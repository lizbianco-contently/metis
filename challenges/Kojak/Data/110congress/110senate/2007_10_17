Mr. President, as the House prepares to take up the \nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Act, I wish to remind our colleagues \nwhat we decided about this program a little over 2 months ago.\n  In August, a bipartisan Senate majority voted to embrace the two \nprinciples behind the original FISA law in 1978: that foreign \nterrorists overseas are a legitimate target--a legitimate target--for \nwarrantless surveillance, and that Americans at home are not.\n  We did this because we had been informed by the Director of National \nIntelligence that advances in technology and an outdated provision in \nlaw had made it impossible for the intelligence community to act on the \nfirst of these principles, causing us to miss significant actionable \nintelligence.\n  The Senate responded to this information accordingly. We addressed \nthe\n\n[[Page S12948]]\n\nchange in technology and updated the law, restoring to the intelligence \ncommunity a tool it had effectively used even before the 9/11 attacks \nto track terrorist activity abroad.\n  Congress made sure in 1978 that the intelligence community was free \nto collect intelligence on foreign targets overseas and act on it \nquickly. In a post-9/11 world, we were insisting they continue to have \nthis vital capability. Now we will have the chance to insist on it \nagain, by voting against the bill that is being considered in the House \nor by approving an alternative that corrects its flaws.\n  The bill that is being taken up in the House has two major \nweaknesses. First, it requires intelligence officials to obtain a \nwarrant before listening in on foreign terrorist suspects abroad. In \nother words, if we want to listen in on a terrorist in Tehran who may \nbe talking about blowing up Los Angeles, we would have to stop and get \na court approval first. I guarantee you, there is not a single person \nin this country outside this building who thinks that makes a bit of \nsense.\n  It is common sense that our ability to act quickly on the \nintelligence we get is a crucial part of our ability to prevent terror \nattacks here at home. This dangerous provision would create a new \nhurdle for intelligence officials to jump before they can collect and \nact on a live potential threat. Allowing it to stand would have been \nfoolish before 9/11. It would be inexcusable now, which is exactly why \nwe acted to remove it in August and why the President has rightly said \nhe will veto any law that retains it.\n  Now, the second problem: This bill would expose U.S. phone companies \nto giant lawsuits for cooperating with the intelligence community in \npursuit of terrorists, for doing their part--their part--to defend this \ncountry from terrorist groups such as al-Qaida. We need to be making it \neasier for our intelligence officials to detect terrorist plots against \nus, not harder, and we need to be rewarding people for helping us in \nthis fight, not penalizing them or scaring them with the threat of a \nlawsuit if they do.\n\n  So let's make something clear right now: Any bill that leaves this \nChamber must restore to intelligence officials the same tools they have \nhad in fighting terrorism for decades. And it should reassure U.S. \nbusinesses that they have no reason to regret cooperating with \nintelligence officials in the past and that they should not be the \nleast bit afraid to do so in the future.\n  The Bill of Rights does not extend to terrorists overseas who want to \nhurt us here at home. Our laws have always reflected that. In a post-9/\n11 world we are being asked to affirm it. We did not hesitate in \nAugust. We should not hesitate now.\n  The House bill that is being considered needs some major work. In \naddition to the two points I have raised, House Democrats have also \nstruck a provision that allows the United States to conduct warrantless \nsurveillance on foreign suspects who have information relating to the \nconduct of foreign affairs. In a time of heightened threats, we cannot \nthrow away the tools we have always used to keep this country safe. I \nwould urge my colleagues to give intelligence officials the tools they \nneed to protect us, to give them a bill that the President will sign \ninto law.\n  We cannot let our enemies exploit a weakness that we--and now they--\ncan clearly see. We know the threat is real. The bill we pass should \nreflect that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/17/senate-section/article/S12948-1", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12948]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  NOMINATION OF JUDGE MICHAEL MUKASEY\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I am pleased the Judiciary Committee \nwill begin hearings this morning on the nomination of Judge Michael \nMukasey to be the Nation's 81st Attorney General.\n  Judge Mukasey has outstanding qualifications and a sterling \nreputation. Throughout four decades, he selflessly devoted his life to \npublic service, culminating in his selection as Chief Judge of the \nUnited States District Court for the Southern District of New York.\n  As a jurist, Judge Mukasey handled complex legal problems \njudiciously, thoughtfully, and fairly. The complex problems that face \nthe Justice Department merit similar serious treatment, and I am \nconfident that were he to be confirmed, Judge Mukasey will bring his \ntrademark qualities to bear in analyzing them.\n  Analyzing these problems requires a careful and deliberative process. \nIt is a process that starts today, and it will continue after the \nJudiciary Committee's hearings are over. It is a process that does not \nlend itself to snap judgments or snap answers.\n  Judge Mukasey will not abandon his trademark qualities of \njudiciousness and thoughtfulness today, nor should we want him to.\n  It would be injudicious and unthoughtful for Judge Mukasey to make \nsnap judgments about particular outcomes on highly complex and highly \nsensitive policies in the war on terror before he even gets into \noffice. Judge Mukasey is not read into some of these programs, and is \nnot, at the present time, fully familiar with others. Even if he were \nfully familiar with them, it would be imprudent for him to discuss \ntheir classified features in open sessions while our enemies are \nwatching.\n  The Senate Judiciary Committee should be mindful of the complex \nproblems that Judge Mukasey is being called on to solve, as well as the \nconstraints under which he is operating. And it should treat him \nfairly. If he is treated fairly, I am confident the committee will \nreport him to the floor for a prompt up-or-down vote.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, if I could briefly say, while the \ndistinguished Republican leader is on the floor, I had a meeting late \nyesterday afternoon with the chairman of the Intelligence Committee, \nSenator Rockefeller. He indicated to me that he and Senator Bond, the \nvice chair of that Intelligence Committee, are moving forward this week \nto have a markup on the Intelligence bill. It will be bipartisan. \nSenator Leahy has announced he would move very quickly with the \nJudiciary Committee, which has joint jurisdiction of that.\n  Hopefully, we can have that bill to us within the next couple of \nweeks. We should get that done so it is not a last-minute deal like it \nwas right before we broke for one of our breaks. I think it was before \nthe August recess when we were pushed so hard on that matter. So I \nthink things are moving along well. The Intelligence Committee is \nworking extremely well. I am very satisfied with the work they have \naccomplished.\n  I see one of the members of the Intelligence Committee on the floor \ntoday, Senator Nelson, who has been such a great addition to the \nIntelligence Committee. He and other members of that Intelligence \nCommittee devote hours of their time away from the TV cameras, away \nfrom reporters, trying to work out ways we can move forward against the \nevil that is focused on our Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/17/senate-section/article/S12948-3", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12948]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, today, I ask the Senate to salute the men \nand women of the 3rd Battalion, 297th Infantry Regiment of the Alaska \nArmy National Guard.\n  This unit just returned from the Middle East for demobilization. \nWithin days, the Alaska Army Guard members will start their return \njourney back to Alaska.\n  Today, they will be honored at a ``welcome home'' ceremony at Camp \nShelby in Mississippi. I had hoped to be with them today, but due to \nthe votes in the Senate and the committee assignments, I have remained \nhere in Washington, DC.\n\n[[Page S12949]]\n\n  The 3rd Battalion served with distinction in both Kuwait and Iraq \nover the past year. When this unit was mobilized in 2006, it \nrepresented the largest mobilization of the Alaska National Guard since \nWorld War II. These Guard members represent 81 communities in our \nState, including many Alaska Native villages.\n  Before their deployment last October, Senator Murkowski and I met \nwith this battalion in Camp Shelby. It was an exciting day as members \nof the units successfully completed their predeployment training. I was \nimpressed with their high morale and dedication to our country.\n  Most of the members of the Alaskan Guard left behind families and \njobs in Alaska to be part of this mission. Their departure caused \nhardship for their families and communities, especially in their small \nvillages. But they were steadfast in their commitment to the mission \nand to our country.\n  The dedication of the 3rd Battalion reminds us that in our Nation's \ndarkest moments--when freedom has been on the line--our citizen \nsoldiers have answered the call to serve. Their duties and traditions \nare deeply rooted in our country's history. During the Civil War and \nWorld War II, it was our citizen soldier who tipped the balance and \nensured our victory.\n  Members of the 3rd Battalion have carried forward this proud \ntradition. Their dedication to serve reflects the bravery and courage \nof those who came before them. Many of them are descendants of those \nwho served with COL Muktuk Marston and other Eskimo Scouts in the \nTundra Army during World War II. During that war in which I served, \ntheir predecessors defended our freedom in Alaska and around the world. \nI remember well the heroism of the National Guardsmen I served with in \nWorld War II. They, too, and these people now, have earned also the \nhonor of being called the ``Greatest Generation.''\n  There are few of us left who lived through the dark history of World \nWar II, but as I reflect on their service, I appreciate their bravery, \ncommitment, and dedication. The men and women in uniform today are \ntruly our newest ``Greatest Generation.'' We are comrades in the \ndeepest sense of the word, and we should salute their service.\n  As citizen soldiers, they are a force not only on the battlefield but \nalso a force in their communities. They are the link between the \nstanding military units they serve and the people they protect. They \nalso answer the call in national disasters.\n  In recent months, their mission was critical to the overall success \nof our operations in the Middle East and Iraq, and all Alaskans, \nespecially those in their communities, are proud of their service.\n  On a day when we honor the 3rd Battalion, I believe we should also \ntake a moment to reflect on those we have lost. Tragically, two Alaska \nArmy Guard soldiers were killed and two were gravely injured in a \ntraining accident near Camp Shelby last year. We still mourn their \ndeaths and send our deepest condolences to their families and friends.\n  We should ask God to bless them and God to bless the brave men and \nwomen, such as the Army National Guard, who volunteer to defend our \ngreat country. The thoughts and prayers of Alaskans, and I think of a \ngrateful Nation, are with all of them.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/17/senate-section/article/S12949-1", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12949]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, following the majority leader's \ncomments and admonitions about the coming telecommunications \nsurveillance intercept bill, otherwise known as the FISA bill, I think \nwhat the majority leader said was absolutely essential, that the work \nproduct that comes out of the Intelligence Committee and then the \nJudiciary Committee be bipartisan in nature. We do not want to repeat \nwhat happened in the first week of August, in which there was so much \nmisinformation and mistrust on both sides of the aisle. It was very \ndifficult to cobble together a bill, which the intelligence community \ntold us was essential because of the increased traffic, which is \notherwise defined as increased communications of some indication that \nthere might be the planning stages of an additional attack upon the \nUnited States. In that atmosphere of warnings, we were told we had to \npass a bill.\n  It was in that crisis atmosphere that a piece of legislation was \ncobbled together in the midst of mistrust and misinformation on this \nfloor. But the safeguard was put on it that what was passed and \nultimately signed into law by the President was only good for 6 months. \nIn other words, it sunsetted or ceased to exit at the end of 6 months. \nTherefore, in now constructing the permanent law, we need to come \ntogether.\n  Now, this Senator, a member of the Intelligence Committee, has been \nquite firm in my insistence to both of the leaders of our committee--\nSenator Rockefeller, the chairman, and Senator Bond, the vice \nchairman--that they come out with an agreed-upon, bipartisan piece of \nlegislation to protect the rights of American citizens, their civil \nliberties, their privacy and, at the same time, to be able to utilize \ninstruments of the Government of the United States to be able to go \nafter the people who want to do us harm. I believe that the agreement \nhas pretty well been reached between Senator Rockefeller and Senator \nBond. What is potentially going to hold up an agreement is the question \nof what kind of immunity should be given to the telecommunications \ncompanies who had, at the request of the U.S. Government, after \nSeptember 11, 2001, allowed their databases to be used for the purposes \nof trying to determine who the bad guys were.\n  Everything I am saying has all been out in the press. It is well \nestablished. The House has taken a position of not wanting to have any \nimmunity for the telephone companies on a retroactive basis. They \nalready have immunity on a going-forward basis as a result of what we \npassed in August, and that is now law. It is my hope that the two \nleaders of the Intelligence Committee will be able to get agreement on \nwhat that immunity should be, and that will be a large part of the \ndiscussion that is supposed to take place in the markup in the \nIntelligence Committee tomorrow.\n  As the majority leader, Senator Reid, said, it is very important we \nget this right and that we get this done soon in order that it can then \ngo from the Intelligence Committee to the Judiciary Committee and that \nit can come out of the Judiciary Committee, come to the full Senate and \nthen a conference committee can iron out the differences between the \nHouse and the Senate versions and then get a final product to the \nPresident for him to sign into law.

Mr. Presdient, I actually came here to talk \nabout a different subject, and that is the fracas that is now engulfing \nthe National Democratic Party with regard to the selection of its \nPresidential nominees. Florida is right in the middle of this because \nan order was set up under the rules of the Democratic National \nCommittee that allowed four States to go before any other State, and \nthose four States, they set out an order and said it would be first a \ncaucus in Iowa, then a caucus in Nevada, then an election, a primary \nelection in New Hampshire, and then a primary\n\n[[Page S12950]]\n\nelection in South Carolina. Those were going to be representative of \nthe country and all of those four had to occur before any other State \ncould start its primary or caucus in the selection of the Presidential \nnominees and that the date they could start was February 5 of next \nyear.\n  Over the objection of Democratic State legislators in the Florida \nlegislature--indeed, with the Democratic leader of the Florida Senate \noffering an amendment to keep Florida's election from violating the \nDemocratic National Committee rules and, therefore, to be on February \n5, over his and others' objections--the Florida legislature changed the \ndate of the Florida Presidential primary from March to January 29. The \nFlorida legislature is basically two-thirds Republican, one-third \nDemocrat, in both Houses of the legislature. Governor Crist, a \nRepublican, signed the legislation, setting the Florida primary date as \nJanuary 29, and signed it into law.\n  The Democratic National Committee took great umbrage at this and \nunder its rules said it was going to strip Florida of half its \ndelegates. That is what the Democratic National Committee rules \nprovide. In the Democratic National Committee Rules Committee's \ndeliberations, they went further. Unlike the Republican National \nCommittee, which said they would take away half of Florida's delegates \nfor the Presidential nominee, the DNC said: We are going to punish \nFlorida completely by taking away all their delegates to the \nconvention. What is more, we are going to enforce a part of the DNC \nrules that say, unless Florida backs up and ignores that election, \nmakes it a ``beauty contest'' that has no meaning and selects their \ndelegates sometime from February 5 or later, Florida was going to \nreceive additional punishment, which was that no Presidential candidate \ncould go and campaign in Florida, and campaigning was defined as \nspeaking in Florida, interacting with voters in Florida, hiring \ncampaign staff in Florida, opening an office in Florida, having a press \nconference in Florida, except--oh, by the way, you can go into Florida \nto raise money.\n  This is as violative of the constitutional right of freedom of speech \nas anything I have ever heard. It conjures up that you can't come to \nFlorida so Florida Democratic voters can interact with Presidential \ncandidates unless you pay a fee at the door in order to gain entrance \nbecause it is a fundraiser. Doesn't that remind you of something that \nwas held unconstitutional called a poll tax?\n  It was because of this kind of punishment that was inflicted on the \n4.25 million registered Florida Democrats that this Senator, with a \nheavy heart, joined with his colleague, Congressman Alcee Hastings, \nalso with a heavy heart, and filed suit in Federal District Court in \nTallahassee, the seat of government of our State, against Howard Dean, \nthe chairman of the DNC, and the Democratic National Committee.\n  A defendant was also named, Kurt Browning, the secretary of state of \nFlorida, purely for functionary purposes since he is the one authorized \nunder Florida law to conduct the election. As a result, that suit had \nbeen filed 2 weeks ago alleging the violations of the Constitution in \nthe 1st, 5th, and 14th amendments, as well as violations of the Voting \nRights Act of 1965.\n  A Federal court will ultimately determine that issue of whether the \nparty has the right to prohibit people, in a duly called, State-run, \nState-sanctioned by State law election, whether that national party can \ntake away those constitutional rights of people to see and hear and \ninteract with the Presidential candidates, as well as taking away all \nof their ability to be heard at the national convention by stripping \naway all of the elements. That is the issue in front of the court.\n  It should not have come to this. For the last 6 months, I and others, \nlike Congressman Hastings, have offered compromises on three different \noccasions, three different compromises on how we could get out of this \nbox. It would be a win-win situation, but the DNC and its rules \ncommittee said ``nyet,'' they are going to sanction Florida.\n  Why am I making this speech this day, Mr. President, when the suit \nwas filed 2 weeks ago? Because there is a news article in this \nmorning's papers saying that the Iowa Republican Party has announced \nthat it is bumping up its caucus, not where it was previously \nprescribed--somewhere in the middle of January of next year--but \ninstead moving it up to January 3. And South Carolina Republicans, some \ntime ago, had a joint press conference with the secretary of state of \nNew Hampshire, who under New Hampshire law is the sole authority to \ndetermine what date New Hampshire's primary, both Democratic and \nRepublican, will be held, and the South Carolina Republicans announced \nthat they were moving their primary up some 10 days earlier--it might \nhave been 8 or 9 days, but it was earlier than the prescribed time of \nJanuary 29--to which the New Hampshire secretary of state said he would \nmove New Hampshire's primary up early.\n  So the question that is begged today, Wednesday, the middle of \nOctober, is, if all of these parties are jumping early and the order \nthat the Democratic National Committee wanted to preserve is being \nthwarted, does the DNC intend only to punish Florida Democrats or will, \nin fact, they punish the Democratic parties in New Hampshire and Iowa \nif they, in fact, jump forward from what the DNC rules had prescribed?\n  So I bring to the floor of the Senate something that involves only a \nfew States. Yet it has enormous implications for the entire country \nbecause this is the process by which we select the Presidential \ncandidates of the two major parties, one of which is likely to be the \nnext President of the United States.\n  Because of all this fracas and I think just the news of today that \nindicates the Iowa parties are jumping much earlier, we will probably \nnow see all of the others start to jump, and as a result there will be \nincreased turmoil. It is certainly my hope that reason will prevail and \nthe Democratic National Committee, which has taken out its frustration \non Florida, will suddenly realize there is no reason to continue that \nfrustration on Florida because, at the end of the day, if everybody \nelse is doing it, why just try to punish Florida? And because of this \nfracas, this turmoil, will reason prevail that there is a better way to \ndo this? It is regional primaries spaced out in a logical order over \none in March, two in April, two in May, and one in June, that would \ngive the candidates plenty of time to get around to these regional \nprimaries, which order could be determined by lot, and in that primary \none State from each region in the country could have an election, so no \nparticular part of the country is favored. In the favored first status, \nall of this fracas should point to that goal.\n  Let's bring order out of this chaos in the way we select the next \nPresident of the United States in both of these great political parties \nthat participate in American politics.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Mississippi is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, it is none of my business, but I say to the \nSenator from Florida that I tend to agree with him. Maybe it is a \nregional thing. I wish him good luck in his effort to have Florida \nassume its rightful place.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/17/senate-section/article/S12950-1", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12950-S12952]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, a lot of discussion has been going on today, \nthis week, and over the last few weeks about a very important program; \nwe call it SCHIP. That is Washingtonspeak for health care for children, \nwhich has a very important role for the States to administer this \nprogram. This week, the House will be voting on the President's veto of \nthis issue. That is the way things work in Washington. It is not very \npretty. I am not proud of the whole process we have gone through on \nthis issue.\n  First of all, I have a message for everybody involved. Let's put low-\nincome, poor kids first. Let's figure out how we deal with their needs. \nThat is what caused this program to begin with.\n  I had the pleasure of being the majority leader in the Senate in the \n1990s when this program was created. I remember the debate. It was \npretty hot. Phil Gramm of Texas was saying: Wait a minute, we need to \nput protections in\n\n[[Page S12951]]\n\nhere, and Senator Kennedy and Senator Hatch were very much involved. \nBut then a bipartisan agreement broke out, the way we used to have \nhappen around here occasionally. We created a program, well-\nintentioned, that was targeted for low-income children, to make sure \nthey had insurance coverage. It was not a massive number; I guess we \nwere thinking in terms of 6 million, with the idea that might go up as \ntime went by and more people or parents were made aware of the program \nand information was gotten to them and they could come onto the \nprogram. I think it has worked well. It has been successful. It covered \na lot of low-income children who would not have been covered otherwise.\n  Now, of course, we come to a period where we have to extend the \nprogram, and it has been very difficult. I acknowledge right up front \nthat Senator Grassley tried to find a way to work through this issue \nand get a proper result. He and Senator Baucus, the chairman of the \nFinance Committee, wound up coming together and getting an agreement. I \nalso acknowledge that a lot of the problems have been exacerbated by \nthe previous administration and this one because they kept granting \nwaivers to States to go above the 200 percent of poverty, up to as high \nas 350 percent of poverty, making not just low-income, poor children \neligible but children of families making up to--I don't know the exact \nnumber--$62,000 or $63,000, and some States were applying to go to 400 \npercent of poverty, which would go as high as an $80,000 income for \nfamilies. That was not our intent. Plus, adults have been added. Only \nin Washington can you get confused about a program that is for kids and \nthen start putting adults on it. But States started doing that and \nwaivers were requested, and the administration, unfortunately, for a \nwhile granted those waivers. I think we should put limits on those \nwaivers. Thank goodness, finally the administration turned down the \nmost recent application for going up to 400 percent of poverty.\n  So here we are. Some of us on the Finance Committee said: Look, we \nwant this program extended. The President recommended that it be \nincreased by $5 billion, which is about $1 billion a year. Some of us \non the Finance Committee realized that probably was not enough to cover \nthe children now on the program plus to get more low-income children \nwho should be eligible and should be covered, covered. So we were \nlooking at going above the $5 billion increase the President originally \nsuggested. How much? That is what the legislative process is about. Is \nit perhaps $9 billion instead of $5 billion or maybe $12 billion? I \nwasn't wedded to a number; I was wedded to a concept and a program to \nmake sure we cover those now on the program. Some should not now be on \nthe program. But we wanted to make sure low-income children are covered \nfirst.\n  The administration, to its credit, did put in place a provision that \nwould say you cannot start insuring middle-income children until you \nhave insured 95 percent of low-income children. This bill which has \nbeen vetoed by the President would knock that out. What? If our goal is \nto insure low-income children, why would we not require that? But the \ncompromise that was worked out went to $35 billion. It would allow for \nkids who are not in the low-income category to be covered.\n  The President vetoed it. I think he should. Now the House is going to \nsustain that veto. My question is, Now what? We have made our positions \nclear. We have had a grand old time playing politics with kids. Let's \nget over it. We need to get a result. That is the way it works. \nSomebody was saying in that very chair last night that the Congress has \na role to play. Yes, and so does the President. Some people say: Look, \nthere was a bipartisan compromise worked out. Yes, but some of us who \nwould like to have been involved, who were there when the program was \ncreated, didn't get involved. We just thought we would do what we want \nand shove it over to the President and say: Take this. But he doesn't \ntake it. So now we sit down and work it out.\n  What is the plan of the Democrats? To let the program just collapse? \nThat is unacceptable. Nobody is going to stand for that. Then I hear: \nWell, the plan is to keep extending it in increments--maybe 30 days, \nmaybe 90 days. We want to keep it alive until next fall. Look, we can \nplay politics and partisan politics, but do we have to use kids in the \nprocess? I don't think we should do that. We need to make sure we have \na program that works.\n  One of my big problems about the plan we have is that it would put 2 \nmillion kids who now have private insurance on the Government rolls. \nThat is part of the plan. The plan is to get them off of the private \nplan, which the families can afford; they could not get on Medicaid, so \nwe will get them on the SCHIP program. I think that is a mistake. Of \ncourse, I think there is phony budgeting in the bill the President \nvetoed. I think the funding is not reliable.\n  Now, at least the Senate came up with something that was a little \nmore defensible than what the House was working on. They said: We want \nto take money from Medicare Advantage, elderly people in rural areas, \nand use that savings to pay for the children's health program. That was \na total nonstarter with the Senate, thank goodness.\n\n  What did we come up with? Cigarette taxes. Who wants to stand up here \nand defend tobacco? I will. I smoke a pipe. I don't do it in public. My \nmother wouldn't approve of me doing that. By George, I make that \nchoice. I don't apologize for it. But, oh, it is a part of the \npolitically correct position now: Let's make everybody quit smoking \ncigarettes. There are no good tobacco products.\n  This is still America. We do still have choices. And by the way, \nlet's assume it works. If we jack the price of a package of cigarettes \na buck a package, which is what this would do, it is going to \neventually, I guess, discourage people and low-income, poor working \nfamilies: Gosh, we can't afford cigarettes; maybe we will quit. Good, \nthat is great. I don't deny it is not good for your health. Maybe they \nwill quit.\n  This is the problem: If they do quit, we would not get the money to \npay for the SCHIP program. Think about that. We are do-gooders here, we \nare going to raise taxes on tobacco products to pay for the Children's \nHealth Insurance Program. That way we will make them quit smoking. And, \noh, you mean then we would not have the money? Yes. You can't have it \nboth ways. It is the kind of stuff we do around here. It is ridiculous.\n  So the money would not be there. The program is not going to be \nfunded. We all know better than that; it is going to be funded. At some \npoint, if the tobacco money doesn't come in, which I assume it would \nnot because we have gone crazy trying to tax it out of existence--by \nthe way, this is an area States usually handle. But, no, we are going \nto put a 61-cent Federal tax on cigarettes and that will further block \nwhat the States might do to raise revenue for their programs. By the \nway, they do a better job of running the health programs than we do \nanyway. It is part of the inconsistency here.\n  There are many problems with this bill. I have always said, OK, let's \nhave our political debates. Let's stake out our partisan positions and \nthen let's sit down and work something out. Is that what the people \nexpect us to do? That is what the legislative process is all about.\n  I don't have the Holy Grail in this area. I realize it would be a \ngive and take. I believe Senator Grassley and I and representatives \nfrom the administration and Democrats can work out this legislation. \nThe President said: Let's negotiate. Yes, I think he ought to send his \ntop people down here and humbly say to the leaders in the Congress, \nRepublicans and Democrats in the House and Senate: What can we do to \nwork through this bill now and get this program extended to where it \ncovers genuinely poor kids and get it beyond the next election? I urge \nwe do that.\n  I don't presume to try to say who would be in the room. Pick anybody. \nBut I say this: That is what needs to be done. Let's go ahead and rack \nup the political points and politically let's say this one goes to the \nDemocrats. Policywise, I have no qualms about the position I have \ntaken. I am perfectly comfortable with it. But also I am prepared to \nsay enough is enough, let's move on, let's get a compromise worked out, \nand let's protect this program which is well intentioned but which, for \ngood reasons, we have gotten carried away.\n\n[[Page S12952]]\n\n  There are some people who might say: Let's cover all children with a \nfederally funded health insurance program. Maybe we can raise taxes to \n$5 a package, 10 bucks a cigar. It is ridiculous. There are other ways \nwe can get revenue. I hope we will get started on that as soon as the \nHouse votes. They will sustain the veto, and then we can sit down and \nwork this out.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Salazar). The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I came to the Chamber to speak on an \noversight issue on which I have been working for well over a year. But \nbefore I speak on that subject, I wish to take advantage of the \nopportunity to respond to incorrect impressions about the compromise \nState Children's Health Insurance Program bill on which the House is \ngoing to be voting tomorrow. I am speaking as much to Republicans in \nthe House of Representatives as I am responding to some of the points \nSenator Lott has made. These reminded me that regardless of how many \nspeeches one gives around here, regardless of how many explanations one \ngives of what our bill does and does not do, nobody listens. We get the \nsame wrong statements being made time after time. I wonder, does \nanybody ever listen? Maybe they don't like to have Chuck Grassley say \nit.\n  I was a negotiator for the Republicans. I never had a single \nRepublican tell me since January that they didn't want the SCHIP \nprogram reauthorized after a 10-year sunset. I never had one of them \nsay it wasn't a program that was serving a good purpose. I had a lot of \npeople express faults about what is wrong with the present program. \nMost of those issues have been corrected in the legislation the \nPresident vetoed.\n  I finally got people to realize the $5 billion the President put in \nhis budget on top of baseline is not enough to do what we are already \ndoing. Even the Republicans on this side offered $14.5 billion over \nbaseline, which still is not enough to do what needs to be done to take \ncare of the kids we are taking care of now and extend coverage to other \neligible but uninsured low income children.\n  Some people are saying this bill should have been vetoed because \nthere are adults in the program. But it was this Administration that \napproved the waivers to cover adults. The bill that the President \nvetoed did away with waivers. What has been in the program for 10 years \nthis bill does away with. Childless adults are not going to be on the \nprogram. New waivers for parents under SCHIP is prohibited. For states \nthat currently cover parents, the federal match is reduced. But yet \npeople are still saying to me, from the other body, as I talk with \nRepublicans over there to vote to override the President's veto: Why \nare we letting all these adults on? The waivers did that, and we do \naway with the waivers.\n\n  Also, in my conversations with people in the other body, as I try to \nconvince them they ought to vote to override the veto, this $83,000 \nnumber keeps coming up. There was an inference made to it in the \nprevious speech. That is not in our bill, and yet the President in his \nveto message referred to our bill allowing people up to $83,000 to get \non SCHIP. That is in the law. It has been in the law for 10 years, and \nthat can only happen if the President of the United States says a State \ncan do that upon that State's request. Only the President can allow \nthat to happen. That has been that way for 10 years. So don't tell me \nour bill allows States to go up to $83,000. That has been the law.\n  What about the statement of having genuine poor children on this \nprogram? I agree. Do you know that 92 percent of the kids on the \nprogram are in families under 200 percent of poverty? Somebody can say: \nWhat about the other 8 percent? OK, so what do we do about that? \nBecause there has been an inference to a State Health Official letter \nto states released on August 17, 2007 that we did away with what would \nhave prevented that. But the policies in that letter were flawed and \nunworkable. What we did is we made those policies workable in our \nlegislation. So the emphasis on kids under 200 percent of poverty works \nout this way: First, we reduce the Federal match to the Medicaid match \nfor any state that wants to go over 300 percent of poverty, beginning \nupon enactment of the bill. Then, by 2010, any State that wants to go \nor to continue to go above 300 percent of poverty for children has to \ndemonstrate that they have reached the targets determined by the 10 \nbest States covering kids under 200 percent of poverty. If they do not \nmeet the target, they get no Federal match for kids over 300 percent.\n  So don't tell me the bill before us does not have emphasis on low-\nincome kids. It has emphasis on low-income kids.\n  It was not brought up in the previous speech, but in my conversations \nwith the House of Representatives, I have had this other smokescreen \nthrown at me: Our bill allows illegal immigrants to get on the program. \nFor the first time, we are doing in SCHIP what has never been done \nbefore, what we have done for Medicaid in the Deficit Reduction Act. We \nare making it so that illegal immigrants cannot get on the SCHIP \nprogram.\n  People are paid to read legislation, and I don't know how the \nPresident of the United States, who gets paid a heck of a lot more than \nI do and has a lot of advisers who get paid a heck of a lot more than I \ndo--I don't know how they can have him put in a speech that this bill \nallows people over $83,000 to get into the program, or there can be \nspeeches in the Chamber of the other body saying we are opening the \ndoor for illegal immigrants to be covered by this program when we are \ndoing more than existing law does in that area and where existing law \nalready allows, if the President approves it.\n  And then this business of adults being in the program--absolutely \nright, three States have more adults on the program than other States. \nHow did that happen? This administration gave waivers for that to \nhappen. We do away with those waivers. I have heard all the complaints \nfrom this side of the Senate, the Republican side of the Senate, that \nthere is no ``A'' in SCHIP--and I agree, it shouldn't be for adults--\nand I even heard Democrats strongly speak to this point. This program \nshould never have gone in that direction. We do away with waivers.\n  I ask everybody to read the legislation, and particularly Republicans \nin the other body, before they vote tomorrow to override or not \noverride because all these inaccurate representations of the compromise \nbill are creating a very bad mistake. It's so bad politically that the \nWhite House is looking for some way to get out of this situation. \nProbably that some way to get out of it is negotiating another bill \nwith us. But it would be smart if the White House would send a signal \nto the House of Representatives: Override our veto; we made a mistake.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/17/senate-section/article/S12952-1", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12952-S12955]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             GENERAL SERVICES ADMINISTRATION INVESTIGATIONS\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I now wish to address this body about \nsome investigations I have been doing over a long period of time.\n  This is a report to my colleagues that senior executives at the \nGeneral Services Administration may have failed to meet their \nresponsibilities to the American taxpayers. These issues were carefully \nexamined in two oversight investigations conducted by my staff. These \ninvestigations have uncovered a disturbing change of circumstances at \nthe General Services Administration.\n  In a nutshell, it is this way: These studies indicate that top-level \nGeneral Services Administration management interfered in contract \nnegotiations with Sun Microsystems. They put pressure on contract \nofficers to sign a potentially bad contract. When that person refused, \nthey had that contract officer removed under duress.\n  All the evidence from this investigation suggests that this \nparticular contractor had been overcharging the Federal Government for \nyears. The contract officer believed the proposed terms were still not \nfair to the Government. Even worse, these reports also indicate that \nallegations of intimidation against the General Services Administration \nOffice of Inspector General and its auditors may have been fabricated. \nThis may have been done to cover high-level pressure on contract \nofficers or maybe because the new contract was signed on terms dictated \nby the contractor. When I asked for audits of the new contract, this \ncontractor resisted tooth and nail, and in the end they canceled the \ncontract before audits could be completed. I want to repeat that, \nbecause this is the bottom\n\n[[Page S12953]]\n\nline. When I asked for audits of this new contract, this contractor \nresisted tooth and nail, and in the end they canceled the contract \nbefore the audit could be completed. That ought to tell you something \nabout that contract.\n\n  I think it is important my colleagues know what my staff uncovered at \nthe GSA, not merely for the purpose of pointing out mistakes but for \nthe purpose of seeking solutions, because these investigations are \nabout fixing a problem.\n  Let me set the record straight. This is not some sort of witch hunt \nfor the Administrator of GSA or anything else. Quite simply, this is \noversight and investigation, or O, as we call it around here on the \nHill.\n  In doing this oversight and investigation work, I am fulfilling one \nof the most sacred responsibilities of a Member of Congress. As with \nall my investigations, I want to be certain every tax dollar is spent \nwisely and according to law--nothing more, nothing less. With that in \nmind, I want to address the findings of these investigations that are \ndocumented in separate staff reports.\n  The oversight work began last September when I was informed \nAdministrator Lurita Doan of the GSA was attempting to cut the \ninspector general's budget for audits. These are the policemen to see \nthat the money we appropriate is spent wisely. It appeared that this \nadministrator was attempting to neutralize the inspector general, \nespecially in the area of oversight of Government contracts. This was a \nred warning flag, so I decided to dig deeper.\n  The Administrator was alleging that the Office of Inspector General--\nor I might refer to that as the OIG--was abusing its power by \nthreatening and intimidating Government contracting officers and \nvendors. These allegations were raised by the Administrator in numerous \nstatements, publicly and internally, and in letters to me. According to \nthree separate witnesses, Administrator Doan even compared the \ninspector general officials to terrorists.\n  These allegations concerned me for two reasons: First, I was \nextremely concerned that sworn Federal law enforcement agencies and \nagents, and accredited auditors, might be abusing their power. Second, \nif there was no factual foundation for these allegations, if they were \nfabricated, where did they come from and why did they come?\n  I asked Administrator Doan to provide me with specific examples of \nthe alleged intimidation. Since she had aired these allegations in \npublic, I thought she would provide me with specific details to support \nthe charges. The fact is, she could not. In reality, only one specific \ninstance was brought to my attention. In the end, my staff could find \nno evidence whatsoever to support those allegations. Sadly, it appears \nas if that one specific allegation was fabricated to cover up intense \ntop-down pressure on contract auditors to award a contract that was \ndetrimental to the taxpayers.\n  It was a bureaucratic smokescreen that opened a much larger can of \nworms. That can of worms was a contract awarded to Sun Microsystems, \nInc. in 1999 for computer products and services. The inspector general \nhad this particular contract under a microscope for several years. The \nIG audits indicated that Sun had failed to report significant discounts \ngiven to commercial contractors, as mandated by the contract; in other \nwords, transparency when you are doing business with the Federal \nGovernment. Because this information was withheld--in other words, \ntheir commercial contract arrangements--Government customers paid much \nhigher prices than Sun's commercial customers. The Government was \nlosing money because of these unfair pricing policies, losses \npotentially in the tens of millions of dollars. These and other alleged \ncontract violations, including potential fraud, were referred to the \nDepartment of Justice and now are in the Federal courts.\n  The alleged fraud was first reported to General Services \nAdministration management in February of 2005. GSA management had \nseveral options, including seeking a better contract, canceling that \ncontract, or suspension. In fact, three GSA contracting officers who \nhandled the Sun contract attempted all three remedies. In each case, \nintervention from upper management at GSA blocked those moves. Upper \nmanagement turned a blind eye to the alleged fraud, preferring instead \nto do business as usual. Then they began applying serious pressure on \nthe contracting officer to extend the contract with Sun for another 5 \nyears.\n  In August of last year, the GSA contracting officer assigned to the \nSun contract dug in his heels, holding out for a better deal, \nprotecting the taxpayers of the United States. He believed the terms \noffered by Sun in negotiations were not fair to the Government.\n  Now, if you ask senior GSA management, you get a very different \nstory. Those individuals, including Ms. Doan and FAS Commissioner \nWilliams, claimed this contracting officer was so intimidated, \nbrowbeaten, even, by OIG auditors, that he had to be replaced. The \nfacts, however, do not support that allegation or explanation.\n  The contracting officer and his immediate supervisor both deny \nexperiencing any intimidation from the inspector general auditors. They \nsay, in fact, it never even happened. The source of the allegations has \nchanged her story several times. In fact, she continued to support the \ncontracting officer's position in negotiations--a position that was \nfully aligned with the inspector general auditors' position--even after \nclaiming he was being intimidated into that position by the \nsame auditors. If that position was tainted by the inspector general \nauditor intimidation, why would she support it?\n\n  One other fact seems to have escaped the GSA managers making these \nallegations. IG auditors have no direct influence over a contracting \nofficer's career. The only person with that kind of authority is the \ncontracting officer's supervisors, not the inspector general.\n  There is some irony here too. The same GSA managers who accuse the \nOIG auditors of intimidating this contracting officer had themselves \nattempted in vain to intimidate him into awarding the contract.\n  So it seems that GSA management tried to turn the concept of \nintimidation upside down. Now, why would they do that?\n  The evidence suggests these allegations were a smokescreen to hide \nthe actions of the General Services Administration management. They \nused it for cover while ramming through a contract that may be bad for \nthe taxpayers. There should be no greater motivation for those in \nGovernment procurement than protecting the taxpayers' money. \nContracting officers who are warranted by this Government should be \nallowed to fight in negotiations for the best deal for the taxpayers, \nsaving money where they can. Any pressure, any suggestion, any direct \ninvolvement by management to thwart that mission would be out of line. \nWhat Administrator Doan, Commissioner Williams, and others did to short \ncircuit this process, then, is entirely wrong. To turn up the pressure, \nsenior GSA officials, including Administrator Doan, were communicating \ndirectly with Sun Microsystems, Inc. and their lobbyists during \nnegotiations. They made sure that contracting officer knew about that \ncontact they were having. What kind of message does that send to a \ncontracting officer fighting for a good contract to save the taxpayers' \nmoney? What kind of message does that send to the current and potential \nGovernment contractors, wherever they might be?\n  I would say that, at the very least, it tells them that if you don't \nlike the deal offered by the contracting officer, go over his or her \nhead. Go to the very top. Get the problem fixed. Get the price you want \nout of the taxpayers. It also says if the contracting officer is in the \nway, get rid of the contracting officer and get one who will do the \ndirty deed.\n  It would be bad enough were this the end of the story, but it isn't. \nAfter forcing out the contracting officer, GSA management assigned a \nnew officer. It took her 9 days to negotiate a final deal with Sun. But \nwhat did the Government get?\n  In interviews, this new contracting officer claimed that she didn't \nneed to talk to IG auditors who had years of knowledge on the Sun \ncontract. She claimed she could solve any impasse in negotiations by \nlistening to what the\n\n[[Page S12954]]\n\ncontractor had to say. Many of the provisions she adopted were ones \nsteadfastly opposed by the previous contracting officer--the very same \nones that led to the so-called ``impasse'' and the removal of that \ncontracting officer.\n  The new contracting officer even admitted during questioning that she \ndid not fully understand key provisions of the contract. She admitted \nmaking ``big oversights'' in some of the contract terms. I fear the \nGovernment got a contract based on terms that were dictated by the \ncontractor. I ask you: Is this GSA management's idea of how to \nnegotiate?\n  After my staff interviewed the new contracting officer, I realized I \nneeded to know more about the new contract. That is the one signed in \nSeptember 2006. Was the Government continuing to lose money due to the \nunfair pricing and unreported discounts that they had with the \ncommercial sector?\n  As a Member of the Senate who cares deeply about oversight, I would \nhave been remiss in not asking more questions. So on June 5, 2007, I \nasked the GSA inspector general to conduct an audit. I asked the IG to \nlook at the terms of this new contract.\n  Now, if this contract was such a ``good deal for America,'' as has \nbeen suggested by Sun on the one hand and GSA management on the other \nhand, then one would think Sun would rush to cooperate. Wouldn't they? \nWell, they did not. Instead, for 3 months, Sun complained to me, they \nprocrastinated, they withheld information and fought the audit at every \nstep. They also lashed out at the GSA inspector general, claiming \nbias--maybe because the IG had nailed him in the past. To his credit, \nIG Brian Miller held his ground and forged ahead with the audit.\n  This is what happened, and sadly so, because you don't get to the \nbottom of it then. Sun chose to cancel this contract on September 13 of \nthis year, without waiting for the completion of those audits. This \nentire situation is extremely unfortunate, possibly preventable, and \ncertainly baffling. Why would Sun cancel a contract that it had fought \nso hard to get? Did Sun have something to hide?\n  Government contracting, particularly multiple award schedule \ncontracting, appears to be in serious jeopardy. Contracting officers \nare in short supply and are quitting in alarming numbers. They are \noverworked, they are stressed, and some try to juggle 100 or more \ncontracts at any given time. With that kind of workload, assuring \ncontract compliance is out of the question.\n  One of the culprits here may be the industrial funding fee structure \nwe use in Government. This is money that the GSA charges other agencies \nthat tap into governmentwide contracts negotiated by GSA. These fees \nare the lifeblood of the General Services Administration and are \nresponsible for the lion's share of the agency's budget. The incentive \nis to maximize fees and agency profits. This creates what has been \ndescribed as a ``perverse incentive.'' Getting the best deal for the \nGovernment and the taxpayers gets lost in the drive for more contracts \nthat generate more fees to fill that agency's coffers.\n  I feel the Sun contract fiasco may be only the tip of the iceberg. I \nhope it is an exception, but many contracting officials suggested \notherwise.\n  Am I suggesting that Government procurement is broken beyond repair? \nNo. I do think that GSA procurement officials have a lot of work to do \nto make sure these situations are corrected. They certainly need to \nclean up their act, and they will need to make hard choices to fix \nthese problems.\n  GSA has a professional force of contracting officers. GSA management \nneeds to let them negotiate the best deal possible without interference \nfrom the top. Interference in that process as evidenced by the Sun \nnegotiations may not violate the law, but it is not right and it does \nnot protect the taxpayers.\n  Senior GSA management needs to realize that what may be profitable or \nstrategically important for the GSA may not always be in the best \ninterests of the taxpayers. GSA managers also need to recognize the \nneed for oversight and followup on awarded contracts. Contract officers \nneed to be able to fight for the best possible deal for the taxpayers, \neven if it means the loss of a contract that is lucrative to the agency \nfor their operating expenses, or for the vendor. GSA must never forget \nthat the real customer is the American taxpayer.\n  Today, I am forwarding three investigative reports to Administrator \nDoan, to the GSA inspector general, to the House and Senate oversight \ncommittees, and the White House Chief of Staff for review. These \nreports contain proprietary and privacy-protected information and will \nnot be made public by me. The reports provide in great detail the \nresults of these significant investigations into the allegations of \ninspector general auditor intimidation and top-level GSA management \nintervention in the Sun Microsystems contract negotiations.\n  As I said, it is not my intent to point the finger at any one \nindividual or company. My sole purpose is to get to the bottom of what \nmay be a significant problem in Government contracting and, of course, \nget it fixed. I respectfully ask GSA Administrator Doan and the \ninspector general to address the problems identified in these reports \nand to take appropriate action in the future. I hope GSA will do a \nbetter job of protecting the taxpayers' money.\n  I apologize to the chairman and ranking member of the Labor-HHS \nSubcommittee for taking this time, but I believed I needed to respond \nto some of the speeches that were made about the health program before \nI gave my report on my investigation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, before the distinguished ranking member \nleaves the floor, I wish to acknowledge a couple of things--one, my \nappreciation for his hard work on the SCHIP program and my \nunderstanding of his frustration with some of the misunderstandings \nthat have taken place in the debate on all sides. For just a couple of \nminutes of the Senate's time, I wish to discuss how we got where we are \nand how we need to get to where we are going to be. But before he \nleaves, again, I commend the distinguished ranking member on his effort \non behalf of children's health insurance and his effort to clear the \nrecord in hopes that, in the end, it will be a foundation for all of us \nto clear the record of misunderstandings. There is fault enough to go \naround, starting with the administration and then taking both sides of \nthe issue. But I commend the chairman for his hard work.\n  Ten years ago, I chaired the State Board of Education of Georgia when \nthe SCHIP program was first authorized. I took it upon myself, in that \ncapacity--the one that met closest with the children in need in \nGeorgia--to initiate a broad program of registering and getting the \ninformation out so that every poor child in Georgia who was eligible \ncould be covered by SCHIP, which in Georgia is known as PeachCare.\n  On the floor of this Senate earlier this year, I fought, along with \nMembers from 17 other States, to get additional funding necessary on an \ninterim basis because of the shortfalls that took place in the SCHIP \nprogram. I commend this Senate now on working to reauthorize SCHIP.\n  We are in a dilemma. There are differences of opinion on the \neligibility. There are differences of opinion on the amount of money. \nThere are differences of opinion on how it should be raised. There have \nbeen statements that have been made that are correct and statements \nthat have been made that are wrong. But if the House sustains the veto \nof the President, we find ourselves in a position I would like to \naddress for a second, a position where there are enough agreements for \nus to make to come back to the floor and pass a SCHIP bill that can be \nreauthorized and pass this Senate almost without objection.\n  Everybody in the Senate agrees SCHIP should be reauthorized. On the \nvote to extend the current program through November 16, on the \ncontinuing resolution, there was only one dissenting vote, and it was \nnot about SCHIP. The questions are who should be eligible, how far the \nprogram should go, whether it should run in one direction or another, \nand how it should be funded. Just in the remarks made by the \ndistinguished ranking member, as well as previous remarks made by the \nminority whip prior to Senator Grassley's remarks--both sent the signal \nthat there is room in the middle.\n\n[[Page S12955]]\n\n  I hope the administration will understand that a lot of the \nfrustration with the current state of SCHIP has been the waivers--13 of \nthem--that have been granted by this administration to expand SCHIP \nduring the last 10 years, beyond what the Congress and beyond what the \nSenate intended it to be.\n  There is common ground in front of us, and it is the poor children of \nAmerica. There is a good solution in front of us, and that is to see to \nit that SCHIP is what it started out to be. As Senator Grassley has \nsaid, the bill that went to the President and was vetoed did correct \nsome of those waivers. As others have said, there are serious questions \non the financing mechanism. But there is no question that this Senate \nshould be ready and prepared, immediately when the veto is sustained, \nto go forward and find a compromise that works for the poor children of \nAmerica.\n  It is critical to me, as one who started in Georgia 10 years ago to \nregister those eligible children, to see to it that they continue to \nget the promise that was granted by the Congress of the United States. \nIt is equally important to me to see to it that we do not expand that \nprogram beyond what was intended and ultimately end up compromising the \nvery poor children we started out to help.\n  I commend the Senator on his remarks. I urge the administration to \nimmediately aggressively pursue avenues of agreement so we can come \ntogether as a Congress before November 16 and unanimously pass a SCHIP \nbill that works for the poor children of America and is fiscally \naccountable to the taxpayers of the United States of America.\n  Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time, and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/17/senate-section/article/S12955-1", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12955]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to the consideration of H.R. 3043, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 3043) making appropriations for the \n     Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and \n     Education, and related agencies for the fiscal year ending \n     September 30, 2008, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3325\n\n                (Purpose: In the nature of a substitute)\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk, and I ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Harkin], for himself and Mr. \n     Specter, proposes an amendment numbered 3325.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, we are now on the appropriations bill for \nEducation, Labor, Health and Human Services, and related agencies. \nBefore we get into the bill, I want to explain a couple of things. I \nwill be yielding to my partner, Senator Specter, for his opening \nstatement. Then I will follow with mine. It is not the usual order. \nUsually, the chairman goes first. But Senator Specter is very much \ninvolved in Judiciary Committee hearings today, and he has to return to \nthat. I will respect that and yield to him in a moment.\n  I wished to make it clear to our fellow Senators there is a change in \nthe bill they will now notice, the substitute at the desk. The \namendment Senator Specter and I offered basically strikes the language \nin the bill dealing with stem cells. Again, I do this with regret. \nSenator Specter and I have worked together for many years to advance \nthe cause of embryonic stem cell research. In fact, we worked together \non the first bill President Bush vetoed in his first 4 years. That was \nour stem cell bill, the only bill he vetoed in 4 years. We then came \nback with another stem cell bill this year, and he vetoed that also. \nThat veto override has not taken place yet.\n  So together we put some additional language in this bill to further \nthe cause of trying to break through and get embryonic stem cell \nresearch covered. However, we received a statement of administration \npolicy from the administration yesterday saying they opposed our bill \nfor two reasons. It says it includes ``an irresponsible and excessive \nlevel of spending,'' and then it says, ``The administration strongly \nopposes provisions in this bill that overturn the President's policy \nregarding human embryonic stem cell research.''\n  I guess in the spirit of compromise, we wanted to show we are willing \nto compromise. We are willing to try to meet the President halfway. We \nknow the President's strong feelings against this; they are misguided, \nnonetheless. Plus, the fact that, although not yet before the Senate, \nwe will have a veto override vote on a stem cell bill he vetoed earlier \nthis year. I don't know if we will have the votes to override. We may. \nWith that, we thought we will show our good faith in saying to the \nPresident: OK, we are willing to compromise. We will take that language \nout. That is what we have done with the amendment that is at the desk. \nWe have taken that language out of the bill.\n  However, on another aspect in terms of the administration saying it \nis an irresponsible and excessive level of spending, I will say more \nabout that in my opening statement, but the fact is, in the last 5 \nyears, under the leadership of Senator Specter, when I was ranking \nmember, this appropriations bill exceeded the President's budget \nrequest every single year. I thank Senator Specter for that. He \nprovided great leadership. But the President never once threatened to \nveto one of those bills and never did, even though we exceeded his \nbudget. This year, however, the President has said he is going to veto \nit because we exceeded his budget. What is the difference? Because the \nCongress changed hands? I don't think Senator Specter or I give a hoot \nabout that. What we care about is investing in education and health, \njob training, biomedical research, all the other good things this bill \ndoes.\n  I respectfully disagree with the President that it is irresponsible. \nI believe it is responsible. We met our budget allocations. We are \nwithin our pay-go limitations. We do not exceed our budget allocation \nin this bill whatsoever.\n  I wished to make that clear for other Senators. We are on this bill. \nWe have dropped the stem cell language. I did this in consultation with \nSenator Specter as a good faith reaching out to the White House to say: \nWe are willing to compromise. So we will take it out, but we are going \nto stand firm on our funding levels because they are reasonable. They \nare within our budget allocation. They don't bust the budget.\n  I yield the floor to my partner in this for many years, Senator \nSpecter, for his opening statement. I know he has to get back to the \nJudiciary Committee. I will return and make my opening statement at \nthat time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank the Chair and note for the record \nthat the other Senator from Pennsylvania is presiding. I do not use the \nterm ``junior Senator'' because Senator Casey is so distinguished, I \nwouldn't want to have any suggestion of limited status.\n  We are taking up now the appropriations bill which has no rival for \ngreater importance to America. Others may stand alongside it as equals, \nbut when you deal with the Nation's health and education and labor, job \nsafety, job training and medical research, the Centers for Disease \nControl, and Head Start, we deal with the fundamentals of governmental \ninvolvement for the general welfare as recited in the Constitution. \nHealth is our No. 1 capital asset. Without going into any details\n\n[[Page S12956]]\n\non that, I know that in depth from personal experience. Without your \nhealth, you can't do anything. But similarly, or about as important, is \nan education, to be able to do something productive and constructive.\n  We have submitted a bill which we believe fairly addresses the needs \nof the country and is not excessive in its expenditures. Last year's \nbill for this committee was $144.8 billion. The President has come in \nwith a budget request of $141.3 billion. That is $3.5 billion less than \nlast year. If one figures in inflation, we are looking at about a $7.2 \nbillion cut. We simply can't accommodate that and do the Pell grants, \nthe education funding, the title I funding, the President's program on \nLeave No Child Behind or the National Institutes of Health. We are out \nof fat. We are through tissue. We are to the bone and beyond.\n  The National Institutes of Health are the crown jewels of the Federal \nGovernment, maybe the only jewels of the Federal Government. Enormous \nstrides have been made in combating the major ailments of our society--\nheart disease, cancer, Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's--but in FY06 there \nwas a $50 million cut on the National Cancer Institute, which I won't \ncall scandalous or outlandish, I will say it is inappropriate. This \nyear we have added in this budget only $1 billion. When I say ``only,'' \nat $20 billion, raising it to $29.9, that doesn't keep up with the cost \nof inflation. There are many grants which are now being turned away by \nNIH.\n  We had a vote last night on a motion to recommit the bill on \nCommerce-Justice-Science. I voted against recommitment and made a brief \nfloor statement that to send the bill back to committee to come back \nwith the President's figure would constitute a surrender of the \ncongressional responsibility to appropriate.\n  Article I gives us that responsibility and the authority. If we are \ngoing to accept the President's figure, then why don't we start there \nand leave us to fill in the blanks. But so that the record will contain \na statement on legislative process, if anybody is watching on C-SPAN 2, \ncoming to these bills, the one today on Labor, Health and Human \nServices, and Education and coming to the bill which we passed last \nnight on Commerce-Justice-Science, it is an elaborate, painstaking \nprocess. There are hearings. There are deliberations. There are \nmeetings. Then there is what is called a markup in the subcommittee. We \ngo through the budget.\n\n  Meanwhile, staff has worked diligently on it. If it was generally \nknown how hard the staff works, people would be amazed. They say if you \nasked: How many people in Washington in the Federal Government work? \nthat most people would respond about half. The fact is, this is a very \ndifficult job, especially for staff. Senators work too. So do House \nMembers. Without going into that, though, we did not come up with these \nfigures and pull them out of the air. They were worked through very \ncarefully.\n  The bill which was passed yesterday had some increases which were \nvery vital increases. They were increases on law enforcement which \nAmerica needs. For example, the appropriation for the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation was increased by $383 million over the preceding year.\n  The Community Oriented Policing Services, the program known as COPS, \nto get additional law enforcement officers on the street, was increased \nby $1.639 million. That means that America is being better protected. \nIt goes to the local governments. It is seed money. They hire \nadditional police. The Federal allocation does not last long. Then it \nis our expectation they will keep the police.\n  State and local law enforcement assistance was increased by $163 \nmillion. I refer to that only briefly to give you some idea as to what \nwe did yesterday and why it seemed to me to be inappropriate to refer \nit back to committee, which means we would take the President's figure, \nwhich was about $3.2 billion lower, in another subcommittee worked \nunder the distinguished leadership of Senator Mikulski and Senator \nShelby. If we are to discharge our responsibilities under the \nConstitution, we have to stand by our guns as to what we want to do.\n  Now, I am not saying the figure on yesterday's bill is not to be \nmodified. The President has set the tone on that when he vetoed the \nSCHIP bill. Congress came in at $35 billion over 5 years, and the \nPresident came in at $4.8 billion. Then he said he was willing to \nnegotiate. There are some in the Congress who do not want to negotiate, \nwho want to let the program lapse because it would be politically \ndisadvantageous to the President if there is no continuation of the \nprogram for children's health.\n  Well, I do not think that will happen. I do not think that should \nhappen. Because if some Members of Congress stand in the way of \nnegotiations and a compromise, people will find out about it and it \nwill be a political detriment to those who stand in the way of \nnegotiations.\n  So as I said last night on the Senate floor, if you have the Senate \nbill on Commerce, Justice and Science higher than the President's \nfigure by $3.2 billion, let's negotiate, just like the President said \non SCHIP.\n  On this bill, we are prepared to negotiate. The first line of \nnegotiation has already been announced by Senator Harkin, and that was \nin response to a Statement of Administration Policy issued today from \nthe Executive Office of the President:\n\n       The Administration strongly opposes provisions in this bill \n     that overturn the President's policy regarding human \n     embryonic stem cell research.\n\n  Well, Senator Harkin and I have considered this issue very carefully, \nand we have decided, much against our preference, to accede to what the \nPresident has strongly opposed. We do this in the context--not that we \nagree with the President, because we strongly disagree with him--but we \nwould like to get this bill passed, and we are prepared to compromise.\n  This stem cell issue is one which is very near and dear to me. We \nfound out about the potential for stem cells in November of 1998. Ten \ndays, two weeks later--I chaired the subcommittee--we had hearings. We \nhad 20 hearings on it. The research has shown me that these stem cells \nare a tremendous potential for curing the maladies of the world. We \nhave 400,000 of them that are frozen that are going to be thrown away.\n  This is a long, involved subject, but in a nutshell, we are going to \nhave Federal funding of stem cell research. It is a matter of when, not \na matter of whether or if. It will happen. It will happen.\n  So in removing this provision from the bill, I do it with great \nreluctance and great regret. But I do it after consultation with the \ngroups, the advocacy groups for stem cell research. They have been \nconsulted. They are in the middle of all this, and they understand the \nreasons for it. They also understand if we pursue this, there will be a \ngreat many amendments which could pass and be harmful to the interests \nof the health of this country and to what the advocacy groups are \nseeking to accomplish.\n  So we come to a bill which I think America needs. It is worth \npointing out that our bill is substantially under the bill passed by \nthe House of Representatives. We have come in at $152.1 billion. The \nHouse of Representatives has come in at 154.2 billion. So they are $2.1 \nbillion higher than we are. But this is our best judgment as to what \nought to be done.\n  If anybody disagrees with it, Senators have the right to come to the \nfloor and offer amendments, if they want to reduce the funding. We are \nprepared to listen. And we are prepared to negotiate with the \nPresident. But I am not prepared to take the figure the President has \nautomatically. I am not prepared to do that. If we are going to do \nthat, there is no reason to have the hearings and the meetings and the \nmarkup and the full committee and the laborious work we go through. If \nwe are going to take the President's figure, it may as well come out of \nthe White House as to what they are doing, if all we are left to do is \nfill in the blanks. I think it would be a dereliction of duty for us \nnot to come forward with our conclusions on what appropriations are \nnecessary for these three major Departments.\n  At the present time we are proceeding here, we have started the \nconfirmation proceedings of Judge Michael Mukasey. I was there earlier \nthis morning, and I have to return there. So I will be taking care of \nmy duties here as best I can. Since I am not twins,\n\n[[Page S12957]]\n\nthere will be someone else here to take over on the occasions when I \ncannot be here. But I did want these views to be expressed, and there \nis a long, erudite statement prepared by extraordinary staff, Bettilou \nTaylor--some call her the 101st Senator, but I think that diminishes \nher standing--and Sudip Parikh.\n  So, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that statement be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 Floor Statement--Senator Arlen Specter\n\n\n FY 2008 LABOR, HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AND EDUCATION APPROPRIATIONS \n                                  BILL\n\n       Mr. President, the Labor, Health and Human Services and \n     Education bill before the Senate today totals $152.1 billion, \n     an increase of $7.3 billion over the FY'07 level and $10.8 \n     billion over the President's budget. The bill that passed the \n     House of Representatives contains $154.2 billion, an increase \n     of $2.1 billion over the Senate.\n       The funds contained in this bill address this nation's \n     public health problems and continue to strengthen our \n     biomedical research, assure a quality education for America's \n     children, and offer opportunities for individuals seeking to \n     improve job skills.\n       At this time, I want to take this opportunity to thank the \n     distinguished Chairman of the Subcommittee, Senator Tom \n     Harkin, for his hard work. This bill is not an easy one to \n     maneuver through the subcommittee and full committee and it \n     is a major accomplishment getting it to the floor for \n     consideration.\n       Some of the key funding levels in the bill include:\n       $29.9 billion for the National Institutes of Health, $1 \n     billion over FY'07\n       $4 million for Embryo Adoption\n       $2.170 billion for Ryan White AIDS programs\n       $75 million for mentoring programs\n       $300 million for Family Planning programs\n       $100 million for Mentoring Programs\n       $12 million for a Cord Blood Stem Cell Bank\n       $2 million for administering asbestos claims\n       $1.1 million for mesothelioma registry and tissue bank\n       $220 million to continue construction projects at the \n     Centers for Disease Control\n       $2.161 billion for Low Income Home Energy Assistance\n       $200 million for Children's Hospital Graduate Medical \n     Education\n       $2.3 billion for Community Health Centers\n       $102 million for Healthy Start\n       $7.1 billion for Head Start\n       $828.5 million for Worker Protection Programs\n       $5.25 billion for Job Training Programs\n       $13.9 billion for Title I Grants to Disadvantaged Students\n       $11.2 billion for Special Education State Grants\n       $14.5 billion for Pell Grants to support a maximum grant of \n     $4,310\n       $313.4 million for Gear Up\n       $43.5 million for youth offender programs\n       $420 million for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, \n     in addition\n       Let me discuss in detail the major elements of this bill:\n\n\n                            MEDICAL RESEARCH\n\n       The bill before the Senate contains $29.9 billion for the \n     National Institutes of Health. The $1 billion increase over \n     the FY'07 level will continue the important work of thousands \n     of researchers across this nation. These additional funds are \n     critical in catalyzing scientific discoveries that will lead \n     to a better understanding in preventing and treating the \n     disorders that afflict men, women, and children in our \n     society.\n       Each year, the Labor-HHS Subcommittee holds numerous \n     hearings on medical research issues. Testimony is heard from \n     the NIH Institute Directors, medical experts, patients, \n     family members, and advocates asking for increased biomedical \n     research funding to find the causes and cures for autism, \n     Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, spinal cord injury, \n     muscular dystrophy, ALS, AIDS, diabetes, heart disease, and \n     the many cancers affecting millions of Americans. But the \n     diseases I just mentioned are the ones that everyone knows. \n     However, there are a number of orphan diseases, those \n     affecting 200,000 people or less, that are just as important \n     but not often talked about. Research also needs to be \n     specifically focused on orphan diseases such as spinal \n     muscular atrophy, Ataxia's, Batten disease, fibromyalgia, \n     Fragile X and spina bifida.\n\n\n               CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION\n\n       The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is the lead \n     Federal agency for protecting the health and safety of \n     Americans at home and abroad. To address these needs the bill \n     includes $6.4 billion for programs at the CDC. The CDC's \n     ability to respond quickly to address this nation's health \n     concerns has been proven over the last several years. Within \n     minutes of the September 11 attack, CDC set up an emergency \n     operations center and began to deploy supplies and staff, \n     issuing health alerts and responding to State needs. CDC \n     redirected more than 2,000 staff to focus their resources on \n     the anthrax crisis to identifying the disease and ensuring \n     that health professionals were properly trained in \n     recognizing the signs of anthrax. During the gulf coast \n     hurricanes, the CDC staff was on the ground to assess and \n     mitigate the infectious disease risk to residents of flooded \n     areas. Last June, CDC also quickly identified a patient with \n     a drug resistant strain of TB and took steps to isolate the \n     patient and protect the American public. The Committee has \n     included $1.7 billion to improve this nation's research \n     capacities and to detect and control emerging infectious \n     disease threats in the U.S. and around the world. The \n     Committee has included $220 million to continue the \n     renovation of the CDC facilities in Atlanta. With the funds \n     provided in FY'08, we will only need one more year of funding \n     to complete the modernization of the CDC campus.\n\n\n                    PANDEMIC INFLUENZA PREPAREDNESS\n\n       Although press attention regarding pandemic influenza has \n     waned, the threat of a pandemic influenza resulting in \n     millions of deaths worldwide remains high. The Committee has \n     included $888 million for pandemic influenza preparedness \n     activities. These dollars are to purchase pre-pandemic \n     vaccine stockpiles, spur vaccine development, purchase \n     antivirals, and for the development of diagnostic tests. The \n     remaining dollars are for on-going pandemic preparedness \n     activities within the Department of Health & Human Services \n     and the Centers for Disease Control & Prevention.\n\n\n                               MENTORING\n\n       In this nation it is estimated that more than 772,500 \n     juveniles are members of gangs, dropout rates in some school \n     districts exceed 60% and the direct and indirect cost of \n     youth violence exceeds $158 billion a year.\n       Mentoring programs have proven to steer children away from \n     gangs, violence and crime. Studies show that mentored \n     children are less likely to start using drugs and alcohol or \n     commit violent acts. They are also more likely to graduate \n     from high school and go on to a higher education. \n     Unfortunately, the demand for mentors far exceeds the supply.\n       To address these concerns the bill includes $75 million, \n     including $50 million to support mentoring programs for \n     children who are at risk of failing academically, dropping \n     out of school, or involved in criminal or delinquent \n     activities. These funds will be awarded to local education \n     agencies and non-profit community-based organizations to \n     support mentoring programs. Also included is $25 million \n     targeted to areas with the highest dropout rates and schools \n     designated as persistently dangerous. Funds will be used to \n     increase the number of mentors, identify children at an early \n     age and link them with mentors to provide support before \n     children get involved in criminal behavior.\n\n\n                 MINE SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION\n\n       This Subcommittee has always been concerned about mine \n     safety, but the many accidents in recent years have sharpened \n     the Subcommittee's focus.\n       The regulations governing mine safety have evolved slowly \n     from primitive beginnings in 1891. In the 1930's, well over \n     2300 people were dying annually in mining accidents. In 1941, \n     Congress established the forerunner of the Mine Safety and \n     Health Administration. The passage of the Mine Act in 1977 \n     established MSHA, placed it in the Department of Labor, and \n     established the current regulatory framework. The Congress \n     amended the Mine Act in 2006 to strengthen its safety \n     provisions in response to the recent incidents. Within the \n     total provided, the bill includes $330.1 million for the Mine \n     Safety and Health Administration, including $2 million for \n     mine rescue and recovery activities. This is an increase \n     of $16.5 million over the FY'07 level. The increase will \n     be used to accelerate the implementation of the MINER act \n     to improve health and safety conditions for miners.\n\n\n                                GEAR UP\n\n       The bill provides $313.4 million for Gaining Early \n     Awareness and Readiness for Undergraduate Programs. These \n     funds will be used to assist high schools to help low-income \n     students prepare for and pursue postsecondary education.\n\n\n             CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION\n\n       To support health professions training in children's \n     teaching hospitals, the bill provides $200 million. The \n     amount provided is a $97 million cut below the FY'07 level. \n     However, the bill that passed the House contains $307 million \n     and I will support the House figure during conference \n     negotiations.\n\n\n                        COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS\n\n       To help provide primary health care services to the \n     medically indigent and underserved populations in rural and \n     urban areas, the bill contains $2.2 billion for community \n     health centers. This amount represents an increase of $250 \n     million over the FY 2007 level.\n\n\n                            SUBSTANCE ABUSE\n\n       For prevention and treatment of substance abuse, the bill \n     includes $3.4 billion, including $2.1 billion for treatment \n     programs, $197.1 million for prevention and $923.1 million \n     for mental health programs. The latest estimates indicate \n     that millions of Americans with serious substance abuse \n     problems go untreated each year. The amounts provided will \n     help address the treatment gap.\n\n\n                                 LIHEAP\n\n       The bill provides $2.161 billion for the Low Income Home \n     Energy Assistance Program\n\n[[Page S12958]]\n\n     (LIHEAP) the key heating and cooling program for low income \n     families in Pennsylvania and states throughout the nation. \n     Funding supports grants to states to deliver critical \n     assistance to low income households to help meet higher \n     energy costs.\n\n\n                             AGING PROGRAMS\n\n       For programs serving the elderly, the bill before the \n     Senate recommends $3.3 billion. Including $483.6 million for \n     the community service employment program to provide part-time \n     employment opportunities for low-income elderly; $350.6 \n     million for supportive services and senior centers; $217.6 \n     million for the national senior volunteer corps.; $773.6 \n     million for senior nutrition programs; $1.1 billion for \n     research conducted at the National Institute on Aging; $162.6 \n     million for family and native American caregiver support \n     programs; and $35 million for the Medicare insurance \n     counseling program.\n\n\n                                  AIDS\n\n       The bill includes $6.5 billion for AIDS research, \n     prevention and services. Included in this amount is $2.1 \n     billion for Ryan White programs; $930.4 million for AIDS \n     prevention at the Centers for Disease Control; $2.9 billion \n     for AIDS research at the National Institutes of Health; and \n     $300 million for the Global Fund for HIV/AIDS.\n\n\n                               HEAD START\n\n       To enable all children to develop and function at their \n     highest potential, the bill includes $7.1 billion for the \n     Head Start program, an increase of $200 million over last \n     year's appropriation.\n\n\n                               EDUCATION\n\n       To enhance this Nation's investment in education, the bill \n     before the Senate contains $58.1 billion for discretionary \n     education programs, an increase of $532 million over last \n     year's funding level and $1.5 billion more than the \n     President's budget request.\n\n\n                  EDUCATION FOR DISADVANTAGED CHILDREN\n\n       The bill includes $13.9 billion, an increase of $1.1 \n     billion for Title I grants to school districts. These \n     funds will provide services to approximately 15 million \n     school children in nearly all school districts across the \n     United states.\n\n\n                               IMPACT AID\n\n       For Impact Aid programs, the bill includes $1.24 billion. \n     Included in the recommendation is: $49.5 million for payments \n     for children with disabilities; $1.1 billion for basic \n     support payments; and $65.7 million for payments for Federal \n     property. In addition, $17.8 million is available for \n     construction activities at certain Impact Aid-eligible \n     schools.\n\n\n                           SPECIAL EDUCATION\n\n       For special education state grants, the bill includes $12.3 \n     billion, an increase of $527.5 million more than provided in \n     FY'07. These funds will help local educational agencies meet \n     the requirement that all children--ages 3 through 21--with \n     disabilities have access to a free, appropriate public \n     education, and all infants and toddlers with disabilities \n     have access to early intervention services.\n\n\n                            READING PROGRAMS\n\n       The bill includes $800 million for Reading First State \n     Grants to implement comprehensive reading instruction to \n     ensure that every child can read by the end of the third \n     grade. Also included is $117.7 million for Early Reading \n     First designed for preschools to enhance the verbal skills, \n     phonological awareness, letter knowledge and early language \n     development of children ages 3 through 5. To help struggling \n     middle and high school students improve their reading skills, \n     the bill includes $36 million.\n\n\n                21st CENTURY COMMUNITY LEARNING CENTERS\n\n       For community learning centers activities, such as before- \n     and after-school, recreational, drug, violence prevention and \n     family literacy programs, the bill includes $1 billion.\n\n\n                                  TRIO\n\n       To improve post-secondary education opportunities for low-\n     income first-generation college students, the Committee \n     recommendation includes $858.2 million for the TRIO program, \n     to assist in more intensive outreach and support services for \n     low income youth.\n\n\n           CHARTER SCHOOLS AND VOLUNTARY PUBLIC SCHOOL CHOICE\n\n       The bill includes $214.8 million for charter school grants \n     which help in the planning, development and implementation of \n     charter schools. Also included is $26.2 million for voluntary \n     public school choice to expand programs, especially for \n     parents whose children attend low-performing public schools.\n\n\n                    STUDENT AID AND HIGHER EDUCATION\n\n       For student aid and higher education programs, the bill \n     provides $18.4 billion. Pell grants, the cornerstone of \n     student financial aid is funded at $14.5 billion which will \n     provide a maximum grant award of $4,310. The bill also \n     includes $770.9 million for the supplemental educational \n     opportunity grants, and $980.5 million for the Federal work \n     study program. Also included are $858.2 million for TRIO \n     programs and $507.2 million for aid to institutional \n     development.\n\n\n                              JOB TRAINING\n\n       In this nation, we know all too well that unemployment \n     wastes valuable talent and potential, and ultimately weakens \n     our economy. The bill before us today provides $5.59 billion \n     for job training programs. This includes $1.65 billion for \n     the Job Corps; $864.2 million for Adult training; and $1.19 \n     billion for retraining dislocated workers.\n\n\n                                CLOSING\n\n       There are many other notable accomplishments in this bill, \n     but for the sake of time, I mentioned just several of the key \n     highlights, so that the nation may grasp the scope and \n     importance of this bill.\n       In closing, Mr. President, I again want to thank Senator \n     Harkin and his staff and the other Senators on the \n     Subcommittee for their cooperation.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Before I yield the floor, I wish to compliment my \ndistinguished colleague, Senator Tom Harkin. Senator Harkin and I have \nworked side by side. Sometimes I have been chairman; sometimes he has \nbeen chairman. I like it better when I am chairman. But I also like it \nwhen he is chairman. We have what we call a seamless transfer of the \ngavel.\n  People complain there is a lot of bickering in Washington, DC, and \nthere is too much infighting. Well, Tom Harkin and Arlen Specter do not \ndo that. We try to set an example of working together in the public \ninterest.\n  May I also add, I do the same thing with Senator Robert P. Casey, \nJr., my colleague from Pennsylvania. We meet frequently and go over the \nkey issues. When there are major events--we had a big hearing in \nPhiladelphia on juvenile gang violence. I invited Senator Casey to come \nalong. He has had some ideas and some programs he has advocated, and he \nhas invited me.\n  We went to Pittsburgh to swear in some judges. I made sure it suited \nSenator Casey's schedule. People like to see Democrats and Republicans \nworking together. Senator Casey and I do, and, I say to the Senator \nfrom Iowa, certainly you and I do, Mr. Chairman. So I thank you. I \nthank Ellen Murray and Sudip for their extraordinary work.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I appreciate that.\n  Mr. SPECTER. There is a story that behind every successful man there \nis a surprised mother-in-law. But in the case of Tom Harkin and Arlen \nSpecter, it is Ellen and Bettilou.\n  Mr. HARKIN. That is right.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank my good friend, Senator Specter, \nfor his very kind words, his generosity of spirit, and respond in kind \nthat I have said many times to people that during the interregnum when \nthe Republicans controlled the Senate--I say that jocularly--I was very \nfortunate and blessed to have Senator Specter as the chairman of this \ncommittee. He is right, we have worked together very closely over the \nyears, and I thank him for that very close partnership and working \nrelationship. He is a great leader in areas of health and education and \nmedical research and so many other items. So I thank Senator Specter \nfor that very close working relationship.\n  I am pleased to bring to the floor the fiscal year 2008 \nappropriations bill for Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, \nand related agencies.\n  It has been said many times that the Defense appropriations bill is \nthe bill that defends America. But this appropriations bill, the bill \nwe have before us--the bill that funds Education and Health and Human \nServices and biomedical research and the Centers for Disease Control \nand Prevention--is the bill that defines America.\n  This bill funds the most basic, essential, life-sustaining, and \nlifesaving services for millions of people in this country, including \nthe most needy among us. It provides for the education of our children. \nIt provides health care for many of our poorest citizens. It helps \nstudents from low- and middle-income families afford college. It funds \nmedical research to help ease human suffering. It gives displaced \nworkers a chance to get back on their feet.\n  This bill does define us and says who we are as Americans. Despite \nextreme budget constraints, I believe we have produced a good bill. I \nwish we could have done more for these programs because we have some \ncatching up to do. But we also have to be fiscally responsible. This \nbill fits within the budget resolution. It conforms to pay-go. It \nreflects the priorities of Senators on both sides of the aisle, and it \nreflects the values, ideals, and priorities of the American people.\n  Again, I commend our ranking member, Senator Specter, for his \nleadership in helping to craft this bill. As Senator Specter said, we \nhave had an amazingly productive partnership for\n\n[[Page S12959]]\n\nthe last, as I count it, about 17, almost 18 years. As control of the \nSenate has switched between the two parties, we have passed the gavel \nback and forth, but there has been one constant and that is our shared \ncommitment to investing in job training, in essential human services, \nin education, and cutting-edge biomedical research.\n  One notable accomplishment of our bipartisan partnership was the \ndoubling of funding at the National Institutes of Health over a 5-year \nperiod between 1998 and 2003. It started under a Democratic President, \nfinished under a Republican President. But today, sadly, that \nachievement seems like ancient history. Today, it is an achievement in \nthis bill simply to prevent a cut at the National Institutes of Health \nbecause that is what the President proposed in his budget. The \nPresident proposed a $279 million cut in funding for NIH, in things \nsuch as cancer research, Alzheimer's research, ALS research, and other \nlifesaving research being done through NIH.\n  The National Institutes of Health is just one of the critical \nprograms in this bill that the President's budget underfunds. Head \nStart, special education, job training all would face cuts if the \nPresident had his way.\n  Overall, for all the programs in this appropriations bill, his budget \nrequest was $3.5 billion below last year's level. Let me repeat that. \nThe President's budget was $3.5 billion below last year's level--not \nbelow an inflationary increase, below last year's level. So not only \ndid his budget fail to keep up with inflation, it would take us back. \nThat is unacceptable.\n\n  President John Kennedy once said that ``to govern is to choose''--a \nfamous line. Well, I tend to agree. Governing is also about setting \npriorities. The President has set his priorities. He is just days away \nfrom sending up a supplemental budget request for the war in Iraq. We \nhear it to be as much as $190 billion, and he will insist that we \nappropriate every single penny. Meanwhile, 2 weeks ago, rejecting pleas \nfrom many members of his own party, he vetoed the SCHIP bill, which \nwould preserve health coverage for 6 million children nationwide and \ncover millions more who are currently uninsured. Now, the President, \nwith his statement of policy that he sent up yesterday, is threatening \nto veto this bill.\n  So think about it. The President is demanding that we continue to \nspend more than $12 billion a month in Iraq on the war, yet he is \nthreatening to veto this appropriations bill because it spends $11 \nbillion a year more than what he wanted, for 1 year. The President says \nhe wants $12 billion a month for the war in Iraq, but we shouldn't \nspend $11 billion over his budget for 1 full year for all of the other \nthings we do in education and in health care and in human services.\n  Under the Constitution, we know that the President proposes, the \nCongress disposes. So we in Congress get to set our priorities too. We \nalso get to choose about governing. Rather than cut the essential \nprograms and services in this bill, we have chosen in a bipartisan \nfashion to provide a very modest increase. So we respectfully disagree \nwith the President. We believe it is time to make investments in this \ncountry. It is time for the President to put our own needs here at home \nfirst. For 5 years we have poured untold billions of U.S. taxpayers' \ndollars into schools, job programs, hospitals, and human services in \nIraq. It is time we looked after those same needs here in America. That \nis exactly what we propose to do in this bill.\n  This bill provides a modest increase of $1 billion for the National \nInstitutes of Health. That is 3.5 percent. That is less than biomedical \ninflation. But the President's budget would slash investments in NIH, \ncutting 800 research grants that could lead to cures or treatments for \nheart disease, cancer, diabetes, or other diseases ravaging our people. \nThis is a very exciting time in biomedical research. We are reaping the \nbenefits of the Human Genome Project. It would be unconscionable and I \nthink totally irresponsible to short-circuit this progress by cutting \nthe funding for NIH. So we have, as I said, provided a modest increase \nof $1 billion for NIH in this bill.\n  In this bill, we increase funding for Head Start by $200 million. I \nwish it were more. It should be more. We are just beginning to make up \nfor the tens of thousands of children who have been lost to the program \nbecause of stagnant funding over the last several years. The \nPresident's budget would cut Head Start funding by $100 million. So the \nPresident's budget cuts it by $100 million; we increase it by $200 \nmillion. The President's budget would cut thousands more children from \nthe rolls of Head Start; ours would add to it. That is the difference. \nWe believe the President's approach is unacceptable.\n  In this bill, we provide an additional $457 million for special \neducation. Again, it really ought to be more, and I will explain what I \nmean by that. If we accepted the President's budget, it would cut \nspecial education by $291 million.\n  When IDEA passed--the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act--\nwhen it passed the Congress--I guess it was about 30 years ago; yes, it \nhas been about 30 years--when we passed the Individuals with \nDisabilities Education Act, we committed ourselves, we committed the \nFederal Government to paying up to 40 percent of the additional cost of \neducating kids with disabilities in our schools. Now, consider this: \nPrior to that time, most kids with disabilities were shunned aside. \nThey were sent to State institutions, warehoused, and many of them \nnever even went to school. But because of a decision--and I say to the \nSenator sitting in the chair, it was a Pennsylvania case, PARC, \nPennsylvania Association of Retarded Citizens v. Pennsylvania, a \nlandmark case.\n  From that case, it was decided that if a State decided to provide a \nfree public education for all its children, if it decided to do that, \nit could not then discriminate against kids with disabilities in \nproviding that free, appropriate public education. Well, that then led, \nof course, to the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act that \npassed the Congress. In that, we said: We are going to help. We think \nStates should do this. States are mandated to do this under the \nConstitution, but we are going to help. So we are going to try over the \nyears to build this up to where we provide at least 40 percent of the \nadditional funding to mainstream kids with disabilities in our public \nschools.\n  Where are we? Under President Bush, we are going backward. Two years \nago, the Federal Government got up to 18 percent of this additional \nfunding for kids with disabilities. We got up to 18 percent 2 years \nago. In the last fiscal year, the Federal share dropped to 17 percent. \nIf the President gets his way with his budget in 2008, we will be down \nto 16 percent. We have had a number of amendments on this floor, sense-\nof-the-Senate resolutions, to get this up to 40 percent. Republicans \nand Democrats have voted for this. Yet the President's budget is taking \nus in the opposite direction, and that, of course, again is \nunacceptable. When we don't pick up the tab, when we don't do our share \nand our part in providing for special education, who gets stuck with \nthe bill? Local property taxpayers. The States have to increase and \nkeep increasing the share of local property taxes to pay for this. \nAgain, that is unacceptable.\n  Turning now to college education, we all know the cost of a college \neducation is rising. It hits all of us pretty hard. It hits all middle-\nclass families and anyone who wants to get a college education. \nObviously, it hits the poorest families the hardest. This bill provides \nan increase of more than $800 million for Pell grants over last year--\nPell grants, so that our poorest students have a chance to get a higher \neducation. Building on that increase we put in the bill earlier, \nSenator Kennedy and Senator Enzi, the chair and ranking member of the \nauthorizing committee on education, wrote a budget reconciliation \nbill that raises the maximum Pell grant award from $4,310 to $4,800. \nThat is a boost of almost $500 a year for the neediest students--the \nlargest increase in more than 30 years. But under the President's \nbudget, the increase would be less than half that--about $230 a year. \nSo again, our bill would increase that and provide for $800 million \nmore for Pell grants over last year.\n\n  One other item which is something of importance to every Senator is \nthis bill increases funding for administering Social Security by $125 \nmillion above the President's request. Now, why is that important? I \nwill bet my colleagues\n\n[[Page S12960]]\n\nevery Senator here and their State offices have been getting all kinds \nof cases coming in from people who have disability claims, but they are \nbacklogged, backlogged, backlogged. They wait months and months, \nsometimes years, to get their disability claims administered. Well, \nthis increase would allow us to make a dent in that backlog of \ndisability claims. Again, we ought to be even more aggressive in \nreducing the backlog. But make no mistake, if we accept the President's \nbudget, the Social Security Administration would have to institute a \nhiring freeze and the backlog of claims would skyrocket. It is bad \nenough the way it is right now, but under the President's budget, it \nwould be unacceptable. So our bill would provide $125 million more for \nSocial Security to begin to reduce the disability claims backlog.\n  I think one of the most disturbing problems with the President's \nbudget is it is kind of a total disregard, I would say, for the needs \nof our poorest people, the poorest citizens of our country. Just \nconsider three programs that serve low-income children and families in \nthis country. The three programs are the LIHEAP program, which is the \nLow Income Home Energy Assistance Program, the Community Services Block \nGrant Program, and the Social Services Block Grant Program. Let's look \nat those three. These all serve the lowest income people in our \ncountry.\n  The President's budget would cut LIHEAP by $379 million despite \npredictions of record energy prices this winter. This cut would force \nStates to lower their benefits or serve fewer low-income individuals, \nmany of whom are elderly and poor, many who are going without medical \ncare, some cutting down on their food and other necessities in order to \npay their heating bills.\n  Then, the two block grants I mentioned, the community services block \ngrant and the social services block grant, many of the States tie these \ntogether to provide essential services for our most disadvantaged \npeople in this country.\n  The community services block grant is a key safety net, providing \nassistance in areas such as job training, housing, and emergency food \naid. This bill increases funding for the community services block grant \nby just a modest $40 million. The President's budget eliminated--the \nPresident's budget didn't just cut community services block grants, \nthey zeroed it out--all $630 million zeroed out.\n  The other block grant, the social services block grant, addresses \nsome of our country's most vital human services needs, such as \nprotecting children from abuse and neglect, caring for homeless \nseniors, providing services to children and families with severe \ndisabilities, to mention just a few. The President's budget slashed the \nsocial services block grant by 30 percent. Our bill says no.\n  The President has already cut taxes for the wealthiest Americans. We \nare not going to decimate programs for the poor at the same time. \nEnough is enough.\n  So the bill we have before us invests in job training and employment \nservices programs to help Americans develop the skills they need to \nfind work. The President's budget cut job-training programs by $1 \nbillion; that is, from $3.6 billion last year, he would cut it to $2.6 \nbillion. This bill rejects that. This bill also provides $483 million \nfor community services jobs for older Americans. The President's \nrequest was $350 million, which would have actually cut a lot of \nseniors from the program, seniors who are already working in that \nprogram.\n  America's working families also count on the Labor Department to \nensure that their workplaces are safe and that employers comply with \nlabor laws. Unfortunately, the President has consistently underfunded \nthe agencies that enforce these laws. Since 2001, OSHA--that is the \nOccupational Safety and Health Administration--has lost almost 10 \npercent of its enforcement staff because of the President's budgets. \nThis bill charts a new course. We invest $12 million over last year to \nrebuild OSHA staffing.\n  When I describe the funding choices in this bill as ``investments,'' \nI choose my word carefully. It is a simple fact that when we invest in \nthese programs, we save money in the long run and our country saves \nmoney in the long run. When the Minneapolis bridge collapsed this \nsummer, we all talked about the large costs of failing to invest in our \ninfrastructure, our physical infrastructure, our roads, our bridges, \nour highways, our rails.\n  Well, what about failing to invest in our human infrastructure, our \npeople? What can be more important than that investment? We know some \nthings. We know that early childhood education pays many dividends \nlater on in life and saves us money. We know that quality K-12 \neducation pays big dividends. We know that enabling kids to go to \ncollege and not be burdened with a lot of debt pays off with big \ndividends. We know that adding community health centers pays off, pays \ndividends by preventing emergency care and disability down the road. We \nknow that job training pays big dividends by getting workers who are \nlaid off of jobs--maybe they have gone overseas--retrained and equipped \nfor new kinds of jobs so they can be productive, taxpaying citizens. \nAll of what I mention pays huge future dividends.\n  I said earlier that this bill defines America. It is important that \nthis bill defines America as a compassionate nation, a nation that \ninvests in its future, a nation, as the late Senator Hubert Humphrey \nused to say, that meets the needs of those at the beginning of life, \nthose in the twilight of life, and those in the shadows of life.\n  Again, I ask, how can we continue to pour endless billions of dollars \ninto Iraq--more than $12 billion a month now, and counting--and yet we \ncut funding for the basic essential services here at home for our most \nneedy citizens? This is a case of seriously misplaced priorities. We \nare doing our best to correct it in the bill before us today. \nObviously, we have not been able to do everything we want or need to \ndo, but this bill reflects the priorities of Senators on both sides of \nthe aisle, and, as I said, we stayed within our budget allocation.\n  Again, given all of this, I am genuinely saddened that the President \nhas already pledged to veto the bill. I really cannot believe the \nPresident wants us to cut funding for cancer research and other \nlifesaving research through the NIH. I cannot believe the President \nwants to cut children from the rolls of Head Start. I cannot believe \nthe President wants to eliminate the community services block grant, \nwhich is a basic life support for many of our neediest citizens. I \ncannot believe the President wants to cut funding for home heating \nassistance for poor elderly. Yet the President's budget would require \nall of these cuts to essential programs and services. It would be \nunconscionable.\n  So all I can assume is that the President is getting very bad advice. \nPerhaps his advisers have told him to veto this bill to score some \npolitical points--whatever that might be. If so, it is bad advice \nbecause there is not an ounce of extravagance in the bill. It meets the \nessential needs of the American people in terms of education, health \nand human services, and job training. It passed out of committee 26 to \n3. You cannot get much more bipartisan than that.\n  I might again point out, as I did earlier, that over the last 5 \nyears, this appropriations bill--again, it was under the leadership of \nSenator Specter, and I was ranking member--every year was above the \nPresident's request. Not once did the President threaten to veto it. \nWell, this year, some games are being played. The President's budget \nslashes all these programs. We come in to replenish the money and put \nit in and to give modest increases, all within our budget allocation, \nbut for the first time in 6 years the President says he is going to \nveto it. What is the difference? Is the only difference now that the \nDemocrats are now in charge? Because, as I said, every year, Senator \nSpecter's bill was higher than the President's request, but he never \nthreatened to veto one of those bills and he never did. This year, he \nsays he will. It sounds to me like the last Karl Rove tactic before he \nleft town. This sounds like a Rove tactic.\n  I say to the President that he is gone, he is history--bad history, \nbut he is history. Now, Mr. President, do the right thing. Do what we \nhave for the last 5 years and work with Congress. We are willing to \nmeet you halfway, as I said earlier.\n  One of the objections in the President's veto threat, which he sent \ndown\n\n[[Page S12961]]\n\nhere yesterday and I have here, was that he opposes overturning the \nPresident's policy regarding human embryonic stem cell research. All \nright. We took it out, even though Senator Specter and I and our \ncommittee feel very strongly about this. We have had hearings and \nhearings on this since 1998. Under Senator Specter's leadership, we \nhave passed legislation to overturn the President's policy. I think we \ngot, if I am not mistaken, about 66 votes in the Senate to do that. I \nthink I am right on that. So, again, we feel strongly about that, as \nstrongly as the President may feel about it, but in the spirit of \ncompromise and getting our bill done and moving it ahead, we decided to \ntake it out, and we did.\n  So I hope that in the next 24 hours the White House will listen to \nthe debate and they know what is going on and they have their people up \nhere; this is no secret--I hope the President will revisit this, and I \nwould like to see a new Statement of Administration Policy coming down \nsaying: You did, in good will, take out the stem cell thing, and that \nwas half of our objection. We will meet you halfway and accept the bill \nas you have it.\n  Mr. President, that would be the good thing to do. I still am hopeful \nthat the President will do that. There is really no justification now \nfor vetoing this bill. If we are over what he wanted, we have been over \nwhat he wanted for the last 5 years and he never vetoed the bill. So I \nhope the President will send down a new statement of policy and that \nthey will support this bill because I think the bill is going to have \nbig support here. It passed committee 26 to 3. If I am not mistaken, \nthose three votes were opposed to the stem cell provisions we had in \nthe bill. Had they not been there, we would have had a unanimous vote \nin committee.\n  I think this bill will get a big vote here on the Senate floor. It \nwould be helpful and would ease things and would, I believe, lift a lot \nof the contentiousness that goes on around town here if the President \nwould come out and say: OK, we will meet you halfway; you took that \nout, so we will take the bill as it is. That would make things go very \nsmoothly.\n  Again, we look forward to the consideration of the bill on the floor \nthis week. We want to use our time productively. I encourage Senators, \nif they have amendments, to bring them to the floor in a timely fashion \ntoday so we can complete our work and get the bill to conference as \nsoon as possible.\n  Senator Reid said on Monday that we would stay in this week--and \nSaturday, if necessary--to finish this important bill. Well, I have \nplaced all my plans on hold. I intend to be here, if necessary, Friday \nand Saturday--or Sunday, if necessary--to finish this vitally important \nbill. I take the leader at his word that we will be here Friday and \nSaturday if we need to be. However, if Senators come over today and \noffer amendments today and tomorrow, hopefully, we can finish this bill \nin a timely manner. Again, Mr. President, we are on the bill, and I \nhope Senators will come over and offer their amendments.\n\n  Mr. President, on August 2, 2007, by a vote of 83 to 14 this Senate \napproved S. 1, the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act of 2007. \nThe President signed the legislation on September 14, 2007. This ethics \nreform legislation will significantly improve the transparency and \naccountability of the legislative process.\n  Pursuant to the new rule XLIV, it is required that the chairman of \nthe committee of jurisdiction certify that certain information related \nto congressionally directed spending be identified and that the \nrequired information be available on a publicly accessible \ncongressional Web site in a searchable format at least 48 hours before \na vote on the pending bill. In addition, Members who request such items \nare required to certify in writing that neither they nor their \nimmediate family have a pecuniary interest in the items they requested, \nand the committee is required to make those certification letters \navailable on the Internet. The information provided includes \nidentification of the congressionally directed spending and the name of \nthe Senator who requested such spending. This information is contained \nin the committee report numbered 110-107, dated June 29, 2007, and has \nbeen available on the Internet for 8 weeks. The Member letters \nconcerning pecuniary interests are also available on the Internet.\n  I am submitting for the Record the certification by the chairman of \nthe Committee on Appropriations, Senator Byrd. I ask unanimous consent \nto have it printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Senator BYRD. I certify that the information required by \n     Senate Rule XLIV, related to congressionally directed \n     spending, has been identified in the Committee report \n     numbered 110-107, filed on June 27, 2007, and that the \n     required information has been available on a publicly \n     accessible congressional website in a searchable format at \n     least 48 hours before a vote on the pending bill.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Menendez). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                         CIA Inspector General\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, there was discussion on the floor this \nmorning about intelligence matters. I wanted to spend a few minutes to \ndiscuss a matter of bipartisan concern in the Senate. What I am talking \nabout is the very troubling development that came to light last week \nindicating that the head of the CIA, General Hayden, has decided to \nlaunch an investigation into the Agency's inspector general.\n  I and others--and I particularly commend Senator Bond, our vice \nchairman of the committee, for his excellent statement on this matter--\nare very concerned about this new development. It is particularly \nimportant that the inspector general of the Central Intelligence Agency \nfunction with independence. Because our work by its very nature--\nentrusted with those secrets essential to protect our country's \nsecurity--has to be done in private and is classified, we need an \nindependent inspector general to ensure accountability.\n  Because of a development such as this, I think this can have a \nchilling effect on the independence of the inspector general at the \nCentral Intelligence Agency.\n  The Congress created these inspector general positions for a reason, \nand that is to ensure accountability, to ensure Government efficiency. \nVirtually all of the agencies have these key positions and, of course, \nit is their job to report findings to the Congress.\n  Perhaps General Hayden is concerned about the work of Mr. Helgerson, \nthe inspector general for the Agency. There is an appropriate process \nfor bringing up those concerns. If the head of the Central Intelligence \nAgency is concerned about how the CIA inspector general is doing his \njob, he ought to bring them to the President's Council on Integrity and \nEffectiveness.\n  It is my view that particular body has been handling complaints \nagainst inspectors general, and it is my view they are doing their job \nwell and appropriately. But to have an investigation such as this, in \nmy view, is going to interfere with the inspectors general \nindependence. If the Director of the CIA is ordering investigations \ninto the inspector general's activities and plans to ``suggest \nimprovements'' for the inspector general to consider, my view is that \ncan undermine the inspector general's independence.\n  I do not want to see inspectors general intimidated. That is the \nbottom line here, and I do not want the Director of the CIA interfering \nwith the extraordinarily important activities of the inspector general \nat the Agency.\n  Let me also state that my concern is part of a view that there has \nbeen a pattern at the Agency of being less than transparent. I and, \nagain, senior Members of this body, particularly Senator Bond and \nSenator Roberts, have worked very closely and in a bipartisan way to \nensure that the inspector general's report on the role of the Agency in \nthe runup to 9/11 was going to be made public. I can tell you that, \nunfortunately, General Hayden fought that bipartisan effort every step \nof the way.\n  The fact is, it was a balanced effort. The particular recommendations \nof the\n\n[[Page S12962]]\n\ninspector general were modest in nature. They did not require that \nanybody be fired or cavalierly dismissed. It called for what is known \nas an accountability board, something, again, to ensure that the \nwatchdogs are in place to protect this country's security and do it in \na fashion that is committed to the American principles of transparency \nand openness.\n  I have written Admiral McConnell who, of course, is the head of the \nnational intelligence community, and asked him to direct General Hayden \nto cease and cease immediately the investigation that is now going on \ninto the work of the inspector general at the Central Intelligence \nAgency.\n  It is my view that people who know they are doing the right thing are \nnot afraid of oversight. It is time for the head of the intelligence \ncommunity, Admiral McConnell, to put an end, and an immediate end, to \nGeneral Hayden's attempt to muzzle the CIA's inspector general.\n  I wrap up by saying, again, we are not talking about a matter that is \npartisan. Senator Bond, who has been so cooperative on these matters \nrelating to accountability and transparency, said it very well. Senator \nBond said the inspector general had done great work. In his statement \non this matter, Senator Bond noted that the Agency regrettably has a \ntrack record of resisting accountability.\n  So that is what this is all about. The ball is now in Admiral \nMcConnell's court. It is my hope that in the next few days, Admiral \nMcConnell will direct General Hayden to cease this investigation into \nthe work of the CIA's inspector general.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/17/senate-section/article/S12962-1", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12962]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Louisiana is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3328 To Amendment No. 3325\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I will call up amendment No. 3328 which is \nat the desk, but in the interim, before I actually call it up and make \nit pending, I wish to discuss the Vitter amendment No. 3328. Hopefully, \nin a relatively short period of time, we can actually call it up and \nmake it pending.\n  This amendment is very simple and very straightforward. In fact, it \nis something this body has seen before on other bills and has strongly \nvoted for before. It simply prohibits any funds in this appropriations \nbill from being used to block the reimportation of safe prescription \ndrugs from Canada.\n  All of us know that sky-high prescription drug prices are a very \ntroubling burden every American family faces. Certainly literally every \nfamily I deal with in Louisiana deals with this issue in some form or \nfashion, often in the context of trying to help elderly parents or \ngrandparents or others with very significant prescription drug costs.\n  One partial solution to that huge challenge is to allow American \nconsumers to buy prescription drugs in person or through mail order or \nthe Internet from Canada, because precisely the same prescription drugs \nare available in Canada--in all cases at a dramatically lower cost.\n  Unfortunately, in this country we have had Federal law that prevents \nAmerican consumers from doing that in most cases. This amendment and \nother full-blown bills, some introduced by myself, others introduced by \nother leaders on the issue, such as Senators Dorgan and Snowe, would \nlift those prohibitions and allow American consumers their rightful \naccess to safe, cheaper prescription drugs from Canada.\n  This amendment is being brought on this appropriations bill for a \nvery simple and legitimate reason. Under the current administration \nthere has been a task force established under the Department of Health \nand Human Services. That task force was specifically established to \ncoordinate all Federal Government activity by the administration to \nblock reimportation of drugs from Canada and elsewhere. That is \ngoverned under the Department of Health and Human Services. That is \norganized under that Department which is governed by this bill, so this \namendment will simply say: No funds in this bill going to the \nDepartment can be used for that purpose. That task force has to quit \nits operation. None of that money can go to support the activity of \nthat task force, which is specifically designed to block American \nconsumers from getting safe, cheaper prescription drugs from Canada and \nelsewhere.\n  At this point I believe it has been cleared so I wish to formally \ncall up amendment No. 3328 and make it pending.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Louisiana [Mr. Vitter] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3328 to amendment No. 3325.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To provide a limitation on funds with respect to preventing \n   the importation by individuals of prescription drugs from Canada)\n\n       On page 79, between lines 4 and 5, insert the following:\n       Sec. __. None of the funds appropriated in this Act may be \n     used to prevent an individual not in the business of \n     importing a prescription drug (within the meaning of section \n     801(g) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. \n     381(g) from importing a prescription drug from Canada that \n     complies with sections 501, 502, and 505 of the Federal Food, \n     Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 351, 352, and 355).\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, this is virtually exactly the same \namendment I proposed with Senator Nelson to the Homeland Security \nAppropriations bill. That amendment was agreed to in the Senate 68 to \n32 on July 11, 2006, and was subsequently signed into law. More \nrecently, this year we came back to the Senate floor with the same \namendment on this year's Homeland Security Appropriations bill and that \nwas agreed to by unanimous consent. So the Senate has spoken. The \nSenate has spoken strongly, by a vote of 68 votes or more, in support \nof what an even larger percentage of the American people want, and that \nis free, unfettered access to safe, cheaper drugs from Canada and \nelsewhere.\n  This amendment is very simple. It says none of the funds in this act, \nin this bill before us, can be used to stop Americans from getting the \nsafe, cheaper prescription drugs from Canada. The amendment is very \nspecific to Canada only.\n  This amendment will take us along the path toward full-blown drug \nreimportation. Last year we had success in allowing Americans to carry \non their person these prescriptions drugs from Canada. This amendment \nwould go further and allow that, not only on an individual American \ncitizen's person, but also by mail order or the Internet, as long as \nthat American citizen is not in the business of wholesaling and selling \nprescription drugs, as long as it is for his or her personal use.\n  I hope the Senate, both sides of the aisle come together as we have \nin the past with a strong, overwhelming majority--in the past it has \nbeen 68 votes or more--and pass this amendment and say enough is \nenough. Let's establish this regime of safe reimportation from Canada \nand elsewhere. Let's push the administration to put forward the safety \nmechanisms that they absolutely have the authority and ability to help \nlower the cost of prescription drugs for all American citizens, \nparticularly our seniors.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in this amendment.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S12963]]\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                                Ethiopia\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, the House of Representatives has recently \npassed the Ethiopian Democracy and Accountability Act of 2007, H.R. \n2003.\n  Although this legislation states that its purpose is to encourage and \nfacilitate the consolidation of democracy and security in Ethiopia--\nwords right out of the resolution--in reality it focuses on the \nshortcomings, on the problems that they face, and not on the successes \nthe country has made.\n  Ethiopia takes great pride in being the oldest independent country in \nAfrica. It continues to be a close friend of the United States, a \nstrong ally in the war on terrorism in the Horn of Africa. I have to \nsay that this is significant because if you kind of use your mental map \nof northeastern Africa and you think about the terrorist activity that \nhas taken place in the Middle East and how it is now coming down \nthrough the Horn of Africa, through Djibouti and that area into the \nUganda-Ethiopia area, it is a very significant area right now.\n  Now, as many of you know, I have had quite an extensive background in \nAfrica. I think I am safe to say that I have been to Africa more than \nany Senator in the history of America. I have been really tied to that \ncontinent and recognize the significance in the future of our country \nas well as their country. It is an area of strategic importance \nglobally to this Nation.\n  I have traveled to the country on several occasions, both on my own \nand as a Member of the Senate and the House. A short while ago, I was \nthere with Congressman Boozman from Arkansas. Throughout my travels in \nthe region, I have met and developed friendships with many political \nand religious leaders.\n  In Addis 6 years ago, we found a little baby. The little baby was 3 \ndays old. The baby was almost dead. It was not unusual. In some \ncountries in Africa, they throw away mostly young baby girls. Then \nafter about 3 days, when they die, the dogs get them. We were there \nbefore the dogs got there. I have 20 kids and grandkids of whom I am \nvery proud. My daughter Molly had nothing but boys. She always wanted a \ngirl. So we were able to take this little girl from Ethiopia and nurse \nher back to health. She had several very close calls. She is healthy \nand has now been here in the United States and is my adopted \ngranddaughter. Her name is Zegita Marie, which is a very common name in \nEthiopia. I say that because I do want to impress upon this group that \nI know something about Ethiopia. I know something about its background. \nI know something about its significance to our safety.\n  In Ethiopia, recently, I met with Prime Minister Meles, his wife. I \nmet with members of the Parliament and with all the individuals there \nwho are trying to do a good job. While there, I saw firsthand their \ndemocratic progress and commitment in fighting terrorism. Although I \nappreciate the increased attention being given to Africa, particularly \nEthiopia, I believe the bill is misguided and takes the wrong approach \nby placing demands on a friend and ally that has made obvious \nadvancements in democracy and human rights. While I continue to agree \nthat the violence and intimidation that took place after the 2005 \nelection was an unnecessary use of excessive force, the Government of \nEthiopia has taken significant steps again to regain a democratic \nprocess that is fair and respectful of human rights.\n  On July 20, 2007, following convictions and sentencing, 38 opposition \nleaders were granted full pardons. All remaining members of the \nopposition were pardoned and released on August 18, 2007. Since these \nevents, reforms have been made in the election process. So often we use \nAmerica as a standard by which to measure democracy in other countries. \nIt is the same problem we have in the Middle East. People say they are \nnot reaching the goals we want them to reach, having a democracy in \nIraq. Why would they? It took this country several years to come up \nwith a democracy. Why should they be able to do it?\n  The same thing is true in Africa. There are some 52 countries in \nAfrica. Just recently have they come into democratization. It has been \nincredibly successful in many of those areas. The United States has \nrecognized the ongoing efforts by the Government of Ethiopia and \ncontinues to play an important role for human rights in Ethiopia. The \nState Department recently hosted a group of opposition political \nleaders and members of Parliament in DC, providing an opportunity for \ndialog and reconciliation. By providing training in public relations, \nhuman rights and logistics planning and coordination for military \nprocedures, the United States is developing the Ethiopian National \nDefense Force into a professional and apolitical machine.\n  We need to understand the significance of what is going on right now. \nWe made a decision about 6 years ago to help the Africans establish \nfive African brigades. They are located in the north, south, east, \nwest, and central. It happens that Ethiopia is the headquarters for the \nEast African Brigade. This is not something we are imposing upon them, \nbut we are saying to them: If you want to do these, we are here to help \nyou. Our idea is, as I mentioned, there is a squeeze in the Middle \nEast. As terrorism starts going down through Djibouti and the Horn of \nAfrica into northeastern Africa, this is an area where if they are \nprepared to take care of themselves, we would not be sending our troops \nthere. It is a well-conceived idea. There is no one area in Africa that \nis as significant as northeastern Africa.\n  Let me digress a little bit. Go to their next-door neighbor, Uganda, \nnorthern Uganda. We hear so much about problems in the Sudan and other \nareas. But we don't hear anything about Uganda. In northern Uganda \nthere is a butcher by the name of Joseph Knoy who, for 30 years, has \nbeen mutilating little kids. You have heard about the children \nsoldiers. Those soldiers are taken over by these people and trained to \nfight at ages 10, 11, and 12. Then once they learn to be soldiers, they \nhave to go back to their villages and murder their parents and family. \nIf they don't do that, they dismember them. I have been up there to \nGulu and other areas, and I have seen that taking place. This is right \nnext door. This is what is happening in that region. Ethiopia has been \nour strong ally in the war on terror and stands on the frontlines of \nthe conflict in Africa. The growing instability in Somalia and the \nOgaden region, combined with the unresolved border disputes between \nEthiopia and Eritrea, creates serious problems. Remember what happened \nthe other day. A few weeks ago, we were sending our troops down to \nMogadishu and the Ethiopians were fighting right there by our side. \nThat was not an easy thing for them to do. That endangered them because \nthere are many opposition groups who would then go into Ethiopia, and \nthey paid dearly for supporting us. But they did so. They have remained \ncommitted to promoting regional stability and eliminating any staging \narea for al-Qaida or other terrorist organizations. In 2006, they sent \nroughly 100,000 troops with us into Somalia, into Mogadishu. We were \nsuccessful in defeating the Islamic coalition. They did that for us. \nDespite these advancements, Somalia remains a continued concern for \ngrowing extremism and the violence continues to escalate. The Ogaden \nregion which borders Somalia is also a growing place of hostility and \nIslamic terrorism. The ongoing insurgency in the region has taken a \ndrastic toll on the civilian population, significantly affecting \ncommercial trade and humanitarian aid.\n  In April of 2007, due to escalating violence, the ENDF initiated a \ncampaign against the insurgency in Ogaden. The ongoing border dispute \nbetween Ethiopia and Eritrea threatens the stability in the Horn of \nAfrica. I have talked to Eritrea, trying to get the two parties \ntogether. It hasn't happened yet. But the Eritrean Government, along \nwith extremist organizations in Somalia, is providing support and \nassistance to the Ogaden National Liberation Front. Our friend in this \nfight is clearly Ethiopia. The United States remains concerned about \nhuman rights violations and the lack of religious and political \nfreedoms in Eritrea. The United States will continue to work with \nEthiopia to bring stability to the region and foster respect of human \nrights and freedom from political or religious persecution.\n\n[[Page S12964]]\n\n  Ethiopia is so significant to the Horn of Africa. It remains an area \nof strategic importance in the war on terror. This area is critical to \nstability of the entire continent of Africa and is a national security \ninterest of the United States. Ethiopia continues to be the central \nbulwark in the fight to deter the growth and disrupt the influence of \nIslamic extremism in the region. Our country's strong support of \nEthiopia during this significant time is imperative.\n\n  In spite of all these successes, in spite of what we have talked \nabout and the significance of Ethiopia, I think we have to oppose H.R. \n2003. I have talked to several people who didn't know any differently. \nThey didn't object to this. I think it went through on a UC over there. \nBut a lot of people couldn't find Ethiopia on a map. I don't think they \nrealized the significance. This resolution's idea of encouraging and \nfacilitating is to impose restrictions and ultimatums. These punitive \nactions could damage the bilateral relationship between the United \nStates and the Government of Ethiopia, as well as derail progress \nEthiopia has made in furtherance of democracy and supporting human \nrights.\n  I fully support the State Department's assessment. Quite often I am \ncriticized for coming down here and opposing the State Department. More \noften than not, that is the case. But in this case they are exactly \nright. They say: The bill risks damaging our ability to influence the \nGovernment of Ethiopia, advance reform, and to deliver effective \ndevelopment assistance.\n  I will only say, then, this is a success story we have had. I can't \nthink of anything worse for the surrounding states, and I would say all \nother 51 countries in Africa, than if we were to punish the very \ncountry that is being friendly to us, is helping us, fighting with us \nside by side, sending 100,000 troops with American troops down to \nSomalia and working on our side.\n  I hope when it comes to this side, if it does come in this form, that \nwe will be able to resoundingly defeat it. I look forward to being in \nEthiopia in about 3 weeks. I will certainly hope that I don't have to \ngo over there after having something like this pass the Senate.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3328\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I am going to offer an amendment in a few \nmoments. First, I would like to spend a couple minutes talking about \nthe amendment that was offered by Senator Vitter. I have a copy of the \namendment. The amendment deals with the issue of drug reimportation. It \nsays:\n\n       None of the funds appropriated in this Act may be used to \n     prevent an individual not in the business of importing a \n     prescription drug from importing a prescription drug from \n     Canada that complies with sections 501, 502, and 505 of the \n     FDA Cosmetic Act.\n\n  I don't have any particular problem with this amendment. It says that \nthe FDA can't do what it is not doing. So that is largely irrelevant to \nme. It has an appearance of doing something, but it doesn't do \nanything. At the moment, if you are in Grafton, ND, and you go across \nthe border to Winnipeg, Canada, and buy prescription drugs and bring \nthem across, if you bring across a 90-day supply of prescription drugs \nfor yourself, you are not going to have a problem. They allow a \npersonal reimportation of prescription drugs because very few Americans \nhave the opportunity to drive to Canada to access that. The one area \nwhere the Vitter amendment would allow reimportation where there needs \nto be some safety attached is with respect to Internet sites. But the \nfact is, those who are now accessing certain Internet sites are doing \nso, and the FDA is not intervening because they don't have the \ncapability to intervene.\n  We do have a piece of legislation that is bipartisan. Senator Snowe, \nSenator Kennedy, Senator McCain, Senator Grassley and myself, many of \nus, helped write the legislation that would allow the reimportation of \nprescription drugs on a much broader basis, in a manner that is \ndetermined to be safe, where we would actually require Internet sites \nto be registered and inspected. But let me talk about that in just a \nmoment.\n\n  Mr. President, I have kept in my desk here in the Senate something I \nwant to show by consent. These are a couple of bottles of Lipitor. \nLipitor is, I think, the most common and perhaps the most popular \ncholesterol-lowering drug. These two bottles contain 20-milligram \ntablets of Lipitor. As you can see, the bottles of Lipitor are \nidentical, with the exception of the color--one is blue and one is red \non the label. Both of these bottles of Lipitor tablets were made in \nIreland. They put some in this bottle, they put some in this bottle, \nand then they start sending them around. They sent this bottle to the \nUnited States, and they sent this bottle to Canada.\n  Now, understand this: This is an FDA-approved drug, produced in an \nFDA-approved plant in Ireland, sent to our country, sent to Canada--the \nsame pill, put in the same bottle, made in the same place, FDA-\napproved. Difference? Well, one has a red label, one has a blue label. \nAnd there is another very big difference: one costs twice as much. \nThere is a 96-percent higher price on the one the Americans get to \npurchase. Difference? Well, no difference in the pill, no difference in \nthe bottle; it is just the American consumer gets to pay twice as much. \nNow, why is that the case? Well, I could hold up a dozen bottles of \nmedicine and describe many popular brand names and tell you exactly the \nsame thing.\n  In fact, I will tell you a story. Sitting on a bale of straw once at \nthe farmstead in central North Dakota on a Sunday afternoon, visiting \nwith a group of people, was an 82-, 84-year-old farmer. I was in the \nfarmyard visiting with some farmers at an afternoon stop, and this old \ncodger, a wonderful old guy, said: ``One of the problems me and the \nMrs. have had--yes, that is what he said--``One of the problems me and \nthe Mrs. have had is being able to afford prescription drugs. My wife \nhas been fighting breast cancer for a long time. For the last 3 or 4 \nyears, she has been fighting breast cancer. And do you know what? Every \n3 months we have had to drive to Canada to buy Tamoxifen to fight her \nbreast cancer. Why do we do that? Because we save 80 percent on the \ncost, and that is the only way we can afford to buy the medicine, the \nTamoxifen for my wife to fight her breast cancer.''\n  Isn't that something? This guy sitting on a bale of straw, talking to \nme about what he has to do every 3 months to be able to afford the \nmedicine his wife needs to fight breast cancer.\n  Now, that is Tamoxifen. We pay, in some cases, 2 times more or 3 \ntimes more for the same medicine, so we then have a woman fighting \ncancer and then fighting the issue of having to pay 2 or 3 times as \nmuch for the medicine.\n  Now, first of all, this is unfair. There is no circumstance under \nwhich we ought to ask the American people to pay the highest drug \nprices in the world for FDA-approved drugs. It is not fair, and it \nshould not happen.\n  Now, how does it happen that they can enforce this, the \npharmaceutical industry can enforce this? Well, they have a law that \nsays the only ability to import drugs into this country is by the \npharmaceutical manufacturer itself, the company itself. They are the \nones who are able to import. Now, I just mention to you that as a \nmatter of practice, they allow a personal supply of drugs to come \nacross the border for about 90 days' worth of drugs. They do that. But, \notherwise, if you are a licensed pharmacist or a wholesaler and you buy \nan FDA-approved drug, you cannot bring it into this country.\n  By contrast, let me just describe this: 40 percent of the active \ningredients in prescription drugs in this country come from China and \nIndia. Forty percent of the active ingredients in our prescription \ndrugs come from China and India.\n  Let me tell you another statistic that I think is interesting. In \nthis country, we had 1,200-plus inspections of pharmaceutical plants \nthat are producing medicines for the American people--1,200 \ninspections. Forty percent of the active ingredients for our \nprescription drugs comes from China\n\n[[Page S12965]]\n\nand India, and we have had, in 2006, 16 inspections in China and 62 \ninspections in India--1,222 inspections in the United States. Isn't \nthat interesting?\n  I tell you all that as a bit of history just to say this issue of \nprescription drugs is not new. A bipartisan group of us has worked for \na long while on this issue, and we are going to win this issue. It has \ntaken us longer than we had hoped, but we are going to win this issue \nbecause it is not fair for the American people to be charged the \nhighest prices in the world for prescription drugs.\n  We have so far not been able to prevail, not because someone comes to \nthe floor of the Senate and thumbs their suspender and tugs in their \ntrousers and puffs out like a puff adder and says: I stand up here for \nthe pharmaceutical industry; the American people ought to be charged \nthe highest price in the world. Nobody has ever done that. There are \nother ways to try to derail legislation like this. But, ultimately, I \nthink we will win. We have a wide bipartisan group of Senators who \nbelieve we must fix this. Now, how do we fix it? We fix it in a way \nthat allows the reimportation of prescription drugs only from FDA-\napproved plants, only in circumstances where we apply pedigrees and lot \nnumbers so you can track it back. For example, you could not import \nfrom an Internet site unless that Internet site had been inspected and \ncertified to make sure this is a safe source from which to order \nprescription drugs.\n  We have a piece of legislation we believe--and almost everyone who \nhas testified in hearings believes--solves all of those problems, \nincluding dramatically increasing the security of all the other issues \nthat are now being complained about with respect to counterfeit drugs. \nHow does it happen we have counterfeit drugs? Well, it happens because \nwe do not have enough inspections. We do not have enough attention to \nthese things. We do not have a pedigree requirement. There are a number \nof things our legislation would require. But at that point, we would \nallow the American people to have access to this market and be able to \nshop for an FDA-approved drug from a country in which they pay one-\nhalf, one-fourth, and in some cases one-tenth the price the American \nconsumer is charged.\n  So let me say, I do not object to the Vitter amendment. I would hope \nthey would just take it. It has been offered to other issues. I would \njust say, however, that it really does not do much because it is saying \nto the agency: Don't do what you are not doing. I do not have objection \nto that. But I do want to say this: There is a serious approach with \nrespect to prescription drug issues that we need to get about the \nbusiness of dealing with, and we are trying very hard to get it to the \nfloor and get it passed. We will get that done at some point soon, in \nmy judgment.\n  Having said that, I would like to offer an amendment to the \nunderlying bill. Before I do, I think this is not only an obligation \nbut an opportunity for me to say to Senator Harkin and Senator Specter \nand others who have worked on the legislation that I think they have \ndone an awfully good job in putting together legislation that invests \nin people's lives and invests in the health of this country, and I \nappreciate their work a lot. So I just want to say thanks. This is a \nbig piece of legislation. It is hard to put together. It is not an easy \njob to carry this to the floor of the Senate, so thanks for what they \nhave done.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3335 to Amendment No. 3325\n\n  Mr. President, if there is an amendment pending, I ask unanimous \nconsent that the pending amendment be set aside so I might send an \namendment to the desk.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered. The pending amendment is set aside.\n  The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3335 to amendment No. 3325.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To increase funding for the State Heart Disease and Stroke \n  Prevention Program of the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention)\n\n       On page 59, line 22, insert before the semicolon the \n     following: ``, of which $5,000,000 shall be made available to \n     the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as an \n     additional amount to make grants under the State Heart \n     Disease and Stroke Prevention Program''.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this issue is not a large issue in the \ncontext of the bill that has been brought to the floor of the Senate--\nit deals with $5 million of resources--but I want to talk just for a \nfew moments about it. It deals with the issue of heart disease and \nstroke.\n  There is no one in this Chamber, I expect, who has not been affected \nby heart disease in dramatic ways. I lost a beautiful young daughter to \nheart surgery, and I think of her every day. I have dedicated a lot of \nmy time and interest in working with the American Heart Association and \nmany others to find the resources to continue to invest in the research \nand unlock the mysteries of this terrible disease.\n  It is estimated that about 80 million American adults--1 in 3 males \nand females--suffer from heart disease. It is estimated that an \nAmerican dies from cardiovascular disease every 35 seconds in this \ncountry. It has a very steep price tag. I know it. My family knows it. \nPerhaps, I would guess, every Member of the Senate knows it from having \nlost a friend, an acquaintance, a family member. The medical expenses \nattributable to heart disease in this country are about $430 billion a \nyear, including lost productivity. But the good news is that this is \none of those diseases where we have made substantial progress. In the \npast 50 years, the fight against heart disease and stroke has been \npretty remarkable.\n  I recall Senator Harkin, and myself, and Senator Specter--I think \nthere were five or six or seven of us who decided we were going to \ndouble the investment in the National Institutes of Health. As I \nrecall, about then we were funding it at around $12 billion a year. A \ngroup of us decided: What better investment in this country's future \nthan to decide to double the amount of money at the National Institutes \nof Health to research and to discover opportunities to cure these \nterrible diseases and treat these awful diseases. I am so proud of what \nhas been done. It is pretty remarkable.\n  I heard this morning at a hearing over in the Commerce Committee \nsomething I have heard so often that I am so sick and tired of. One of \nour colleagues said there is nothing the Federal Government does that \nis really worth anything, nothing the Federal Government manages that \never works out.\n  Well, let me tell you something. Dr. Francis Collins is one of the \nsignificant people who engaged in something that, by the way, came from \nearmarked funding, started here in the U.S. Congress, right here in the \nU.S. Senate, the Human Genome Project. Do you know that? As a result of \nthe Human Genome Project, we now have unlocked the mysteries of the \ngenetic code. We now, for the first time, have an owner's manual for \nthe human body. Do you know what that means? Well, not a lot of people \nunderstand it every day, but every single day, scientists and \nresearchers are understanding those genetic codes and making giant \nstrides in beginning to find cures for diseases.\n  Dr. Francis Collins came back from Cambridge, England, about, oh, \nmaybe 2 months ago, and I saw him at Dulles Airport when he landed. He \nhad gone for a conference in England about how the researchers were \nusing the genetic information from the Human Genome Project. He said: I \nthought it was going to take much, much longer. What is going on now is \nbreathtaking in using the Human Genome Project to find the opportunity \nto treat and to cure some of these diseases. He said it is \nbreathtaking.\n  That is the Federal Government. This is a civil servant, by the way. \nAs to the research that is going on at NIH, these are people on the \nFederal payroll. So to my colleagues who think nothing works, let me \njust tell you something: There is only one place on Earth where the \nHuman Genome Project reached success. And, yes, it was a collaboration, \nbut we did it. It is going to improve lives, and it is going to unlock\n\n[[Page S12966]]\n\nthe mysteries of terrible diseases. It was a good thing to do.\n  But my point is, Senator Harkin and Senator Specter were two--and I \nthink Senator Feinstein--and I was one who decided we were going to \ndouble the research funding at the National Institutes of Health. Guess \nwhat that has done for this country. It allows me to stand here and say \nwe are making great progress on heart disease. We really are. The \nsurvival rates for cancer are up. So we are making progress.\n  The reason I wanted to offer this amendment is this amendment deals \nwith heart disease and stroke. We know the risk factors for heart \ndisease and stroke. We know if you understand the risk factors, you can \nsubstantially reduce the risk of heart disease and stroke--by not \nsmoking, by maintaining a healthy weight, and avoiding diabetes, high \nblood pressure, high cholesterol. We know you can do that. In fact, by \ntaking these steps, individuals often can add 10 years to their lives. \nSo we have made some progress by making investments. There is a long \nway to go. We have 105 million Americans who have high cholesterol and \n72 million Americans have high blood pressure, so we have to do a much \nbetter job of educating the public about cardiovascular disease. That \nis the goal of what is called the State Heart Disease and Stroke \nPrevention Program at CDC.\n\n  What I have offered, very simply, as I close, is a $5 million \naddition to the State Heart Disease and Stroke Prevention Program at \nCDC. It is a program that works. We know it works. It needs this \nadditional funding to make it more widely available. This initiative \nwill help States create the programs, the private-public sector \npartnerships, that will help individuals in controlling blood pressure, \nlowering cholesterol, and learning the signs and symptoms of heart \ndisease and stroke.\n  This is a program that we know works. I am hoping that finding an \noffset, which I have suggested in my amendment, would allow us to \naccept the amendment. I did not intend to take quite this length of \ntime, but I needed only to say to Senator Harkin and Senator Specter \nhow much I appreciate their work, and my hope is that having highly \ncomplimented them, they will be motivated to accept this amendment. I \ncompliment them even if they do not accept it, but I have high hopes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from North Dakota for \nhis longstanding effort to give our consumers a better shake when it \ncomes to drug prices in this country. I also thank him for all of his \nhelp and support over the years for funding for NIH. I know of his \nintense interest, of course, in heart disease. The amendment is a good \namendment. It is one I can support. We are trying to work it out now, \nof course, in terms of the offset. Our staffs will be working on it and \nhopefully we will be able to have that worked out.\n  Hopefully we can set this amendment aside for right now and move on \nto other amendments, but I assure my friend from North Dakota we will \nget this worked out one way or the other.\n  Also, on the Vitter amendment, I understand we don't have a clearance \non that either at this time, so I ask to set that aside also so we can \nmove on with other amendments.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3336 to Amendment No. 3325\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \npending amendment be set aside, and I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Feinstein], for herself \n     and Mr. Kyl, proposes an amendment numbered 3336 to amendment \n     No. 3325.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To provide funding for a feasibility study on the child abuse \n                         and neglect registry)\n\n       On page 64, line 5, insert before the period the following: \n     ``Provided further, That $500,000 shall be available to \n     complete a feasibility study for a National Registry of \n     Substantiated Cases of Child Abuse or Neglect, as described \n     in section 633(g) of the Adam Walsh Child Protection and \n     Safety Act of 2006 (Public law 109-248), and the Secretary of \n     Health and Human Services shall submit the report described \n     in section 633(g)(2) of such Act not later than 1 year after \n     date of enactment of this Act''.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, let me quickly give the background on \nthis. In May of 2007, Senator Kyl, Senator Dole, Senator Boxer, Senator \nLott, and myself sent a letter to Michael Leavitt, the Secretary of \nHHS. We pointed out that the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act \nwas passed in July of 2006. Pursuant to that act, there were to be two \nregistries set up. The first registry was to be located at the \nDepartment of Justice and it would require the establishment of a \nnational sex offender registry which would track details of convicted \nsex offenders and make the information electronically available to \nauthorities in all jurisdictions, and even the public at large. This \nregistry is up and functioning.\n  The second registry authorized by the new law was a national registry \nof substantiated cases of child abuse and neglect. That was directed to \nbe located at the Department of Health and Human Services. This \nregistry is a different but equally vital resource intended for child \nprotection authorities only. Believe it or not, each State already \ncollects information on substantiated cases of abuse and neglect, but \nonce an investigation is under way, adult perpetrators of violence or \nneglect on children need only to move to another State to escape, and \nthis is the difficult part, because there may be no trace, no record \nkept that the new State can easily access. In this way, some children \nmay never escape abuse in their own home, because the offender can \nsimply move.\n  Essentially what we have in this amendment is a request for funding \nof $500,000 to complete the necessary feasibility study which is the \nfirst step to the establishment of a national child abuse registry. I \nhave spoken to the chairman of the committee, Senator Harkin. I submit \nthis on behalf of Senator Kyl and myself. I haven't had a chance to \ntalk to the others--Senators Boxer, Lott, and Dole--but I am sure they \nwould be associated with this as well. It is $500,000 for the \nfeasibility study, and my hope is it can be accepted.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from California again \nfor her championing this issue for a long time. This amendment from \nSenator Feinstein will provide funds for a feasibility study so no \noffset is needed since funds are set aside within the existing total \nfor HHS general departmental management. The Adam Walsh Child \nProtection Safety Act of 2006 required the Secretary of HHS to create \nan electronic national registry of substantiated cases of child abuse \nand neglect. They have not yet created that registry. There have been \nsome problems that have been raised about this, and the feasibility \nstudy amendment Senator Feinstein has offered will address several \nimplementation concerns regarding the establishment of the registry.\n  So again, I support the amendment. We can accept it. I believe it has \nbeen cleared on both sides, so we will accept the amendment.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank the chairman and ranking \nmember. It is my understanding that--we were told, at least--HHS \ncouldn't do this because they didn't have the money, so this would make \nthat money available and hopefully we will get it. So I thank the \nSenator very much.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes, the $500,000 will get the job done.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there further debate on the \namendment?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3336) was agreed to.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S12967]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I know the Senator from Alabama \nis going to speak. He was kind enough to let me make these comments \nsince we are on the Labor-HHS appropriations bill in the field of \nhealth. There are a lot of provisions in this appropriations bill that \nare absolutely necessary.\n  On the subject of health, we have a critical vote that is being taken \ntomorrow in the House of Representatives. It is on the question of the \noverride of the President's veto of the Children's Health Insurance \nProgram. This is a plan that was established about 10 years ago, \nrecognizing that there are children whose health care needs are not \npaid for by Medicaid because their parents earn too much money to \nqualify for Medicaid but whose family incomes for those children are \nsuch that they are not high enough for the family to afford health \ninsurance for their children.\n  What is the cost to society down the road if children's health is not \naddressed in those early years and medical complications are manifest \nin later years? Ultimately, the cost to society overall is much \ngreater. So it makes good common sense, even good common financial \nsense, that we try to address health care needs for children, and that \nis an appropriate role for the Federal Government to assist if the \nparents of those children cannot afford that health care.\n  That is what the Children's Health Insurance Program, CHIP, is all \nabout. There are different people who handle it different ways in \ndifferent States. In my State of Florida, we recognized this was a \nproblem, and we set up what was called the Healthy Kids Program under \nFederal law, of which there was a program to expand health insurance \ndistributed through the schools so we had a point of contact--with an \neligibility of the child according to their eligibility in the School \nLunch Program--which was a determination of whether the child met that \nfamily income level. It was a tremendously successful program before \nthis Federal program was ever set up 10 years ago.\n  Now we are at the moment of truth of whether we are going to \nreauthorize this program and whether we are going to expand it.\n  There are, for example, in my State of Florida, 700,000 children who \nare not covered by health insurance. This new program of expansion to \ncover the 6.6 million currently enrolled kids, plus another 3.2 million \nkids--a modest increase--is only going to cover about 350,000 to \n400,000 more in my State of those 700,000. It is not going to get all \nthe kids, but at least it is a step in the right direction.\n  Back in that early program, before this Federal program was set up, I \nwas the chairman of the board of the Healthy Kids Corporation that \nreached these children. Time after time, we would have parents come to \nus in tears to what this program had done for that child who had this \nor that malady and that because they had health insurance, in a lot of \ncases, through preventive care, they diagnosed that malady and got the \nproper treatment for the child.\n  There is nothing like the agony of a parent who cannot provide the \nhealth care for their child because they cannot financially afford it, \nand that is what this program, the Children's Health Insurance Program, \nset out to do.\n  In the course of the debate on this legislation, and if the House of \nRepresentatives tomorrow overrides the veto, it is going to come to us. \nI think we have the number of votes in the Senate to override. There \nwill be a lot of speeches about the legislation. It is amazing to me \nthe number of misstatements that have been made about this bill and the \nlikes of respected Senators, such as Senator Grassley of Iowa and \nSenator Hatch of Utah, have come to this Chamber and pointed out that \nmisinformation and those misstatements about this bill. There are \nmisstatements even coming out of the White House in the veto message.\n  This legislation does not try to substitute adults for children. The \nwhole program is about providing insurance for children. Of the 6.6 \nmillion children who are currently enrolled under CHIP, 91 percent of \nthem are in families with incomes at or below 200 percent of the \npoverty level. That is approximately at or below $40,000 of income for \na family of four.\n  It simply does not provide--and I will not go into the details--this \nis not a program for adults. About the only adults who are going to get \nsome care under this legislation are pregnant women. It will allow the \nStates the option of providing coverage to pregnant women, but the \npregnant women are the very women who are about to have the child, and \nwe want to make sure she has the help in order to deliver a healthy \nbaby.\n  These scare stories people throw up about this being for adults--as a \nmatter of fact, the reform legislation cracks down on a lot of the \npotential eligibility that the States were allowed to get waivers in \norder to cover adults. This stops a lot of that practice.\n  Contrary to what I have heard other people saying, this legislation \ndoes not provide insurance for families that make over $80,000 a year.\n  It becomes clear, it seems to this Senator, that it is common sense \nthat when it comes to children's health, that is in everybody's \ninterest. No matter whether you come from a red State or a blue State, \nwhether you sit on that side of the aisle or this side of the aisle, \nhealthy children is the commonsense interest for us to have for all of \nAmerica.\n  I certainly look forward to the House providing an override, and if, \nfor some reason, they do not provide that override of the President's \nveto and we get it, that we can do the override, and then we are going \nto have to continue to work to ensure that we achieve a reauthorization \nof this bill that puts the health of our children ahead of partisan \npolitics.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3324\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I wish to take a few moments now and \ncall up my amendment. I wish to make some comments about amendment No. \n3324. It is an important amendment that deals with an issue that is too \noften overlooked, and I will share my thoughts about it.\n  The amendment will restore funding to the Office of Labor and \nManagement Standards at the Department of Labor by increasing funding \nat OLMS by $5 million. There is an important principle involved here. \nUnion members should have the same protection of their moneys that \nstockholders have in businesses. In many ways, they deserve better \nprotection than stockholders.\n  The Office of Labor and Management Standards is to union transparency \nand integrity what the SEC, the Securities and Exchange Commission, is \nto corporate accountability. Yet for fiscal year 2008, the Senate \nappropriations bill that is now before the Senate funded the SEC at \n$905 million. That is $12 million above the fiscal year 2007 level and \nat the requested level of the President's budget.\n  The Office of Labor and Management Standards is the only Federal \nagency created to protect rank-and-file union members. It enforces the \nLabor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959, which requires \nfinancial disclosure by labor unions and union officers. It requires \ndisclosure, that is all it does.\n  This office audits, in addition, union books to detect embezzlement \nand other thefts of union members' dues and ensures fair elections of \nunion officers.\n  The mission of the OLMS, referred to on this chart, is to provide \nunion financial transparency; that is, it would require the officers to \ntell their members how they are spending their money. That is all it \ndoes. It does not tell them what they must spend it on. It requires \nthat they give a fair report of the money they obtain from their \nmembers.\n  It has as its mission to protect union financial integrity. As I will \npoint out, we have had quite a problem with that issue over the years.\n  It will safeguard union democracy. That is fair elections in unions.\n  All those points are important issues. Anyone close to this issue for \nthe last 50 years knows we have had constant problems in this area. \nThis is popular with the union members and is the right thing for us to \ndo.\n  This office has been funded at $47.8 million, and it has shown big \nresults. It\n\n[[Page S12968]]\n\nis a small agency that is showing big results, and I will talk about \nthat point.\n  From 2001 to 2007, OLMS investigations have resulted in 796 \nconvictions--that is since 2001--and have resulted in court-ordered \nrestitutions to unions and to union members of $101 million. Those are \npretty good results.\n  I am going to explain in a moment how they are vastly underfunded \nalready. We need more. I will go into that issue in a moment.\n  Since 2001, OLMS has recovered, as I noted, $101 million. I doubt \nthat is all that was stolen. No doubt it is not all that was stolen. \nThis is what was actually ordered and recovered in restitution. I would \nsay that, by any standard, $101 million is a lot of money.\n\n  Since 2001, the work by OLMS has resulted in convictions and \nrestitution, so we are talking about an agency that is working on \nbehalf of the American worker, ensuring the American worker knows how \nthe union dues they have contributed are being spent. When it is clear \ntheir money is being abused, OLMS works to fairly return the money to \nthem; this is a good program and an important program.\n  Embezzlement is not something the American people support. We as a \nCongress are focusing on transparency in a lot of different areas, and \nit is embarrassing that our colleagues have decided to cut funding in \nthe one office in the whole Federal Government, the only one, that is \nrequired to carry out this job with regard to our unions.\n  Let me show this chart. As a Federal prosecutor myself for a number \nof years, I have to say I am impressed with these numbers. Since 2001, \n95 percent of indictments that have been produced as a result of OLMS \ninvestigations have resulted in convictions. That is a pretty good \nsuccess rate. So it is clear they are not picking on people who have \nmade honest mistakes or where honest errors are occurring and people \nare doing what they are supposed to do as union leaders.\n  In fact, they have offices strategically placed around the country. \nEvery union in the country has OLMS employees who live within driving \ndistances of their offices. They are ready to help the union leaders \nfigure out how to complete any required forms and disclosures. They are \nprepared to assist in any problems that arise in union elections. They \nare a resource and were not created as a punishing tool for unions.\n  We are not, as a part of this amendment, and those who support this \namendment, out to kick labor unions around. We are trying to make sure \nthey comply with the law and ensure that the rank-and-file members have \nsomeone watching out for them and their money. It is clear from these \nstatistics that there is still a need for oversight, sunlight, and \ntransparency. That is clear. We have a problem out there and it still \nexists. It is painfully clear we need to be monitoring union officials \nwho are taking bribes--and some have been convicted of that--who are \ninvolved in racketeering and stealing hard-earned money from working \nAmericans.\n  Since 2001, OLMS has been able to audit only 3,275 of the 26,000 \nunions on record. They are supposed to be auditing these unions, but, \nin fact, since 2001, they have only been able to audit 12\\1/2\\ percent \nof the unions on record. I have to tell you, if you do more audits, you \nare going to have less criminal activity. It is when people know they \nare not being watched, know they are not likely to be audited, that \nthey take chances and make mistakes and get themselves in trouble and \ncost their union members a lot of money.\n  OLMS, in the year 2000, only did 204 audits out of well over 20,000 \nunions. That is the equivalent of a union being audited once every 133 \nyears. Last year, OLMS did 736 audits, which translates into an audit \nevery 33 years. So we are doing better, but we are still a long way \nfrom a regular audit program.\n  Now, with the $2 million reduction in funding--and you have a cost-\nof-living increase with salaries and electricity and all those kinds of \nthings that tend to go up--if you have taken a flat net reduction of $2 \nmillion in funding, there will be approximately 350 fewer audits each \nyear. That is about half.\n  Shouldn't we be seeking more audits, considering that from the 3,267 \naudits that were completed between 2000 and 2007 there came 827 \nindictments and 796 convictions? I think so. I think this is a good \ninvestment for our country.\n  Now, in the very few reports OLMS audited, evidence was found in many \nof them that warranted other action. In my home State of Alabama, 41 \naudits were completed, and from that came 20 convictions; that is, \nalmost half the audits resulted in some conviction.\n  Here in the District of Columbia, 30 audits were completed, resulting \nin 27 convictions. One of those was the Washington Teachers Union. Let \nme give that example. On October 23 of last year, in the U.S. District \nCourt, Cheryl Martin, the daughter of a former Washington Teachers \nUnion executive assistant to the president, Gwendolyn Hemphill, was \nsentenced to a probationary sentence--which she should be most thankful \nfor, it appears to me--for her role in an embezzlement scheme which \ndefrauded the union of $4.6 million. Right here, just last October. She \npled guilty to conspiracy to laundering money and for assisting her \nhusband Michael Martin in laundering more than $500,000 in Washington \nTeachers Union members' funds, most of which were funneled back to \nHemphill and the then WTU president, Barbara Bullock.\n  Well, that is quite a lot--$4.6 million stolen from only about 5,000 \nunion members. That is about $1,000 a member. This isn't chickenfeed, \nit is real money. I have heard stories of how some of those very same \nteachers who lost their money through union embezzlement are the same \nones buying pencils, books, and supplies for their students out of \ntheir own pockets. So despite what some might say, convicting people \nwho steal from unions and seeking restitution is not anti-union \nactivity; it is pro-union activity.\n  There are many cases such as this that need transparency to come to \nlight. Since 2001, the administration, President Bush, and Secretary \nChao have worked hard to reach consensus on how best to work with the \nunions to get voluntary compliance on disclosure forms that the law \nrequires them to make. But, still, many unions are not reporting as \nthey are required to do. This chart shows, unfortunately, that the \ncompliance rate for unions is only 64 percent, with 36 percent failing \nto comply.\n  That is an unacceptable number. If this were the Securities and \nExchange Commission, we would not accept the fact that our stockholders \nand employees are placed at risk because those entities, those \ncorporations, are not being monitored. If it were the Federal Election \nCommission and we didn't submit our financial disclosures on time, \npeople would be very critical. Somebody would probably ask that we step \ndown from our offices as we would be committing a violation of the law. \nHowever, we don't seem to be as willing to protect our workers and the \nmoney they pay in to their unions.\n  The way this works here, we have public access when these forms are \nreported, the ones that do, and you can call or go to the Department of \nLabor in person or get online information at www.unionreports.gov and \nreview these reports.\n  Now, union members care about this. It is most valuable information \nto union members--those people in the town who know the community, they \nknow the company, they know the union, they know their coworkers, the \nstewards, the union reps, the employees. By law they are required to \nhave this information to see what is being done with the money. Union \nmembers want to know how their dues are being spent, and it is clear \nthey are looking to see how their money is spent.\n  Between May of 2006 and May of 2007, in the past year, there were \n767,000 hits on the OLMS Web site, an average of over 2,000 a day. \nPeople are looking to see how their bosses are spending their money. \nAccording to a 2004 Zogby poll, 71 percent of union members want \ndisclosure. They want to know how their funds are being spent. The \nfoundations of this transparency were established in the 1950s when the \nLabor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959 was passed.\n  Transparency and sunlight--full disclosure of financial gains and \nlosses. These are the tenets that Senator Kennedy, John Kennedy, former \nPresident Kennedy, and the McClellan Commission report, set in place 50 \nyears ago to\n\n[[Page S12969]]\n\nprotect union members, our hard-working Americans, from corruption, \nbribery, coercion, or maybe worse.\n  The data shows the actions OLMS is taking in pursuing corruption are \nspot on. They are doing what they should be doing; they just don't have \nenough resources now to do it. They certainly don't need a cut in their \nbudget.\n  When President Bush took office and Secretary Elaine Chao was \nappointed to be the Secretary of Labor--and she has done a fantastic \njob, in my opinion--they quickly learned that most union members didn't \neven know they had rights or what agency would enforce those rights if \nthey were abused. Now there are posters placed at every union workplace \nstating clearly the rights and duties of unions and employees.\n  The funding increase proposed in this amendment, which I will be \noffering, I believe is warranted as OLMS is showing substantive results \nthat are benefitting rank-and-file members, and providing valuable \nresources to union leaders as so many of them work to uphold the law, \nbut they need assistance in doing that correctly. In fact, the \nDepartment of Labor has gone to great lengths to ensure that labor \nunion officials have all the help they need and that the reporting \nrequirements are reasonable.\n  To make the rules fair, you must sometimes work out problems you have \nand decrease the burden. Over the years, the Secretary has consulted \nwith labor leaders, has made the forms easier to understand, has worked \nclosely with the AFL-CIO and other unions to create exceptions, \nexemptions, and to simplify reporting requirements where possible. But \nyou have to know where the money is being spent ultimately. DOL last \nyear added examples and further guidance to one of the forms that is \nrequired, the LM 30.\n  OLMS has been funded below the requested level for the last several \nyears. This is beginning to accumulate in a way that is hurting their \nability to meet their needs. This is the level requested by the \nPresident to keep this agency on track, and we have been seeing a \ndecline in funding. Last year, the budget was $47.753 million. This \nyear, the committee bill cuts it by $2 million to $45.737 million. With \nall due respect, I think that is a bad decision. We have a lot of \nincreases in this agency. It is a very important agency, but that is a \nmajor reduction when you see it has continued to fall behind what we \nprojected their growth to be.\n  This agency has seen difficult times. It does seem to be an issue \nthat is political, I have to say. During the Clinton administration, \nOLMS was cut to only 260 employees. Understaffed, the division was \npurposefully and expressly prohibited from even carrying out the \nenforcement duties the law required. This administration has at least \nattempted to restore resources to OLMS so it can carry out its mission. \nEven so, the President's fiscal year 2008 staffing request for only 369 \nFTEs--that is full-time personnel--is still below the 1985 level, which \nwas 463.\n  Now, as you can see, the trend has turned away from providing even \nthose resources, resulting in a more substantial cut. It indicates to \nme that if we maintain this level, this Congress is not interested in \nseeing that this agency, the only one in Government empowered and given \nthe responsibility of enforcing integrity in unions, would be reduced \nin its ability to do so, to a precarious level indeed.\n\n  In fact, OLMS was the only enforcement agency, the only one in the \nLabor Department, that received a budget cut during the congressional \nmarkup of that bill. It is the only one in this bill on the floor now, \nthe only office at this agency, that got a cut. The Appropriations \nCommittee increased the Department's overall budget by $937 million \nabove what the President requested for the Department of Labor. The \nonly cut in the Department's budget, which totals $10 billion, was an \n$2 million cut for OLMS.\n  Senator John F. Kennedy was instrumental in passing this act in 1959 \nand the act says that a member:\n\n      . . . must have access to union financial records and has \n     the right to recover misappropriated union assets on behalf \n     of a union when the union fails to do so.\n\n  That is what the act called for. Senator Kennedy spoke on it \naggressively. Then Senator Kennedy, later President Kennedy, said:\n\n       The racketeers will not like it, the antilabor extremists \n     around the country will not like it, but I am confident the \n     American people, and the overwhelmingly honest rank and file \n     union members, will benefit from this measure for many years \n     to come.\n\n  That was in 1959, almost 50 years ago. He said they will benefit from \nthis law for many years to come, and I submit they have: 796 crooks \nhave been convicted, $101 million in restitution has been received in \nthe last 6 years.\n  Senator Robert Byrd, a champion of union rights who, I have to tell \nyou--isn't it something? is still a Member of this Senate--he was \nactive in this debate. During that time, he got a letter from a member \nof the UMWA in West Virginia. They sent him a letter condemning his \nvote for it.\n  Senator Byrd, who still retains great respect in the union \nmembership--and leadership, too, for that matter--this is how he \nresponded on the floor of the Senate:\n\n       The bill which passed the Congress will not hurt honest \n     unions, and it will give added protection to the rank-and-\n     file members in the unions. Honest union leaders have nothing \n     to fear from the legislation . . . the corruption and \n     racketeering that have been revealed in the fields of both \n     labor and management made it imperative that some kind of \n     legislation be enacted.\n\n  I applaud the efforts of OLMS to pursue those who are misusing their \npower over our hard-working union members, those who are using that \nmoney for their personal benefit, abusing their position by squandering \nthe hard-earned dollars of working Americans.\n  Let me mention this story about the United Transportation Union. I \nthink it highlights what can happen when there is no consistent \noversight. I have a photograph that was taken in the course of an \ninvestigation that shows a person handing over money in a corrupt \ntransaction. What is happening here is that the money is being given by \na designated UTU legal counsel named Victor Bieganowski. The person \nreceiving the money was John Russell Rookard, 58, of Olalla, WA, a top \nspecial assistant to Byron Alfred Boyd. Mr. Boyd was president of the \nUTU at the time.\n  This picture shows the handing over of the money. There was an \nundercover agent working there and they recorded the deal.\n  In 2004, Boyd, the international president of UTU, the nation's \nlargest railroad operating union, pleaded guilty to participating in a \nbribery scheme involving Houston lawyers. Union officials extorted \nbribes from the lawyers in exchange for access to union members who \nmight have been injured so they could file lawsuits.\n  As a March 12, 2004, Houston Chronicle article explains, Byron Alfred \nBoyd, Jr., 57, of Seattle, is the last of four officials of the United \nTransportation Union to plead guilty--he admitted that he did it--in a \nplan to extort bribes from the lawyers in exchange for access to \ninjured union members. He admitted using the bribes obtained from the \nlawyers, extorted from lawyers, to gain control of the union. He used \nit for his political strength too. He persuaded former union president \nCharles Leonard Little, 69, to resign in exchange for $100,000 and a \nnew pickup, so Boyd could assume the post. He wanted to be president of \nthe union. He goes to the former President and offers him $100,000 and \na new pickup to resign so he could be president.\n  Mr. Little should have been a little bit more careful before he \nresigned because when he resigned he never got his money, but he was \nout of office. Little also pleaded guilty last year, as did the former \nunion insurance director, Ralph John Dennis, 51. The man in this \npicture, John Russell Rookard, 58, of Olalla, WA, a top assistant to \nBoyd, also pleaded guilty. The indictment alleged that some union \npresidents determined which lawyers were to be included on the union's \ndesignated counsel list. That position was coveted and very valuable \nbecause he gave those lawyers easier access to get clients from union \nmembers who might have been injured. They would therefore be able to \nmake a lot of money off lucrative personal injury lawsuits.\n  At the time of the indictments, 56 lawyers were on the list, \nincluding 6 in Texas. Unfortunately, we have example after example of \nthis kind of disregard for doing the right thing with the money of our \nhardworking Americans.\n  On August 31, let me note, Judy A. Thurman, former treasurer of \nFederated Independent Texas Union Local\n\n[[Page S12970]]\n\n900, pled guilty in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District \nof Texas to embezzlement of union funds totaling $164,268.50. That is a \nlot of money.\n\n  We also have election violations. Assisting labor unions when \nproblems arise in elections is an OLMS responsibility. One union \nofficer generated over 300 phony ballots using the union's computer. He \nmarked the ballots for himself--who else, I suppose--placed them in \nfalse return envelopes and returned them to the union, where they were \nsubsequently counted in the election. Those kinds of things are hard \nfor an average union member to understand, ascertain or prove. An \nagency such as this, that knows how to investigate and prove these \nthings, can make sure our elections in unions are legitimate.\n  All of us in this Senate know we have to have good staff, and Liz \nStillwell, with me, is very much that. So staff capacity at OLMS is an \nimportant reason I have introduced this amendment. In 1992, staffing at \nOLMS was around 392. During the Clinton administration, it was cut back \nto 260. Today it is back up to 315, which is a little better. As you \ncan see from this chart, the cuts have hit the Department hard. As a \nresult, they are still unable to audit more than 2 to 4 percent of the \ntotal unions each year. Only 12 percent of unions have ever been \naudited. Of those audited, there have been 796 convictions. It tells us \nsomething.\n  Let me say this. I spent most of my professional career as a Federal \nprosecutor. I prosecuted labor cases. But let me say, if you don't want \nto have these convictions, if you don't want to have this kind of theft \nfrom union members, let me tell you how to stop it. Have regular \naudits. Once everybody knows the money is going to be accounted for, \nthat somebody is going to be watching closely, they are not going to \nsteal. It is when there are no controls that people feel they are out \non their own in some town or city or wherever, and nobody is looking, \nthere is lots of money coming through the headquarters there and they \nhave an opportunity to get it and they think no one is going to know \nit--temptation takes over.\n  It will happen to anybody, not just union members or business people; \nit could happen to anybody when that kind of money is lying around. It \nhappens in churches. People steal from churches. They have an \nopportunity and nobody has an ability to watch and account for it. If \nwe want to end this kind of thing and strengthen unions and create a \nbetter reputation and environment, we need to step up prosecutions and \nwe will begin to see a major reduction in crime, fraud, and abuse. That \nis the way it is.\n  Since 1959, when Senators Byrd and Kennedy and other leaders passed \nthe Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act, these priorities \nthat I mentioned have been the guiding standards of this agency. The \nstandards are to promote union democracy, protect union members' funds, \nprotect American workers and fight labor racketeering.\n  This $2 million cut is not aimed at an anti-union agency. It is, I \nhave to say, an act that appears political and it appears it is \nconceding and giving in to union leaders and forgetting the interests \nof union members.\n  I know a lot of the union leadership have complained about this law. \nThey don't want to have to file a reporting document. They don't want \nto have to put it in--36 percent of them are not getting it in on time \nor at all. But who are we representing? I say we ought to represent \nunion members and 71 percent of them want this disclosure; over 700,000 \nlast year checked their union leadership reports on the Web site to see \nhow their money was being spent. What is wrong with that?\n  When it was created by Senators Kennedy and Byrd and others, it was \nnot to shut down unions, it was to shut down theft, waste, fraud, \nabuse, criminal activity. Of around 26,000 unions active today, only 2 \nto 4 percent have been audited each year since 2001; only 12 percent \nhave been audited at all. A quarter of the unions audited, 25 percent, \nhave been found to be in violation of the law; 75 have been correct, \nwere not found in violation. But 25 percent were found in violation. If \nwe did those audits more regularly, we would have fewer problems with \ncompliance, we would have fewer criminal convictions, we would have \nless restitution to have to be paid as a result of theft and abuse of \nthe money.\n  This transparency will help us there. When you turn on the lights, \nyou can actually see what is going on and take action to fix the \nwrongdoing. So I hope somehow we can work through this.\n  I know the managers of this bill have done a tremendous job. They had \nthousands and thousands of people making suggestions on thousands and \nthousands of issues. Then, to have somebody such as me come in and tell \nthem this is what I think you ought to do--one more time, I am sure our \ncolleagues such as Senator Harkin and Specter get tired of everybody's \ncomplaining. But I think we ought to work on this. I think this \nreduction in funding cuts from an agency that is actually doing a good \njob.\n  We ought to encourage that agency to do a better job and actually \nincrease their funding more. So I am asking simply that $5 million be \nput back in, which would bring it a little bit above last year's \nappropriations for the agency so they can at least stay on track of \ninflation and everything to continue at the same level of auditing and \ninvestigating they are now doing. I wish we could do more. Frankly, I \nwish we would. This would be my suggestion.\n  I continue to look forward to perhaps seeing if we could reach some \nsort of accord on this. I ask my colleagues to study it carefully. I \nurge them to vote in support of this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Webb). The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3339 to Amendment No. 3325\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I have an amendment I am offering on \nbehalf of Senator Smith of Oregon. I send it to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nset aside.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Harkin], for Mr. Smith, proposes \n     an amendment numbered 3339 to amendment No. 3325.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To provide a technical correction to suicide prevention \n      grants authorized under the Garrett Lee Smith Memorial Act)\n\n       On page 49, line 19, insert before the period the \n     following: ``Provided further, That Section 520E(b)(2) of the \n     Public Health Service Act shall not apply to funds \n     appropriated under this Act for fiscal year 2008''.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, this is a 1-year technical fix requested \nby Senator Smith. These are the State suicide prevention grants \nauthorized under the Garrett Lee Smith Memorial Act. It is a simple \ntechnical correction to enable HHS to issue youth suicide grants to \nStates this year. It has no cost. It has been cleared by the \nauthorizers on both sides of the aisle, and we are prepared to accept \nthe amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3339) was agreed to.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thought I might take this bit of lag \ntime on the floor while we are waiting for Senators to offer \namendments--which I hope will happen, if there are amendments; I am not \ntrying to encourage any. I am saying if there are\n\n[[Page S12971]]\n\namendments, Members should come and offer them because now is a good \ntime--to talk about the bill and what this debate is all about, why \nthis bill is so important. I say that because the President yesterday \nsent down his policy statement and said he was going to veto the bill \nbecause it spends too much money, that it has to stay within his \nconstraints.\n  I want to make it clear, we stay within our budget, the budget we \nhave, and we have a pay-go budget. We are not adding anything new this \nyear. We are severely constraining spending to get out of the deficit \nhole. I want to compare this bill, what we have done on a bipartisan \nbasis--this appropriations bill passed our committee 26 to 3, strong \nbipartisan support in the subcommittee and full committee--with the \nPresident's budget so that Senators who are thinking of how they are \ngoing to vote on this appropriations bill might have a clearer picture. \nWhat would happen if we did what the President asked, if we just \napproved the President's budget instead of the bill before us? What I \nwant to do is go through it.\n  You can tell a lot about a person's priorities on how they spend \ntheir money. This bill provides a modest increase in programs that help \npeople, especially Americans at the bottom rungs of the ladder. It \nhelps them to lead meaningful, safe, and productive lives. The \nPresident wants to cut those programs. He says we are spending too much \nfor education, for medical research, for job training. Again, look at \nthe amount of money we are talking about. The Senate bill is about $11 \nbillion higher than the President's budget. That is about 1 month in \nIraq; we are talking about a full year--1 month in Iraq versus 1 full \nyear for education, health, job retraining, all the other items.\n  Compared to last year, our Senate bill invests $7.3 billion more than \nlast year on education, health, and labor programs. Again, as part of \nour balanced budget plan, we are within our budget constraints. The \nPresident's budget would cut $3.5 billion from these programs from last \nyear. At the same time, he wants to spend up to almost $10 billion a \nmonth in Iraq.\n  Again, let's look at some of the programs we are talking about; for \nexample, helping the poor. Two of the most important programs in the \nbill are the community services block grants and the social services \nblock grants. States get to use these funds in a wide variety of ways \nto help some of our most disadvantaged citizens. The Senate bill \nprovides $2.4 billion for these two block grants. The President's \nbudget requested a 50-percent cut in these two programs, a 50-percent \ncut from last year to $1.2 billion. So again, when we are talking about \nprograms that help lift people up, we are at $2.4 billion; the \nPresident says he wants to cut it in half to $1.2 billion. That is one \nclear difference in the President's budget and in what we offer.\n  Let's look at medical research. The Senate bill provides another $1 \nbillion for the National Institutes of Health. That is about a 3.5-\npercent increase, and that does not even keep up with biomedical \ninflation. Our bill would increase the number of new research grants by \nabout 400. What does the President's budget do? It would cut NIH by \n$279 million. That would slash the budget by 12 percent below where we \nwere in 2003--going backward. It would cut the number of new research \ngrants by 800. So the President's budget would cut the number of \nresearch grants by 800; our bill would increase it by 400. Members may \nchoose which one they would rather have--the President's budget or the \nSenate bill.\n  Let's look at special education. Three decades ago, when we passed \nthe Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, we said to the States: \nOur goal is for the Federal Government to provide up to 40 percent of \nthe additional cost of mainstreaming kids, getting kids into school \nrather than warehousing them in State institutions or not even giving \nthem an education. We opened the door for kids with disabilities to go \nto school. But we said our goal was to get up to 40 percent of this \nadditional cost. That was 30 years ago. What has happened? I can say \nthat time after time we have had a number of votes on the Senate floor, \nusually a sense-of-the-Senate resolution saying that we have to put \nmore money for special education, we have to get up to that 40 percent. \nThe Senate bill increases the State grants by $450 million to help them \nmeet the needs of the additional cost of educating kids with \ndisabilities. The President's budget slashes $291 million from special \neducation.\n  What is not on this chart is that is going backward. The high point \nwe had was in 2006. In 2006, the Federal Government's percentage of the \nadditional cost was about 18 percent. Last year, it went down to 17 \npercent. Under the President's budget, it would go to 16 percent. This \nmeans a lot to our local schools because if we don't put the money in, \nthere is only one way they can get it, and that is usually through \nlocal property taxes which are unfair in most cases.\n\n  Again, what we are trying to do is to meet our goal, our obligation, \nwhat we said 30 years ago. We put in $450 million, and the President \nwants to cut it by $291 million.\n  Let's look at another program, Head Start, a popular program, one of \nthe great society programs started by Lyndon Johnson. We always hear \nabout how the Great Society failed. No, it didn't. I am sorry. It did \nnot. Here is one of the great examples of the successes of the Great \nSociety; that is, the Head Start Program. We have a lot of data over \nthe years to show that kids who went through Head Start do better in \nelementary school, high school. They go on to lead healthier and more \nproductive lives.\n  In our bill, we expand Head Start services with an increase of $200 \nmillion. The President's budget cuts Head Start by $100 million, which \nwould leave thousands of children behind. The President's budget would \nresult in a cut of over 30,000 slots for children in Head Start \nPrograms. Again, the President's budget goes backward. We are moving \nahead.\n  Let's look at community health centers. One of the things I had \nalways said is that I agreed with President Bush about his goal of \nhaving more community health centers built and having at least one \ncommunity health center in every poor district. I thought that was a \nlaudable goal. I have been supportive of that. Again, the Senate bill \nincreases the Community Health Centers Program by $250 million. The \nPresident neglects the uninsured, people with limited health care \naccess. He just says: Keep it where it is, no increase whatsoever. Yet \nwe know we need to not only open new community health centers--a lot of \nthem are backed up. People want to open new ones, plus the ones that \nare open, because of the increased cost of health services. Medical \ndevices, equipment, and all that have higher expenditures as well. We \nneed to make sure we keep up with funding of community health centers \nthat are open.\n  We are also expanding dental services. One of the most important \nparts of community health centers we have found in the last several \nyears--maybe decade, decade and a half--is the importance of dental \ncare for kids. We have begun to add more and more dental services to \nour community health centers, which has helped a lot of families who \notherwise cannot afford dental care for their children. That requires \nsome extra money as well. We have responded to that by putting in $250 \nmillion. The President keeps it exactly where it is.\n  Ours would increase the Community Health Centers Program from $1.99 \nbillion to $2.2 billion. The President says: Leave it where it is and \nleave a lot of low-income Americans who are uninsured without any \naccess to community health centers.\n  Another provision in our bill is the home energy assistance program, \notherwise known as LIHEAP, the Low Income Home Energy Assistance \nProgram. It is a very successful program. The Senate bill maintains \nfunding. We should have had an increase, but we are in a budget crunch. \nWe couldn't get an increase for it, but at least we held the line. We \nknow energy costs are higher now than they have ever been. What does \nthe President's budget do? It cuts LIHEAP by $379 billion despite \nrecord-high energy prices. The President's budget would reduce the \nnumber of families receiving this assistance by 1.1 million. Again, \nthese are the very low income, in many cases low-income elderly who we \nknow are cutting back on their food, on medicine, and other things to \nbe able to pay heating bills in the wintertime.\n  Another issue that is of importance to all of us is Social Security.\n\n[[Page S12972]]\n\n  As I said earlier, we know--every Senator knows; and you can check \nwith your State offices, and they will tell you--the caseload for \npeople whose disability claims have not been acted on has a backlog of \nseveral months, a year, a year and a half, in trying to get their \ndisability claims approved. Right now, it takes 1\\1/2\\ years--1\\1/2\\ \nyears--to process a hearing request. In the year 2000, it was 200 days. \nIt was 200 days, and now it is a year and a half. The disability claims \nbacklog is about 660,000. That is about a 100,000 increase since 2006.\n  Recognizing this, we have put a $426 million increase into Social \nSecurity for hiring more people, to accelerate the hearings decisions, \nand to try to reduce that disability backlog we have now of 660,000.\n  The President's budget only put in enough money--$300 million--that \nwould allow no hiring, despite the lowest staffing level since 1972. \nWith the baby boom generation hitting the disability-prone years and \nclosing in on retirement, the President's budget would add almost \n100,000 disability claims to the backlog, so we have put in $426 \nmillion to reduce that backlog.\n  Student aid, which is another big part of our bill: The gap between \nthe cost of a 4-year public college and the maximum Pell grant has \nincreased by over $3,000 since 2002. We increased the amount of money \nfor Pell grants to $4,800 to help alleviate that problem. The \nPresident's budget falls short of that by almost $300, bringing it to \n$4,540--again, very short of the amount needed to offset the cost of \nhigher tuition.\n  On competitiveness, there are 7 million unemployed and millions more \nnot working and not looking, as employers move jobs overseas. They hire \nforeign workers to fill jobs. Well, the Senate bill provides $4.8 \nbillion for job training, and career and technical education programs \nto enhance the competitiveness of our workforce.\n  What does the President's budget do? It undermines U.S. \ncompetitiveness with a $1 billion cut--a $1 billion cut--in job \ntraining, a 50-percent cut in career and technical education programs. \nAlmost 8 million high school and college students could see career and \ntechnical education courses disappear because of the President's cuts.\n  That is not all that is in our bill. There is more, but I thought \nthis kind of highlights the difference between the President's budget \nand what we are trying to do in this bill, keeping in mind, again, that \nour bill is a little over $7 billion more than last year--hardly an \ninflationary increase. We have kept within our budget, within our pay-\ngo budget. Yet we have been able to get necessary increases, as I have \noutlined.\n  The President's budget basically says: No. Give me more money to \nspend in Iraq, to the tune of about $12 billion a month. We are saying \nwe only need $11 billion for the entire year, for all the things I \noutlined.\n  I think the choice is clear. I think the choice was clear when we \nwere in subcommittee. It passed our subcommittee unanimously. It passed \nthe full Appropriations Committee, as I said, by a vote of 26 to 3. I \nthink it is a good, bipartisan bill. I hope we can bring it to a close \nhere in the next day or so.\n  I say to my fellow Senators, the floor is open if anyone has any \namendments. As I said, I am not encouraging them, but I know there are \nsome people who do have amendments, and I would hope they might come \nover and offer those amendments.\n  With that, Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3333 To Amendment No. 3325\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 3333.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Dakota [Mr. THUNE], for himself, Ms. \n     Stabenow, Mr. Crapo, and Mr. Conrad, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3333 to amendment No. 3325.\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To provide additional funding for the telehealth activities \n          of the Health Resources and Services Administration)\n\n       On page 79, between lines 4 and 5, insert the following:\n       Sec. __. (a) In addition to any amounts appropriated or \n     otherwise made available under this Act to the Health \n     Resources and Services Administration to carry out programs \n     and activities under the Health Care Safety Net Amendments of \n     2002 (Public Law 107-251) and the amendments made by such \n     Act, and for other telehealth programs under section 330I of \n     the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 254c-14), there \n     shall be made available an additional $6,800,000, to (1) \n     expand support for existing and new telehealth resource \n     centers, including at least 1 resource center focusing on \n     telehomecare; (2) support telehealth network grants, \n     telehealth demonstrations, and telehomecare pilot projects; \n     and (3) provide grants to carry out programs under which \n     health licensing boards or various States cooperate to \n     develop and implement policies that will reduce statutory and \n     regulatory barriers to telehealth.\n       (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, \n     amounts appropriated or otherwise made available under this \n     Act for the administrative and related expenses for \n     departmental management for the Department of Labor, the \n     Department of Health and Human Services, and the Department \n     of Education, shall be reduced on a pro rata basis by \n     $6,800,000.\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I rise today to offer an amendment to \nprovide an increase in funding for the Office for the Advancement of \nTelehealth, under the Health Resources and Services Administration. I \nam pleased to say I am joined in this effort by Senators Stabenow, \nCrapo, and Conrad.\n  I have spent quite a lot of time over the last month debating how to \nincrease access to affordable health care in this country. Opinions \nhave ranged considerably on this topic, but for most of us the goal is \nthe same--it is to find ways at the Federal level to make health care \nmore affordable for our constituents back home. Many of us are also \ntrying to bring more options to rural areas or even urban underserved \nareas where access to care can be challenging.\n\n  One thing that both sides of the aisle can agree on and have agreed \non during my time here is on a very similar amendment, and that is \nincreasing funding for proven technologies such as telehealth.\n  Telehealth is the most effective way to deliver many types of care to \nrural and other populations that have traditionally lacked adequate \nhealth care access. Many Americans do not live near certain specialists \nor they don't live near affordable specialists. This is certainly the \ncase among many small towns in my State of South Dakota.\n  Telehealth bridges the gap between these patients and providers by \nenabling doctors and nurses to remotely care for patients, thereby \nraising the standards of care for underserved populations. Telehealth \nalso increases patient and provider access to medical information and \nimproves training of health care providers. Of course, with increased \naccess to care and less need to travel great distances, patients and \nproviders save money.\n  I wish to share with my colleagues part of a story from an article in \nthe Platte Enterprise, a local South Dakota newspaper, and a subsequent \nletter to the editor back in September dealing with telehealth. There \nare many different medical services that can be provided over long \ndistances through telehealth technology. The Platte Health Center in \nPlatte, SD, already provides some medical specialties through \ntelemedicine, including dermatology and infectious disease. Now they \nwill also be able to provide mental health services.\n  According to the article: Patients can talk to and see a physician on \nthe television screen who in turn can see and talk to them.\n  In a subsequent letter to the editor from a user of these types of \ntelemedicine services, my constituent, Kris Kuipers, describes:\n\n       I recently experienced the use of telemedicine at Platte \n     Health Center Hospital. I thought it was wonderful. One of \n     our local nurses greeted me and explained the operating \n     equipment. It is great because I didn't have to do a thing.\n\n[[Page S12973]]\n\n       I was able to talk with my physician in Sioux Falls who was \n     on the TV screen just like if I were talking to Dr. Jerome \n     Bentz. It was very personable and I didn't have to drive four \n     hours round trip.\n       I am very excited that we have this capability here in town \n     and I hope more physicians will catch on to the advantages of \n     using the telemedicine network equipment. I want to encourage \n     you to tell your out-of-town doctors about our tele-med \n     capabilities at the Platte Health Center Hospital. Maybe by \n     word of mouth, other physicians will be encouraged to use \n     this local alternative as a means of providing health care to \n     our rural communities.\n\n  I hear from local providers and patients such as Kris Kuipers very \noften about the benefits of telehealth to rural communities in my \nState. In South Dakota, telehealth technologies are utilized by our \nthree major hospital networks: Avera, Sanford, and Rapid City Regional. \nAdditionally, many of the rural health clinics who serve the health \ncare needs of some of the smallest communities in our State also \nutilize these technologies. These organizations touch more than 40 \ndifferent communities, large and small across the State.\n  The Office for the Advancement of Telehealth under HRSA is the \nprimary tool of the Federal Government to develop telehealth resources \nand to help local providers to develop these resources.\n  My amendment will provide additional funding to support existing and \nnew telehealth resource centers, including a resource center focused \nspecifically on telehomecare; that is, telemonitoring technologies for \npatients who have to have their vital signs checked in the home. These \nresource centers currently help assist the telehealth community in \nbreaking down barriers to the adoption of telehealth.\n  Additional funding will also support telehealth network grants, pilot \nprojects for the development of telehomecare technologies and grants to \nhelp carry out programs where health licensing boards and States come \ntogether to reduce their statutory and regulatory barriers to \ntelehealth.\n  My amendment is very modest. It proposes a $6.8 million increase for \nthe Office of the Advancement of Telehealth, or OAT, to fulfill these \nactivities which were authorized under the Health Care Safety Net \nAmendments Act of 2002. With this amendment, total funding for OAT \nwould be increased to $13.8 million.\n  Additionally, this amount is fully offset by a prorated reduction in \nthe departmental management accounts of the Department of Labor, the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services, and the Department of \nEducation.\n  The $6.8 million provided by my amendment, while modest, will have a \nsignificant and positive impact on almost every health activity in this \nwide-reaching bill. Increasing the investment in telehealth is valuable \nand necessary and will help save money for patients and for the Federal \nGovernment.\n  This is a small but important investment in the future of our \nNation's health care system. I hope the $6.8 million increase, when you \ntake it away from all of the various departments that are funded under \nthis bill--this is a multibillion dollar bill--is inconsequential in \nterms of the impact that can be had by putting that $6.8 million into \nthe advancement of telehealth in this country, making sure that more \npatients and more providers are able to utilize technology to meet the \nhealth care needs of people in rural and underserved areas across this \ncountry.\n  So I hope my colleagues will support this amendment and help us \nadvance this very important initiative.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time, and I ask that \nthe amendment be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Pryor). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from South Dakota for \nbringing up this important program. As a neighboring State Senator, \ntelehealth is a very important part of our State. We have seen the \nsavings, as the Senator talked about, that can accrue from this, not \nonly in terms of money but in saving the lives of people who live in \nour small towns and communities.\n  I have seen firsthand the benefit of telehealth by using the \nfiberoptic network system we have in the State of Iowa. I know of many \ncases where someone was in a car wreck in a small town and they didn't \nknow whether they could leave them there in the small clinic or if they \nneeded to be air-lifted, and with telehealth and with the fiberoptic \nsystem, they were able to do some diagnoses and make the decision that, \nyes, the person needed to be removed immediately or, no, they didn't. \nSo it does save a lot of money, but it also saves a lot of lives.\n  Again, I say to my friend from South Dakota, this program is a \nperfect example of how starved we have been in our account over the \nlast few years--how starved we are in this bill. Ten years ago, \ntelehealth received $15.8 million in this bill. Over the last 5 years, \nthe funding has hovered between $4 million and $6.8 million. So again, \nI have no problems with the amendment. I hope our staffs can work \ntogether and we can work together to find an appropriate offset. I \nthink there may be some things we can work out that will be acceptable \nto both sides on the offset.\n  So I thank the Senator from South Dakota for his interest and for \noffering this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I appreciate the willingness of the \nchairman of the subcommittee and the ranking member to work with us on \nthis amendment. I know of his interest in this particular area of \ntechnology of health care, and I appreciate the support. Hopefully, we \ncan figure out a way to get more money into this very important account \nbecause it does they are doing some remarkable things, and particularly \nin the areas the Senator from Iowa and I represent, in the rural areas \nof the country, and the sky is the limit in terms of what I think can \nbe accomplished. But we have to make sure it is appropriately funded. \nSo I thank the Senator from Iowa for being willing to help out.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3345 to Amendment No. 3325\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3345 to amendment No. 3325.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To require that the Secretary of Labor report to Congress \nregarding jobs lost and created as a result of the North American Free \n                Trade Agreement, and for other purposes)\n\n       On page 12, line 8, before the period, insert the \n     following: ``Provided further, That not later than 180 days \n     after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of \n     Labor shall submit to Congress a report regarding the impact \n     of the North American Free Trade Agreement (in this section, \n     referred to as the `Agreement') on jobs in the United States. \n     The report shall cover the period beginning on the date the \n     Agreement entered into force with respect to the United \n     States through December 31, 2007, and shall include on a \n     industry-by-industry basis, the information regarding the \n     number and type of jobs lost in the United States as a result \n     of the agreement and the number and type of jobs created as a \n     result of the Agreement.''.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I offer this amendment on behalf of \nmyself, Senator Brown, Senator Stabenow, and Senator Casey.\n\n[[Page S12974]]\n\n  Mr. President, this amendment calls for a study and a report, and I \nwant to describe the purpose of it and why I am offering it today. It \nrequires the Department of Labor to determine in a study and report to \nthe Congress the number of jobs lost to the North American Free Trade \nAgreement and the number of jobs created due to the North American Free \nTrade Agreement.\n\n  Now, it is interesting. In an October 4 Wall Street Journal article, \nthere was a story, front page, with the headline ``Republicans Grow \nSkeptical of Free Trade.'' Republicans grow skeptical of free trade. \nActually, the story described skepticism by everybody about what is \ncalled free trade, but it was talking about the politics of it, and so \nthe story described a poll which found that by a 2-to-1 margin \nRepublican voters believed free trade deals have been bad for this \ncountry's economy. It turns out that the dissatisfaction with the \ncurrent trade strategy is bipartisan, not just Republican.\n  The poll found that 59 percent of polled Republican voters agreed \nwith this statement: Foreign trade has been bad for the U.S. economy \nbecause imports from abroad have reduced demand for American-made goods \nand it has cost jobs here at home and produced potentially unsafe \nproducts.\n  The poll also describes that all voters essentially feel this way; it \nis not just Republican voters. But as I indicated, it was trying to \ntake a political look at an issue that is very important.\n  We are going to have a number of free trade agreements come to the \nfloor of the Senate soon. We will have one from Peru, Colombia, Panama, \nand South Korea. It is interesting that the Wall Street Journal \ndescribes how the American people feel about these trade agreements. I \nthink it is not the case that people feel trade is not important. I \nbelieve in trade, and plenty of it. I just insist that trade be fair.\n  I want to go back with this amendment to the North American Free \nTrade Agreement because that free trade agreement dates back almost--\nwell, it is over a decade now, and we have had substantial experience \nwith it. Those who negotiated it--and, incidentally, it was negotiated \nbeginning under the first President Bush, concluding under President \nClinton. He sent it to this Senate, and I, at that point, was one of \nthe leaders waging a fight against it. But when it was debated in \nCongress, it was alleged by economists and virtually everybody that it \nwould result in the creation of 200,000 new jobs for our country. If we \nwould pass this new trade agreement, 200,000 jobs would be created in \nour country.\n  Well, what has happened with the trade agreement? Let me describe \nwhat has happened, and I will describe it in a way that the \nadministration and the Commerce Department and Labor Department would \ndescribe it. They would say what an unbelievable success this trade \nagreement has been. How on Earth would you be critical of a trade \nagreement that has increased our exports from the United States to \nMexico? It has increased our exports to Mexico. And it has. It sure \nhas. But it has increased our imports from Mexico much, much, much \nmore. What started prior to the North American Free Trade Agreement as \na $1.5 billion surplus with Mexico--a trade surplus with Mexico--has \nnow become nearly a $60 billion, close to $70 billion trade deficit. So \nit's a trade surplus converted to a big trade deficit.\n  Now, I didn't take a lot of higher math, but I understand if you turn \na trade surplus into a big trade deficit, that is not a positive \noutcome for your country. That is a negative approach, and it means \nlost jobs. It means you are going to have to repay that trade debt with \na lower standard of living someday.\n  In fact, the proponents of NAFTA some years ago relied on a study by \nGary Clyde Hufbauer and Jeffrey Schott. It was called the Hufbauer/\nSchott, and it was the one cited by everybody. They actually said it is \ngoing to create 170,000 new jobs in our country--net new jobs. That was \nrounded up by the proponents to 200,000. That was going to be nirvana. \nWe would pass this trade agreement and get 200,000 net new jobs. That \nwas how it would work. Except that we passed it and we went from a $1.5 \nbillion trade surplus with Mexico to a nearly $70 billion trade \ndeficit. Now, that is headed in the wrong direction, and that means \nlost jobs.\n  I took a look at this, and I asked some while ago, 10 years after \nNAFTA had been approved, to commission a study from the Congressional \nResearch Service to identify the top 100 American companies that had \nlaid off U.S. workers as a result of NAFTA between 1994 and 2002, and \nhere is the list of the top 100 companies. The list totals about \n412,000 U.S. jobs that have been certified as lost. Now, this is not \nsome speculation. This is a program at the Department of Labor that a \ncompany has to actually certify to in order to get some help for their \nemployees--trade adjustment assistance. They certify that because of \nNAFTA these jobs are gone.\n  The Congressional Research Service turned to the Department of Labor, \nwhich has this program, and they said: Can you give us this \ninformation? They gave us the information. This means we can directly \nattribute these job losses to NAFTA, because that is the certification. \nOf the roughly 412,000 jobs that have been certified, actually of the \ntop 100 companies, 201,000 jobs are attributable to these 100 names.\n  But if you look at the companies, it is very interesting. Levi \nStrauss is No. 2. Levi Strauss. I mean, you know, slip on a pair of \nLevis. Anything more all American than putting on a pair of Levis? \nThere is not one pair of Levis made in the United States of America, \nnot one. We passed NAFTA and Levis go south. We still wear them, all \nright. They are just shipped north so we can slip them on. So Levi \nStrauss: 15,676 people, some were proud, I bet, going to work in the \nmorning to make a pair of Levis. But no more. I understand there is not \none pair of Levis made in America.\n  Kraft Foods. Kraft Foods is on the list. Kraft Foods decided they \nwere going to shut down their cookie plant in Fair Lawn, NJ. They made \nFig Newton cookies. So they moved Fig Newton cookies to Monterrey, \nMexico, and 955 jobs were certified as lost. Fig Newton. Now, I don't \nknow whether there is some inherent capability in Mexico to shovel fig \npaste in a more expeditious manner than exists in New Jersey. I doubt \nit. My guess is, just as Levi went south in search of cheap labor, so \ntoo did Fig Newton cookies.\n  So the next time somebody says let's go out and buy some Mexican \nfood, buy Fig Newton cookies. They left New Jersey and ended up in \nMonterrey, Mexico. Mexican food.\n  What about Fruit of the Loom underwear? We all understand it; some \nwear it. Fruit of the Loom underwear--5,352 workers in Texas were \ncertified and thousands more in Louisiana were certified to the Labor \nDepartment as having lost their jobs due to NAFTA. Actually, when that \nhappened it was pretty big news around the country, because Fruit of \nthe Loom laid off a lot of people, and I came to the floor and said: It \nis one thing to lose your shirt--and then I stopped, because I realized \nwe shouldn't joke about jobs lost with Fruit of the Loom.\n\n  But these were people who made underwear--probably, I am sure, very \nproud of their jobs. They probably worked for a career. Is there no \nmarket for underwear any more? People stopped wearing them? I don't \nthink so. The underwear is made, it is just not made in America. Fruit \nof the Loom is gone, and it was certified to have gone and the jobs are \nlost.\n  Mattel's western Kentucky plant, making Barbie playhouses and \nbattery-powered pickup trucks for nearly 30 years, 980 employees went \nfrom a job in Kentucky to being unemployed. The plant went to Mexico to \nproduce Mattel toys.\n  John Deere, 1150 employees, lawn mowers and chain saws, jobs gone to \nMexico.\n  Well, all of these are just numbers. You know, you could pick any one \nof them. Nokia, 1,980. Make it 1,979 and talk about the person, the one \nperson who came home one night and said: Honey, I lost my job. They \ncalled me in and they told me my job was gone. Well, was it because you \nweren't a good employee? No, I am a good employee. They just said we \nare moving the jobs to Mexico.\n  I have described other cases on the floor of the Senate of American \nworkers who worked for careers and were making $11 an hour plus \nbenefits. They all got fired in search of cheaper labor\n\n[[Page S12975]]\n\nby a company that moved their jobs. In that case, the jobs went to \nChina. But the reason I told the story previously is that all of those \nworkers who lost their jobs because they made $11 an hour--and that was \nway too much money--on the last day of work, as they pulled out of \ntheir driving spaces in the parking lot where their car used to park at \na job they cared about, they all left a pair of empty shoes. It was a \nplaintive way for the employees of that company to send a message to \nthe owners of that company who shipped their jobs overseas. It was a \nway of saying: You can move our jobs to China, but, by God, you are not \ngoing to fill our shoes. It was a message from the employees who cared \nabout their jobs and cared about their work.\n  Well, Hufbauer/Schott and all the others who gave us those hifalutin \nestimates of new jobs with NAFTA, they said: By the way, there will be \nsome jobs that will move south. But they will be low-skilled, low-wage \njobs. But don't worry.\n  Well, guess what. The three largest imports to the United States \ntoday from Mexico are automobiles, automobile parts, and electronics, \nall the product of high-skilled jobs. Now, that is completely at odds \nwith what was represented to the Congress and the American people.\n  I started this by saying the Wall Street Journal does a front-page \nfeature story saying that Republicans don't believe free trade has been \ngood for our country. They were doing a political story. But they \nneedn't have said Republicans. Actually, the American people don't \nbelieve the so-called free trade agreements have been good for our \ncountry. Why is that? Because they are the ones who know. They are the \nones who know, not the economists, not the folks who put on three-piece \nblue suits and suspenders every day and puff about what is going on in \nthe world. It is the people who are working who lose their jobs and are \nfacing downward pressure on income from these kinds of trade \nagreements.\n  Now, I am not suggesting, and would not ever suggest, that we \nshouldn't trade. I believe we ought to trade. I believe trade is \nimportant, and plenty of it. I just insist that it be fair. Whether it \nis Mexico, or China--the bilateral agreement with China--or South Korea \nor any number of trade agreements, I can point to the examples of what \nhas happened that undermines the support of the American people for \nthese agreements. Let me give you a couple.\n  South Korea. There is an agreement coming to the Senate Chamber \ndealing with South Korea. We have done other trade agreements with \nSouth Korea, and they have never met the commitments they made in those \nagreements, but nonetheless, an agreement with South Korea. Well, South \nKorea last year sent us roughly 700,000 automobiles. They put them on \nships, sailed them across the ocean, and they offloaded them onto \nAmerican docks and put them for sale in this country. We were able to \nsell about 5,000 vehicles in South Korea.\n  So 700,000 one way, 5,000 the other way. Why? Is that consumer \npreference? It is because in Korea 99 percent of the cars on Korean \nroads are made in Korea, and that is the way they want it. They do not \nwant American cars sold in Korea. They have all kinds of devices to \nkeep them out. We open our market. One-way trade. The American people \nunderstand that, and they do not support that.\n  I am going to mention one other thing. I have mentioned the bilateral \nagreement with China, with whom we have a giant trade deficit--$230 \nbillion a year trade deficit. Not many people know that in the latest \nbilateral agreement with China--a country that is ramping up a very \nsignificant powerful automobile export industry. You will see Chinese \ncars on the streets in this country soon. They are aggressively ramping \nup an automobile export industry. Here is what our country decided to \ndo with a country with which we have a very large deficit. We said to \nChina: When you export your cars to the United States, we will impose a \n2.5 percent tariff on cars you sell here, and it is okay for you, on \nany American cars we sell in China, to impose a tariff 10 times higher, \nat 25 percent. That is what we said to China.\n  That is unbelievably ignorant of our own economic interests. Is it \nsurprising the Wall Street Journal does a poll that says the American \npeople don't believe in this nonsense? They are living it. They lose \ntheir jobs. There is not one person in the Congress who has lost his or \nher job due to a bad trade agreement. It is the other folks out there \nwho go to work in the morning and care about their job, who are doing \nthe best they can and are told, by the way, you have to compete with \nMonterrey, or Chihuahua, or someone in Shenzhen, or Beijing who is \nwilling to work for 30 cents an hour. And if you can't compete with \nthem, we are sorry.\n  The result has been downward pressure on wages, fewer benefits, and \nproblems for American workers. That is a very long description of why I \nwanted to offer an amendment. Finally, at long last, I wish to see a \nreal evaluation done of what has been the net result of NAFTA, because \nwe still have these folks running around here saying NAFTA has been a \ngreat success. I mean, I don't know if they are on their feet when they \nlook at something and say it is successful or not, but you cannot take \na sober look at this and say it is successful. Exports have grown, yes, \nbut imports have grown much faster. The evidence is here. We have \nroughly 412,000 jobs that have been certified as having been lost to \nMexico, certified by the Department of Labor as having been lost, \nbecause of the trade agreement--or at least been lost from the time the \ntrade agreement was negotiated.\n\n  What I have asked for is a study, a real study to determine the \nnumber and types of jobs lost due to NAFTA and the number and types of \njobs created due to NAFTA.\n  One final point. This administration has no problem figuring out how \ngreat trade deals will be for other countries. In fact, Wendy Cutler, \nAssistant U.S. Trade Representative, was touting the benefits that our \ntrade agreement with Korea would offer to Korea. Let me quote her:\n\n       An FTA with the United States is predicted to produce \n     economic benefits for the Korean economy, increasing Korea's \n     real GDP by as much as 2 percent, establishing a foundation \n     to achieve per capita income to as high as $30,000, boosting \n     exports to the United States by 15 percent, and creating \n     100,000 new jobs.\n\n  That is what the USTR is saying, here is the nirvana that is going to \nexist if we can simply do this trade agreement: Here is what is going \nto exist for Korea.\n  Ask them, what will exist for our country? What will be the \nconsequences for our country? What are the comparable numbers for the \nUnited States? They make no similar projection.\n  In fact, the Korean agreement comes to us now, not having addressed \nthe issue of the imbalance in the bilateral automobile trade with \nKorea.\n  Anyway, it is a case where I hope, perhaps, repetition will someday \nbreed success. It is a case where I believe we should trade. I believe \nour country should be a leader in trade. I believe our leadership ought \nto say we aspire to lift others up in the world, not push our workers \ndown. We spent 100 years creating standards--safe workplace, child \nlabor law, minimum wage, a whole series of standards that we ought to \nbe proud of.\n  I believe in our trade agreements we ought to aspire to lift others \nup rather than push ourselves down, push our standards down. That has \nregrettably not been the case with NAFTA. It has not been the case with \na number of other trade agreements and will likely not be the case with \nthe next four agreements that will be brought to the Senate.\n  My colleagues and I, several of us, will be proposing establishing \nbenchmarks and accountability at long last attached to trade \nagreements. We ought to have benchmarks and some accountability \nattached to those benchmarks to find out what has happened. You can't \ngo on forever with a bad trade agreement. You can't go on forever with \none that doesn't work. When we are awash in debt, as we are, over $700 \nbillion a year in trade deficit--which inevitably will be repaid with a \nlower standard of living in the United States--then we are headed for \ntrouble. We need a better trade strategy, one that encourages trade but \none that demands and insists on fair trade for our own economic \ninterests.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Dorgan for his many years\n\n[[Page S12976]]\n\nchampioning the cause of our skilled workers in this country, \nchampioning the cause of manufacturing in this country. He warned us a \nlong time ago about what NAFTA was going to do. Frankly, his dire \npredictions have turned out, unfortunately, to be true. When Senator \nDorgan speaks about NAFTA, or any trade agreement, and the impact on \njobs in this country, it would do us well to pay attention.\n  There is no one I know who knows more about this area than Senator \nDorgan. His amendment, I say to him, is one I can fully support. I hope \nall Members of the Senate could support it. As he said, it requires the \nDepartment of Labor to provide Congress with a fuller picture of the \nimpact of the NAFTA agreement.\n  Frankly, this is key information we ought to have anyway so we can \nunderstand the changes to our economy that have occurred since NAFTA \nhas passed. Again, I thank him for it. This has been a key issue in my \nState of Iowa.\n  I say to my friend from North Dakota, I remember all the speeches he \nused to give about Huffy bicycles and now talking about Levis. What \ncould be more American than that?\n  I might say something equally as American as that is the Maytag \nwashing machine. The Maytag washing machine, what could be more \nAmerican than that Maytag repairman who never had anything to do \nbecause the Maytag washers and dryers were so good?\n  We have always taken great pride in Iowa that Iowa was the home of \nthe Maytag, has been since the beginning, since Fred Maytag started his \nbusiness in Newton, IA. I hate to tell you, but your Maytag washers are \nnow coming from Mexico. All these great jobs we had, and these were \ngood-paying jobs. A lot of people in the past worked at Maytag. It was \npart of their community. They built good schools, educated their kids, \nthe kids went on. Some of the kids grew up and they then went to work \nat Maytag. It was a wonderful community, a wonderful business. They had \ngreat relations with organized labor there.\n\n  To make a long story short, Whirlpool came in, bought out Maytag, \nshipped all the jobs to Mexico. Now all those jobs are missing in Iowa. \nWhat do we do? We scramble to get some retraining, some job retraining \nand things such as that. But the jobs the people are getting are much \nlower paid jobs. They are not as good, and all the manufacturing jobs \nare now in Mexico.\n  Of course, maybe I am being a little chauvinistic because it was such \nan Iowa institution, Maytag, and to think they are not making them \nthere anymore, they are gone.\n  Mr. DORGAN. The town of Bryan, OH, was enormously proud of its \nproduct. It was the product that defined Bryan, OH. It was Etch A \nSketch; every little kid played with Etch A Sketch. The folks in Bryan, \nOH, made Etch A Sketch and every kid played with them. Etch A Sketch is \ngone. They couldn't compete with China. And the Radio Flyer Little Red \nWagon was made in Chicago for 110 years. It was made by an immigrant \nwho started the company. Why was it called Radio Flyer, the Little Red \nWagon? This immigrant was fascinated with two things. He liked Marconi, \nso he named it Radio, and he loved airplanes. So he decided to name it, \nthe Little Red Wagon he crafted in Chicago, IL, as Radio Flyer, and \nvirtually every kid in this country has ridden on Radio Flyer wagons.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I did myself when I was a kid.\n  Mr. DORGAN. They were here for 110 years but no more. Now they are \nmade in China. We could go on at some length. Some people will say: \nDon't you understand, you two, the world has changed, for God's sake, \nthe world has changed and they are going to make these things where you \ncan pay 20 or 30 cents an hour.\n  My question to them is this: If that is where the jobs are, who is \ngoing to buy the products? In this country, it seems we built standards \nfor a century to provide good wages and working conditions for the \nAmerican worker and that is what provided the income and development \nand expansion of the middle class and gave them the earning power to \nbuy products. I know the Senator agrees with me. He agrees with trade.\n  We come from agricultural States. We need to find a foreign market \nfor what we produce, but trade has to be fair.\n  Mr. HARKIN. We represent agricultural States, but we always had a \ngood blend of manufacturing and agriculture. One of the well-kept \nsecrets is that Iowa at one time had more foundries than any other \nState in the Nation, small foundries. People made things in these \nfoundries. Those jobs have left now. Now with Maytag leaving, it is \neroding our manufacturing base.\n  We need a good industrial policy. We need a manufacturing policy for \nthis country. We don't have one. We need a good industrial policy for \nthis country. We don't have one. If we do not have some kind of an \nindustrial policy and some policy that says here is the kind of \nmanufacturing base we are going to keep, we are going to protect--\nprotect? I don't mind using the word ``protect.'' We are protecting our \npeople. If we are going to have a manufacturing base that protects us \nin the area of national security, so we have the manufacturing \nwherewithal to take the raw materials and make them into items that our \npeople need but which will provide us with that bulwark for the future \nagainst the possibility of other countries cutting us off or making \ntrade sanctions against us--we need to have that policy.\n  We don't have it. If we don't have it pretty soon, we are not going \nto be making anything in this country. We are not going to be making \nanything. We are going to be shuffling money around, that is all we are \ngoing to be doing. That is not what makes a great country, and it is \nnot what is going to sustain us, if all we are going to do is shuffle \nmoney around.\n  I thank the Senator. He has been a great leader in this area. We are \ngoing to do something. We don't have an agreement yet to accept it. I \ncan tell the Senator I am going to work hard to make sure we get an \nacceptance of his amendment. I thank him for it.\n  With that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Cantwell). The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3347 to Amendment No. 3325\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside \nthe pending amendments so I can offer an amendment that has been sent \nto the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Jersey [Mr. Menendez] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3347 to amendment No. 3325.\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To provide funding for the activities under the Patient \n     Navigator Outreach and Chronic Disease Prevention Act of 2005)\n\n       On page 79, between lines 4 and 5, insert the following:\n       Sec. __. (a) In addition to any other amounts appropriated \n     or otherwise made available under this Act, $15,000,000 shall \n     be available to carry out activities under the Patient \n     Navigator Outreach and Chronic Disease Prevention Act of 2005 \n     (Public Law 109-18).\n       (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, the \n     amount made available under this Act for the Reading First \n     State Grants program under subpart 1 of part B of title I of \n     the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. \n     6361 et seq.), as specified in the committee report of the \n     Senate accompanying this Act, shall be reduced by \n     $15,000,000.\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, first I wish to thank Senator Harkin \nfor his leadership on this bill, as well as the ranking Republican, and \nhis strong support of what I am trying to do here, which is to fund the \nPatient Navigator Program.\n  The amendment provides $15 million for initial implementation of the \nPatient Navigator Outreach and Chronic Disease Prevention Act of 2005. \nThis\n\n[[Page S12977]]\n\nact creates a 5-year, $25 million demonstration program within the \nHealth Resources and Services Administration for patient navigator \nservices through community health centers, National Cancer Institute \ncenters, Indian Health Service centers, and rural health clinics, as \nwell as hospitals, academic health centers, and certain nonprofit \nentities that enter into partnerships to provide patient navigator \nservices.\n  This funding is the culmination of years of bipartisan and bicameral \ncompromise. I was then, at the time, in the House of Representatives, a \nsponsor with Congresswoman Deborah Pryce from Ohio. Here in the Senate, \nSenators Hutchison and Bingaman were champions of this legislation. It \npassed by unanimous consent in the Senate, and President Bush signed it \ninto law in 2005. The Labor-HHS Subcommittee provided funding last \nyear, but unfortunately that did not make it into the final bill.\n  This Patient Navigator and Chronic Disease Prevention Act and the \npatient navigators that are called for in the bill have strong \ngrassroots support from organizations such as the American Cancer \nSociety. Actually, it was our work with the American Cancer Society \nthat at the time had it as its No. 1 or No. 2 top legislative \ninitiative. So we got the bill passed into law, but we haven't been \nable to fund it yet. It also has the support of the National \nAssociation of Community Health Centers, the National Rural Health \nAssociation, the American Diabetes Association, the American Medical \nAssociation, the Intercultural Cancer Council, the National Alliance \nfor Hispanic Health, the National Hispanic Medical Association, the \nNational Patient Advocate Foundation, and many others.\n  The goal of a patient navigator is to improve health outcomes by \nhelping patients, including patients in underserved communities, to \novercome barriers they face in getting early screening and appropriate \nfollowup treatment.\n  Patient navigators benefit people across the country, from all walks \nof life, regardless of class, location, culture, or language, and \nnavigators help get people into a health care provider for preventive \nscreenings and help them navigate our complex health care system if an \nabnormality is detected. They conduct year-round outreach into \nunderserved communities so people are aware of the importance of early \ndetection and screening. They help them find followup testing and \ntreatment. They stay with them throughout the process to make sure they \nget to that next doctor's appointment and they get early treatment. \nThis is a small investment with huge benefits, benefits in terms of \nlives and dollars saved.\n  I was fortunate enough, in the House of Representatives, when I \nserved there, to actually get some pilot projects of patient navigators \nin what was my former congressional district in New Jersey. It \nreplicated two very successful programs that were the forerunners of \nthis idea--Dr. Harold Freeman in Harlem Hospital, who works with the \nAmerican Cancer Society, and here in Washington, DC, at the Washington \nCancer Center, Dr. Elmer Huerta, who had a different variation on it, \nbut both of them created patient navigation, the effort to bring \nindividuals into a preventive setting, and in doing so, help them \nnavigate. We took that example and we brought it to my home State of \nNew Jersey.\n  What we did is, at one of the family health centers, we found \nourselves significantly bringing in people into a preventive setting. \nWe found a fair number of individuals who had abnormalities, and \nbecause of the screening we put them through, we detected their \nabnormalities. Then, through the patient navigator, we navigated them \nthrough the health care system in a way that we saved lives and we \nsaved an enormous amount of money from people whom we caught early in \ntheir illness, particularly cancer-related, and whom we ultimately were \nable to not only save their lives but at an enormous cost of having \nindividuals not wait longer in the process and end up, at the end of \nthe day, in an emergency room with far greater costs.\n  So this is a small investment with huge benefits, benefits in terms \nof lives and dollars saved. By getting people in to see a doctor before \nsymptoms develop, we can catch diseases such as cancer or diabetes \nearly. Then we can get patients into treatment early, which means they \nwill have a better chance of survival, and the health care costs will \nbe lower.\n  This is a win-win proposition which has strong bipartisan support in \nthe House and Senate, signed by the President. We are just simply \nlooking to get it funded. We look forward to working with the chair of \nthe subcommittee, Senator Harkin, and the ranking member to get it \naccepted. We think we have an appropriate offset, but at the same time, \nwe are open to others as well in order to achieve this goal.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                  Iraq\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, on October 11, we marked the fifth \nanniversary of Congress's capitulation to the resolution authorizing \nthe war in Iraq. I believe we should take this opportunity to tally up \nwhat this war has cost our Nation.\n  We are all very aware of the human cost. More Americans have died in \nIraq than died on September 11. These are our friends and neighbors, \nfathers and mothers, sons and daughters, gone forever. Twenty-eight \nthousand men and women have come back home wounded, some with their \nlegs or arms blown off by bombs, some blind from shrapnel in their \neyes, some thrown into a state of mental shock from which they will \nnever fully recover.\n  As for the Iraqi men, women, and children who have died in this \nconflict, we cannot even say. Some estimates say the body count is more \nthan 100,000. As for the people who have been forced to abandon their \nhomes, they are about to number 4\\1/2\\ million, a disproportionate \nnumber of them being children.\n  We all know that the Iraq war is a human calamity of vast \nproportions. It can be harder to visualize the direct damage that comes \nfrom the financial cost of the war, to see it as the cancer that it is, \nmaking our debt metastasize, threatening our budget, eating away at the \nfinancial stability of our entire Nation.\n  We are paying for this war with borrowed money, racking up massive \ndebt, severely threatening the future of our country. We know our \ncountry has spent more than $450 billion on this war so far. We \ncontinue to spend about $10 billion every month. That does not just add \nup to a stack of bills that could have sat in the Treasury; it is \nequipment at ports that can scan for nuclear weapons and other measures \nthat actually make the homeland more secure. It is children healed with \nbetter health care. It is more teachers in our schools, better training \nfor our jobs, energy that is clean and does not strengthen repressive \nregimes in the Middle East, payment of our debts so future generations \nwill inherit a country that is financially viable. Those are casualties \nwe cannot fail to count.\n  When our money gets burned in Iraq, we deserve to know what we are \ntrading away. What we are trading away cannot be summed up in one \nspeech, however, so I will be coming back to the subject as many times \nas necessary to give each sacrifice fair attention.\n  When we add it all up, the bottom line is very clear: If we had never \ngone into Iraq, our lives would be better. The sooner we get out of \nIraq, the better our lives will be. I will repeat this until our troops \nhave come home. If we had never gone into Iraq, our lives would be \nbetter, and the sooner we transition out of Iraq, the better our lives \nwill be.\n  Today, I wish to speak about what the failed war in Iraq has cost us \nin terms of our security here at home. The Bush administration likes to \nparrot the line that:\n\n       We are fighting them over there, so we do not have to fight \n     them here.\n\n  Nevermind that the war has created more terrorists than there were \nbefore. Beyond that, it has directed funding away from programs that \nactually would prevent terrorists from attacking the homeland. The \nadministration's budget for the failed war in Iraq is 13 times this \nyear's budget for Homeland Security--13 times this year's budget for \nHomeland Security. Do we really think the Iraq war is 13 times more \nimportant to America than the Department of Homeland Security's \nmission? When it comes to our money, the administration's motto really \nis:\n\n[[Page S12978]]\n\nWe are spending it over there, so we do not have to spend it here.\n  Every time we ride the subway or the bus, we put ourselves at risk \nbecause our public transportation systems are unnecessarily vulnerable \nto terrorist attacks. The American Public Transportation Association \nestimates that it will cost $6 billion to make them substantially more \nsecure. That includes funding for personnel, training, communications \nsystems, cameras, detection systems. Well, we spend that much--that is, \n$6 billion that the Public Transportation Association says would make \nus safer--we spend that much in Iraq every 18 days. Every 18 days. That \nis what the war costs. Security on public transportation versus 18 days \nin Iraq--what is our choice?\n  Money being spent in Iraq could have substantially improved security \nin our Nation's ports, where 95 percent of the cargo slips into the \ncountry without any inspection whatsoever. For the cost of 3 days of \noperations in Iraq, we could fund a year's worth, a year's worth of \nstrong port security initiatives throughout our country--purchasing \nradiation detectors, giving individual grants tailored to the specific \nneeds of each port, and drastically increasing the number of containers \nscreened.\n  Here is an example. There is something called a container security \ndevice. It attaches to the hinges of a container and lets inspectors at \nports know if the container has been tampered with from the port it \ncame from. They cost about $25 each. You could provide a device for \nevery one of the 11 million-plus containers that enter our ports every \nyear for the same money it costs us to be in Iraq for 1 single day. We \ncould take 11 million containers that enter our ports every year and \nfor 1 single day in Iraq make our country more secure. That is what the \nwar costs--electronic security for every container entering the United \nStates versus 1 day in Iraq.\n  As we have considered the Commerce-Justice-Science appropriations \nbill that we passed yesterday, it is as good a time as any to discuss \nhow funding for the Iraq war impacts local police departments here at \nhome. With the billions of dollars going toward a failed effort to \nsecure the streets of Baghdad, we could boost our efforts to fight \nterror and violence of gangs on the streets of the neighborhoods we \ncall home.\n  The FBI tells us that crime rates are going up in the United States. \nThis is no coincidence considering the Bush administration has \nrepeatedly cut funding for hiring new police, law enforcement \ntechnology, and successful prevention programs.\n  Luckily, this Senate under Democratic leadership has changed that \ncourse. We are taking action to reverse that situation. I was proud to \ncosponsor Senator Biden's amendment to boost funding for the COPS \nProgram, one of the most successful Federal crime prevention programs \nin history. Eight hours of Iraq funding pays for that amendment to put \ncommunity police officers on the streets of our Nation. That is the war \ncost--more police on the streets versus 8 hours of spending in Iraq. \nWhen it comes to our money, the message the administration is sending \nis clear. We are spending it over there so we don't spend it here. But \nin terms of security, if we had never gone into Iraq, our lives would \nbe better. The sooner we transition out of Iraq, the better our lives \nwill be.\n  Costs of the war for the United States are going only to escalate as \nGreat Britain withdraws its troops. So the financial question we have \nto answer as a nation is as urgent as any we have ever faced. We have \nto decide what we value as a Nation: the war or keeping our country \nsafe. These are the questions we are going to continue to ask to put a \nreal sense of what it is costing us here at home in real terms. Today \nwas about security. We will come back to the Senate floor and talk \nabout education and health care and economic expansion and reducing \ndebt, because we have to offer a real sense to the American people of \nwhat this war is costing us here at home.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3332 to Amendment No. 3325\n\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \npending amendment to be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Madam President, I call up amendment No. 3332.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Missouri [Mrs. McCaskill], for herself and \n     Mr. DeMint, proposes an amendment numbered 3332.\n\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To require the Departments to establish and maintain on their \n website home pages a direct link to the websites of their Inspectors \n                    General and for other purposes)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Sec. __.  Not later than 30 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Departments, agencies, and \n     commissions funded under this Act, shall establish and \n     maintain on the homepages of their Internet websites--\n       (1) a direct link to the Internet websites of their Offices \n     of Inspectors General; and\n       (2) a mechanism on the Offices of Inspectors General \n     website by which individuals may anonymously report cases of \n     waste, fraud, or abuse with respect to those Departments, \n     agencies, and commissions.\n\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. I ask unanimous consent to add Senator DeMint as a \ncosponsor of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Madam President, we have successfully added this \namendment to all appropriations bills to date. It is a very simple \namendment. It requires the Departments under this bill to maintain a \ndirect link to the agency's inspector general Web site, on the home \npage of his or her department's Web site. It requires this direct link \nbecause the information the inspector general provides to the public \nneeds to be easily available. They are the eyes and ears of the \ntaxpayers in many ways. They are on the front lines in terms of waste, \nfraud, and abuse. They provide a valuable service. In many departments, \none can't find the information. This amendment will require that on the \nhome page of the Web sites of the Departments of Education, Labor \nHealth and Human Services, there be a direct link to the inspector \ngeneral of that Department's Web site so taxpayers, Members of \nCongress, and members of the executive branch can easily find the \nimportant information that is provided by the inspector general's \noffice.\n  I urge passage of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Missouri for \noffering this amendment. It is a good amendment. I have checked with \nSenator Specter on our side, and it is OK on that side. It is OK with \nus. We will accept the amendment.\n  Before doing so, I will again say to my friend from Missouri that in \nthis bill we have increased funding above the President's budget for \nall the inspector generals in all the departments this bill covers. \nBasically opening it up, as her amendment does, allows more people \naccess to what the inspector generals are doing. Hopefully we can \ncontinue to try to maintain the integrity and independence of the \ninspector generals. Some of them are perhaps being pressured by the \nadministration to do certain things. But we want to maintain that \nintegrity and the independence of the inspector generals. This \namendment will help to do that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, without \nobjection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 3332) was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3345\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I rise to support the Dorgan amendment \noffered earlier this evening. I thank him for his amendment. I am a \nproud cosponsor.\n  The Dorgan amendment makes sense for a variety of reasons. Most \nimportantly, we need updated and current information on what NAFTA, the \nNorth American Free Trade Agreement, which passed in November of 1993, \nmeans for our country today and, most importantly, because the North \nAmerican Free Trade Agreement has become\n\n[[Page S12979]]\n\nthe model, for good or bad, for trade policy since. The Central \nAmerican Free Trade Agreement was built on the NAFTA model. Trade \nagreements Presidents asked this Congress to pass, negotiated with Peru \nand Colombia, Panama and South Korea, while tweaked, while having some \nimprovements, perhaps, in the case of Peru and Panama, some significant \nimprovements, nonetheless are based on the same failed trade model that \nNAFTA was based on, a trade model that entertains investor-state \nrelations giving more authority to corporations to undercut \nenvironmental laws in our country, to undercut labor law, and to \nundercut the values of our society.\n  I wish President Bush would sit down with the steel worker in \nSteubenville or the machinist in Toledo or the tool and die shop owner \nin Lorain and talk about what these trade policies, this NAFTA model \nthe Dorgan amendment addresses, in fact means for American workers, \nwhat they mean for American small manufacturers, what they mean for our \ncommunities, what they mean in Hamilton and Middletown and Ashtabula \nand Maineville, what impact that has on communities. These trade \npolicies, which are set in Washington and negotiated across the globe, \nhave a direct impact on Toledo, on Wauseon, on Findlay, on Bowling \nGreen, all across our State. That is why the voters in my State and \nacross the country sent a message loudly and clearly in November \ndemanding a very different direction in trade policy, a trade policy \nthat serves workers, consumers, families, and communities rather than \none that serves investors, especially the wealthy in other countries \nand the wealthy in this country.\n  Working men and women in Ohio, including the machine shop owner in \nAkron and the factory worker in Columbus, know that job loss doesn't \njust affect the worker or the worker's family or the business owner. \nJob loss in the thousands affects communities and police, the number of \npolice and firefighters and teachers and workers in a community and the \neconomic vitality of that community.\n  What we have seen in the last few years in this country is disturbing \nespecially in this sense. American workers all across the board, \nwhether they are in the State of the Presiding Officer, Washington, or \nin Lima, OH, are more productive; whether they work with their hands or \nminds or whether they are a retailer or whether they are a factory \nowner, workers are more productive, provably, quantifiably, \nquantitatively way more productive than they were 5 years ago. That is \na testament to our Nation's hard-working and skilled labor force. It is \na testament to our job training and education system. The problem is, \nthose workers' productivity is no longer parallel to their wages. It \nused to be in this country, after the war, since the 1940s, that as \nproductivity went up, workers' wages and profits went up roughly at the \nsame pace. But we have seen a disconnect. As productivity goes up and \nup because workers with their capital investments are more and more \nproductive, we have not seen wages keep up. In a nutshell, that is \nbecause ultimately what has happened is, our Nation's workers don't \nshare in the wealth they have created for their employers. If you are a \nworker and you create more wealth for your employer, you should share \nin the wealth. But that is not what is happening. That disconnect is \nmore and more obvious in this country, especially in a State such as \nOhio.\n\n  Some years after NAFTA passed the House and Senate and was signed \ninto law, took effect, the agreement among Mexico and the United States \nand Canada, some 5 years later, at my own expense, I flew to McAllen, \nTX, rented a car with a couple friends, went across the border into \nReynosa, Mexico. I wanted to see how NAFTA was working on the other \nside of the border. I knew how it was working in Lorain and Akron and \nSandusky and Findlay, but I wanted to see how it worked on the other \nside of the border. I went to the home of two General Electric workers. \nThey worked for GE Mexico. They lived in a 20-by-20-foot shack, dirt \nfloors, no running water or electricity. When it rained hard, the dirt \nfloors turned to mud. These were full-time workers, 3 miles from the \nUnited States of America, just south of the Rio Grande. These workers \nwere working every bit as hard as any workers in the United States. But \nthey weren't sharing in the wealth they created for their employers.\n  As you walked around their home, in the community behind their shack \nwas a ditch maybe 4 feet wide, 2 by 4 across the ditch. This ditch was \nfilled with I am not sure what, human/industrial effluent waste running \nthrough the neighborhood. The American Medical Association says along \nthe Rio Grande River is one of most toxic places in the western \nhemisphere. There were children playing in the ditch contracting who \nknows what kind of diseases that they might pick up along this very \npolluted little waterway, if you could call it that. But as you walked \naround this neighborhood and you looked at these shacks, you could tell \nwhere the workers worked because the workers' shacks were constructed \nfrom the packing materials of the companies for which they worked. The \nroofs, the walls were made of cardboard boxes and other kinds of \npacking materials, crates where these workers worked.\n  Not far away from these shacks I visited an auto plant. This plant \nlooked just like an auto plant in the United States. It was modern, \nmaybe more modern, more up to date, the best technology. The workers \nwere working hard. The floors were clean, all that you would want in a \nmodern industrial plant. But there was one difference between the \nMexican auto plant and an auto plant in Norwood or Toledo. The auto \nplant in Mexico had no parking lot because the workers there weren't \npaid enough to buy the cars they made. They weren't sharing in the \nwealth they created. You could go halfway around the world to a \nMotorola plant in Malaysia, and workers weren't paid enough to buy the \ncell phones they make. You could come back to Costa Rica and go to a \nDisney plant, and the workers weren't making enough to buy toys for \ntheir children. You could go halfway around the world to China and go \nto a Nike plant or a bicycle plant, and the workers were not making \nenough to buy the Nikes or the bicycles they were making, that they \nwere building. That is the key.\n  In our trade policy, which has become international in this \nglobalized economy, because of what is happening around the world and \nbecause of the way we write trade policy, workers are simply not \nsharing in the wealth they create. Whether it is a Mexican auto plant, \na Malaysian cell phone plant, a toy plant in Costa Rica, or a shoe \nplant in China, the workers are not making enough to share in the \nwealth. The workers are not sharing in the wealth they create. That is \nwhat has happened in our country, this disconnect between productivity \nand wages. More than anything, that is why the middle class is \nshrinking. That is why the Dorgan amendment is so important to show the \nworld, to show the country, to show us in this body what we need to do \nto fix our trade policy.\n  This trade policy hurts local business owners, not just the plant \nthat might lay off or close, but it hurts the drugstore, the grocery \nstore, the neighborhood restaurant. It hurts teachers and firefighters \nand police. It hurts the people whom the police and the firefighters \nand the teachers serve. When I first ran for Congress, our trade \ndeficit was $38 billion. Today, after NAFTA and NAFTA clones, like the \nCentral American Free Trade agreement, the WTO and PNTR with China, our \ntrade deficit has topped $800 billion, from $38 billion in 1992 to $800 \nbillion today. Our trade deficit with China in 1992 was barely double \ndigits, barely $10 billion. Now it probably--for 2007, we don't know \nfor sure--is going to exceed $250 billion. The first President Bush \nsaid a $1 billion trade surplus or deficit translates into 13,000 jobs. \nWhether he is right, he is close enough to be right. When you do the \nmath, a $1 billion trade surplus or trade deficit translates into \n13,000 jobs. When you do the math, you can see the kind of effect our \ntrade policy has on us, not just with lost jobs but with what it has \ndone to break that connection between productivity and workers' wages.\n\n  That is the story of our trade policy and why the Dorgan amendment is \nso important. The current system is not sustainable. We want trade. We \nwant plenty of trade but not under this NAFTA model. We want trade \nunder a whole new set of rules. Now is not the time for more bad trade \ndeals.\n\n[[Page S12980]]\n\n  We need to adopt the Dorgan amendment, look at what has happened with \nour trade policy, pause, and have a national conversation about a new \ndirection for trade in the 21st century.\n  Let's wait on the passage of Peru and Panama. Let's wait on the \npassage of South Korea and Colombia. We need a conversation that \nincludes all parties involved. That means investors. It means workers. \nIt means small business owners. It means communities with people who \nare so affected by trade. The Dorgan amendment is a significant first \nstep in doing that.\n  We should adopt the Dorgan amendment. We should pause and look at \nwhere our trade policy is going, and then we should embark in a new \ndirection on trade in this country.\n\n\n                          family forum earmark\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I rise today to discuss a project I \nsponsored in the fiscal year 2008 Labor, Health, Human Services and \nEducation appropriations bill. The project, which would develop a plan \nto promote better science-based education in Ouachita Parish by the \nLouisiana Family Forum, has raised concerns among some that its \nintention was to mandate and push creationism within the public \nschools. That is clearly not and never was the intent of the project, \nnor would it have been its effect. However, to avoid more hysterics, I \nwould like to move the $100,000 recommended for this project by the \nsubcommittee when the bill goes to conference committee to another \nLouisiana priority project funded in this bill.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I appreciate the sentiments by the \nSenator from Louisiana and accept this proposal to move the funding for \nthis project to other priority projects for the State of Louisiana in \nthe bill when it goes to conference committee.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I concur with my colleague and will \nagree to move these funds in conference committee.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, since the year 2000, shortly after news \nreports attributed hundreds of deaths to asbestos exposure from decades \nof vermiculite mining in Libby, MT, I have worked hard on behalf of the \npeople there to ensure that they received the care they needed. The \nCenter for Asbestos Related Disease plays an important role in \nscreening Libby residents and providing them with the health care they \nneed as a result of this tragedy.\n  The people living in Libby suffer asbestos-related diseases at a rate \n40 to 60 times the national average. They suffer from mesothelioma at a \nrate 100 times the national average. The culprit for this unprecedented \ntragedy is a highly toxic tremolite asbestos amphibole. Due to the \nshipping of Libby asbestos to processing sites in 30 States, and its \nsubsequent use as insulation material in all parts of the country, the \ntoxicity of this amphibole is an issue of national importance.\n  The Department of Health and Human Services and the Environmental \nProtection Agency have designated the Center for Asbestos Related \nDisease as a clearinghouse for information that facilitates clinical \nepidemiological and pathologic studies of asbestos-related diseases. \nThis new role unfortunately comes without adequate funding to \naccommodate the transition to this national leadership role.\n  This is an issue of national concern to scientists who rely on \ntremolite asbestos data for their work. Support letters have been sent \nto Members of this body by researchers at the Mesothelioma Applied \nResearch Foundation from California, Mount Sinai Medical School in New \nYork, Wayne State University in Michigan, North Carolina State \nUniversity, the University of Vermont, the University of Pittsburgh, \nthe University of Pennsylvania, and Montana State University. These \nletters all emphasize the importance of the Libby data to the national \nresearch efforts on asbestos related disease.\n  That is why I submitted an amendment to the Labor, Health and Human \nServices, and Related Agencies Appropriations bill for fiscal year \n2008. My amendment would provide $250,000 to the Center for Asbestos \nRelated Disease in Libby, MT, so that the clinic can provide its \ncritically important information to clinical researchers and \nuniversities across the country. The raw data and data management that \nthe center provides for research institutions will facilitate \nmeaningful research into amphibole asbestos toxicity and health \nimpacts.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/17/senate-section/article/S12980-1", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12980]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, the Russian Federation is, in many \nrespects, a democratic state. Elections are held at regular intervals, \nlocal and national elective bodies meet and pass legislation. Referenda \nmay be held on major issues, both at the national and local level, \nalthough this exercise may be reduced in the near future.\n  But there is another consideration, in which the Russian Federation \nfalls short in its democratic characterization.\n  Freedom of the press is vital to the existence of a stable democratic \nstate. Journalists must be able to openly report on all issues without \nfear of physical harassment or economic pressures. It is no accident \nthat Napoleon said that four newspapers were more effective than a \nthousand bayonets.\n  Therefore, it is regrettable that a number of Russian journalists \nhave recently been murdered while reporting on subjects sensitive to \nthe Russian government. Other have been beaten or otherwise prevented \nfrom doing their job. One recent victim was involuntarily incarcerated \nin a psychiatric hospital.\n  Among those Russian journalists who have given their lives for their \nprofession was Anna Politkovskaya, who reported extensively on the \nbrutal war in Russia's secessionist region of Chechnya. Last week, \nfriends, colleagues, and supporters of this courageous woman marked the \none-year anniversary of her assassination.\n  Politkovskaya was fearless in her efforts to bring correct and \nunbiased information on the Chechen war to her readers. This was a \nhard-earned counterpoint to the propaganda that much of the electronic \nmedia turned out daily on the conflict . . . when there was any mention \nof it at all. While other journalists reported on the conflict from \nafar, she routinely traveled to troublesome areas to view and describe \nfirst-hand the problems and issues in the war-torn region. She was one \nof few Russian reporters to actively engage the Chechen people in open \ndialogue, and she presented her findings in a fair and balanced manner. \nHer resume included a long list of awards and commendations for her \ninvestigative skills and professional competence.\n  On October 7th, 2006, Ms. Politkovskaya was carrying groceries up to \nher Moscow apartment when, according to authorities, a gunman clad in \nblack fired twice, shooting her once in the head. The murderer left the \nweapon at her side, a brazen gesture indicating, or meant to indicate, \nthe commission of a contract murder. The Moscow newspaper Novaya \nGazeta, where Ms. Politikovskaya worked, suggested the assassin or \nassassins had been following her closely and probably for a long time. \nIndeed, she was used to being watched and harassed. Numerous threats \nhad already been made on her life, and at one point in 2001 she was \nforced to flee to Vienna.\n  As Co-chairman of the Helsinki Commission, I would also note that \nAnna Politkovksya delivered memorable and compelling testimony on the \nconflict in Chechnya at Commission hearings on Capitol Hill in \nSeptember 2003, and she was awarded the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly's \nannual Prize for Journalism and Democracy in that year.\n  Recently, several suspects were arrested in connection with the \nmurder. However, there are disturbing reports that the investigation \nhas been marked\n\n[[Page S12981]]\n\nby irregularities and apparent political considerations. For instance, \nRussian officials have been quick to assert that certain individuals \nand factions outside of the Russian Federation must have ordered the \nkilling, although they have presented no credible proof. The fact is \nthat Politkovskaya's work was extremely critical of corrupt and \nincompetent officials in the Russian government. At the time of her \ndeath, she had been working on a story about the torture of detainees \nin the jails of the pro-Moscow Chechen authorities.\n  The true instigator of this murder might well reside in Moscow, \nLondon, Grozny, or Murmansk. In any event, Russian President Vladimir \nPutin stated during a visit last week to Germany that the investigation \nis ``on the right track.'' Let us hope that he is correct.\n  And let us also remember the sacrifice and the journalistic integrity \nof Anna Politkovskaya and her colleagues in Russia and throughout the \nworld, who risk life and limb every day to discern the truth and bring \nit to their fellow citizens.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I would like to comment on the status of \nthe alternative minimum tax, AMT.\n  There is some good news regarding the need to do a patch to protect \n19 million families. If you look back over the last few months, I have \ncome to the floor several times to urge my friends in the Democratic \nleadership in both bodies to focus on this problem and get legislation \nready. Earlier today, I urged the House to begin work on an AMT patch \nbill. I urged them to send it to the Senate so that Chairman Baucus and \nI will have a vehicle to deal with this pressing problem.\n  We have a few weeks to act before the IRS forms are finalized. After \nthat time, there could be big problems for taxpayers and the Internal \nRevenue Service.\n  I was pleased to read in this afternoon's press reports that Chairman \nRangel is going to process an AMT patch bill.\n  I also want to commend our Finance chairman, my friend, Senator \nBaucus, for convening an informal meeting of the Finance Committee to \ndiscuss this pressing matter. I hope the Democratic leadership provides \nChairman Baucus floor time to take up a committee bill.\n  On a related point, at a press event earlier today, in answer to a \nreporter's question, I indicated that we could look at measures to \ninsure that certain high-income taxpayers who pay no regular income tax \nor AMT pay some tax. I would like to elaborate on that comment.\n  I have referred many times to the IRS statistic of high income \ntaxpayers who pay no regular income tax or AMT. The statistic is that, \nfor the tax year 2004, IRS Statistics of Income reported that 2,833 \ntaxpayers with incomes over $200,000 paid no income tax. That same \ngroup paid no AMT as well. I will ask to have inserted in the Record a \ncopy of that statistic.\n  The reason this group does not pay tax is defects in the AMT. What I \nwas saying is that the AMT is defective in its original purpose. That \nis, to make sure that all high-income taxpayers pay some tax. I was not \narguing for a tax increase on high-income taxpayers who are paying \neither regular income tax or AMT. I was arguing that, if anything, if \nthe AMT's original purpose is to be served, then insure that those not \npaying ANY tax, pay it.\n  Mr. Presdient, I ask unanimous consent to have a copy of the \nstatistic to which I referred printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   TABLE 1.--RETURNS WITH AND WITHOUT U.S. INCOME TAX: NUMBER OF RETURNS, BY SIZE OF INCOME UNDER ALTERNATIVE\n                                             CONCEPTS, TAX YEAR 2004\n                                  [All figures are estimates based on samples]\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                          Returns by size of adjusted gross income\n                                           ---------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                             All returns      under        $50,000      $100,000     $200,000 or\n  Returns by tax status, size of expanded  --------------  $50,000 \\1\\      under         under         more\n                  income                                 --------------   $100,000      $200,000   -------------\n                                                 (1)                   ----------------------------\n                                                               (2)           (3)           (4)           (5)\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                All returns\n \nTotal.....................................   132,226,042    91,302,396    28,166,641     9,735,569     3,021,435\nUnder $50,000 [\\1\\].......................    90,478,783    89,700,020       767,886         8,163         2,714\n$50,000 under $100,000....................    29,115,600     1,572,295    27,186,378       353,025         3,901\n$100,000 under $200,000...................     9,564,057        27,792       205,880     9,279,698        50,687\n$200,000 or more..........................     3,067,602         2,289         6,497        94,683     2,964,133\n \n       Returns with U.S. income tax\n \nTotal.....................................    90,876,672    50,767,865    27,371,775     9,718,430     3,018,602\nUnder $50,000 \\1\\.........................    50,003,838    49,336,042       659,474         6,609         1,713\n$50,000 under $100,000....................    28,278,142     1,413,628    26,509,632       351,123         3,759\n$100,000 under $200,000...................     9,532,119        17,365       197,144     9,267,112        50,498\n$200,000 or more..........................     3,062,574           831         5,524        93,587     2,962,632\n \n      Returns without U.S. income tax\n \nTotal.....................................    41,349,370    40,534,531       794,866        17,139         2,833\nUnder $50,000 [\\1\\].......................    40,474,945    40,363,978       108,411         1,555         1,001\n$50,000 under $100,000....................       837,458       158,667       676,746         1,902           142\n$100,000 under $200,000...................        31,938        10,428         8,736        12,586           189\n$200,000 or more..........................         5,028         1,458           973         1,096         1,501\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ Includes returns with adjusted gross deficit or with negative expanded income.\nNOTE: Detail may not add to totals because of rounding.\nSource: IRS, Statistics of Income Division, June 2007.\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/17/senate-section/article/S12981-1", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12981-S12982]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                            RED RIBBON WEEK\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague, \nSenator Murkowski, in cosponsoring a resolution commemorating Red \nRibbon Week. Red Ribbon Week, celebrated October 23-31 of this year, \nencourages individuals, families and communities to take a stand \nagainst alcohol, tobacco and illegal drug abuse.\n  The tradition of Red Ribbon Week, now in its 22nd year of wearing and \ndisplaying red ribbons, started following the assassination of U.S. \nDrug Enforcement Agency Special Agent Enrique ``Kiki'' Camarena. In an \neffort to honor his memory and unite in the battle against drug crime \nand abuse, friends, neighbors and students from his hometown of \nCalexico, CA, began wearing red ribbons. Shortly thereafter, the \nNational Family Partnership took the celebration nationwide. Since \nthen, the Red Ribbon campaign has reached millions of children, \nfamilies, and communities across the country, spreading the message \nabout the destructive effects of drugs.\n  In my State of Iowa, the theme for Red Ribbon Week is ``Take a \nStand--Be Drug Free.'' Schools and community groups across the State \nare organizing a variety of activities including pledges, contests, \nworkshops, rallies, theatrical and musical performances and other \nfamily and educational events. These events are all designed to educate \nour children on the negative effects of drugs and to promote a drug-\nfree environment.\n  Research tells us that the longer a child stays drug-free, the less \nlikely they will become addicted or even try illegal drugs. This is why \nit is so important to maintain a coherent antidrug message that begins \nearly in adolescence and continues throughout the growing years. Such \nan effort must involve parents, communities and young people. Red \nRibbon Week provides each of us the opportunity to take a stand by \nhelping our children make the right decisions when it comes to drugs.\n  In light of the growing epidemic of prescription drug and cold \nmedicine abuse throughout the Nation, this year's Red Ribbon Week holds \ngreater importance. I thank my colleagues for\n\n[[Page S12982]]\n\npassing this resolution to demonstrate our commitment to raising \nawareness about drugs and encourage everyone to make healthy choices.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/17/senate-section/article/S12982-1", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12982]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor the service and \nsacrifice of Trooper Zachariah ``Zach'' Templeton.\n  My wife Joan and I were deeply saddened to hear of the tragic death \nof Trooper Zachariah Templeton while in the line of duty this past \nFriday in Adams County, CO, as he tried to help a motorist on \nInterstate 76.\n  It takes a person of great courage to become an officer of the law. \nIt takes a strong, hardworking, and considerate individual. It takes a \nspecial someone who is willing to pay the ultimate price in protecting \nthe safety of others.\n  Trooper Templeton was just this person. And unfortunately, Trooper \nZachariah Templeton paid the ultimate price.\n  At age 27, Trooper Zachariah was the 24th Colorado State Patrol \ntrooper who has died in the line of duty. Trooper Jason Lee Manspeaker \nwas the last trooper killed on duty and died in a motor vehicle crash \non January 23, 2001, while attempting to locate a vehicle believed to \nbe associated with the ``Texas Seven,'' who were wanted in connection \nwith the death of a Texas police officer. According to the National Law \nEnforcement Officers Memorial Fund, more than 17,500 officers have been \nkilled nationwide since 1792, including 238 in Colorado.\n  A native of Colorado, Zach joined the Adams County Sheriff's Office \nas a detention specialist from May 2002 to July 2003, and then joined \nthe CSP and graduated from the CSP Academy in 2003. According to CSP \nofficials, ``Templeton was best described by fellow troopers and \nsupervisors as an individual with a big heart and willingness to help \nothers. It is that desire to serve which led Templeton to respond to \nthe call of a fellow officer. He served the citizens of Colorado with \ndignity and honor for four years.''\n  Zach came from a family steeped in law enforcement tradition. Zach's \nfather is a sergeant with the Adams County Sheriff's Office, and his \ngreat-grandfather was once county sheriff.\n  Trooper Zachariah Templeton was a father, brother, and a son. He is \nsurvived by daughter Samantha, parents Doug and Teresa Templeton, his \nbrother Levi, and his girlfriend Holly Holsinger. Zach was well liked \nby his peers and was often very funny and a jokester with his fellow \ncoworkers.\n  The State of Colorado and the Colorado State Patrol has lost a \nvaluable member of its community, and we are all forever grateful for \nTrooper Zachariah Templeton's service and dedication to the safety and \nwell-being of others. His service to all of us is highly commendable, \nand his contributions will be remembered.\n  I extend my deepest sympathy to the family of Trooper Zachariah \nTempleton. May his bravery and unwavering sense of duty serve as a role \nmodel for the future generation of law enforcement officers. Thank you \nfor your service, Trooper Templeton. Rest in peace, Sir. End of watch: \nFriday, October 12, 2007.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/17/senate-section/article/S12982-3", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12982]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     BREAST CANCER AWARENESS MONTH\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of October \nas Breast Cancer Awareness Month. During this month, numerous national \nservice organizations, professional medical associations, and \ngovernment and local agencies are working to promote breast cancer \nawareness, share information and provide access to screening services \nto women nationwide.\n  As you may know, breast cancer is the second leading cause of death \namong women--around 180,000 women in the United States will be found to \nhave invasive breast cancer in 2007. Furthermore, about 40,500 women \nwill die from the disease this year. And right now there are slightly \nover 2 million women living in the United States who have been treated \nfor breast cancer.\n  Mr. President, in my home State, of New Jersey, we have one of the \nhighest incidence rates of breast cancer in the Nation, averaging \napproximately 8,000 new cases per year. New Jersey also has one of the \nhighest morbidity rates associated with breast cancer--approximately \n1,500 deaths per year. These statistics are painful. Mothers and \nsisters and daughters are struggling to survive this disease across the \ncountry--a disease that is treatable through proper education, early \ndiagnosis, and aggressive therapy.\n  Routine mammography screening is an especially effective means of \ndetecting breast cancer at the earliest stages. That is why during \nBreast Cancer Awareness Month, I urge women nationally to maintain a \nregular mammography schedule. When breast cancer is diagnosed at early \nstages, the chance of survival greatly increases. Aside from \nmammographies, the American Cancer Society recommends that women obtain \nannual clinical breast exams, perform monthly breast self exams, and \nobtain a risk assessment from a physician to maintain their own breast \nhealth, and to catch breast cancer at the earliest stage possible.\n  Although it may seem like breast cancer solely plagues women, there \nare documented cases, although rare, of male breast cancer. In fact, it \nis estimated that in 2007 some 2,030 new cases of invasive breast \ncancer will be diagnosed among men in the United States.\n  However, there is hope among these devastating statistics; with \nknowledge and early screening, many cases can be caught early, \nincreasing patients' chances of survival tremendously. We need to \nincrease our outreach to men and women so we can combat this \ndevastating disease.\n  It is also important to remember that Breast Cancer Awareness Month \ncannot just be a 31-day event--we must take action every day of the \nyear if we have a hope of increasing treatment and saving lives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/17/senate-section/article/S12982-4", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12982-S12983]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               50TH ANNIVERSARY OF NASA AND THE SPACE AGE\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I wish to commemorate the 50th \nanniversary of space flight, the NASA space program, and its \ncontributions past and present to the United States as well as to New \nMexico.\n  Just over 50 years ago on October 4, 1957, the Soviet Union launched \nSputnik, the first artificial satellite to orbit around Earth, which \npropelled the world into the space age. This era saw an unprecedented \nrise in scientific and technological developments benefiting mankind \nboth on and off the surface of the Earth.\n  New Mexicans have a long history of contributions to NASA and to the \nU.S. space program, beginning in 1929 when the ``Father of Modern \nRocketry'' Robert H. Goddard moved to Roswell and began his work \ndesigning and testing rockets. In 1946 the first ever rocket was \nlaunched from U.S. soil into space from what is now White Sands Missile \nRange in New Mexico.\n  Shortly after the Soviet launch of Sputnik, the United States \nlaunched Explorer I, using Goddard's research on the Redstone rocket as \nthe launch vehicle. Later that year on July 29, Congress passed the \nNational Aeronautics\n\n[[Page S12983]]\n\nand Space Act. This law created NASA as we know it today in order to \n``provide for research into problems of flight within, and outside the \nEarth's atmosphere, and for other purposes.''\n  In 1961 a chimpanzee named ENOS, trained at Holloman Air Force Base \nin Alamogordo, was launched into orbit around Earth and safely returned \nafter two full orbits. Fellow space travelers, Astronauts Drew Gaffney, \nSidney Gutierrez, Mike Gutierrez, Edgar D. Mitchell, and former Senator \nHarrison J. Schmitt, whom I had the honor of working with years ago, \nall call New Mexico home.\n  White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico currently provides an \nalternative landing site for the space shuttle, serves as the primary \ntraining area for NASA space shuttle pilots and is used for research on \nthe next generation of the space shuttle. NASA has collaborated with, \nand funded, research at the University of New Mexico, New Mexico State \nUniversity, and New Mexico Tech. This funding has been used to continue \nto expand the limits of understanding in the fields of science and \ntechnology. NASA continues to work with Sandia and Los Alamos National \nLaboratories on cutting edge research and development programs.\n  New Mexico's Holloman Air Force Base in Alamogordo is also home to \nthe 2007 X-PRIZE Cup competition, the world's largest air and space \nflight demonstration. In just a few days, on October 27 and 28, lunar \nlander vehicle competitions, launches, and air show performances will \ntake place along with ground static displays of rockets, NASA displays, \nrobotic displays, and military aircraft displays. I know that the \ncompetition will again be fierce for the X-PRIZE Cup, and I am very \nexcited that all the action will take place in New Mexico.\n  I am proud of New Mexico's role and rich history in space and with \nNASA. It is a great honor for New Mexico to contribute in so many ways \nto this remarkable program which has played such a large role in our \nNation's history and which continues to be so important to our \nadvancement.\n  From the Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo missions of the 1960s space race \nto the shuttle age and beyond, NASA has been on the cutting edge of \ntechnology, and they are consistently pushing the limits of \nunderstanding. Through space exploration we continue to gain a clearer \npicture of the history of our universe, our planet, and ourselves.\n  In honor of 50 years of space flight, NASA will be hosting lecture \nseries, future forums, and science expos throughout the country \nbeginning this month and continuing through October of 2008. I am in \nawe of what NASA has done and can only anticipate what exciting things \nthey will bring this country, and the world, over the next 50 years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/17/senate-section/article/S12983-1", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12983]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n        SANTA CLARA UNIVERSITY PARTICIPATION IN SOLAR DECATHLON\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to \nrecognize the extraordinary efforts of one of the universities in my \nhome State of California--Santa Clara University.\n  Twenty-eight SCU students are here in Washington this week to compete \nin the Solar Decathlon to build the most livable and energy efficient \nsolar-powered house.\n  As one of only 20 university teams worldwide chosen by the U.S. \nDepartment of Energy to participate, the SCU team is making tremendous \nstrides both on the Mall and in California to lead the charge in \nsustainable living. They are setting a fantastic example for youth \nthroughout the Nation, and for future generations, in how we can work \nto save energy and reduce global warming pollution.\n  The SCU students have studied the innovative problem solving methods \nthat are a staple of Silicon Valley and have incorporated those \napproaches in their work. They have gone above and beyond to \ndemonstrate that people can have affordable, beautiful, functional \nhousing that also saves energy, protects our environment, and reduces \npollution.\n  In June, the SCU team started building their solar-powered home and \nthen transported it across the country last month. Their state-of-the-\nart ``green'' home is fully equipped with bamboo I-beams, developed by \nthe SCU engineering team, retractable walls, ``smart'' windows and \nsolar thermal panels, in addition to generating its own solar \nelectricity. The solutions to our environmental challenges lie in new \ntechnologies like these.\n  Buildings are responsible for 40 percent of greenhouse gas emissions. \nThis means that taking the steps to make our homes more efficient will \nensure a better, greener future for generations to come. Building \nenergy efficient homes and buildings, increasing our use of solar \npower, and expanding the use of clean, renewable energy sources are \nsome of the best ways to reduce the pollution that causes global \nwarming.\n  I again commend the students of Santa Clara University for making the \ntrip to Washington and for their efforts to blaze the trail for a \nbetter, cleaner environment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/17/senate-section/article/S12983-2", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12983]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              TRIBUTE TO JUSTICE WILLIAM E. McANULTY, JR.\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I speak in memory of my dear friend, \nWilliam E. McAnulty, Jr., justice of the Kentucky State Supreme Court. \nHe died last month of lung cancer, at the age of 59.\n  Justice McAnulty should have been with us for many more years. But \nBill lived a life that could have been called complete no matter when \nhis book closed--complete because it was full of love, full of humor, \nand full of pathbreaking work.\n  Bill jumped at the chance to be the first African American to serve \non Kentucky's Supreme Court, declaring that he didn't have time to wait \nto make history. ``And to those many, many before me,'' he added, \n``thank you for not waiting.''\n  And Justice McAnulty knew that, just as he owed a debt to the civil \nrights pioneers who came before him, he in turn would be remembered by \nthose who came after: After his success, he said, black lawyers ``will \nunderstand the door is open and they are able like any other lawyer or \njudge to enter. I've looked at my entire career as being someone who \ncould pave the way for others behind me.''\n  ``He was simply born to be a judge,'' said a prominent Kentucky \nattorney. But when I met Bill at the University of Louisville law \nschool, his accomplishments on the bench were still far in the future.\n  What I remember most from our student days together is his \nmischievous streak for practical jokes and his crackling sense of \nhumor--qualities that served him wonderfully as a judge.\n  When a lawyer paused in the middle of a lengthy closing statement and \nasked Bill to wake a snoring juror, he replied: ``You put him to sleep. \nYou wake him up.'' And when this University of Louisville graduate and \nlife-long Democrat was preparing for brain surgery in the last days of \nhis life, he asked the doctor for assurances that he wouldn't wake up a \nUniversity of Kentucky fan or with the judicial perspective of Justice \nClarence Thomas.\n  Bill faced his sudden illness and his imminent death with a bravery I \nwish we could all be blessed to emulate. In one sense, it was deeply \nunfair for that sickness to strike only a year after his crowning \nachievement, service on his State's highest court. But as Bill would \nhave told us, only a false measure of success could be stolen so \neasily.\n  Bill earned a much deeper kind. In the words of Ralph Waldo Emerson \nquoted at his funeral: ``To laugh often and much; . . . To know even \none life has breathed easier because you have lived--this is to have \nsucceeded.''\n  So I join Bill's surviving loved ones--his father William, his wife \nKristi, and his four children--in their sadness. At the funeral, the \npresiding pastor implored Kentucky's Governor, ``We know you can't give \nus another Judge McAnulty, but please give us somebody like him.''\n  A success like the life of Justice William E. McAnulty, Jr., is no \ncause for mourning. But we grieve Bill's death, and I can't deny that I \nwill miss this best of friends very, very much.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/17/senate-section/article/S12983-3", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12983-S12984]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     BORDER BINATIONAL HEALTH WEEK\n\n Mr. DOMENICI.

This year's theme is ``Families in Action \nfor Health,'' which is an effort to make sure all people are healthy, \nand families working together can make sure that happens. Border States \nhave a unique set of concerns citizens elsewhere may not experience. By \nrecognizing Border Binational Health Week, we can begin a dialogue on \nthese issues, between countries.\n  Several events are being held around the State to raise awareness. \nThe events include a Red Ribbon Rally Parade and Health Fair in Sunland \nPark; a Family Health Fair in Las Cruces; a Health Disparities Forum in \nSilver City; a 1\\1/2\\ mile Walk out West in Alamogordo; and a Youth \nPromotora Training and Educational Workshop in Animas and Lordsburg. \nEach of these activities help promote healthy living in border States, \nand especially border communities.\n  It is my hope that border health will be discussed not only during \nthis week but all year long.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/17/senate-section/article/S12984-1", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12984]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        RECOGNIZING CANYON ROAD\n\n Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I wish to recognize the city of \nSanta Fe and their award for one of 2007's Great Streets. Canyon Road \nwas showcased by the American Planning Association as being one of the \ntop 10 streets in the country.\n  Canyon Road is unique in that it combines elements of commercial and \nresidential living in a way that makes guests want to visit this street \ntime and again. It is the heart of the residential arts and crafts \ndistrict, and many artists sell their work on this street. Canyon Road \nis loaded with art galleries that draw crowds of art connoisseurs and \nsimple lovers of art. Art is a huge part of the culture in Santa Fe, \nand Canyon Road epitomizes that culture. This street is enjoyed by \nlocals and tourists alike.\n  It is great to see Santa Fe recognized along with cities like New \nYork City and St. Louis. Canyon Road was listed alongside other famous \nroads, such as North Michigan Avenue in Chicago and Ocean Drive in \nMiami. It is great to see the character and distinctiveness of my State \nrepresented on lists such as these. The American Planning Association \nhas only solidified what New Mexicans already know, that this street is \na place all should enjoy. I invite all of you to visit New Mexico and \ngo take a leisurely stroll down the legendary Canyon Road. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/17/senate-section/article/S12984-2", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12984]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING MARNEE'S COOKIES\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today I recognize Marnee's Cookies, \na growing small business from my home State of Maine that recently \nopened its first retail store in Bath, ME. Marnee's Cookies, a premier \ngourmet cookie company, held the grand opening of Marnee's Cookie \nBistro on September 28 to great fanfare. Originally operated out of \nowner Marnee Robinson's kitchen, the business is now based out of a \n4,000 square-foot facility in downtown Bath, which serves as both a \ncookie factory and retail store.\n  Baking from an early age, Ms. Robinson has developed and refined the \nquintessential cookie by combining the arts of baking and design. For \nyears, family and friends have enjoyed her two signature cookies--\nNirvana and Serendipity--that became the genesis and impetus for her \nbusiness. In 2005, Ms. Robinson's entrepreneurial dream became a \nreality when Marnee's Cookies was founded, offering 13 types of gourmet \ncookies. Originally begun as a home-based Internet company run solely \nby Ms. Robinson, the demand for her product quickly expanded into a \nbooming business with loyal customers around the world, from Maine to \nCalifornia, and Paris to India. In fact, Internet orders were so strong \nthat Ms. Robinson was working 18-hour days to ship cookies worldwide. \nAs a result, her growing business needed a facility to accommodate the \nincreasing demand.\n  The expansion of Marnee's Cookies was made possible by a $150,000 \ncommunity development block grant. These grants are awarded to small \nbusinesses that will, in turn, contribute to economic development and \njob creation. The city of Bath saw great potential in Ms. Robinson's \nbusiness plan and applied for the grant on her behalf. I am confident \nthe grant will be beneficial to Marnee's Cookies, enabling it to \nfurther expand its reach and create additional jobs and opportunities \nfor Bath's residents.\n  Marnee's Cookies is also to be commended for its active involvement \nin local community and charity events. Cookies are regularly donated to \nlocal events and nonprofit organizations ranging from the Bath Soup \nKitchen to St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. Additionally, \nMarnee's Cookies holds an annual charity event on December 4--National \nCookie Day--with a portion of all holiday orders donated to a local \ncharity. These gracious acts of philanthropy cannot go unnoticed and \nare a shining example of a small business going above and beyond to \nserve the local community.\n  Marnee's Cookies is truly a success story and a bright example of \nwhat small businesses can accomplish with measured expansion and \nconsistent determination. I congratulate Marnee Robinson for her \nentrepreneurial spirit and for being an exceptional role model for \nMaine and the Nation. We at the Senate wish Marnee's Cookies all the \nbest for many more successful years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/17/senate-section/article/S12984-3", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12984]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RECOGNIZING THE SALVATION ARMY\n\n Mr. THUNE.

They own and operate the \nBlack Hills Salvation Army Camp and the Rapid City Salvation Army \nThrift Store. This ``church with its sleeves rolled up'' serves as a \nshining example of an organization that is meeting the needs of South \nDakota's citizens both physically and spiritually.\n  The Salvation Army would not be able to perform its invaluable \nmission without the hard work and dedication of the many volunteers and \nofficers who have put in countless hours serving the needs of others. \nThese compassionate individuals are truly the backbone of the Rapid \nCity community and I hope that their service will inspire others to \nlend a helping hand.\n  It gives me great pleasure to rise with the State of South Dakota in \ncongratulating the Salvation Army of Rapid City on this important \nanniversary and wish them continued success in the years to \ncome.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/17/senate-section/article/S12984-4", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12984-S12985]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      ENROLLED BILL SIGNED\n  At 10:03 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker \nhas signed the following enrolled bill:\n\n       H.R. 1495.

A bill to amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act \nof 1965 to improve standards for physical education; to the Committee \non Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the FIT Kids Act. \nThat first word, FIT, is an acronym for ``Fitness Integrated with \nTeaching''. The FIT Kids Act encourages schools to provide children \nwith quality physical education that can help them lead healthier \nlives.\n  Since the 1970s, the incidence of obesity has more than doubled for \npreschool children aged 2-5 years and for young people aged 12-19 \nyears, and has more than tripled for children aged 6-11 years. There \nare many reasons of this public health crisis, and addressing this \ncrisis will require multiple solutions as well. One critical place to \nstart is in our schools. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \nhas found that fewer than 10 percent of our public schools at all \nlevels offer daily physical education or its equivalent for the entire \nschool year for all students.\n  The FIT Kids Act would amend the No Child Left Behind Act to support \nquality physical education for all public school children through grade \n12, and ensure they receive important health and nutritional \ninformation. As a senior member of the Senate Health, Education, Labor \nand Pensions Committee, I have been working with Chairman Kennedy and \nmy other colleagues to reauthorize the No Child Left Behind Act in a \nway that improves on existing law, and gives schools and educators the \nresources they need to succeed.\n  It is truly alarming to see the discrepancies in achievement between \nchildren in the United States and children abroad. Here in the U.S., we \nhave a wide and persistent achievement gap that is leaving behind \nchildren of color, young people from disadvantaged backgrounds, and \nchildren with disabilities. I believe that the No Child Left Behind Act \ngives us a framework to reduce, and hopefully close, this achievement \ngap to ensure that children from all walks of life are achieving at \nhigh levels. I believe that we can and will reauthorize the No Child \nLeft Behind Act in a way that preserves its essential reforms and \ncontinues the progress we have made over the nearly 6 years since the \nact became law.\n  Unfortunately, despite the law's lofty goals, many educators have \ncome to see it as a burden and a hindrance to effective classroom \npractices. I admit I share many of their concerns. I am particularly \nconcerned about reports of imbalances and distortions that have come \nabout as various States and the Federal Government have pushed for \nhigher standards and greater accountability. Earlier this year, the \nCenter on Education Policy, here in Washington,\n\n[[Page S12991]]\n\nreleased a study showing that, as a result of NCLB, many school \ndistricts have cut back on the time spent teaching subjects other than \nmath and reading.\n  I am especially concerned by the finding that time spent on physical \neducation has dropped by 9 percent, and recess by 6 percent. A new \nelementary school in Atlanta was actually built without a playground! \nThis is just plain wrong-headed and short-sighted for two big reasons: \none, we are fighting a childhood obesity epidemic of frightening \nproportions. Two, as any teacher or parent knows, kids have got to have \ntime to play and burn off energy if they are going to be in a proper \nframe of mind to learn.\n  This legislation will provide parents with information on the time \nand resources devoted to giving their children a quality physical \neducation. Specifically, the bill will amend the State, local education \nagency, and school report cards to include measures of physical \neducation tied to nationally recognized guidelines and standards. It is \nimportant to note, however, that this legislation will not amend the \nschool accountability process to include measures of physical \neducation. However, by including this new information on report cards \nwe will give parents the data they need in order to assess whether \ntheir children are receiving an appropriate physical education.\n  In addition, the bill promotes teacher professionalism in the field \nof physical education in order to promote healthy lifestyles and \nphysical activity, and thereby to boost students' readiness to learn. \nThe bill promotes physical activity in after-school programs. It amends \nthe school counseling program to take into account students' emotional \nand physical wellbeing. It supports efforts to train parents to \nencourage healthy behaviors and physical activity.\n  Finally, this legislation authorizes research into the ways physical \nactivity can be incorporated into all aspects of the school day, as \nwell as research into the impact of physical activity on students' \nability to learn, and into the best ways to measure student progress in \nincreasing physical activity.\n  I am pleased that this bill is strongly supported by the American \nHeart Association, the National Parent Teacher Association, the \nAmerican School Counselor Association, YMCA of the USA, National \nAssociation for Sport and Physical Education, the Campaign to End \nObesity, and many other leading organizations in the fields of \neducation and health.\n  The FIT Kids Act shines a spotlight on children's heath and how our \nschools can play a greater role in teaching our children healthy \nbehaviors. As we move forward in reauthorizing the No Child Left Behind \nAct, we cannot neglect the importance of proper physical education. \nStudents should be learning healthy behaviors and the importance of \nphysical activity, and why these lessons will be important throughout \ntheir lives. The FIT Kids Act provides the framework to accomplish \nthis. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. VOINOVICH (for himself and Mr. Brown):\n  S. 2174. A bill to designate the facility of the United States Postal \nService located at 175 South Monroe Street in Tiffin, Ohio, as the \n``Paul E. Gillmor Post Office Building''; to the Committee on Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nto name the Post Office in Tiffin, Ohio, after the late U.S. \nRepresentative Paul E. Gillmor. It is my honor to introduce this bill \nbecause of my close relationship with Congressman Gillmor, and the \nutmost respect I have for him and his service to the people of Ohio. I \nwould like to thank Senator Brown for his cosponsorship.\n  Paul and I met four decades ago in 1967 when we began our careers \ntogether, Paul as a State senator and I as a member of the Ohio House. \nPaul was immensely successful and well-respected because he treated \nothers with dignity and respect.\n  During his tenure as president of the Ohio Senate, he was able to put \npartisan politics aside and work together with Governor Celeste for the \nbest interests of the state.\n  Paul had a wonderful knack for being able to work with people to get \nthings done. He led by example, and his enthusiasm and ability always \nmade you want to be on his team. He left an indelible mark on the \npeople he worked with which is a part of his wonderful, lasting legacy.\n  When I came to the Senate I knew I had a real friend in Paul Gillmor. \nMy only regret is that I did not have more time to spend with him.\n  Because of Paul's diligent and devoted service to his country, it is \nfitting that the post office in Tiffin, Ohio, should soon bear his \nname. Not far from his small home town of Old Fort, Ohio; Tiffin was \nchosen in concurrence with the wishes of his wife, Karen Gillmor.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. CLINTON:\n  S. 2175. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act with regard to \nresearch on asthma, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I rise today to reintroduce the Family \nAsthma Act, legislation that would improve our federal government's \nresponse to this epidemic. The number of people with asthma has more \nthan doubled in the past twenty years, and today, more than 32 million \nAmericans, including more than 9 million children, have been diagnosed \nwith asthma. By 2020, asthma is expected to strike 1 in 14 Americans \nand 1 in 5 families.\n  While deaths and hospitalizations from asthma are decreasing, the \ndisease has a disproportionate impact among racial and ethnic minority \npopulations. The emergency department visit rate for blacks seeking \nasthma treatment was 350 percent higher than that of the rates of \nwhites, while the hospitalization rate for blacks with asthma was 240 \npercent higher than the rate of whites with asthma. Puerto Rican \npopulations are 95 percent more likely to be diagnosed with asthma than \nwhite populations. Women are also disproportionately impacted, with \nasthma hospitalization rates approximately 35 percent higher among \nfemales than males.\n  Our legislation seeks to reverse these disparities. It would set up \npilot projects to increase patient self-management, and allow for a \nbetter understanding of the environmental factors, like indoor and \noutdoor air pollution, that contribute to asthma. It would improve our \nsurveillance and education efforts through the Centers for Disease \nControl and Prevention, so that we identify and target interventions to \nthe populations with the highest burdens of asthma. And it would train \nproviders to recognize the links between environmental pollution and \nasthma, in order to better treat and manage this condition.\n  This legislation contains the following components: it establishes \npilot projects to improve asthma management and increase our knowledge \nof the environmental and genetic links to asthma. The Family Asthma Act \nestablishes a $10 million annual grant program through the National \nInstitutes of Health to establish pilot research projects that assist \npatients with asthma management. These projects will also allow \nscientists to engage in research on the environmental and genetic \nfactors that contribute to severe, persistent asthma.\n  It directs our Government's asthma coordinating body to review and \nmake recommendations for future directions in research and \ninterventions. This legislation directs the National Asthma Education \nand Prevention Program to review current private and public sector \nefforts in combating asthma, and make recommendations as to how to \nstrengthen those efforts in order to reduce the impact of this disease \nupon our health care system.\n  It increases funding to the CDC for education and surveillance. The \nbill provides $10 million annually to increase CDC's educational \nefforts, with state, local and nonprofit partners, to raise awareness \nof both asthma and ways to manage the disease. It also increases the \nscope of CDC's asthma surveillance activities to include \nhospitalization data, so as to better measure the impact of asthma at \nboth the national and local level.\n  It creates a fellowship program to train providers about the links \nbetween the environment and asthma. Through this bill, the National \nInstitutes of Environmental Health Sciences will set up a $2 million \nfellowship program to\n\n[[Page S12992]]\n\nhelp a broad spectrum of health care providers learn about the links \nbetween the environment and asthma, and increase their ability to \naddress those links in clinical practice and asthma management \nprograms.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues in the Senate to move \nthis legislation forward and address the growing incidence of asthma in \nour country.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter of support be printed in the \nRecord.\n       There being no objection, the material was ordered to be \n     placed in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                    American Lung Association,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 17, 2007.\n     Hon. Hillary Rodham Clinton,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Clinton: The American Lung Association \n     strongly supports your Family Asthma Act. Once enacted into \n     law, this measure will result in much-needed research into \n     factors contributing to asthma and the alarming effects of \n     asthma on the health of Americans, particularly children, \n     minorities, women and the elderly.\n       As you know, over 22 million Americans currently have \n     asthma, including more than six million children. Asthma is \n     the leading cause of chronic illness among children in the \n     U.S. and the third-leading cause of hospitalization among \n     kids under 15 years of age. It also results in almost 13 \n     million days of missed school annually. Asthma takes a \n     significant toll on the public, increasing absenteeism from \n     work, as well as the financial burden of asthma treatment. \n     The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) \n     estimates that 11 million workdays are missed annually as a \n     result of asthma and it is estimated to cost almost $15 \n     billion in direct health care costs each year. Asthma also \n     disproportionately affects women and minorities.\n       The introduction of this legislation comes at an important \n     time: this week, the National Asthma Education and Prevention \n     Program is issuing revised guidelines, emphasizing the \n     importance of asthma control and suggesting new approaches \n     for monitoring asthma. The new guidelines will help doctors \n     and their patients select a treatment based on the patient's \n     needs and level of asthma, emphasizing the importance of \n     regularly monitoring the patient's asthma level so that \n     treatments can be adjusted necessary.\n       However, despite these new guidelines, nationwide efforts \n     to monitor asthma prevalence are hampered by a lack of \n     consistent data. Your legislation will require that asthma \n     surveillance activities be conducted so that critical \n     information on the prevalence and severity of asthma, the \n     effectiveness of public health asthma interventions and the \n     quality of asthma management is collected. The Family Asthma \n     Act will also require greater federal coordination to create \n     a national plan to combat asthma.\n       Thank you for your leadership on this critical public \n     health issue. The American Lung Association looks forward to \n     working with you to see the Family Asthma Act become law.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Bernadette A. Toomey,\n                                                President and CEO.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERRY (for himself and Mr. Hatch):\n  S. 2178. A bill to expedite the adjudication of employer petitions \nfor aliens with extraordinary artistic ability; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, one of the best ways that the United States \ncan gain understanding and appreciation of other cultures is through \nthe arts. Exposing children and adults alike to the creativity of other \ncountries enriches our own artistic talents and helps bridge the gap \nbetween nations. It is for those reasons my colleague Senator Hatch and \nI have introduced the Arts Require Timely Service, ARTS, Act.\n  This legislation helps streamline the visa process and waive fees so \nthat foreign artists and musicians can share their talents in the \nUnited States. Currently, the visa process for visiting artists is slow \nand costly, often times prohibiting artists from coming to the United \nStates to share their talents. Breaking down these barriers is \nimportant and we shouldn't let the politics of immigration interfere \nwith expanding our cultural horizons.\n  I am proud to stand with Senator Hatch and the Performing Arts Visa \nTask Force to try and help artists visit our country and inspire our \ncommunities. I hope our colleagues will join us and pass this sensible \nreform to expedite cultural exchanges and artistic expression.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to join with Senator John \nKerry in introducing the Arts Require Timely Service, ARTS, Act. The \nARTS Act would reduce the current processing times for ``O'' and ``P'' \narts-related visa petitions filed by, or on behalf of, nonprofit arts-\nrelated organizations to a maximum of 45 days.\n  Unfortunately, delays by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration \nServices are making it increasingly difficult for international artists \nto appear in the U.S. Nonprofit arts organizations confront long waits \nand uncertainty in gaining approval for visa petitions for foreign \nartists. Most nonprofit arts cannot afford the Premium Processing \nService, guaranteeing processing within 15 days upon payment of an \nadditional $1,000 fee per petition. This is burdensome for many \nnonprofit arts organizations leaving them to await the unpredictability \nof the regular visa process.\n  Performances and other cultural events are date, time and location-\nspecific. The nature of scheduling, booking, and confirming highly \nsought-after guest soloists and performing groups requires that the \ntiming of the visa process be efficient and reliable. There is a \ncontinuing risk that foreign guest artists will be unable to enter the \nU.S. in time for their engagements, causing burdens on nonprofit arts \norganizations, international artists, and the local artists who were \nscheduled to perform alongside the international guest.\n  In my home State of Utah, the Utah Symphony & Opera has witnessed \nfirst-hand how delays and unpredictability in artist visa processing \nhave denied Utahns the opportunity to experience international \nartistry. To make matters worse, cancellations create high economic \nrisks for these nonprofit arts institutions as they must sell tickets \nin advance, creating a financial obligation to their audiences.\n  Congress has already indicated strong, bipartisan support for the \nARTS Act. In fact, the provision enjoys support from key House and \nSenate Judiciary Committee members and it was included in the 2006 \nSenate comprehensive immigration reform bill. I agree with Homeland \nSecurity Secretary Michael Chertoff when he said, ``Our heritage and \nour national character inspire us to create a more welcoming society \nfor those who lawfully come to our shores to work, learn, and visit.'' \nIndeed, this noncontroversial improvement to the artist visa process \nwill strengthen our ties with other countries, enrich our Nation's \nculture, and provide a wonderful opportunity to learn from foreign \nartists.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support the ARTS Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. COLLINS (for herself, Mr. Casey, Mr. Bond, Ms. Cantwell, \n        Mr. Roberts, and Mr. Reed):\n  S. 2181, A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprotect Medicare beneficiaries' access to home health services under \nthe Medicare program; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senators Casey, \nBond, Cantwell, Roberts and Reed in introducing legislation, the Home \nHealth Care Access Protection Act, to prevent the devastating 11.75 \npercent cut that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, CMS, \nis planning to make in Medicare home health payment rates over the next \n4 years.\n  Home health has become an increasingly important part of our health \ncare system. The kinds of highly skilled and often technically complex \nservices that our Nation's home health agencies provide have helped to \nkeep families together and enabled millions of our most frail and \nvulnerable older and disabled persons to avoid hospitals and nursing \nhomes and stay just where they want to be--in the comfort and security \nof their own homes. Moreover, by helping these individuals to avoid \nmore costly institutional care, they are saving Medicare millions of \ndollars each year.\n  That is why I find it so ironic that the Medicare home health benefit \nis once again under attack.\n  The House version of the SCHIP reauthorization bill proposed cutting \nMedicare home health spending by $2.6 billion over 5 years, and the \nSenate may soon be considering similar cuts.\n  To make matters worse, CMS has proposed additional administrative \ncuts that are estimated to total more than $6 billion over the next 5 \nyears. If allowed to go forward, this ``double whammy'' for home care \nwill result in\n\n[[Page S12993]]\n\ncuts in excess of $8.6 billion over 5 years from a program that costs \nless than $15 billion a year. This simply is not right, and it \ncertainly is not in the best interest of our Nation's seniors who rely \non home care to keep them out of hospitals, nursing homes and other \ninstitutions.\n  The administrative cuts proposed by CMS are based on the assertion \nthat home health agencies have intentionally ``gamed the system'' by \nclaiming that their patients have conditions of higher clinical \nseverity than they actually have in order to receive higher Medicare \npayments. This unfounded allegation of ``case mix creep'' is based on \nwhat CMS contends to be an increase in the average clinical assessment \n``score'' of home health patients over the last few years.\n  In fact, there are very real clinical and policy explanations for why \nthe average clinical severity of home care patients' health conditions \nmay have increased over the years. For example, the incentives built \ninto the hospital DRG reimbursement system have led to the faster \ndischarge of sicker patients. Advances in technology and changes in \nmedical practice have also enabled home health agencies to treat more \ncomplicated medical conditions that earlier could only be treated in \nhospitals, nursing homes, or inpatient rehabilitation facilities.\n  These administrative cuts are proposed to go into effect on January \nl. This would be devastating to home health agencies in Maine and \nacross the Nation, particularly given that there is no evidence of \nintentional ``gaming'' on the part of home health agencies to warrant \nsuch a severe financial penalty.\n  Moreover, CMS has not made public any of the details of the research \nmethod, data and findings they used to justify the planned cuts, making \nit impossible for Congress or the public to evaluate the reliability or \nthe validity of its actions.\n  What is of most concern to me, however, is that this unfair penalty \nis being assessed across the board, even for home health agencies that \nshowed a decrease in their clinical assessment scores. If an individual \nhome health agency is truly gaming the system, CMS should target that \none agency, not penalize everyone.\n\n  The fact is that the Medicare home health benefit has already taken a \nlarger hit in spending cuts over the past 10 years than any other \nMedicare benefit. In fact, home health as a share of Medicare spending \nhas dropped from 8.7 percent in 1997 to 3.2 percent today, and is \nprojected to decline to 2.6 percent of Medicare spending in 2015.\n  This downward spiral in home health spending began with provisions in \nthe Balanced Budget Act of 1997, which resulted in a 50 percent cut in \nMedicare home health spending by 2001--far more than the Congress \nintended or the Congressional Budget Office projected.\n  And home health spending continues to be much lower than CBO \nprojections. In 2000, the CBO projected that home health spending in \n2006 would total $21.1 billion under the new home health prospective \npayment system. The actual total expenditures for home health last year \nwere $13.2 billion. If home health agencies were engaging in the kind \nof widespread ``upcoding'' that CMS has alleged, home health spending \nwould be exceeding CBO's projections. In fact, home health spending has \nbeen far less than expected.\n  Home health care has consistently proven to be a compassionate and \ncost-effective alternative to institutional care. Additional deep cuts \nwill be completely counterproductive to our efforts to control overall \nhealth care costs. They will also place the quality of home health \nservices at risk, particularly given ever-rising transportation, \nstaffing, and technology costs. Cuts of this magnitude could leave some \nproviders with no alternative but to reduce the number of home health \nvisits or patient admissions, which would ultimately threaten seniors' \naccess to care and clinical outcomes. Or they could cause them to close \ntheir doors altogether.\n  The legislation that we are introducing today will block the ``case \nmix creep'' cuts that were proposed by CMS as part of the final home \nhealth prospective payment system regulation in August. It will also \nestablish a reliable and transparent process that the Department of \nHealth and Human Services must use to justify that payment rate cuts \nare needed to account for improper changes in ``case mix scoring.'' A \ncompanion bill to our legislation is being introduced in the House by \nRepresentative Jim McGovern. \n  The Home Health Care Access Protection Act of 2007 will help to \nensure that our seniors and disabled Americans continue to have access \nto the quality home health services they deserve, and I encourage all \nof my colleagues to sign on as cosponsors.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REED (for himself and Mr. Smith):\n  S. 2182. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act with respect \nto mental health services; to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I introduce the Community Mental \nHealth Services Improvement Act. For decades, we have known that people \nsuffering from mental illness die sooner, on average 25 years sooner, \nand have higher rates of disability than the general population. People \nwith mental illness are at greater risk of preventable health \nconditions such as heart disease and diabetes. With this legislation, \nwe are taking steps to address these disturbing trends.\n  We know that mental health and physical health are inter-related: \neach contributes to the other. Yet historically mental health and \nphysical health have been treated separately. The vision of this \nlegislation is that the two should be integrated in a single medical \nhome.\n  In a recent survey, 91 percent of community mental health centers \nsaid that improving the quality of health care is a priority. However, \nonly one-third have the capacity to provide health care on site, and \nonly one-fifth provide medical referrals off site. The centers \nidentified a lack of financial resources as the biggest barrier to \nintegrating treatment.\n  Accordingly, this legislation provides grants to integrate treatment \nfor mental health, substance abuse, and primary and specialty care. \nGrantees can use the funds for screenings, basic health care services \non site, referrals, or information technology.\n  This legislation is also a comprehensive response to the workforce \ncrisis identified by the President's New Freedom Commission on Mental \nHealth. It provides grants for a wide range of innovative recruitment \nand retention efforts, from loan forgiveness and repayment programs, to \nplacement and support for new mental health professionals, to expanding \nmental health education and training programs.\n  Finally, this legislation provides grants for tele-mental health in \nmedically-underserved areas, and invests in health IT for mental health \nproviders. These proposals address the twin goals of improving the \nquality of mental health treatment while expanding access to that \ntreatment in rural and underserved areas.\n  This bipartisan legislation, which I am introducing with my colleague \nSenator Smith, has the overwhelming support of the mental health \ncommunity. It has been endorsed by the National Council for Community \nBehavioral Healthcare, the National Alliance on Mental Illness, Mental \nHealth America, the Campaign for Mental Health Reform, and the American \nPsychological Association. I am especially grateful for the support of \nthe Rhode Island Council of Community Mental Health Organizations, \nwhose members treat close to 15,000 Rhode Islanders of all ages.\n  Today Senator Smith and I are also introducing the Community Mental \nHealth Infrastructure Improvements Act. It should be obvious that this \nlegislation is a necessary complement to the Community Mental Health \nServices Improvement Act: without community mental health centers, \nthere can be no services to improve. Accordingly, this legislation \nprovides grants to states for the construction and modernization of \nfacilities that provide mental health services.\n  As a member of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions, I will work to include\n\n[[Page S12994]]\n\nthese important initiatives in legislation that renews and improves \nSubstance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, SAMHSA, \nprograms. It is my hope that with its passage, we can begin to address \nthe challenge of improving and expanding access to mental health \nservices in a comprehensive way.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2182\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to provide \ngrants for community-based mental health infrastructure improvement; to \nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions. '\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague, Senator \nJack Reed of Rhode Island, to introduce two bills, S. 2182 and S. 2183, \nthat we hope will have a tremendous impact on the quality and \naccessibility of mental health care throughout the U.S. Our bills, the \nCommunity Mental Health Services Improvement Act and the Community-\nBased Mental Health Infrastructure Improvement Act, support those \nprograms that serve as an important line of defense against mental \nillnesses and suicide.\n  Community mental health programs are the backbone of our mental \nhealth system by providing access to vital mental health care services \nto those in need. Unfortunately, community mental health centers are \nsuffering under tremendous fiscal constraints to provide care in their \ncommunities. They operate, usually, on a small budget and with little \nresources to improve their facilities. Senator Reed and I are \nintroducing these two bills to help community mental health centers \nobtain the resources necessary to meet their needs.\n  The goal of the Community Mental Health Services Improvement Act is \nto provide funding to promote the provision of mental health services \nlocally. The bill would establish a grant program for community mental \nhealth programs to provide health care services, screenings, referrals, \ninformation technology or facility improvements. The bill also \nestablishes grants for programs that integrate treatment for \nindividuals with a serious mental illness and a co-occurring substance \nabuse disorder. Grants also would be provided to mental health \nnonprofit organizations or accredited institutions to establish or \nexpand accredited mental health education and training programs. \nFinally, this bill will provide grants to community mental health \nprograms for tele-mental health in medically-underserved areas.\n  The second bill that we are introducing today is one that is very \nimportant to mental health programs in my home State of Oregon. \nCurrently, patients are waiting for important mental health care due to \nlack of building capacity. Our bill, the Community-Based Mental Health \nInfrastructure Improvements Act, would provide funding for bricks and \nmortar infrastructure for mental health programs in our communities. \nThere is no Federal funding currently available for construction of \ncommunity mental health facilities. This bill ensures that individuals \nwith mental illness are not turned away because a facility does not \nhave the resources to keep their building up to code or because a \nbuilding expansion could not occur to keep up with a growing population \nbecause no funds were available.\n  In developing this legislation, I worked with the Health Resources \nand Services Administration, HRSA, and the Substance Abuse and Mental \nHealth Services Administration, SAMHSA, to determine how best to make \nfunding available for community mental health programs. This bill would \nencourage a continuation of this important partnership between SAMHSA, \nHRSA and States to ensure that competitive grant funding is made \navailable to community mental health programs throughout the country.\n  We know that mental illness can affect people of any age, of any race \nand of any income. As a parent with a son who struggled with mental \nillness, I know all too well the indiscriminate nature of the illness \nand the frightening statistics of its regular occurrence for those we \nlove. In any given year, more than a quarter of our Nation's adults, 60 \nmillion people, suffer from a diagnosable mental disorder, many of whom \nsuffer in silence. Mental disorders are the leading cause of disability \nfor those aged 15-44 in the U.S. and in Canada.\n  Mental illness is just as deadly and serious as a physical illness. \nSuicide takes the lives of more than 30,000 people each year, with more \nthan 700,000 attempts. Suicides outnumber homicides three to one each \nyear. People who suffer from mental illness also suffer from much \nhigher rates of other chronic conditions, such as cardiovascular \ndisease. However, unlike heart attacks and strokes, mental illness is \nnot something that we, as a Nation, want to talk about.\n  In a 2004 report by the Oregon Governor's Mental Health Taskforce, \nthey found that in any given year 175,000 adults and 75,000 children \nunder the age of 18 are in need of mental health services in my home \nState. Effective treatment exists for most people suffering. Help is \nout there, and these bills will help ensure that this help can be \naccessed effectively.\n  I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support the \nimportant work of community mental health centers by voting for these \nbills.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nplaced in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2183\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to permit individuals who are employees of a grantee \nthat is receiving funds under section 330 of the Public Health Service \nAct to enroll in health insurance coverage provided under the Federal \nEmployees Health Benefits Program; to the Committee on Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Community Health \nCenter Employee Health Coverage Act of 2007, a bill that will help \nprovide community health centers, or CHCs, better access to more \naffordable health insurance for their employees. I am pleased to have \nmy colleagues Senators Bingaman, Salazar and Sanders join me as \noriginal cosponsors on this important proposal.\n  CHCs form the backbone of the Nation's health care safety net. They \nprovide essential medical services to some of our most vulnerable \ncitizens, including the uninsured and Medicaid and Medicare \nbeneficiaries. In my home State of Oregon, health centers provide over \n130 points of access, where upwards of 180,000 individuals receive care \neach year. Approximately 41 percent of those served are uninsured and \n36 percent are on Medicaid, and most all reside in either a rural or \neconomically depressed area. Clearly, CHCs have an important role in \nensuring that those who otherwise might be unable to afford health \ncoverage have access to the care they need.\n  CHCs also serve their patients in a very efficient manner. Studies \nhave shown that care provided Medicaid patients at CHCs costs 30 \npercent less than care provided in other settings. This is mainly due \nto a lower number of specialty referrals and fewer overall hospital \nadmissions. CHCs effectively demonstrate how focusing on primary and \npreventive care can help keep individuals healthier, which ultimately \nenhances their lives and saves the broader health care system money. \nAbove and beyond the efficiencies CHCs have achieved in service \ndelivery, patients report overwhelming satisfaction for the treatment \nthey are provided. Health care providers across the spectrum would be \nwell-served by emulating CHCs' example of delivering affordable, high-\nquality health care in an efficient manner.\n  Given the enormous value CHCs have to the U.S. health care system, I \nbelieve Congress should do all it can to support their mission. I \ncommend President Bush's commitment to increasing funding for health \ncenter expansion in recent years. I am pleased the administration's \nrequest for $180\n\n[[Page S12998]]\n\nmillion in new funding in fiscal year 2007 was included in the Senate's \nversion of the budget resolution. As the appropriations process \ncontinues to move forward, I hope that those much-needed funds are \nultimately approved by Congress.\n  The bill I am filing today will compliment the increased funding CHCs \nhave received in recent years. Just like businesses across the nation, \nhealth centers are coping with the rising cost of providing health \nbenefit to their employees. Premiums for private health insurance grew \nby 9.5 percent in 2005, the fifth consecutive year of increases over 9 \npercent. Because CHCs operate on very limited budgets, it has become \nmore and more difficult for them to absorb these increased costs while \ncontinuing to provide affordable health care to their patients.\n  It is important to note that CHCs rely upon the Federal Government \nfor more than half of their operating revenues. Each year, health \ncenters receive 26 percent of their funding from direct Federal grants \nand another 36 percent from the Medicaid Program. Because CHCs are \npredominantly a Federal enterprise, I believe it makes sense for them \nto be able to reap many of the same benefits of other Federal entities. \nThat is why the bill I am filing today would allow CHCs to purchase \nmore affordable health insurance coverage for their employees through \nthe Federal Employee Health Benefits Program, FEHBP.\n  Allowing federally funded entities to purchase health coverage \nthrough FEHBP is not unprecedented. Employees of Gallaudet University \nand certain U.S. Department of Agriculture grantees already are able to \nparticipate in FEHBP as if they were directly employed by the Federal \nGovernment. Considering that CHC providers are already deemed ``Federal \nemployees'' for the purpose of receiving medical liability protection \nthrough the Federal Government, it is a logical next step to allow them \nto purchase health coverage through FEHBP. In doing so, we will be able \nto provide CHCs much needed security in knowing that their employees \nwill have steady access to affordable health insurance.\n  I believe that in the long run, CHCs will be able to achieve a great \ndeal of savings by purchasing health coverage for their employees \nthrough FEHBP. Premiums for policies purchased through FEHBP \nconsistently grow at a much slower rate than other commercial policies. \nEvery dollar CHCs save in employee benefit costs can be redirected into \nmedical care for the vulnerable populations they serve. Access to FEHBP \ncoverage also may help some CHCs provide health benefits to their \nemployees for the first time. This could help recruit much needed \nmedical personnel in underserved and rural communities. I am hopeful \nhealth centers in rural parts of my State will be able to attract the \nphysicians they so desperately need by offering them FEHBP coverage.\n  There is wide support for CHCs in the Senate, as evidenced by the \ndevelopment of a number of CHC-related measures. Earlier this year, I \njoined a group of bipartisan Senators in filing the Community Health \nCenter Reauthorization Act, to ensure that vulnerable populations have \naccess to basic health care for the next several years. I hope the \nSenate's leadership will move these bills quickly through the process, \nas a sign of appreciation for the important role CHCs play in the U.S. \nhealth care system.\n  I ask unanimous consent that full text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n\n                                S. 2186\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Community Health Center \n     Employee Health Coverage Act of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Federally Qualified Health Centers (referred to in this \n     section as ``FQHCs'') are required under section 330 of the \n     Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 254b) to be located in, \n     and serve, a community that is designated as ``medically \n     underserved''.\n       (2) FQHCs are required under such section 330 to make its \n     services available to all residents of the community, without \n     regard to ability to pay, and to make those services \n     affordable by discounting charges for otherwise uncovered \n     care to low-income families in accordance with family income.\n       (3) FQHCs are required under such section 330 to provide \n     comprehensive primary health care services, including \n     preventive care, care for illness or injury, services which \n     improve the accessibility of care, and the effectiveness of \n     care.\n       (4) FQHCs are required under such section 330 to be \n     governed by a board of directors, a majority of whose members \n     are active, registered patients of the health center, thus \n     ensuring that the center is responsive to the health care \n     needs of the community it serves.\n       (5) FQHCs delivered comprehensive primary and preventive \n     care to more than 16,000,000 people in 2006, more than \n     6,000,000 of whom had no health insurance coverage.\n       (6) FQHCs employ nearly 100,000 people across the United \n     States.\n       (7) FQHCs are being challenged by increasing financial \n     pressures that jeopardize their ability to provide health \n     services to medically underserved populations, including the \n     elderly, the uninsured, and lower-income individuals.\n       (8) Health insurance costs in the small employer market \n     have risen more than 30 percent in the past 2 years, forcing \n     many FQHCs to use additional Federal funding to continue to \n     provide health insurance coverage for their employees.\n       (9) The Federal Government negotiates premiums with health \n     insurance companies for millions of Federal employees, \n     thereby ensuring the best possible rates under the Federal \n     Employee Health Benefit Program (referred to in this section \n     as ``FEHBP'').\n       (10) Last year FEHBP premiums increased 6.6 percent, far \n     less than that of even large employers.\n       (11) FQHCs receive Federal grants from the Health Resource \n     and Services Administration that help cover the cost of \n     providing high quality, affordable health care for everyone \n     in their communities, including the uninsured.\n       (12) FQHCs use a portion of their Federal grant to cover \n     the cost of health insurance for their employees.\n       (13) As health insurance premiums rise, FQHCs may be forced \n     to reduce health insurance coverage for their own employees, \n     or reduce the availability of care in their communities.\n       (14) Last year, almost 1,400,000 Americans joined the ranks \n     of the uninsured--bringing our Nation's total to more than \n     47,000,000 people without health insurance, while another \n     30,000,000 or more are underinsured.\n       (15) The uninsured are in significantly worse health than \n     those with health insurance, receive fewer preventive \n     services, are less likely to receive regular care for chronic \n     diseases, and are more likely to be hospitalized for a \n     condition that could have been treated more effectively with \n     timely access to ambulatory care.\n       (16) Adding FQHC employees to the list of those covered \n     under the FEHBP would help control rising health insurance \n     costs, reduce the cost of providing health insurance to their \n     employees, and enable centers to use scarce funds to continue \n     providing care in their communities.\n\n     SEC. 3. ADDITION OF HEALTH CENTER EMPLOYEES TO FEHBP.\n\n       (a) Definitions.--Section 8901(l) of title 5, United States \n     Code, is amended--\n       (1) in subparagraph (H), by striking ``and'' at the end;\n       (2) in subparagraph (I), by striking the period and \n     inserting ``; and''; and\n       (3) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(J) an individual who is an employee of a federally \n     qualified health center (as defined in section 1905(l)(2)(B) \n     of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1396d(l)(2)(B))) that \n     has elected to offer coverage under this chapter or who is an \n     employee of a grantee that is receiving funds under section \n     330(l) of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 254b(l)) \n     that has elected to offer coverage under this chapter.''.\n       (b) Employees Health Benefits Fund.--Section 8909 of title \n     5, United States Code, is amended by adding at the end the \n     following:\n       ``(h) An individual who is an employee of a federally \n     qualified health center (as defined in section 1905(l)(2)(B) \n     of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1396d(l)(2)(B))) who \n     has elected coverage under this chapter or who is an employee \n     of a grantee that is receiving funds under section 330(l) of \n     the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 254b(l)) who has \n     elected coverage under this chapter shall be required to pay \n     currently into the Employees Health Benefits Fund, under \n     arrangements satisfactory to the Office, an amount equal to \n     the sum of--\n       ``(1) the employee and agency contributions which would be \n     required in the case of an employee enrolled in the same \n     health benefits plan and level of benefits; and\n       ``(2) an amount, determined under regulations prescribed by \n     the Office, necessary for administrative expenses, but not to \n     exceed 2 percent of the total amount under clause (i).''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Salazar, Mr. Smith, \n        Mr. Akaka, and Mr. Sanders):\n  S. 2188. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nestablish a prospective payment system instead of the reasonable cost-\nbased reimbursement method for Medicare-covered services provided by \nFederally qualified health centers and to expand the scope of such \ncovered services to account for expansions in the scope of\n\n[[Page S12999]]\n\nservices provided by Federally qualified health centers since the \ninclusion of such services for coverage under the Medicare Program; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today with Senators Snowe, \nSalazar, Smith, Akaka, and Sanders to introduce the Medicare Access to \nCommunity Health Center, MATCH, Act, which would address a long \nstanding problem for a key component of our Nation's health care safety \nnet, community health centers. These facilities serve as medical homes \nto nearly 16 million underserved patients. Over 1 million of those \npatients are Medicare beneficiaries. Health centers are known for \nproviding high quality, comprehensive care to some of our Nation's most \nvulnerable populations.\n  Over 15 years ago, Congress created the Federally Qualified Health \nCenter, FQHC, Medicare benefit to ensure that health centers were not \nforced to subsidize Medicare payments with Federal grant dollars. \nCongress required centers to be paid their reasonable costs for \nproviding care to their patients. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid \nServices later established a per visit payment cap in regulations based \non a statute applicable to Rural Health Clinics. CMS applied the cap to \nFQHCs without meaningful data to support the payment limit but with the \npromise of future reviews to guarantee that health centers were \nadequately reimbursed. However, these reviews have not taken place. \nNow, 15 years later, over \\3/4\\ of health centers are losing money \nserving Medicare beneficiaries, with losses totaling over $50 million \nannually according to an analysis done by the National Association of \nCommunity Health Centers. In my home State of New Mexico, NACHC \nestimates that health centers have lost more than a million dollars \nannually.\n  I have repeatedly asked CMS to review this antiquated cap but I have \nhad little success. So I rise today to introduce legislation to improve \nthe Medicare payment mechanism for FQHCs. MATCH will establish a \nProspective Payment System for FQHCs, based on actual cost of providing \ncare to health center patients. This new mechanism mirrors the \nsuccessful Medicaid FQHC Prospective Payment System. By reforming the \npayment structure at FQHCs, we will ensure health centers are able to \ndedicate their Federal grant dollars for their original intent, \nproviding care to the uninsured. This new mechanism will also increase \nefficiency and stability in the Medicare program for health centers.\n  This legislation is long overdue. I ask my colleagues to join me in \nstrengthening the Medicare FQHC program to ensure that health centers \ncan continue to provide high quality, affordable primary and preventive \ncare to our Nation's seniors and people with disabilities.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nplaced in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2188\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Medicare Access to Community \n     Health Centers (MATCH) Act of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that:\n       (1) National importance.--Community health centers serve as \n     the medical home and family physician to over 16,000,000 \n     people nationally. Patients of community health centers \n     represent 1 in 7 low-income persons, 1 in 8 uninsured \n     Americans, 1 in 9 Medicaid beneficiaries, 1 in 10 minorities, \n     and 1 in 10 rural residents.\n       (2) Health care safety net.--Because Federally qualified \n     health centers (FQHCs) are generally located in medically \n     underserved areas, the patients of Federally qualified health \n     centers are disproportionately low income, uninsured or \n     publicly insured, and minorities, and they frequently have \n     poorer health and more complicated, costly medical needs than \n     patients nationally. As a chief component of the health care \n     safety net, Federally qualified health centers are required \n     by regulation to serve all patients, regardless of insurance \n     status or ability to pay.\n       (3) Medicare beneficiaries.--Medicare beneficiaries are \n     typically less healthy and, therefore, costlier to treat than \n     other patients of Federally qualified health centers. \n     Medicare beneficiaries tend to have more complex health care \n     needs as--\n       (A) more than half of Medicare patients have at least 2 \n     chronic conditions;\n       (B) 45 percent take 5 or more medications; and\n       (C) over half of Medicare beneficiaries have more than 1 \n     prescribing physician.\n       (4) Need to improve fqhc payment.--While the Centers for \n     Medicare & Medicaid Services have nearly 15 years' worth of \n     cost report data from Federally qualified health centers, \n     which would equip the agency to develop a new Medicare \n     reimbursement system, the agency has failed to update and \n     improve the Medicare FQHC payment system.\n\n     SEC. 3. EXPANSION OF MEDICARE-COVERED PRIMARY AND PREVENTIVE \n                   SERVICES AT FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTERS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 1861(aa)(3) of the Social Security \n     Act (42 U.S.C. 1395x(aa)(3)) is amended to read as follows:\n       ``(3) The term `Federally qualified health center services' \n     means--\n       ``(A) services of the type described in subparagraphs (A) \n     through (C) of paragraph (1), and such other ambulatory \n     services furnished by a Federally qualified health center for \n     which payment may otherwise be made under this title if such \n     services were furnished by a health care provider or health \n     care professional other than a Federally qualified health \n     center; and\n       ``(B) preventive primary health services that a center is \n     required to provide under section 330 of the Public Health \n     Service Act,\n\n     when furnished to an individual as a patient of a Federally \n     qualified health center and such services when provided by a \n     health care provider or health care professional employed by \n     or under contract with a Federally qualified health center \n     and for this purpose, any reference to a rural health clinic \n     or a physician described in paragraph (2)(B) is deemed a \n     reference to a Federally qualified health center or a \n     physician at the center, respectively. Services described in \n     the previous sentence shall be treated as billable visits for \n     purposes of payment to the Federally qualified health \n     center.''.\n       (b) Conforming Amendment To Permit Payment for Hospital-\n     Based Services.--Section 1862(a)(14) of such Act (42 U.S.C. \n     1395y(a)(14)) is amended by inserting ``Federally qualified \n     health center services,'' after ``qualified psychologist \n     services,''.\n       (c) Effective Dates.--The amendments made by subsections \n     (a) and (b) shall apply to services furnished on or after \n     January 1, 2008.\n\n     SEC. 4.

A bill to provide for educational opportunities for all \nstudents in State public school systems, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Student Bill \nof Rights. This bill would ensure that every child in America has an \nequal opportunity to receive a high quality education.\n  The Student Bill of Rights would achieve this goal by providing \nAmerica's children with components needed for a solid education. These \ncomponents include highly qualified teachers, challenging curricula, \nsmall classes, current textbooks, quality libraries, and up-to-date \ntechnology.\n  Currently, federal law requires that schools within the same district \nprovide comparable educational services. The Student Bill of Rights \nwould extend that basic guarantee of equal opportunity to the state \nlevel by requiring comparability of resources across school districts \nwithin a state.\n  More than 50 years ago, Brown v. Board of Education struck down \nsegregation in law. Over 50 years later, we know that just because \nthere is no segregation in law does not mean that it does not persist. \nToday, our education system remains largely separate and unequal, and \nin light of a recent Supreme Court decision, we need to find more \ncreative ways to promote equity in our schools.\n  All too often, where a child's family can afford to live determines \nwhether that child is taught by a high quality teacher, has access to \nthe best courses and instructional materials, goes to school in a new, \nmodern building, and otherwise benefits from educational resources that \nhave been shown to be essential to a quality education. In fact, the \nU.S. ranks at the bottom among developed countries in the disparity in \nthe quality of schools available to wealthy and low-income children. \nThis gap is simply unacceptable, and it is why the Student Bill of \nRights is so important to our children's ability to gain the skills \nthey need to be responsible, participating citizens in our diverse \ndemocracy, and to compete and succeed in the global economy.\n  While other factors such as supportive parents, motivated peers, and \npositive role models in the community are also beneficial to academic \nachievement, we know that adequate resources are crucial to providing \nstudents with the opportunity to receive a solid education.\n  The quality of a child's education should not be determined by his or \nher ZIP code. The Student Bill of Rights will help ensure that each and \nevery child gets a decent education, and in turn, an equal opportunity \nfor a successful future. I hope that my colleagues will join me in \nsupporting the Student Bill of Rights.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2189\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) A high-quality, highly competitive education for all \n     students is imperative for the economic growth and \n     productivity of the United States, for its effective national \n     defense, and to achieve the historical aspiration to be one \n     Nation of equal citizens. It is therefore necessary and \n     proper to overcome the nationwide phenomenon of State public \n     school systems that do not meet the requirements of section \n     101(a), in which high-quality public schools typically serve \n     high-income communities and poor-quality schools typically \n     serve low-income, urban, rural, and minority communities.\n       (2) In 2005, the National Academies found in their report \n     ``Rising Above the Gathering Storm: Energizing and Employing \n     America for a Brighter Economic Future'' that the inadequate \n     preparation of kindergarten through grade 12 students in \n     science and mathematics, including the significant lack of \n     teachers qualified to teach these subjects, threatens the \n     economic prosperity of the United States. When students do \n     not receive quality mathematics and science preparation in \n     kindergarten through grade 12, they are not prepared to take \n     advanced courses in these subjects at the postsecondary \n     level, leaving the United States with a critical shortage of \n     scientists and engineers--a shortfall being filled by \n     professionals from other countries.\n       (3) There exists in the States a significant educational \n     opportunity gap for low-income, urban, rural, and minority \n     students characterized by the following:\n       (A) Continuing disparities within States in students' \n     access to the fundamentals of educational opportunity \n     described in section 102.\n       (B) Highly differential educational expenditures (adjusted \n     for cost and need) among school districts within States.\n       (C) Radically differential educational achievement among \n     students in school districts within States as measured by the \n     following:\n       (i) Achievement in mathematics, reading or language arts, \n     and science on State academic assessments required under \n     section 1111(b)(3) of the Elementary and Secondary Education \n     Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 6311(b)(3)) and on the National \n     Assessment of Educational Progress.\n       (ii) Advanced placement courses taken.\n       (iii) SAT and ACT test scores.\n       (iv) Dropout rates and graduation rates.\n       (v) College-going and college-completion rates.\n       (4) As a consequence of this educational opportunity gap, \n     the quality of a child's education depends largely upon where \n     the child's family can afford to live, and the detriments of \n     lower quality education are imposed particularly on--\n       (A) children from low-income families;\n       (B) children living in urban and rural areas; and\n       (C) minority children.\n       (5) Since 1785, Congress, exercising the power to admit new \n     States under section 3 of\n\n[[Page S13001]]\n\n     article IV of the Constitution (and previously, the Congress \n     of the Confederation of States under the Articles of \n     Confederation), has imposed upon every State, as a \n     fundamental condition of the State's admission, that the \n     State provide for the establishment and maintenance of \n     systems of public schools open to all children in such State.\n       (6) Over the years since the landmark ruling in Brown v. \n     Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483, 493 (1954), when a \n     unanimous Supreme Court held that ``the opportunity of an \n     education . . . , where the State has undertaken to provide \n     it, is a right which must be made available to all on equal \n     terms'', courts in 44 States have heard challenges to the \n     establishment, maintenance, and operation of State public \n     school systems that are separate and not educationally \n     adequate.\n       (7) In 1970, the Presidential Commission on School Finance \n     found that significant disparities in the distribution of \n     educational resources existed among school districts within \n     States because the States relied too significantly on local \n     district financing for educational revenues, and that reforms \n     in systems of school financing would increase the Nation's \n     ability to serve the educational needs of all children.\n       (8) In 1999, the National Research Council of the National \n     Academy of Sciences published a report entitled ``Making \n     Money Matter, Financing America's Schools'', which found that \n     the concept of funding adequacy, which moves beyond the more \n     traditional concepts of finance equity to focus attention on \n     the sufficiency of funding for desired educational outcomes, \n     is an important step in developing a fair and productive \n     educational system.\n       (9) In 2001, the Executive Order establishing the \n     President's Commission on Educational Resource Equity \n     declared, ``A quality education is essential to the success \n     of every child in the 21st century and to the continued \n     strength and prosperity of our Nation. . . . [L]ong-standing \n     gaps in access to educational resources exist, including \n     disparities based on race and ethnicity.'' (Exec. Order No. \n     13190, 66 Fed. Reg. 5424 (2001)).\n       (10) According to the Secretary of Education, as stated in \n     a letter (with enclosures) from the Secretary to States dated \n     January 19, 2001--\n       (A) racial and ethnic minorities continue to suffer from \n     lack of access to educational resources, including \n     ``experienced and qualified teachers, adequate facilities, \n     and instructional programs and support, including technology, \n     as well as . . . the funding necessary to secure these \n     resources''; and\n       (B) these inadequacies are ``particularly acute in high-\n     poverty schools, including urban schools, where many students \n     of color are isolated and where the effect of the resource \n     gaps may be cumulative. In other words, students who need the \n     most may often receive the least, and these students often \n     are students of color.''.\n       (11) In the amendments made by the No Child Left Behind Act \n     of 2001, Congress--\n       (A)(i) required each State to establish standards and \n     assessments in mathematics, reading or language arts, and \n     science; and\n       (ii) required schools to ensure that all students are \n     proficient in mathematics, reading or language arts, and \n     science not later than 12 years after the end of the 2001-\n     2002 school year, and held schools accountable for the \n     students' progress; and\n       (B) required each State to describe how the State will help \n     local educational agencies and schools to develop the \n     capacity to improve student academic achievement.\n       (12) The standards and accountability movement will succeed \n     only if, in addition to standards and accountability, all \n     schools have access to the educational resources necessary to \n     enable students to achieve.\n       (13) Raising standards without ensuring access to \n     educational resources may in fact exacerbate achievement gaps \n     and set children up for failure.\n       (14) According to the World Economic Forum's Global \n     Competitiveness Report 2001-2002, the United States ranks \n     last among developed countries in the difference in the \n     quality of schools available to rich and poor children.\n       (15) The persistence of pervasive inadequacies in the \n     quality of education provided by State public school systems \n     effectively deprives millions of children throughout the \n     United States of the opportunity for an education adequate to \n     enable the children to--\n       (A) acquire the knowledge and skills necessary for \n     responsible citizenship in a diverse democracy, including the \n     ability to participate fully in the political process through \n     informed electoral choice;\n       (B) meet challenging student academic achievement \n     standards; and\n       (C) be able to compete and succeed in a global economy.\n       (16) Each State government has ultimate authority to \n     determine every important aspect and priority of the public \n     school system that provides elementary and secondary \n     education to children in the State, including whether \n     students throughout the State have access to the fundamentals \n     of educational opportunity described in section 102.\n       (17) Because a well educated populace is critical to the \n     Nation's political and economic well-being and national \n     security, the Federal Government has a substantial interest \n     in ensuring that States provide a high-quality education by \n     ensuring that all students have access to the fundamentals of \n     educational opportunity described in section 102 to enable \n     the students to succeed academically and in life.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are the following:\n       (1) To further the goals of the Elementary and Secondary \n     Education Act of 1965 (as amended by the No Child Left Behind \n     Act of 2001), by holding States accountable for providing all \n     students with access to the fundamentals of educational \n     opportunity described in section 102.\n       (2) To ensure that all students in public elementary \n     schools and secondary schools receive educational \n     opportunities that enable such students to--\n       (A) acquire the knowledge and skills necessary for \n     responsible citizenship in a diverse democracy, including the \n     ability to participate fully in the political process through \n     informed electoral choice;\n       (B) meet challenging student academic achievement \n     standards; and\n       (C) be able to compete and succeed in a global economy.\n       (3) To end the pervasive pattern of States maintaining \n     public school systems that do not meet the requirements of \n     section 101(a).\n\n               TITLE I--ACCESS TO EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITY\n\n     SEC. 101. STATE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEMS.\n\n       (a) Requirements.--Each State receiving Federal financial \n     assistance for elementary or secondary education shall ensure \n     that the State's public school system provides all students \n     within the State with an education that enables the students \n     to acquire the knowledge and skills necessary for responsible \n     citizenship in a diverse democracy, including the ability to \n     participate fully in the political process through informed \n     electoral choice, to meet challenging student academic \n     achievement standards, and to be able to compete and succeed \n     in a global economy, through--\n       (1) the provision of fundamentals of educational \n     opportunity described in section 102, at adequate or ideal \n     levels as defined by the State under section 201(a)(1)(A) to \n     students at each public elementary school and secondary \n     school in the State;\n       (2) the provision of educational services in school \n     districts that receive funds under part A of title I of the \n     Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. \n     6311 et seq.) that are, taken as a whole, at least comparable \n     to educational services provided in school districts not \n     receiving such funds; and\n       (3) compliance with any final Federal or State court order \n     in any matter concerning the adequacy or equitableness of the \n     State's public school system.\n       (b) Determinations Concerning State Public School \n     Systems.--Not later than October 1 of each year, the \n     Secretary shall determine whether each State maintains a \n     public school system that meets the requirements of \n     subsection (a). The Secretary may make a determination that a \n     State public school system does not meet such requirements \n     only after providing notice and an opportunity for a hearing.\n       (c) Publication.--The Secretary shall publish and make \n     available to the general public (including by means of the \n     Internet) the determinations made under subsection (b).\n\n     SEC. 102.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for the inclusion of barbiturates and bezodiazepines as covered \npart D drugs beginning in 2008; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the \nMedicare Mental Health Prescription Drug Access Act of 2007--\nlegislation to provide our Nation's seniors and individuals with \ndisabilities access to the mental health drugs that best meet their \nneeds.\n  As many of my colleagues are aware, nearly one out of four Americans, \n58 million people, will experience a mental illness during any given \nyear, and a large number of them will be senior citizens and \nindividuals with disabilities.\n  For far too long, mental illness has been shrouded in fear, \nmisunderstanding and stigma. I believe it is long past time for us to \naddress the inequitable treatment of mental illness in our broader \nhealth care system. Mental health parity is a critical part of the \nsolution. We must fulfill the intent of the 1996 mental health parity \nlaw and expand the definition of parity to include deductibles, co-\npayments, coinsurance, out-of-pocket expenses, as well as scope and \nduration of treatment.\n  However, parity alone is not a panacea to the problem of treating \nmental illness in this country. We must improve the range of mental \nhealth illnesses and treatment options covered by health plans, \nparticularly for children and seniors.\n  This year in the Senate, we have taken a major step toward improving\n\n[[Page S13004]]\n\naccess to mental health services for children by passing the Children's \nHealth Insurance Program, CHIP, Reauthorization Act, H.R. 976, not \nonce, but twice. Among the many important provisions included in this \nlegislation, which I co-authored, is a provision that requires the \nprivate health insurance plans that administer CHIP to provide mental \nhealth services for children that are equivalent to the coverage \nprovided for physical illnesses. In other words, we require full mental \nhealth parity for children enrolled in CHIP.\n  I still believe that we must do more to ensure that all children have \nthe broadest health care coverage possible for mental health screening \nand treatment, along the lines of what is provided to children enrolled \nin Medicaid through the Early Periodic Screening Diagnosis and \nTreatment, EPSDT, program. However, we have taken a significant step in \nthe right direction toward addressing the mental health needs of our \nnation's children by passing the CHIP reauthorization bill.\n  Unfortunately, the same is not true for our nation's seniors and \nindividuals with disabilities. We haven't done nearly enough to address \ntheir mental health needs. In fact, we have taken a step backwards in \nthe mental health coverage provided to Medicare participants, \nparticularly those that are dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid.\n  Many of my colleagues will recall that the Medicare Prescription \nDrug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 excluded certain \nclasses of medications from the newly-created Medicare prescription \ndrug program. Among the prescription drugs excluded were two important \nclasses of mental health drugs, benzodiepines and barbiturates, central \nnervous system depressants which have multiple clinical benefits.\n  Benzodiazepines and barbiturates are used to help seniors and \nindividuals with disabilities who are dealing with a variety of \nconditions including anxiety, depression, insomnia, panic disorders, \nmuscle spasms and seizures. Despite being some of the oldest and most \neffective medications for the treatment of mental illness, \nbenzodiazepines and barbiturates are currently unavailable to most \nseniors and individuals with disabilities enrolled in Medicare. That is \njust wrong.\n  Patients who have found success with benzodiazepines and barbiturates \nare reluctant to change prescriptions because of the potential side \neffects or the understandable fear that their conditions might return. \nOften, there is also an increased cost associated with alternative \nmedications, but the efficacy of these ``replacement'' drugs may \nactually be less than benzodiazepines and barbiturates. So, why should \nwe require MediCare participants to use prescription drugs that could \ncost more without offering any greater clinical benefit? I don't \nbelieve we should. Medicare participants deserve affordable access to \nthe prescription medications that are best suited to treat their \nconditions.\n  Many of my colleagues may be wondering why these two classes of \nprescription drugs were excluded from the Medicare prescription drug \nprogram in the first place. They were excluded because of an \ninappropriate application of existing Medicaid law to the Medicare \nprescription drug program. The 1990 law that established the Medicaid \nprescription drug rebate program gave state Medicaid agencies the \nOPTION to exclude barbiturates and benzodiazepines from their drug \nformularies. Even though no states have excluded these medications from \ntheir Medicaid formularies, the Medicare law makes this exclusion \nMANDATORY for seniors and individuals with disabilities.\n  It is unfair to restrict access to prescribed medications that have \nbeen proven to be safe and effective in the treatment of mental \nillnesses and other conditions that commonly affect seniors and the \ndisabled. That is why I am introducing this important piece of \nlegislation today, and I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  We know that mental illness is treatable, and treatment can help \npeople to live healthy, productive lives. Yet, our Nation's focus on \nmental health has continued to take a backseat to our focus on physical \nhealth even though the two are interrelated. We must act now to bring \nan end to the silent epidemic of mental illness in our country.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2190\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am so pleased to rise in support of this \nresolution. It has now passed, and it is very important that it has. It \nis to honor our former colleague, the Vice President of the United \nStates, Al Gore.\n  When I was first elected to the House of Representatives 25 years \nago, I was placed on the Foreign Affairs Committee, which was \nwonderful. I loved it. Clement Zablocki from Wisconsin was the chairman \nof that committee. I have told people it was like going to school and \nnot having to take the test. I was also put on the Science and \nTechnology Committee. That was a wonderful committee. It opened my eyes \nto so many different things that I had not seen before and had not been \nexposed to before.\n  The first day we met on that committee for organizational purposes, a \nyoung man came up to me and he said: I am Al Gore from Tennessee. He \nsaid: There is going to be a lot of activity here, people wanting to go \nto subcommittees. He said: Just wait. They have formed a new \nsubcommittee. I am going to be the subcommittee chairman. Take my word \nfor it. It is going to be the best subcommittee. Don't try to get on \nall those others. Get on mine.\n  I did. I followed his suggestion. It was wonderful. I knew at that \ntime that not only was he a very nice man--and I knew, of course, of \nhim because of his father having been a U.S. Senator--but I came to \nlearn what a brilliant man he is.\n  We did such outstanding things on that subcommittee. We uncovered \ncorruption within the Federal Emergency Management Agency. We held \nhearings on that. He got into, for the first time, looking at how \npeople are affected who do shift work. Those people who come from \nmanufacturing areas are aware of that, the people who work the \ngraveyard shift, the swing shift. For Las Vegas it is very important \nbecause it is a 24-hour town. People work 24 hours, around the clock. \nHe approached it from what does it do to the minds and the bodies of \npeople who have had this shift work. It was a wonderful, enlightening \nhearing, not only for members of the committee but for the country.\n  Also, he did, for the first time, public hearings on organ \ntransplants. Remember, this was 25 years ago. I can remember it as if \nit was yesterday. He brought in before our subcommittee a little girl \nby the name of Jamie Fisk. I will never forget this little girl. Her \ncolor was the color of a light-colored lemon. She was so yellow. She \nwas so jaundiced. This little girl was dying. She needed an organ \ntransplant, a liver transplant, and this wasn't done much. But she was \ngoing to die. As a result of this hearing, she was able to get an organ \ntransplant, a liver. I don't know what has happened to Jamie. The last \ntime I checked a number of years ago, she was doing just fine, and I am \nconfident she is. She was able to live as a result of this hearing held \nby Al Gore. It really paved the way for organ transplants and what we \ndo with people who are on a waiting list to get these organ \ntransplants.\n  The former majority leader, Dr. Frist, was an organ transplant \nspecialist. I talked to him on a number of occasions about the \nimportant work Al Gore did in that subcommittee.\n  That was only the beginning. Al Gore came to the Senate. I can \nremember coming to him when I decided to run for the Senate. He came \nhere 2 years before I did. He gave me great advice. He was very \nconcerned about campaign spending laws that needed to be changed. He \nwas totally supportive of McCain-Feingold and was a real leader and a \nleader in so many different respects as a Senator.\n  President Bill Clinton, using such good judgment, chose him to be his \nVice President. Prior to that, Al Gore ran for President, and I am \nhappy to say the first time he ran for President, other than the \nSenators from Tennessee, I was the only Senator supporting him. I have \nnever, ever regretted having done that. I think the world of this man. \nHis wife Tipper, if there were an all-American boy, she is the all-\nAmerican girl. She is just what you would want your daughter to be \nlike. I have a daughter, and I certainly hope she turns out like Tipper \nGore.\n  The Vice President and Senator Gore--I visited him in his office \nyears ago. He had in his office a chart, and it was so unusual. It \nshowed how global warming was taking place, what was happening in the \nenvironment, and it went way up into the ceiling. Way back then, 20 \nyears ago, he knew it was a problem. He knew that global warming was a \nproblem.\n  He is a man of humor. He is real family person. We all lived with him \nhere when he took his little boy to a baseball game and his little boy \ndarted in front of a car and was hit and almost killed. For me \npersonally, he is my friend.\n  What he has done for the State of Nevada is remarkable. Lake Tahoe. \nThere are only two lakes in the world like Lake Tahoe: Alpine Glacial \nLake, and the other one is in Russia--Lake Baikal. Lake Tahoe that we \nshare with California is a wonderful lake. It is almost a mile deep. It \nwas in a state of distress. I talked to Al Gore and said: We need to do \na Presidential summit at Lake Tahoe, and we did. He and President \nClinton came there 10 years ago and spent 2 days at Lake Tahoe. There \nwas international coverage of what they were doing at Lake Tahoe to \nshow that this wonder of nature was being destroyed. As a result of \ntheir having been there--they had 7 Cabinet officers who spent time \nwith more than 1,000 people preparing them for the summit. I thought it \nwould be a photo-op, and it certainly was more than that. It led to our \nturning around the environmental degradation of that great lake, and we \nhave made progress. Since they came there, we have spent hundreds of \nmillions of dollars on that lake, and it has been worth every penny of \nit.\n  Mr. President, Al Gore has had a pretty good year. He won an Emmy, an \nOscar, and now the Nobel Peace Prize. I, of course, know he got more \nvotes than the person who beat him in the Presidential election. We not \nonly know he got more votes, we know the tremendous problems they had \nin Florida. The Supreme Court made a decision. Even though I disagreed \nwith the 5-to-4 decision, it was made by the Supreme Court. As hard as \nit was for me to accept it, the minute the Supreme Court made that \ndecision, George Bush became my President. Think about how Al Gore felt \nabout that. Al Gore had gotten more votes than the man the Supreme \nCourt said would be President. How did Al Gore lead the country after \nthat disappointment to him? He didn't whine or cry or ask for there to \nbe a contest in the House of Representatives, which he was entitled to. \nHe led the country in saying George Bush is the President.\n  I say to you there wasn't a single rock thrown through a window and \nthere were no demonstrations held; it was a changeover to George Bush \nbeing President. I give that to the greatness of Al Gore. He could have \nwhined and cried and complained. He didn't do that. He set out, in \nspite of the fact that he was not President of the United States, to \nchange the world. He has done that, earning an Emmy, an Oscar, and now \nthe Nobel Peace Prize. It is one of the all-time great stories in \nhistory.\n  I have to also say that Al Gore, this very serious man, is also very \nfunny; he has a great sense of humor. When I was first elected minority \nleader, and then became the Democratic leader, he is one of the first \npeople I called. What did he do? He said: How much time do you have? I \nsaid: All the time you want. I was on the telephone and he talked to me \nfor more than 2 hours. I took notes. I still have those notes. He gave \nme such a good view of my job.\n\n[[Page S13025]]\n\n  I want everyone within the sound of my voice to understand what an \nextraordinary man he is and how much good he has done. I have watched \nhis progress from the days we spent together on the subcommittee and \nthe committee in the House, and we talked about the environment. This \nNobel Peace Prize is a reflection of the man and his accomplishments.\n  Is there anyone who doubts today that global warming is real? I don't \nthink so. If they do, they are in a very distinct minority. Global \nwarming is here and we must act. Listen to what Vice President Gore \nsays regarding the challenge. He says we must have optimism. He said:\n\n       We sometimes emphasize the danger in a crisis without \n     focusing on the opportunities that are there. We should feel \n     a great sense of urgency because it is the most dangerous \n     crisis we have ever faced, by far. But it also provides us \n     with opportunities to do a lot of things we ought to be doing \n     for other reasons anyway. And to solve this crisis, we can \n     develop a shared sense of moral purpose.\n\n  Does that depict what a great man he is? Al Gore looks at this \noptimistically, saying these are things we should have been doing, but \nwe are not doing it, so let's work together to fight the scourge facing \nour world.\n  On behalf of our former colleague and my friend, Vice President Al \nGore, I am so pleased to support this resolution. More important than \npassing this resolution, which has happened, I hope all my colleagues \nwill honor his cause and moral purpose to continue the fight to reverse \nthe threat of global warming and leave an Earth to our children and \ngrandchildren that is safe, clean, and livable.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/17/senate-section/article/S13025-1", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13025]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      HONORING NOBEL PEACE PRIZE WINNERS IN PHYSIOLOGY OR MEDICINE\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I now ask for their second reading en bloc, \nbut I object to my own request en bloc.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The bills will be read for \nthe second time on the next legislative day.\n\n\n                          S. 2179 and S. 2180\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources has reported over 70 individual bills and resolutions this \nCongress. Most of these bills are authorizations for specific projects \nand activities in the Department of the Interior, although we have also \nreported several measures involving National Forest lands under the \njurisdiction of the Department of Agriculture, as well as a few \nauthorizations related to the Department of Energy.\n  Typically these bills would be considered in the Senate under a \nunanimous consent procedure. Unfortunately, although all of these bills \nare noncontroversial and all were reported unanimously by the Energy \nand Natural Resources Committee, we have been unable to get consent to \npass these bills.\n  In an effort to facilitate passage of these bills, today I am \nintroducing two bills which contain the individual measures reported by \nthe committee. The first bill, the National Forests, Parks, Public \nLand, and Reclamation Projects Authorization Act of 2007, includes the \ntext of 25 bills and 1 resolution which have been passed by the House \nof Representatives and which were reported, or their Senate companion \nmeasure was reported, without substantive amendment by the committee. \nIf considered as individual bills, upon passage in the Senate, these \nbills would have been cleared for the President. Since they will now be \nincluded as part of this comprehensive bill, it will require additional \naction by the House of Representatives, but I am hopeful that because \nall of the measures included in this bill were previously approved by \nthe other body that they will be able to approve this bill \nexpeditiously.\n  The second bill, the Natural Resource Projects and Programs \nAuthorization Act of 2007, includes the text of 44 bills which \noriginated in the Senate, or which passed the House of Representatives \nand were substantively amended in committee. Like the previous bill, \nall of the individual bills were reported unanimously by the Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee. While the House of Representatives has not \npreviously acted on all of the individual components of this new bill, \nI believe these bills are non-controversial, and I hope that the House \nwill be able to consider this bill in a timely manner as well.\n\n[[Page S13026]]\n\n  Mr. President, I have prepared a table identifying the individual \nmeasures that are included in both comprehensive bills, including \nreferences to the corresponding calendar numbers. I ask unanimous \nconsent to have printed in the Record the table to which I just \nreferred.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            NATIONAL FORESTS, PARKS, PUBLIC LAND, AND RECLAMATION PROJECTS AUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2007\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                          Forest Service Authorizations\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSec. 101............................
