I have been \nin touch with the distinguished Republican leader. Those are \nplaceholders for purposes of our having the opportunity to get to the \nDetroit bailout, recovery plan, whatever we wish to call it.\n  I talked to my staff; they were up virtually most of the night \nworking with the Banking Committee from the House and the Senate, and \nthere are two remaining issues that have been discussed with the White \nHouse. I am confident those matters can be resolved within the next \nhour or so. They are both important issues, but I think they can be \nresolved. That having been done, we will confer, Senator McConnell and \nI, and decide how we are going to proceed. I think it would be to \neveryone's advantage that we move first, but we will have to wait and \nsee how. The House can do that if they choose to.\n  We would hope they can complete work on this Detroit situation \ntonight or tomorrow. Then we have to wait for the White House to \ndetermine what, if anything, they are going to do with requesting the \nother money from the TARP money; that is, the bank bailout. That \ndecision has not been made yet.\n  Members, I have received calls, as I am sure my distinguished \ncounterpart has, that people have obligations at home, there are a \nnumber of important foreign meetings people wish to be involved in that \nthey have set on their calendars for longstanding periods of time. \nThese are not pleasure trips, they are business trips representing the \nSenate. We hope to be able to complete work here as soon as possible. \nThe problem is we have to wait and see how we move through this. The \nSenate, being the unique legislative body it is, and it has been, one \nor two people can slow things down quite a bit. We hope that is not the \ncase. We know what we have to try to do. We need to do it as quickly as \npossible.\n  So I hope that, in fact, can be done; that is, the legislation can be \nput before us and a vote taken.\n  On the reading of bills, the second reading, I would object to any \nfurther\n\n[[Page S10822]]\n\nproceedings with respect to these bills. I do it en bloc.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.

The auto industry is vitally important to our Nation's \neconomy, and it is vitally important to my home State. This is not in \ndispute. The question before us is how to reverse the decline of some \nof those automobile manufacturers after decades of complicity between \nmanagement and labor.\n  I understand congressional Democrats sent a revised proposal to which \nthe majority leader referred, to the White House late last night. We \nwill reserve our judgment until we see the latest text. But the \nproposal we saw yesterday afternoon fails to achieve our goal of \nsecuring long-term viability of ailing auto companies.\n  I wish to support a bill that revives this industry. But I will not \nsupport a bill that revives the patient with taxpayer dollars, yet does \nnot secure a commitment that the patient will change its ways so future \nhelp is not needed. To do so would be a betrayal of the millions of \nhardworking taxpayers who are not at fault for the troubles in the auto \nindustry. It would be unfair to the millions of Americans who depend on \nthese companies.\n  On the management side, the draft plan released yesterday fails to \nrequire the kind of serious reform that will ensure long-term viability \nfor struggling automobile companies. By giving the Government the \noption of cancelling Government assistance in the event that reforms \nare not achieved, rather than requiring it, we open the door to \nunlimited Federal subsidies in the future.\n  Instead, we should demand management make the tough choices that are \nrequired for long-term viability. This is the only fair approach from \nthe standpoint of the taxpayer who is footing the bill. On the labor \nside, this bill proposal fails to require any serious reform of legacy \ncosts. Indeed, it states explicitly that one of its purposes is to \npreserve the same retirement and health care benefits that have made \nthese companies so uncompetitive.\n  It is delusional to expect a company that spends $71 per labor hour \nto compete with a company in a neighboring State that spends $49 per \nlabor hour. In short, this proposal is deeply flawed because it fails \nto assure taxpayers, who rightly expect us to be good stewards of their \nhard-earned money, that they will not be asked to shell out billions \nmore in a few years or even a few months from now.\n  Now, there are times when help is needed. But one thing most people \nexpect when they are asked for help is that the one asking makes a \ncommitment to change. This proposal does not go nearly far enough. It \nholds neither management nor labor truly accountable.\n  In areas where one side is held accountable, the other side is not. \nOne example is a provision that requires automakers to drop all legal \nchallenges to State fuel economy standards that are inconsistent with \nthe Federal standard. Where is the offer from our friends on the other \nside to call on environmental groups to drop their lawsuits?\n  Democrats say they want to solve this problem as much as we do. Yet \nthey seem all too eager to tip the scales to the detriment of the \nmanufacturers. Look, there is plenty of blame to go around for the \nproblems that ail the auto industry, but fixing half of a problem is \nnot a real solution.\n  Any successful proposal would force companies to reform, either \ninside of bankruptcy or outside of bankruptcy. Without that mandate, \nthere can be no real expectation of reform. A good proposal would force \nautomakers to get control of their benefit costs. A good proposal would \nmake wages of struggling companies competitive with other automakers, \nnot tomorrow but today. A good proposal would end the practice of \npaying workers who do not work. A good proposal would rationalize \ndealer networks.\n  Just as struggling airlines adjust their capacity to respond to \nmarket conditions, automakers must respond to market demands as well. I \nregret that the proposal Republicans saw yesterday afternoon does not \ndo enough to fix the whole problem. It subsidizes it. A real solution \nmust protect the taxpayers by forcing the changes needed to put these \ncompanies on the path to long-term success.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the lifeline we throw to Detroit has to be \none that gets them to shore, not part way to shore. That is why I \nindicated in my opening statement that during the night there has been \na lot of give-and-take between the White House and the two banking \ncommittees.\n  As I reported earlier, I think there are only two major issues that \nare still outstanding, and I am confident and hopeful they can be \nresolved in the next few hours.\n  The issue before us is, what can we do to stabilize an industry that \nhas direct impact upon 2.5 million jobs in this country. The mere fact \nthat we were trying to work something out yesterday caused the stock \nmarket to go up almost 300 points. The American people want us to try \nto resolve this issue.\n  But my friend is right. As strongly connected as I am to organized \nlabor, it cannot be a one-sided proposal that is brought before the \nSenate. I am confident it will not be. I have talked to the Big Three \noperators. Some are held in low repute. But that withstanding, I think \nwe are in a situation now where we all have to kind of join hands, \nrecognize that this is going to be a compromise, we are going to try to \nwork something out. That is what legislation is all about, the art of \ncompromise and consensus building. That is where we are now. As I \nindicated, I think we are very close to having something that I think \nwe can bring before the body sometime today.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, as we bring the 110th Congress to a close, \nour Nation confronts a daunting set of challenges. While we face the \ngravest crisis, perhaps, since the Great Depression, we must also \nremember that we are a nation at war. From Iraq to Afghanistan, from \nthe Pacific to Europe and countless places in between, American service \nmen and women are proudly carrying out their duties to protect our \ncountry and our way of life. Under stressful conditions and the \nconstant threat of danger, members of our Armed Forces do what it takes \nto get the job done every day.\n  During this holiday season, I wish to take a moment to express my \ngratitude to our servicemembers. Their personal courage and honor \nshould not be taken for granted but genuinely appreciated. I know that \nis the sentiment of the Senate on both sides of the aisle.\n  Today, on behalf of my family, the people of Pennsylvania, and people \nthroughout the country, I thank the members of our armed services and \ntheir families, especially those who\n\n[[Page S10823]]\n\ngave, as Lincoln said, ``the last full measure of devotion to their \ncountry.'' To the families of those who have died or for those family \nmembers who are remembering those who are far away serving our country, \nin either instance, either by way of the loss of a loved one or because \nof distance, there is obviously a void in their lives. The words of the \ngreat recording artist Bruce Springsteen come to mind when I think of \nwhat these families are living through today. I remember the words from \na song he wrote right after the 9/11 tragedy as he came out with a \nnumber of songs. One of them was ``Missing.'' Some of the lines from \nthat song go as follows:\n\n     When I shut out the lights, you're missing.\n     When I close my eyes, you're missing.\n     When I see the sunrise, you're missing.\n\n  I believe so many families feel that today. They know that someone \nwho was in their lives, a member of their family, a son or daughter, a \nhusband or wife who was among them and living and then went off to \nserve and lost their life, they feel that sense of missing a family \nmember or a loved one. But even if they are just away for 6 months or a \ncouple of months or even a year, they are missing, especially at this \nholiday season. So we are thinking of them today, those families who \nare living with that loss or living with that void.\n  So far, 190 sons and daughters of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania \nhave sacrificed their lives during Operation Iraqi Freedom. Since the \nlast time I paid tribute to those who have fallen, 21 Pennsylvania \nfamilies have lost their loved ones. Today I would like to honor each \nof them by reading their names into the Record:\n\n     Aviation Boatswain Mate 3rd Class Daniel Verbeke of Exton, \n         PA;\n     PFC Joshua Waltenbaugh of Ford City, PA;\n     LCpl Travis Stottlemyer of Hatfield, PA;\n     PFC James Yohn of Highspire, PA;\n     SFC Shawn Suzch of Hilltown, PA;\n     LTC Ralph Marino of Houston, PA;\n     SPC Jason Kazarick of Oakmont, PA;\n     SSG Ryan Maseth of Pittsburgh, PA;\n     SGT Timothy Van Orman of Port Matilda, PA;\n     CPT Nathan Raudenbush of Royersford, PA;\n     SPC Luke Runyan of Spring Grove, PA;\n     Chief Petty Officer Michael Koch of State College, PA;\n     SSG Brian Hause of Stoytown, PA;\n     SPC Michael Hook of Altoona, PA;\n     SPC Zachary Clouser of Dover, PA;\n     SFC Michael Tully of Falls Creek, PA;\n     SSG David Wieger of North Huntingdon, PA;\n     SPC Camy Florexil of Philadelphia, PA;\n     PFC Adam Chitjian of Philadelphia, PA;\n     SFC David Cooper Jr. of State College, PA; and finally\n     CPT Erick Foster of Wexford, PA.\n\n  To each of their families, please know our thoughts are with you \ntoday. I extend my sincere gratitude to each of these men and women for \naccepting the call to service. These men were courageous warriors who \nbelonged to the finest military in the world and contributed to \nsomething larger than themselves. Later this week I will honor those \nwho lost their lives during Operation Enduring Freedom.\n  I also personally thank the men and women of the Pennsylvania \nNational Guard. The Pennsylvania Guard's motto is ``civilian in peace, \nsoldier in war.'' They have certainly lived up to that motto. With two \nunits deploying this winter and spring, the Pennsylvania National Guard \nis in the midst of its largest deployment since the Korean war. The \n20,000 members of the Pennsylvania National Guard who give up the \ncomforts of their civilian lives at a moment's notice, who protect \nAmericans in the mountains of Afghanistan, the sands of Iraq, and \nworldwide, and who rescue Americans from devastating floods and natural \ndisasters deserve our highest praise. Therefore, at this holiday \nseason, I want the men and women in service to our country to know we \nare thinking of them, we are praying for their safety and well-being \nand for that of their families.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, as a little boy in Searchlight, as I was \ngrowing up, I used to listen every day to the ``Game of the Day'' \nbaseball on the radio, and because there was no entertainment in \nSearchlight, I loved those games. I listened to them. Dizzy Dean was \none of the announcers, and a guy named Al Helfer was one of the \nannouncers. I thought they were very good, very entertaining. In the \nseventh inning stretch, Dizzy would always sing ``The Wabash \nCannonball.''\n  Now, in my youthful mind, one thing I wanted to do more than anything \nelse was to be a baseball player. In Searchlight, we tried to play \nbaseball. We had a little field there. We did not have enough boys for \nthe team, so we had one girl who made up the nine players. Her name was \nMary Ann Meyers. She still lives in Searchlight. She was really quite \ngood--frankly, better than a lot of the boys. She rode a horse bareback \nas well as anyone could ride with a saddle.\n  I spent a lot of my daydreaming playing baseball. I had a little \npaddle of some kind, and I would throw rocks in the air and hit them \nwith that. That was part of my entertainment. I did that for a long \ntime.\n  As they had no high school in Searchlight, I went to Basic High \nSchool in Henderson, NV, which was 45 miles away. I stayed with people \nduring the week and would come home on a lot of weekends if I could. \nThey did not have a freshman baseball team. They had no baseball team. \nI guess maybe if there had been a freshman good enough--I do not really \nthink that was the case; I do not think they let freshmen be on the \nbaseball team. My sophomore year, I went out for baseball. I was one of \ntwo sophomores to make that team. It was so exciting for me. That team \nwas so good, we were so good, we won the Nevada State Championship. The \nfirst year they had a championship, we won. We beat Fallon. We had a \npitcher by the name of Rey Martinez who later became my chief of staff \nand was a left-handed pitcher who was very good. We were so good that \nwe beat all of the Nevada schools and all of the California schools. \nEven though we were from that little industrial town in southern \nNevada, we were the California Interscholastic Federation champions. We \nbeat them all.\n  Now, I would like to stand before everybody here and say that one \nreason that was the case is I was instrumental in getting hits at the \nright time and making stellar plays, stealing bases as I dreamed I \nwould do as a kid. But I sat on the bench most of the time. I caught \nbatting practice. I was a catcher. But I felt that I was part of that \nteam and will never forget my experiences there playing baseball.\n  My friend Don Wilson, who was the other sophomore, was a State \nbatting champion. He was terrific, a great athlete. He went on the play \nat Arizona State. But we had tremendous athletes. We had Norman Craft, \nwho was our center fielder, who was a Big 10 football player playing at \nIndiana.\n  I went to college on a football-baseball scholarship. I was a lot \nbigger then than I am now. I weighed almost 190 pounds. But I got hurt \nearly in my college athletic career--meaning football--and I came to \nthe realization that I was not the athlete of my dreams. I was not big \nenough, fast enough, or good enough. So my athletic career, as a \nfreshman in college, ended. I fought after that, but not as the \nbaseball-football player I dreamed of being.\n  The reason I mention all of this today is to tell everyone within the \nsound of my voice how much I love baseball. I love athletics. I think \nit is so good and it is so wonderful that women can now participate \njust like men--boys and girls can participate. When I was in high \nschool, the only thing my wife could do--she was far more athletic than \nI am or I was--is be a cheerleader. That was all she could do. There \nwas not a single program for girls. So now we have programs equally for \ngirls and boys, and that is exiting and wonderful, and I am happy that \nis the case.\n  The reason I mention all of this today is that yesterday in Las Vegas \nwas a very big day for people who love baseball. It was an important \nday, but in some ways it was kind of a sentimental day because the \ngreat Greg Maddux announced his retirement.\n  Gregg Maddux, one of the greatest baseball players of all time, \nannounced\n\n[[Page S10824]]\n\nhis retirement yesterday after 23 seasons in the big leagues. Greg \nMaddux announced his retirement. He is such a fine person, unassuming. \nWe see all of the negative things about athletes today, their taking \nsteroids and fighting at bars and carrying guns into bars and shooting \nthemselves in the leg and having dogs fight each other, not setting \ngood examples for kids as to how they treat women. Greg Maddux stood \nfor everything that they didn't--a wonderful family man, beautiful \nchildren, who prizes his family.\n\n  This is not a speech about some guy who played baseball in Las Vegas. \nThis is a statement about one of the greatest baseball players of all \ntime. You take the thousands of people who have pitched in the big \nleagues, Greg Maddux, this small man, relatively small man, who never \nlifted a weight in his life, is eighth on the all-time list of \npitchers, Cy Young, go down the list, Warren Spahn, Greg Maddux; he is \n10 games away from being in the top four or five--10 wins.\n  Another reason it is so important is that Greg Maddux is from Las \nVegas. He never left. He went away for 23 years, spent half the year \nplaying baseball, sometimes more than that, but he always came home. \nLas Vegas is home. That is where his kids go to school.\n  So this is a statement about a wonderful man who is a role model for \nanyone who participates in athletics but also someone Nevada is very \nproud of. He went to Valley High School, a high school that is still \nthere. There are wonderful stories about this boy who went to that high \nschool. A columnist from a prominent newspaper--I think that is where \nit was--a few years ago wrote a story, a column about Greg Maddux. He \nwas a senior in high school. They had this skinny little sophomore who \nwas going to pitch against him and his team. And he looked forward to \nbatting against this skinny little sophomore who was pitching for \nValley High School. And he describes in the column he wrote, he struck \nout every time he got up against this guy and they were, of course, \nbeaten. Stories like that are all over Nevada about what he did in his \nyouth.\n  Greg will soon be 43 years old. Yesterday he held a press conference. \nIn effect what he said is: Thank you to everybody in baseball. He said: \nI still think I could play this game but not as well as I would like \nto, so it is time to say goodbye. And that is what he did.\n  His accomplishments are legendary; 355 games he won. He won more \ngames than Roger Clemens, and he did it without taking any supplements \nof any kind. I repeat what he told me. He said: You know, I have never \nlifted a weight. He said: When I was in high school, a physical \ntherapist said: Don't mess with your body. And Gregg may have pushed a \nfew weights with his legs, but no way did he touch his arm, not because \nhis arm had such great power, because he didn't throw as hard as a lot \nof pitchers, but his accuracy was nearly perfect.\n  Of the seven men in front of him on the victory list, only Warren \nSpahn pitched in the second half of the last century. He is the only \n300 game winner to have more than 3,000 strikeouts and less than 1,000 \nwalks. He averaged less than 30 walks per year. That is a remarkable \naccomplishment; the first player in the history of baseball to win at \nleast 15 games in 17 straight years; the only player in the history of \nbaseball to win 13 games over 20 years.\n  He won four straight Cy Young awards. He won a World Series with the \nAtlanta Braves. He won 18 Gold Gloves. What is a Gold Glove? That means \nyou are the best fielder in baseball at that position. He won 18 of \nthem. No one will ever match that. That is for his fielding excellence. \nThat is the most of any player ever, 18 Gold Gloves.\n  How did he do this, a man who didn't throw that hard, wasn't a \nmonster on the mound being 6 foot 9? He was about my size, a little \nheavier than I am. He was able to do that because of his consistency, \nhis control, and his mental acuity. He studied those batters. He knew \ntheir weaknesses and their strengths, and everyone marveled at how he \ncould throw that baseball.\n  The stories will go on and on about Greg Maddux, but one story is not \nlegend. It is true. For a sportswriter's entertainment, he said: Have \nthe catcher hold up his glove and then we will make sure the catcher \ncan't see so he can't move his hand. Let's see if you can hit that \nglove.\n  Think about that. The catcher is, in effect, blindfolded. He didn't \ndo it once. He did it three times. Think about that. For those of us \nwho have ever thrown a baseball, to hit that target is pretty \nsignificant. He is a man of humility. I just am so proud of Greg \nMaddux. I don't know what team I am going to root for now, because when \nhe was with the Cubs, I was a Cub fan. When he was with the Atlanta \nBraves, I was a Braves fan. As difficult as it was playing for those \nlosers, the Padres; they wouldn't get him any runs, I followed them \nbecause I knew Greg Maddux was on that team. And then he went with the \nDodgers, and I became a Dodger fan. I don't know who I am going to \ncheer for. I really don't know.\n  His brother is a wonderful man. He was a long-time pitching coach for \nthe Milwaukee Brewers. He has now, I understand, gone with the Texas \nRangers. Whenever he came to town, I tried to visit with him. He was \nalso a major league pitcher, 5 or 6 years older than his little brother \nGreg, but always looked out for him and was always so proud of him.\n  I want the record to reflect that America lost from baseball a great \nhuman being yesterday. But for us in Nevada, the place of his home, we \nstill have Greg Maddux. His ties to Las Vegas make us all so very \nproud. Local historians will say--and rightfully so--that Greg Maddux \nis the greatest athlete in the history of our State.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/12/09/senate-section/article/S10824-1", "month": "12", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10824]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I just finished a meeting with my staff \nrepresentative who has been working with the two Banking Committees and \nthe White House on the Detroit situation that we are trying to work \nout. I think there has been a whole lot of progress made. I hope the \nWhite House will be meeting with Senator McConnell in the near future \nand we can start moving forward.\n  We very much want to complete this as soon as possible. I have had \ncalls from lots of different Senators, all having very important things \nto do and places to go dealing with their service as a Senator. I think \nit is going to be very difficult to get a vote today. The legislation \nis not drafted yet. Most of it is, but there are a couple provisions \nthey are working on. So I think it is very unlikely there will be votes \ntoday--not impossible but unlikely. It is more likely there will be \nsomething tomorrow.\n  But everyone should understand, if we have a number of Senators who \nare objecting, who want to slow this down--they have a right to do \nthat; I understand that--we are going to complete the process. That \nbeing the case--everyone knows the rules around here; and I do--it may \nbe necessary, if we get some push back from some of our Senators, where \nwe have to go through the process of moving to proceed and filing \ncloture and all that kind of stuff--if that is the case, everyone \nshould understand we are going to work until we complete this.\n  The American people want us to make a decision. I am fairly confident \nthat all the work that has gone into this is going to bear fruit, that \nwe will be able to pass legislation that will be good legislation. It \nwill help the workers. When I say ``the workers,'' not only those \npeople who are directly employed by the automobile manufacturers, but \nthe suppliers, the bondholders, and on and on down the road. A lot of \npeople are dependent on our doing something that is appropriate, and I \nthink that can be done.\n  We are going to have a vote on this sometime. We can either have it \nsooner or we can have it later. But everyone should understand there \nwill be no stalling us from doing this. We are going to complete this \nlegislation. That may mean--and people have heard me talk about this \nbefore, but\n\n[[Page S10825]]\n\neveryone knows I am serious about this--that may mean we have to work \nthis weekend. I hope that is not the case. Today is Tuesday. But the \nrules are as they are and we may have to work through this. We cannot \nlet a few people stop us from doing the people's business.\n  I think Senator McConnell and I have the same view; we discussed it \nthis morning, that we want to move forward making sure all parties feel \nthey have been part of the process. There is nothing we could do that \nwould be perfect. So we can only do the best we can; that is, to work \nthrough this legislation with the art of compromise. We have had to do \nthat on this piece of legislation.\n  So we will have to wait until the White House completes their \nmeetings with the leadership on the Republican side. Hopefully, today, \nwe can have a better direction as to when we can complete this.\n  I think the seriousness of what we are engaged in with Detroit and \nthe financial bailout of the banking institutions and the financial \napparatus of this country has been very hard and difficult, and we need \nto keep moving forward. As everyone knows, thousands of jobs have been \nlost, and we need to get our country back in a position where we are \ntalking about and feel good about the jobs that are being gained, not \nthe jobs being lost.\n  So having said that, Mr. President, I will be happy to answer any \nquestions anyone has. They know how to get ahold of me.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now \nproceed to a period of morning business, with Senators allowed to speak \ntherein for up to 10 minutes each, and that the morning hour expire at \n4:30 p.m.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I want to take the next several minutes, \nas we are getting together back in the Capitol, to discuss the possible \nfuture assistance the Federal Government might provide to our auto \nindustry.\n  Coming down on the train, several people said to me--some for and \nsome against the proposal--that they were not comfortable with the idea \nof giving money to the auto industry, and I said neither am I. I am not \ninterested in giving money to the auto industry any more than I wanted \nto give money to the financial services industry.\n  I invite the people who are following this issue to go back in time \nto 1979, 1980, when Chrysler was going through a difficult time, and \nLee Iacocca was the CEO of the company then. He called for Federal \nassistance. I think at the time they were interested in a Federal loan \nto Chrysler. We weren't interested in doing that then, but we agreed to \nprovide loan guarantees so that if Chrysler could find financing \nelsewhere, the Federal Government would provide a backstop in the form \nof a guarantee of the loans; otherwise, Chrysler would not have been \nable to obtain the needed financing. We called on Chrysler to make some \ndifficult decisions to reduce costs and make sure that in the long haul \nthey would be successful and viable as a company.\n  At the time, Lee Iacocca told us: If we could make that Chrysler K \nCar, that is our ticket to salvation and redemption and profitability. \nHe said we don't have the financial wherewithal to get there. The \nFederal Government agreed to provide a lifeline in the form of a loan \nguarantee. A number of States, including my State of Delaware, agreed \nto provide loans--direct loans in this case--to Chrysler. We negotiated \na collateralized loan to Chrysler in 1980. In return for the Federal \ntaxpayers taking on the risk in 1980 of the loan guarantees, we asked \nfor an ability to participate in an upside. We wanted to make sure not \njust the shareholders and employees would benefit but that the \ntaxpayers would benefit. We agreed to make loan guarantees in return \nfor getting warrants--not warrants for anybody's arrest but a warrant \nthat is a financial instrument that can be used to turn into stock and \nprovide the potential, at least, for the Federal taxpayer to make some \npositive return on this investment.\n  As it turned out, when the deal was closed and Jimmy Carter signed \nthe legislation in the early part of 1980, the stock for Chrysler was \nabout $5 a share. Under the terms of the agreement, the Federal \nGovernment was able to purchase Chrysler stock for $13 a share. It \ndidn't sound like a very good deal at the time. Nonetheless, we had \nthat option to buy Chrysler stock at a future date at $13 a share. \nLater, Chrysler built the K Car and returned to profitability. They \nmade money and the value of the shares appreciated. The time came when \nthe Federal Government decided to go to Chrysler and say we would like \nto use our warrants and buy the stock at $13 a share. Then we turned \naround and sold them for $30 a share after that. The difference between \nthe $13 and the $30 we sold them for led to an appreciation or \naccumulation of about $310 million for taxpayers. The loan the State of \nDelaware made to Chrysler--the collateralized loan I negotiated as \nState treasurer--was paid in full. Not only did we get the principal \nback, but we made interest for the taxpayers of my State. The same \nthing occurred to the taxpayers of other States. Meanwhile, Chrysler \nagreed to make a number of concessions that there be a sharing of \nsacrifices made by labor and management and others to help make that \ncompany viable for the longer haul. Lee Iacocca worked for $1 a year.\n  The long and short of it is that it worked. That was in 1980. It \nworked for over a quarter century. Chrysler has gotten themselves into \ntrouble because they began relying more and more on large inefficient \nvehicles--SUVs, trucks, and relatively few fuel-efficient cars or fuel-\nefficient light trucks or SUVs. In the end, by this time last year, \nroughly 70 percent of what Chrysler was building was energy-inefficient \ncars. During the CAFE increases last year, among the companies that \npushed back initially was Chrysler. They have had to begin pivoting, if \nyou will, to move from a product line where up to 70 percent of the \nvehicles were light trucks and SUVs, relatively few cars, and not many \nvery fuel efficient, to one where not just the light trucks and vans \nand SUVs were energy efficient but also the cars. You cannot do that. \nChrysler cannot do it, and Ford and GM cannot move within a year, or \neven 2 years, from a product line that is woefully inefficient in terms \nof fuel economy to one that is highly efficient. It has taken a period \nof time.\n  I am encouraged by the progress they are making at Chrysler. They are \na couple of years out from being where they need to be, given the \nmarketplace and what consumers are asking for.\n  Meanwhile, over at Ford, about 2 years ago, they largely redefined \nthe company, including the logo, to begin a major transformation. Under \nthe leadership of Bill Ford and Alan Mullaley, former head of Boeing, \nwho was brought in to run Ford a couple years ago, they began a \ntransformation not 12 months ago but more like 2 years ago to move to \nvehicles such as the Focus and Fusion. They are in a better position \nnow as people are buying fewer vehicles and are looking for energy-\nefficient vehicles. There is some neat, nifty technology and items for \nthe vehicles as well, with the partnership they have worked out with \nMicrosoft.\n  Over at GM, meanwhile, GM is hopefully about to introduce, in a year \nor year and a half, what I call the most advertised car that has never \nbeen built, the Chevrolet Volt. I saw it unveiled at the Detroit Auto \nShow about a year and a half ago--a plug-in hybrid, flex fuel vehicle \nwith the potential of getting not just 40 miles out from the garage in \nthe homes in the morning,\n\n[[Page S10826]]\n\nbut a potential for getting 80 to even 90 miles per gallon by using an \nalternative onboard fuel system, a propulsion system, not to propel the \ncar but to recharge the battery. Unfortunately, we have not built the \nbattery yet. Nobody has built a battery yet that can do that or \ndesigned one that will work at minus 10 degrees Fahrenheit or 110 \ndegrees Fahrenheit. They have worked for 10 years under all kinds of \nconditions. Efforts are underway in many countries to win a race to \nbuild that battery. The Federal Government has provided a fair amount \nof financial support, investing in technology to make sure we get to \nthe finish line ahead of our foreign competitors. It is an important \nrace. GM, I think, stands to benefit from this, and so do the folks who \nwork there and those who have shares with GM. So do the rest of us, \nfrankly.\n  Let me come back to what I said earlier, about the conversation I had \nwith several people on the train coming from Wilmington today. They \nsaid to me: We didn't like the fact that you gave all that money to the \nbanks, and we don't like the idea of giving all that money to the auto \nindustry. If you look at what we have done with the financial \ninstitutions, we have, under the legislation, created a so-called TARP. \nUnder that legislation we authorize the Treasury to invest in the \nbanks, to take an equity position. With the moneys we have infused or \ninvested into most of these banks, we bought preferred stock. That \npreferred stock pays initially 5 percent per year, and later 9 percent \nif it is not bought back by the banks. In addition, we get options, \nmuch as we did with Chrysler in 1980, that could be converted into \nshares of stock that we can benefit from--not just we but the taxpayers \ncan benefit from.\n  The idea there was to make the investment with the possibility that \nif there is an upside or rebound by the financial institutions that \nasked for this investment, the taxpayers have the opportunity to \nparticipate in the profits, as we did with respect to Chrysler all \nthose years ago. The money that we are now talking about, or will be \ndebating, whether to make available for working capital for the auto \ncompanies--let me add that only Chrysler and GM have indicated an \ninterest in drawing down this money. Ford said: We think we are OK. \nMaybe later we will need a line of credit. For now, we think we are all \nright.\n  That is good news. So what we are working on is an approach where we, \njust as we invested in the financial institutions in order to get back \npreferred stock that pays 5 to 9 percent and also carries the \npossibility of warrants that we can turn into profit-making stock \nshares later, we want to do the same thing with our auto industry.\n  The Presiding Officer will recall a year or so ago when we passed \nCAFE legislation. In it we passed section 136, which said we want to \nprovide as much as $25 billion so that the auto companies can modernize \ntheir plants for the principal purpose of building more energy-\nefficient vehicles. We feel that is what is needed--high quality and \ngood productivity. But that is one of the major things needed to be \ncompetitive in the world today: energy-efficient cars, trucks, vans, \nand so forth.\n  That $25 billion is not going to be available, apparently, right away \nto go into plant modernization.\n  The idea is to take as much as $15 billion of that $25 billion to \nmake available to Chrysler and General Motors. The idea is not to give \nthem this money; the idea is to invest this money in ways they can use \nit for working capital to get them through the next several months and, \nin the meantime, to require, under the guidance of what has been called \na czar or an oversight board whose job would be to act almost as a \nbankruptcy judge, to make sure that further savings are realized by \nboth Chrysler and GM but to ensure there is some further givebacks not \njust from labor, not just from management, not just from bondholders, \nnot just from dealers, and not just from lenders but all the above. It \nis a concept that makes sense. The idea of here is $15 billion, and we \nhope you can get better and repay the money down the line, is not what \nwe are interested in doing.\n  We want to improve the likelihood that we will get back every dime we \nlend of this $15 billion and more, if needed, later on. But we want to \nmake sure the companies, particularly Chrysler, Ford, and GM, make the \nadditional changes they need to increase the likelihood that they will \nbe viable for a long period of time.\n  I close by saying we are seeing a real transformation in our economy. \nWe used to be a big manufacturing country. We are less so today. Some \npeople say that is fine, we will be a service economy, we will provide \nfinancial services and legal services, we will have insurance \ncompanies, maybe we will grow some food to feed ourselves and some of \nthe rest of the world. But at the end of the day, we still need to make \nthings. We still need to make things that people here and around the \nworld want to buy.\n  One of the things I believe we need to make are cars, trucks, and \nvans. It has been that way for a long time. It needs to continue to be \nthat way going forward.\n  I have had the privilege of representing and working for the people \nof Delaware, gosh, since 1976, when they elected me their State \ntreasurer. We have had two auto assembly plants in my State for 50, 60 \nyears--a Chrysler plant and a GM plant. The Chrysler plant is going to \nclose at the end of this month. It is painful to me, and I know all the \npeople who work there, the retirees, all who bought their vehicles and \nsupported the plants in ways large and small over the years. But the \nwriting is on the wall. My fear is that is going to happen.\n  As this happens and we see plants such as our plant in Newark, DE, \nthe Chrysler plant, close, it is important we also remember the people \nwho are losing their jobs there, the folks who have not enough \nexperience, enough time to retire and be eligible for benefits. As they \nprepare to close the doors at the Chrysler plant in Newark, DE, I wish \nto make sure the folks who are losing their livelihood have the \nopportunity to be trained for other jobs in my State or other States \nthat will enable them to be gainfully employed, to make a decent income \nfor themselves and to support their families.\n  One of the things we can do, in addition to providing, if you will, a \nloan guarantee or direct loan with strong conditions to these auto \ncompanies, is remember our responsibilities to those who are left \nbehind and those left behind without the prospect of ever working again \nin the auto industry.\n  There are some countries around the world--Finland comes to mind, \nDenmark, and a couple others--that do a good job. As industries grow \nup, mature, the nature of the job market, the industries in those \ncountries change. Some countries around the world do a very good job of \nhelping people whose skills for building, whether it is cars or buggies \nor buggy whips, are no longer appropriate--retraining people, \nsupporting them for a period of time, giving them the social support \nnet they need but then training them for jobs that need to be done, in \nthis case, in the 21st century.\n  There you have it, some thoughts. My hope is we will come back and \nhave a robust debate for the remainder of this week, and before this \nweek is over we will vote not to give away $15 billion to Chrysler or \nto GM but that we will vote to be willing, as we did in 1980, to make \nan investment that has a potential upside, not just for the people who \nwork in the companies, not just for the people who own shares of those \ncompanies but also for the American taxpayers. If we do take on this \nrisk, there needs to be a reward for the taxpayers whose money is at \nrisk.\n  Mr. President, thank you for this opportunity. I suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill).

Madam President, this past Saturday, 1 day before the \n75th anniversary of the attack on Pearl Harbor, a survivor of a \ndifferent World War II kamikaze bombing died quietly at his home in \nShawneetown, IL, at the age of 82.\n\n[[Page S10827]]\n\n  Einar Dyhrkopp, business leader, public servant, and patriot, was a \n19-year-old Navy firefighter assigned to the bowels of the USS Aaron \nWard when the destroyer-minelayer was attacked by 25 kamikaze bombers \nin the battle for Okinawa.\n  In the years after World War II, Gen. George C. Marshall was asked if \nAmerica had any secret weapons to win that conflict. General Marshall \nreplied, yes, we do, ``the best darn kids in the world.'' Einar was \njust the kind of kid General Marshall was talking about. About 365 men \nwere assigned to the USS Aaron Ward; 42 of them burned to death or were \nlost overboard in the 52-minute battle on May 3, 1945. Einar was one of \nthe lucky ones: he survived the attack, although his hair was burned to \nhis scalp as he fought to douse the ship's flames.\n  When the war ended, Einar came home like so many World War II vets, \nfound new ways to serve his country. He married Frances, and they had a \nson. He was a banker, a business leader, a livestock and grain farmer \nin southern Illinois, and a great politician. He was elected mayor of \nShawneetown, IL, where he was born and lived his entire life. He was a \nself-described ``dyed in the wool'' Democrat. He was respected and \nadmired by people from both political parties.\n  He was also a dedicated public servant. In 1993, Einar Dyhrkopp was \nappointed by President Bill Clinton to the U.S. Postal Service Board of \nGovernors and served two terms as the Chairman. During his tenure, the \nPostal Service experienced an unprecedented 5 straight years of \npositive net income. It also enhanced service and increased its ontime \ndelivery rate for next-day delivery to 94 percent. He cared about the \nPostal Service's bottom line and its customers. He talked to me so many \ntimes about issues related to the Postal Service. He cared about the \nworkers there too. He once invited picketing postal workers in for \ncoffee and cinnamon rolls and, after talking with them, answered all of \ntheir questions. He visited countless postal facilities, asking \nemployees what we can do to make their job better and make our services \nbetter in the Postal Service. In 2003, the post office in his beloved \nShawneetown was rededicated and renamed in his honor. Einar had tears \nin his eyes as the tributes were read.\n  Mr. Dyhrkopp also served on several Illinois State commissions and \nwas a member of the Regional Advisory Board of Southern Illinois \nUniversity Public Policy Institute.\n  There was the one curious political chapter in his life. In 1986, \nEinar Dyhrkopp ran what he called a noncampaign for the U.S. Senate. He \nran on the Illinois Solidarity Party slate, a roster of statewide \ncandidates put together by Adlai Stevenson III. Mr. Stevenson, son of \nthe two-time Democratic Presidential candidate, had won the Democratic \nnomination for Governor, but that primary had been raided by the \nLaRouche party. He abandoned the Democratic Party ticket after two \ndisciples of the extremist Lyndon LaRouche won slots on the Democratic \nslate in a disastrous primary election. Mr. Stevenson said he could not \nin good conscience share a ticket with people whose views he found so \nobjectionable. State law required that the new Illinois Solidarity \nParty field a whole slate of statewide candidates, not just the \ngubernatorial candidate. So Einar stepped up and agreed to be the new \nparty's nominee for U.S. Senate.\n  What a crazy campaign. Mr. Dyhrkopp did not accept a single penny in \ncampaign contributions. He did not spend a dollar or make one speech. \nHe did not even vote for himself, announcing he was going to cast his \nballot for his friend, the incumbent, Senator Alan Dixon. As one \npolitical writer put it, his strategy was ``not to leave the house \nuntil the election was over so he wouldn't draw attention or votes away \nfrom Senator . . . Dixon.'' Despite his best efforts to avoid the \nvoters, Einar ended up with 15,000 votes. That is the kind of man he \nwas--hard not to like. As my friend Paul Simon said some years ago, \n``Einar Dyhrkopp represents responsible citizenship at its best. He has \naided his community and provided leadership on the State and national \nscene. He has gone out of his way to help those who need assistance.''\n  For years after the bombing of the USS Aaron Ward, Einar did not talk \nabout the attack. He told a reporter, ``When you go through something \nlike we went through together, almost everyone wants to get it out of \ntheir minds the first few years.'' Later in life, he changed his mind. \nHe became active in a group of survivors of the Aaron Ward attack. He \nwas interviewed by Southern Illinois University's public broadcasting \nstations in conjunction with the broadcast of ``The War,'' by Ken \nBurns, a documentary on World War II. He told a reporter that his \nchange of heart was simply because ``[w]e do not want the experience \nlost. If you lose history, you're destined to repeat it.''\n  America's history might have taken a far different and darker course \nhad Einar Dyhrkopp and millions of others of ``the best darned kids in \nthe world'' not sacrificed and served in that conflict and had they not \ncome back home to serve their Nation in other ways for decades more.\n  He was a good man who gave much to his community, much to my State of \nIllinois, and much to America. Last Friday, at the urging of some \nfriends who told me he was seriously ill, I called his home. Frances \nanswered the phone, and I told her who I was. I said I thought I would \nsay a word or two to Einar if he can take the call. Well, she said, I \nam not sure he can talk to you. I did not know how sick he was. And she \nleaned over, and I could overhear her saying: Einar, it is Senator \nDurbin. The next think I knew, Einar was on the phone. We only chatted \nfor a minute or two. We talked about the great times we had together, \nabout that wonderful man, Paul Simon, who inspired us all to get \ninvolved in public life.\n  He said: I think this is the end for me.\n  I said: You have had a good run at it, Einar. You have been with some \ngreat people, and you have been a great friend.\n  Those were our last words. He died the following day.\n  I offer my sympathy to Mr. Dyhrkopp's wife Frances, their family, \nincluding their three grandchildren, and so many friends in southern \nIllinois. Einar Dyhrkopp will be missed.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Salazar). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/12/09/senate-section/article/S10827-1", "month": "12", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10827-S10828]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TRIBUTE TO SENATORS\n\n\n                              john warner\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, Today is a day I have dreaded. Today I say \nfarewell to my good friend and esteemed colleague, Senator John Warner.\n  A few years ago, in an article for a Capitol Hill publication, \nSenator Warner called attention to the courage of America's war \nveterans. He explained that the men and women who serve in our military \nare ``heroes [who] share the timeless virtues of patriotism and \nselfless devotion to duty in defending our country.''\n  Mr. President, Senator Warner is one of my ``heroes.'' He is a man \nwho has always displayed ``the timeless virtues of patriotism and \nselfless devotion to duty in defending our country.''\n  Indeed, Senator Warner has spent his life in service to our country. \nHe enlisted in the Navy at the tender age of 17 in order to serve in \nWorld War II. A few years later, he joined the Marines in order to \nserve in the Korean conflict. From 1969 to 1972, he served as the \nAssistant Secretary of the Navy, and from 1972 to 1974, as Secretary of \nthe Navy.\n  In 1978, he was elected to the U.S. Senate, and is now the second \nlongest-serving Senator in the history of his beloved Commonwealth of \nVirginia.\n  His entire Senate career has been marked by his dignity, style, \ngrace, and integrity. He is one of those men with whom one can disagree \nwithout rancor. I cannot recall ever hearing anyone speak ill of John \nWarner.\n  A few years ago, on another occasion in which I paid tribute to my \ngood friend, I referred to him as ``the classiest of class acts''--and \nhe is. We\n\n[[Page S10828]]\n\nwill miss his comity, his courtesy, and his refreshing bipartisan \nspirit always seeking consensus solutions for the good of the country. \nWhether in committee or on the Senate floor, he never succumbs to the \nbitter, destructive partisanship which has all too often characterized \nthis chamber in recent years.\n  Senator Warner has spoken out against his own party when he felt that \nthe wrong course was being pursued. When the horrors of Abu Ghraib came \nto light, John Warner did not hesitate to help write the legislation to \nrestrict the use of torture.\n  Senator Warner embodies the guiding principles set down by another of \nour country's brave warriors, GEN Douglas MacArthur, who proclaimed his \nleading lights to be, ``Duty, honor, country.''\n  Mr. President, without qualification, I can say that it has been an \nabsolute pleasure to have served with this distinguished and esteemed \nVirginia gentleman, and I will miss him.\n\n\n                              chuck hagel\n\n  Mr. President, I came to know Senator Hagel in 1997 when we worked \ntogether on the Byrd-Hagel Resolution related to the Kyoto Protocol. We \nmade a good team because our effort was approved unanimously, by a vote \nof 95-0.\n  In our work together, I made a new friend because I found Senator \nHagel to be a likeable and cooperative person as well as a \nknowledgeable and hard-working Senator.\n  My respect for this dynamic Senator increased as I watched him become \none of the Senate's most outspoken critics of Mr. Bush's war in Iraq. \nSeveral of us were already pointing to the disastrous results of the \nBush administration's flawed and failed Iraqi war policies. But Senator \nHagel's opposition to the war carried very special impact. He is a \nconservative, a member of the President's own political party, and a \nmilitary veteran. In fact, he still carries shrapnel in his chest and \nremnants of burns to his face from his service as an infantryman in \nVietnam. Senator Hagel now calls Mr. Bush's war in Iraq ``an absolute \nreplay of Vietnam.''\n  I will miss my friend and colleague. The Senate needs strong, \nindependent voices like Senator Hagel--lawmakers who are willing to put \nthe best interests of our country and American people over partisan \npolitics.\n\n\n                             pete domenici\n\n  Mr. President, when the Senate convenes next January, it is difficult \nto accept that Senator Domenici will not be here.\n  This son of an Italian immigrant grocer was elected to the Senate in \n1972, making him the first Republican in nearly 40 years to be elected \nto the Senate from the great State of New Mexico. He is now the longest \nserving Senator in the history of New Mexico.\n  In the Senate, he established himself as an expert on fiscal policies \nand the intricacies of the Federal budget. Having served with Senator \nDomenici on the Appropriations and Budget Committees, I have come to \nknow and respect him not only as a dear friend and colleague, but also \nas a formidable opponent. Senator Domenici and I have clashed swords \nmany times on the Senate floor, and, believe me, when you clashed with \nhim, you would have the fight of your life. He has one of the sharpest \nminds on Capitol Hill. He is one of the most knowledgeable people on \nthe budget on Capitol Hill. And he is always prepared.\n  Oh, how I regret that he will be leaving us all too soon. But I would \nlike to use this opportunity to thank the senior Senator from New \nMexico for his wonderful service and to congratulate him on an \noutstanding career in the Senate.\n  Thank you, Senator Domenici, for all your work for your State, and \nour country. And, thank you, Pete, for being a friend.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/12/09/senate-section/article/S10828-1", "month": "12", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10828-S10829]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO MAJOR BENJAMIN VENNING\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Major Benjamin \nVenning, U.S. Marine Corps, for his 3 years of service to the U.S. \nSenate and for his continued service to our Nation and its Corps.\n  From December 2005 to December 2006, Major Venning served in my \noffice as a military fellow. He came to my office soon after a tour in \nFallujah, where his actions in service to the United States earned him \na Bronze Star. Major Venning had experienced first-hand the rising \nviolence in Iraq. His on-the-ground experience in Iraq gave him \ntremendous insight on issues affecting servicemembers and veterans.\n  Many who served in Iraq and Afghanistan have returned with serious \nphysical injuries or have even paid the ultimate price. Others have \nreturned with more invisible wounds, injuries that are not immediately \napparent but that bring pain and suffering to a returning veteran and \nhis or her family. Today, traumatic brain injury and post-traumatic \nstress syndrome are recognized as signature injuries of the conflicts \nin Iraq and Afghanistan. While Major Venning served on my staff he \nhelped draw attention to these invisible wounds. With his relationships \nat Bethesda Naval, he helped me understand the impact of traumatic \nbrain injuries on returning soldiers and marines. With Major Venning on \nmy team, I was able to ask hard questions about how our government was \nresponding to the growing number of veterans needing help for these \nserious injuries.\n  In April 2006, I sent a letter that Major Venning worked on, which \nwas one of the first to ask the Department of Veterans Affairs to \nclosely review its ability to provide proper mental health care to \nreturning veterans. Another Senator from the State of Illinois signed \nthat letter: Barack Obama. Today, as the world awaits his inauguration, \nthe President-elect has promised he will continue to improve mental \nhealth treatment for troops and veterans suffering from combat-related \npsychological injuries.\n  After his service as a military fellow, Major Venning was named the \nDeputy Director of the Marine Corps Senate Liaison Office. It is no \nsurprise that he was as loved in that office as he was in mine. It was \nmy pleasure to host his promotion to major, with his friends and family \nin attendance, in my office in the Capitol. His commanding physical \npresence is matched only by his compassion and understanding of the \nissues facing our returning servicemembers, which was never on better \ndisplay than when he helped shepherd wounded veterans as my guests at \nthe State of the Union.\n  Major Ben Venning is a marine in the best tradition of the Corps. His \nefforts have informed the Congress and have represented the Corps' \nvalues and capabilities. His performance here will leave a lasting mark \non my office, the U.S. Senate and the Marine Corps long after he has \ndeparted.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, it is my pleasure today to congratulate and \nthank Major Benjamin Venning of the U.S. Marine Corps. This week, Major \nVenning finishes up a highly successful assignment as Deputy Director \nof the Marine Corps Liaison Office to the U.S. Senate, which is \nresponsible for providing information about the Corps to this \ninstitution. He has served the Senate and the Marine Corps superbly, \nand he is a credit to the entire Corps.\n  Major Venning learned about the Senate during a fellowship in 2006 \nwith Senator Durbin of Illinois. He worked on timely reserve pay and \nbudget issues, getting to know the ins-and-outs of the often arcane \nappropriations process. Senator Durbin, as I am, is a member of the \nSenate's Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, which handles the \nSenate's work in writing the annual budget bill for the Department of \nDefense. That was an ideal perch for Major Venning to grasp the \ncomplicated but essential financing of our extensive national security \noperations.\n  In his next assignment, joining the Corps' liaison office, he brought \nthe same sense of intelligence and integrity that he showed in that \nyear with the senior Senator from Illinois. Major Venning was always \nprompt in answering questions about the Marine Corps, whether about \nplans for growth of the force or the minutia of a particular program. \nHe and the entire team in the liaison office provided excellent support \nfor Senate delegations traveling to foreign nations to meet with \ninternational leaders and to review foreign assistance programs. He \nensured that extensive itineraries unfolded smoothly and productively.\n  Major Venning is a marine through and through, displaying great \ndedication to and knowledge about the force. Staffing a recent mission \noverseas, for example, hewing to longstanding tradition, he made sure \nthat the Corps'\n\n[[Page S10829]]\n\nbirthday was observed in a rousing rendition of ``Happy Birthday.''\n  It should be little surprise to anyone who has known Major Venning \nover the years--in his years growing up in South Carolina and Virginia \nor at college at the Virginia Military Institute--that he would become \nsuch an asset to the Corps. I have no doubt that he will bring the same \nsterling qualities in his next assignment with Company A, 4th \nAmphibious Assault Vehicle Battalion at Norfolk, VA.\n  Major Venning will go far in his future endeavors with the Corps and \nbeyond. I know that all Senators join in wishing him all the best and \nin expressing our heartfelt thanks for a job well done.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/12/09/senate-section/article/S10829-1", "month": "12", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10829-S10831]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  REMEMBERING RICHARD AND JEAN DeWINE\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to the parents of our \ngood friend and former colleague from Ohio, Mike DeWine. Richard and \nJean DeWine died just a few weeks ago, 4 days apart from each other. \nDick was 85, and Jean was 83. They were together almost their entire \nlives, sharing a beautiful love story and 65 wonderful years of \nmarriage.\n  I had the honor of meeting Mike's parents in February when I was \nvisiting Young's Jersey Dairy in their hometown of Yellow Springs, OH. \nIt was a privilege to talk to them. They were so gracious and kind. I \ncould see how proud they were of their son and how proud they were of \nour Nation.\n  Mike spoke about his parents' lives and especially their love of \nfamily at their joint funeral service held on November 5, 2008. In \ntribute to Dick and Jean, I ask unanimous consent that the entirety of \nhis remarks be printed in the Record at the conclusion of mine.\n  There were no two finer Americans than Dick and Jean DeWine. May God \nbless them and their family.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Thank you all so much for coming today and for your \n     friendship and love. Thank you to JoFrannye, Patty, Jocelyn, \n     and the choir for the music, and to our grandson Albert for \n     playing the piano before Mass.\n       Thank you Father Geraci and Father Hagan for being the \n     celebrants today, but I have to say to Father Tom that right \n     now, Dad must be thinking: ``This Mass is much, much too \n     long!''\n       I once asked Dad why he kept going to Fairborn to Mass. He \n     told me he found a great priest there, whose homilies were \n     exactly 3 minutes long!\n       Fran and I thank all of you who helped care for my parents, \n     enabling them to stay in their home the last few years, \n     especially Patrick, Jamie, Megan, and Barbara--thank you. All \n     of my parents' care givers have been just great.\n       And, thanks to all of you who stopped by to visit my \n     parents. Cousin Jerome, we thank you for always being there \n     to brighten my parents' day.\n       When I was growing up, I always thought that I had the \n     greatest parents in the world.\n       I never changed my mind.\n       My parents both grew up in Yellow Springs and both lived on \n     Xenia Avenue. Dad was born at home in a house, which is the \n     present day Wind's Cafe Wine Cellar. They lived next door to \n     the family feed store. Growing up practically in the feed \n     store, itself, and right in the heart of Yellow Springs, Dad \n     was surrounded by a colorful cast of characters who would \n     make a novelist proud! He could remember watching out his \n     bedroom window on Saturday nights, as fights would erupt \n     between patrons of the local bars.\n       One time, when Dad was a young boy, my grandfather asked \n     him if he wanted to ride with his employee, Jimmy, when he \n     took a feed delivery to Springfield. He told Dad he could \n     drag the bags from the back of the truck up to the front, so \n     that Jimmy wouldn't have to get on and off the truck to get \n     them.\n       Before leaving town, Jimmy and Dad each had a dime and \n     bought a 5-cent Bluebird pie. Since they both had a nickel \n     left over, Jimmy asked my young Dad if he wanted to play the \n     numbers. And, he did!\n       Later that day, when they got back to the feed store, my \n     grandfather, shouted, ``Dick, the Sheriff's been looking for \n     you! Were you playing the numbers? Dad ran out of the store, \n     screaming, ``The Sheriff will never find me!''\n       He went out and hid among the stacks of feed sacks. When my \n     grandfather finally found him, all he said was, ``Here's your \n     $25--you won!''\n       At the same time, my mother was growing up not far up the \n     street. Mother's father was a professor of literature at \n     Antioch College. He was an expert in Shakespeare, Chaucer, \n     and Milton. He and my grandmother greatly influenced my \n     mother, particularly instilling in her a great love and \n     appreciation for words.\n       My grandfather had grown up on a farm in upstate New York, \n     and every summer, he would take his family back there so he \n     could help with the farm work. Some of Mother's fondest \n     memories were of those idyllic summers--playing with her \n     sisters, Judy and Dorothy, in the ice house on hot summer \n     days, riding hay wagons, walking to get groceries at the \n     local general store, and watching her grandmother milk cows \n     on a one-legged stool!\n       As a young girl, Mother loved to ride horses. In fact, her \n     parents kept a horse at their house on Xenia Avenue! They \n     called the horse Cheyenne. Once when Mother was about 11 \n     years old, she rode Cheyenne all alone from Yellow Springs to \n     Wilberforce, some 7 miles away, using only the directions and \n     map that my grandfather drew for her.\n       In the summer of 1940, one of my father's best friends was \n     Herbert Berger. That year, Herbert went away for the summer. \n     He had asked Dad to ``look out for'' his girlfriend, who \n     happened to be 15-year-old Jean Liddle. Well, Dad did. And, \n     my parents were inseparable from then on.\n       Dick DeWine and Jean Liddle married 3 years later on \n     September 2, 1943. Dad was 20, and Mother was 18.\n       World War II, of course, was raging at this time. Dad went \n     in as a replacement. He was a Private with K Company and saw \n     combat in France, Germany, and Austria. Captain Bell was \n     their leader. About five years ago, Dad sent an email about \n     first seeing Captain Bell when he and his buddy, Ernie \n     Dessecker, had arrived in Europe and were awaiting their \n     company assignment. This is what my dad wrote:\n       ``We were told that the next morning, we would be assigned \n     to some infantry company. That night, we went into a bar and \n     were bought some beer by some GI's who knew we were--for want \n     of a better word--very uptight. All they talked about was \n     Captain Bell and his K Company. They told us that if we \n     wanted to do a lot of fighting that would be the company to \n     be assigned to. That was not really what [Ernie] and I had in \n     mind!\n       The next day, we were loaded on a truck and at each town, \n     it would stop and some names were called to get off. When \n     Dess and I were told to get off, the first thing we asked \n     was, `What company is this?' When told it was Company K, we \n     both wished we could climb back on that truck and head for \n     the rear echelon! Of course, in a very short time, we were so \n     very proud to be part of Captain Bell's Company K. . . .''\n       Dad never forgot the men with whom he served, maintaining \n     friendships for over six decades. He also never forgot the \n     horrific things he saw when K Company was sent to the Dachau \n     concentration camp shortly after it was liberated in April \n     1945. From the time I was just a kid, Dad told me stories \n     about Dachau and how people in the nearby town would tell the \n     soldiers that they hadn't really known what the Nazis were \n     doing. Dad could never quite comprehend that.\n       On the day before the German surrender in Europe, Dad spent \n     the night in a fox hole near Innsbruck, Austria. He heard \n     rumors that the War was nearing an end. But still, Dad stayed \n     awake all night in that fox hole, fearing that the enemy \n     would attack. He remembered thinking that he saw German \n     troops coming at him. When he compared notes with all his \n     buddies later, they, too, had experienced the same thing.\n       When the War did end that next day, they rode into \n     Innsbruck, where people greeted him and the other soldiers \n     with a shower of flowers. Meanwhile, Mother and Aunt Judy \n     celebrated the German surrender by riding on a fire truck in \n     an impromptu parade down the streets of Yellow Springs. Dad's \n     two younger siblings, my Aunt Mickey and Uncle Jerry, watched \n     the parade with pride.\n       Last week, I started reading my parents' letters to each \n     other when Dad was fighting in Europe. They are letters of \n     great passion and love, written by two young kids, who were \n     only married a year when the War separated them. They write \n     of their plans and dreams and of the child they hoped to \n     conceive as soon as Dad got home. Dad's letter refers to that \n     child as ``Mike,'' while Mother's letter references Michael--\n     a distinction they would each make throughout my life.\n       Dad came home in April, in time for Reds Opening Day, and I \n     was born on January 5th, that year.\n       Dad taught me to fish, to hunt, and to love OSU football \n     and Dayton Flyer basketball. But, his real passion was the \n     Cincinnati Reds!\n       When Dad was 16, he and one of his buddies camped out in \n     line for 36 hours to get tickets for the 1939 World Series, \n     when the Reds were playing the Yankees. They ended up in two \n     different ticket lines, but had made a deal that whoever got \n     up to the ticket counter before the tickets ran out would \n     buy two. Dad was able to get two tickets, but then he \n     couldn't find his friend. It got close to game time, and \n     Dad had to go inside the ballpark.\n       When he was inside, though, he went up to the top deck at \n     Crosley Field and searched again for his friend. He looked \n     down below, outside the ballpark, and there was his buddy, \n     walking away in tears, empty-handed.\n       Dad reached into his pocket and pulled out the silver \n     dollar that his father had given him and wrapped the other \n     baseball ticket around it. Then, he threw it over the \n     railing, hoping and praying that it would fall at the feet of \n     his friend.\n       Amazingly, it did--and they both watched that game \n     together.\n\n[[Page S10830]]\n\n       Mother taught me about different kinds of things. She \n     passed on to me her love of books and taught me about the \n     power of language and the written word. She also taught me \n     how to debate and argue.\n       You see, Mother loved words--and knew how to use them. When \n     I was growing up, the conversations at our dinner table \n     covered a whole range of topics--books and music and sports \n     and movies and, of course, current affairs and politics. Both \n     Mother and Dad were always interested in politics, but Mother \n     took her positions to the public.\n       In the early 1960s, after seeing several of her Letters to \n     the Editor in the Yellow Springs News, then-editor Keith \n     Howard persuaded Mother to write a weekly column articulating \n     a conservative viewpoint--a position that was certainly not \n     then--and certainly not now--especially popular here in \n     Yellow Springs. She titled her column, ``A View from the \n     Right.''\n       In an October 21, 1964, column, she articulated her strong \n     support for Barry Goldwater and conservative philosophy. She \n     opened the column with this line, ``If I were to give one, \n     and only one, reason for voting for Barry Goldwater, it would \n     be because of his firm stand against the frightening growth \n     of the federal government, its power-grabbing programs, and \n     its insidious intrusion into virtually every phase of our \n     lives.'' And that was back in 1964.\n       Mother was such a bright, articulate, well-read, \n     knowledgeable woman, with the most sophisticated and clever \n     wry wit. Her amazing, light-hearted rhyming poems always made \n     you smile. Take this one, for instance, that ran in her \n     column at Christmastime in the early 1960s. She titled it, \n     ``Love One and All--Right, Center and Left!'':\n\n     'Twas the week before Christmas, and all through the town, \n           ev'ry creature was stirring--both uptown and down.\n     The stores were all fancied with tinsel and things, and \n           somewhere a highly-fi'd caroler sings.\n     While I at my battered old typewriter sit, my brain in a \n           quandary, my brow tightly knit.\n     I can't seem to think now on Cuba or Adlai, or the state of \n           the world--either goodly or badly.\n     I cudgel my brain for the newsworthy fellas, the Stevensons, \n           Goldwaters, Khans, and Ben Bellas.\n     Not a thought do they bring to my brain sore and lame, tho' I \n           whistled like crazy and called them by name:\n     ``Now Hoffa, now Bobby, now Rocky and Barry,\n     On Jack and McMillan and `Fidel-the-Hairy.' ''\n     To the top of my head to the top of the page\n     The gears in my brain simply will not engage.\n     It's Christmas and I am opinion-bereft, and I love one and \n           all--Right and Center and Left.\n     So I'll leave you with this thought (at least for tonight), \n           Merry Christmas--that's all--from ``A View from the \n           Right.''\n\n       My mother was unique and extraordinary. She had many sides \n     to her and many interests. In her youth, she was a vibrant, \n     strikingly beautiful woman. She and Aunt Judy were varsity \n     cheerleaders at Bryan High School. She rode horses, and early \n     in their marriage, Dad and Mother fished and camped, often \n     taking Uncle Jerry and Aunt Mickey with them, and also camped \n     with Aunt Judy and Uncle Leo. Later, Dad and Mother would \n     stay out on their old houseboat on the Ohio River.\n       Mother loved music. I can remember her playing the \n     accordion when I was a kid. Mother always had an LP record \n     playing--Nat King Cole, Frank Sinatra, Jo Stafford, the \n     Kingston Trio.\n       Mother could have been a professional writer. All of our \n     kids got their ability to write from their grandmother (it \n     skipped a generation). The kids didn't inherit her abilities \n     so much as they learned to write through Mother's presence in \n     their lives and by listening to her and how she chose her \n     words in their conversations. She read prolifically herself, \n     and loved to read books to our kids.\n       My dad could talk to anyone, and that is because he had a \n     genuine interest in people. He was naturally curious about \n     them. It didn't matter whom he was talking to, he wanted to \n     know all about the person. How did you make a living? Where \n     did you grow up? What about your family? Many times, I \n     marveled that Dad knew more about my own friends than I did. \n     That is because he asked them questions and talked to them \n     and listened.\n       As our son, John, wrote to his grandparents,\n       You taught me how to treat people. Employees, the guy at \n     the paint shop, whoever--regardless of their social status, \n     you treat everyone the same. And it is a good way to treat \n     people.\n       And that is part of what made Dad such a brilliant \n     negotiator, trader, and investor. Like his parents before \n     him, he built DeWine Seeds and the Ohio Twine Company on \n     close personal relationships--whether they were with local \n     farmers, seed dealers, elevator operators, or international \n     businessmen. Dad took the business his parents were so \n     successful at and took it to a new level. These \n     relationships, which he maintained until his death, allowed \n     him to keenly understand the markets and to gather \n     information to make trades and deals across the country and \n     around the world in places as different as Uruguay, Poland, \n     and Ireland.\n       Dad was a real dealmaker. Our oldest son, Patrick, put it \n     best, ``It didn't matter if he was buying a new lawnmower or \n     selling seed in Europe, no one was better than Dick.''\n       Dad was always an optimist. He told me that he just \n     couldn't wait to get up every morning. He loved life \n     immensely. When my mother a few months ago expressed the hope \n     that they would leave this Earth together, he looked at her \n     and allowed as how he was not about to leave anytime soon.\n       At the end of each day, he looked forward to the next and \n     to working on the list of things on his legal pad that he \n     wanted to accomplish. Dad never stopped working and never \n     stopped looking ahead. In fact, in the last month of his \n     life, after battling cancer for over 3 years, he still had \n     his list. He went through his files and sent out old photos \n     and newspaper clippings to friends.\n       And, in those last days, Dad even bought a farm.\n       Mother and Dad loved their home on their 24 acres on \n     Fairfield Pike. After they sold the seed business, my dad and \n     mother would be found each day out in their office in the \n     barn working. You would go out there, and there they would \n     be--one at one desk and one at the other.\n       They had purchased that property--which was part of \n     Whitehall Farm--from Martha Rankin. Along with my \n     grandfather, they rebuilt the dam that had been blown in \n     1912, and created a pond, which attracted countless ducks and \n     Canada Geese. They spent years converting a pasture field \n     into a mosaic of grape vines; berry thickets; vegetable and \n     flower gardens; and fruit, nut, and stately trees, including \n     sugar maples, spruce, red oak, hemlock and bald cypress. Dad \n     grew many of the plants himself in the greenhouse he built \n     with bricks from the old St. Brigid Church, which he, Mother, \n     and some of the grandchildren gathered after the 1974 Xenia \n     tornado.\n       My parents were extraordinary grandparents. They gave our \n     children the best gift of all--and that was the gift of their \n     time.\n       Mama and Dick, as all my kids called them, were always \n     involved in their lives. They put each of their eight \n     grandchildren to work as they were growing up, teaching them \n     how to weed; paint fences; prune trees; pick apples, \n     cherries, and raspberries; and mow grass. My parents were \n     both phenomenal teachers who taught their grandchildren how \n     to enjoy hard work and appreciate a job well done.\n       All of our children have such fond memories of Mama and \n     Dick, whether the kids were working in the greenhouse; \n     fishing in the pond; or picking fruit and berries on hot \n     summer days. They can still smell the fire burning outside \n     when they would help Mama and Dick make bean soup and maple \n     syrup from their own trees.\n       Dick would tell the kids fantastic stories about the Giant \n     Mouse, who would fly him around the pond, and the leprechauns \n     living under the trees. And Dick and Mama both played \n     countless games of checkers with the kids.\n       And then, there were the muddy feet that Mother tried so \n     hard to keep off her floor. As she wrote in a limerick for \n     her grandchildren:\n\n     To all grandkids great and small\n     Muddy feet don't walk in the hall\n     Take off your shoes and make it snappy\n     If Mama's mad, nobody's happy\n\n       Our daughter, Alice, remembers ``picking berries and \n     selling them at the Farmers Market'' and ``Mama's Crustless \n     Sandwiches'' (cut into fourths) and ``Mama's Fettuccini.'' \n     Our daughter, Anna, remembers painting Mama and Dick's fence \n     with her brother Mark and nephew Albert and ``being covered \n     head to toe in paint!''\n       The kids also remember ``all of the fires Dick made in the \n     fireplace--so comforting and always done just right.'' As our \n     daughter, Jill, recalled, ``We could sit for hours \n     alternating between warming our backs and backing away for a \n     few moments long enough to cool off enough, and then going \n     back for more.''\n       There were also all the conversations that took place in \n     the back of their car when Mama and Dick would take the kids \n     to and from lunch on their work breaks. As our son Mark \n     described,\n\n       ``The stories that I have heard there have always stuck \n     close to me. They can be about my seven unique siblings, the \n     way things used to be, or maybe even a lesson learned in \n     grammar. The tales I hear, some are the same, and some are \n     new. The old ones never lose their luster; because every time \n     I hear them, they take on a new meaning. No radio could ever \n     replace the great anecdotes I have listened to [in the back \n     of that car].''\n\n       One of our son Brian's favorite memories was when we were \n     visiting Mama and Dick in Florida once and, as Brian says,\n\n       ``My sister, Jill, threw me in the pool with all my clothes \n     on (she still denies it!). For some reason, I think Dick \n     thought I deserved it. Then Mama had to take me shopping to \n     get new shoes so we could go out and to eat.''\n\n       Our daughter, Becky, was also very close to Mama and Dick. \n     They visited her when she was studying in Britain. They met \n     Becky and her friend, Kim, in Cornwall. That trip always had \n     special meaning for my parents.\n       When I woke up this morning, I realized that I won't be \n     able to go tell my mother and father about how our son \n     Patrick was just elected Judge yesterday and how our daughter \n     Alice passed the Bar Exam. . . .\n\n[[Page S10831]]\n\n       When I look back at my parents' lives, they have left a \n     very tangible legacy. It is visible in the land--the trees \n     and the flowers and the plants that they grew on their 24 \n     acres and the improvements they made to their farmland.\n       But their more important legacy is their grandchildren. \n     That is the lesson of my parents' lives: There is no \n     substitute for the time spent with family and with people.\n       They were an integral part of our children's lives. They \n     worked with our kids, talked with our kids, listened to our \n     kids. It was a wonderful relationship and a wonderful gift \n     that dramatically influenced each of them--in ways obvious \n     and not so obvious--and will, in turn, influence each of \n     their children.\n       The last thing my father did before he died was have our \n     son, John, order several bushels of flower bulbs. Up until \n     the very end, Dad was planning for the future. He wanted the \n     bulbs to be planted in his yard and in Aunt Judy's yard and \n     in our yard. His great-grandchildren helped plant those bulbs \n     just a week before his death.\n       And when those flowers bloom next spring, we will think of \n     Mama and Dick.\n       For over 65 years, my parents loved each other and took \n     care of each other. They had fun and loved their life \n     together. They were quite a team. Mother always considered \n     herself ``Dick's straight man.'' And she was. They made us \n     laugh. They made us smile.\n       I would like to conclude by reading from one of Mother's \n     letters to Dad, as she waited for his return to Yellow \n     Springs from World War II. This one was numbered 407. She \n     wrote:\n       I can have patience, though, in this matter [of your \n     return], specially since, if the news is good, and I think it \n     will be, I know what the outcome of it all will be--it'll be \n     exactly what I've been, and of course, my darling, you, too, \n     [have been] waiting for, for so damned long--the perfect set-\n     up of Jeanie and Dick, together for ever and ever.\n       Remember that, ``As long as you both shall live?''\n       That's right, honey, that's us 100%--and if nothing else, \n     I'm sure of that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/12/09/senate-section/article/S10831-1", "month": "12", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10831]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      NOMINATION OF NEIL BAROFSKY\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am pleased to have supported the \nnomination of Neil M. Barofsky to be the Special Inspector General for \nthe Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP, at the Treasury Department.\n  I have a great interest in the Special IG for the TARP. I raised the \nidea in the first place, the first weekend that we were examining the \nTreasury financial bailout proposal.\n  As many will remember, the Treasury's original proposal for the TARP \nwas three pages long. It gave the Secretary of the Treasury unlimited \npower over $700 billion. And it provided no oversight by anyone.\n  The House and Senate spent 2 weeks hammering out a better bill. That \nbetter bill included strong oversight, and it included the office of a \nSpecial IG for the financial rescue program, as I proposed that first \nweekend.\n  The size and complexity of this effort is unprecedented in recent \nmemory. It is essential to have a team that focuses exclusively on the \nTARP program as managed by the Treasury Department, and it is essential \nfor that team to report to Congress on the status of this new program.\n  My proposal for a Special IG was based on the Iraqi Reconstruction \nSpecial Inspector General. That was another massive oversight \nchallenge. As the Congress debated what to include in the rescue \npackage, 33 Senators signed a letter to the congressional leadership \nendorsing the idea of a Special IG to oversee the troubled asset \nprogram.\n  During the negotiations, the Treasury Department resisted. But then \nthe administration and Congress agreed that the Special IG should be \npart of the final legislation. Congress passed it, and the President \nsigned it into law.\n  The law gives the Special IG a $50 million budget. He will have the \nduties and responsibilities of inspectors general under the Inspector \nGeneral Act of 1978. He will have the power to supervise and coordinate \naudits and investigations of TARP activities. He will have the power to \nappoint staff to carry out the activities of the office. And he may \nenter into contracts for audits and studies. We expect a report to the \nFinance Committee every 120 days on the activities of the TARP, and the \nlaw also directs the Special IG to report to Congress if information he \nrequests is refused.\n  I support the nomination of Mr. Neil Barofsky. I congratulate him for \nhis willingness to serve his country. It is going to be a demanding \njob. For some time, he is going to be playing catchup. I believe Mr. \nBarofsky's experience as a prosecutor with the U.S. Attorney's Office \nin the Southern District of New York will serve him well in his new \nrole as the Special IG.\n  The financial rescue program is huge--$700 billion. The number and \nvariety of financial institutions receiving money from Treasury is \nextensive. Tracking the path of the bailout dollars through these \ninstitutions is going to be a difficult task.\n  The harsh reality is that almost half the $700 billion is already out \nthe door of the TARP. The new Special IG will be looking back at \nTreasury's use of about $290 billion dollars in 45 days.\n  Anyone who has seen a number of the congressional hearings this week, \nincluding our Senate Finance Committee on November 17, knows there are \na lot of questions about how the TARP is operating.\n  We know that the Treasury Department has named Neel Kashkari, \nAssistant Secretary for International Economics, to head the financial \nrescue program.\n  Treasury has decided to send $125 billion to nine major banks, \nincluding Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase. Another $125 billion will be \nallocated for thousands of small and midsized banks. The American \nInternational Group, or AIG, will receive around $40 billion of TARP \nfunds in return for issuing preferred shares to the Treasury \nDepartment.\n  Secretary Paulson has also announced a policy regarding preferred \nshares and warrants for common stock. Standards for restrictions on \nexecutive compensation are being developed. Those include a clawback \nprovision and a ban on golden parachutes during the period that \nTreasury holds equity issued through this program.\n  Several senior posts have been filled. And the law firm Simpson \nThacher & Bartlett has been selected as a legal adviser.\n  Treasury has announced that the Bank of New York Mellon will serve as \nits custodian for the implementation of the Troubled Asset Relief \nProgram, and PricewaterhouseCoopers and Ernst & Young have been hired \nto help with accounting and internal controls services.\n  These decisions made by the Treasury Department are critically \nimportant to the financial rescue program. Yet the Treasury has made \nthem all without any oversight by a Special IG.\n  As for the use of the funds, the bottom line, frankly, is that the \nSecretary of Treasury told Congress and the American people that the \nBush administration needed $700 billion to purchase troubled assets. \nYet last month, the Treasury Secretary announced that, in fact, there \nwere no plans to purchase troubled assets. To say that this was a \nsurprise is an understatement. Congress needs to find out why the first \nplan was rejected and a new plan was developed. What is the theory \nbehind the new plan for providing equity to these financial \nestablishments? What exactly are the agreements with the financial \ninstitutions who have received TARP funds? And what conflict of \ninterest standards were followed? Once the Special IG is in place, we \ncan start to answer some of these questions.\n  Half the money is gone. And it is way past the time when we should \nhave had a Special Inspector General on the job overseeing the program.\n  I am pleased that the Senate has confirmed Mr. Barofsky, and I look \nforward to helping him conduct aggressive oversight of the TARP \nprogram.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/12/09/senate-section/article/S10831-2", "month": "12", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10831-S10833]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                IDAHOANS SPEAK OUT ON HIGH ENERGY PRICES\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, in mid-June, I asked Idahoans to share with \nme how high energy prices are affecting their lives, and they responded \nby the hundreds. The stories, numbering well over 1,200, are \nheartbreaking and touching. While energy prices have dropped in recent \nweeks, the concerns expressed remain very relevant. To respect the \nefforts of those who took the opportunity to share their thoughts, I am \nsubmitting every e-mail sent to me through an address set up \nspecifically for this purpose to the Congressional Record. This is not \nan issue that will be easily resolved, but it is one that deserves \nimmediate and serious attention, and Idahoans deserve to be heard. \nTheir stories not only detail their struggles to meet everyday \nexpenses,\n\n[[Page S10832]]\n\nbut also have suggestions and recommendations as to what Congress can \ndo now to tackle this problem and find solutions that last beyond \ntoday. I ask unanimous consent to have today's letters printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       I am one of the owners of Doug Andrus Distributing in Idaho \n     Falls. We operate nearly 270 trucks, hauling freight all over \n     the United States. As you are probably aware, energy prices \n     are taking quite a toll on trucking companies across the \n     country. I have recently been made aware that nearly 1,000 \n     trucking companies have gone out of business in the 1st \n     quarter of this year. The combination of high fuel prices and \n     a slow economy has made the trucking business very difficult. \n     Because of the slow economy there is too much supply in \n     trucking making it difficult to pass on the increased costs \n     primarily driven by fuel.\n       In September of 2005, our company's fuel costs reached $1 \n     million. Today they exceed $2 million on nearly the same \n     amount of business. We are looking for every way we can find \n     to get better fuel economy. Most recently we have slowed our \n     truck speeds to 62 MPH. While this should result in great \n     fuel savings for our company, it potentially will reduce the \n     total income of our drivers as they will struggle to drive \n     the same number of miles in the driving hours they are \n     restricted to. Drivers are paid per mile. Therefore the \n     paychecks for 270 Idaho drivers will likely decrease while at \n     the same time their cost of living is increasing due to \n     increasing costs for fuel and food.\n       We have got to realize in this country the serious \n     consequences of our energy policy. The highest priority must \n     be to increase production of petroleum within our own \n     borders. We must open more areas to drilling and we must \n     build more refineries. We must also renew efforts to develop \n     nuclear energy to take some of the demand away from oil.\n       I appreciate your concern for this issue. I watch closely \n     the way you handle these issues and am very supportive of the \n     positions you have taken. I hope the high prices will \n     encourage Americans to let their voices be heard so that \n     Congress will make policy that will encourage activities to \n     alleviate the pressures on energy prices.\n           Respectfully,\n     Jason, Idaho Falls.\n                                  ____\n\n       Keep up the great work, Senator, and let us decorate our \n     beaches before the foreigners do. Besides, windmills and \n     derricks are beautiful!\n     Merle.\n                                  ____\n\n       I am a single mother of two with one full-time job and one \n     part-time job. Between the two jobs, I work approximately 56 \n     hours a week. Because of the high gas prices, I will work my \n     part time job longer than I had originally planned. We have \n     cut back on grocery shopping, going out to eat, \n     entertainment. We have a large video library and use that for \n     entertainment. It is just too expensive to drive anywhere. I \n     am scared what will happen once the gas prices reach an \n     amount that will not allow me to drive anywhere. I cannot \n     afford the prices right now and keep cutting back on spending \n     on other important things like food and utilities. I feel \n     poor and I am not. I wish the government would do what is \n     right and protect American consumers at the pumps.\n     Nikcole.\n                                  ____\n\n       First of all, allow me to thank you for not only listening \n     to your constituents when we have contacted you in the past, \n     but also for soliciting our opinions now when energy crises \n     face us.\n       I have taught at a small school 38 miles south of where I \n     live for the past seven years. I love where I teach and I \n     love my students. However, this last month I have applied for \n     a job in my home town due to the doubling of gas prices. I \n     have tried to convince my district to go to a four-day school \n     week, like some surrounding districts have done, but they are \n     not interested. Thus, as a commuter, I have made the tough \n     decision of leaving the job I love simply because I cannot \n     afford the gas bill.\n       Five Priorities for Congress:\n       1. Free America from foreign oil dependency.\n       2. Stop tying America's hands: loosen EPA regulations and \n     government restrictions for drilling, building refineries, \n     and bringing existing refineries up to code.\n       3. Allow responsible drilling for oil in ANWR and off the \n     coast. Take advantage of the shale in the Rockies.\n       4. Seek alternatives that do not harm Americans (i.e. corn \n     for ethanol when we are facing food shortages across the \n     globe).\n       5. Explore nuclear and clean coal options.\n       I personally believe the current energy crisis has been \n     crafted and perpetrated by the far left Eco-jihadists. They \n     will promote their ``green earth'' agenda to the detriment of \n     American interests and our entire economy. When gas prices \n     are high, people drive less, and thus Environmentalists are \n     ecstatic. The clearly Marxist overtones in all of this carbon \n     footprint mumbo jumbo (cap & trade = the redistribution of \n     wealth) is frightening only because Congress has begun to \n     listen to these anti-capitalists and sponsor/pass legislation \n     reflecting their alliances.\n     April, Lewiston.\n                                  ____\n\n       In the past couple of months the gas prices have really \n     affected me and everyone around me. My brothers took over my \n     dad's cabinet shop about a year ago and the economy has taken \n     such a dive that they do not have any work and had to lay off \n     my boyfriend. My boyfriend found another cabinet shop that \n     was still busy, but within 2 months he was laid off again due \n     to lack of work. We went another two months with only my \n     part-time income before he was able to find work again. We \n     cannot afford gas to get to work so we are riding our bikes \n     to work. We have shut off our phones and are still struggling \n     to pay for groceries, and are paying all of our bills late. \n     We are racking up credit cards for groceries or gas when we \n     have to. We used to be a very active couple that would go \n     camping, back-packing or mountain biking all over the western \n     region, and now we only ride our bikes to work and are too \n     tired to go on the trails after work. We only walk the dogs \n     through the neighborhood instead of going up to the hills and \n     letting them run and play and we are not able to go on any \n     trips this summer. I know that there are lots of other people \n     suffering more than we are, but not being able to live our \n     normal lives is extremely hard and frustrating when we watch \n     the gas companies getting richer as we are all suffering.\n       Gas companies are reporting their highest profits while the \n     economy is nearing a dangerous low; someone needs to step in \n     and stop the gas companies. If they were smart, they would \n     lower gas prices again so that more gas would be bought. \n     People are not going on vacations or buying anything that is \n     not necessary. If gas was affordable, we would be traveling \n     every weekend, buying more groceries, and splurging on date \n     nights or clothes that I do not have to get but just want. \n     The more the money is returned into the economy, the more \n     jobs are provided which, in turn, is more people with money \n     who are able to spend more. The gas companies may be too \n     blinded by greed to realize that this all comes full circle \n     to them because the more products that are bought the more \n     products are needed to be shipped across the country which \n     takes gas to get to us either in a truck or a plane. At the \n     rate that we are going, the lower and middle classes will end \n     up in depression status, unable to survive, and the rich will \n     become the middle class and eventually end up with the rest \n     of us because the economy depends on the lower and middle \n     class to survive. The wealthy get their money from the \n     spending habits of the lower classes and if there is no \n     money, there is no spending and the economy crashes.\n     Brandi.\n                                  ____\n\n       I have a different angle than most who will likely write to \n     you with concerns about rising gas prices.\n       I work out of an office in my home, providing customized \n     training to clients around the world. Since I do not commute \n     to/from work, you might think that I am not concerned about \n     higher prices. However, even though I do not drive my car \n     much for work, the dramatic cost increase is affecting me and \n     everybody else because virtually all of our day-to-day cost \n     of living expenses are directly tied to the cost of \n     petroleum--many of them in multiple ways causing the \n     increases to be multiplied.\n       Because of the work that I do, primarily coaching \n     technology commercialization professional, I am aware of so \n     many energy-related technologies that are being developed in \n     the research laboratories across the U.S. and around the \n     world. And many other countries are taking a much more \n     proactive stand to assist in bringing these exciting new \n     innovations a state where they can be highly beneficial to \n     all of us, save us a lot of money, and be helpful to the \n     environment, etc.\n       Each and every U.S. citizen--democrat, republican, white, \n     black, Jew, Christian, Muslim, male, female, young, old--\n     stands to benefit greatly by our government taking \n     appropriate measures to get the U.S. on a faster track to \n     more effective energy production, distribution, and use.\n     John, Idaho Falls.\n                                  ____\n\n       I do not know that a single story can convey the \n     frustration, anger, hardship and disappointment that I (and \n     others) I talk to are experiencing as a result of the current \n     state of the ``energy economy''. It affects my family, my \n     business, my customers, my employees, my neighbors. Without \n     being over melodramatic the effects are deadly. The most \n     frustrating part is that many of us believe it is not only a \n     self-inflicted wound, but that we continue to reload the \n     weapon and offering handing it over to others to shoot us as \n     well.\n       Cap and trade, gas tax holidays and windfall profit taxes \n     are some of the most asinine ideas to come around the pike \n     since James Earl Carter introduced us to malaise. There has \n     to be someone who understands that a centralized economy does \n     not work to alleviate market problems, but only makes them \n     worse in the long haul.\n       Please do your part to pass some sensible rules to protect \n     the natural environment, establish an economic environment \n     that gives some certainty to the people and companies that \n     will invest in identifying and producing market driven \n     energy, and please, please do your part to get the Congress \n     out of the way so Americans can do what Americans do best--\n     solve the problem.\n       Sending our capital to the Middle East to pay for energy \n     that we have in abundance on\n\n[[Page S10833]]\n\n     the land and on the shelf does not speak well for our \n     collective intelligence.\n       Unleash the sleeping tiger of free-enterprise.\n     Ron.\n                                  ____\n\n       Drilling for oil now is our only hope. It is out there; it \n     is what we need; go get it! I am encouraged this morning that \n     John McCain wants to drill off shore again. All of the \n     conserving, all of the money being invested in testing new \n     technologies is not going to cut it and it is no substitution \n     for what we really need: OIL! Wind and electricity are not \n     going to power my car or the many other things that need it. \n     Depending on oil from the Middle East is shameful. Please \n     tell Congress to allow production in full force offshore \n     California and in the Gulf, Alaska and in the mid-west now \n     and start repairing the old refineries and building new ones. \n     It needs to be on the fast track; in other words do not take \n     years writing an environmental impact statement. It can be \n     done safely and with minimum impact to the environment.\n       It is very sad that I am no longer able to travel to visit \n     my 78-year-old Mom in northern Arizona, a trip I/we used to \n     make twice a year. This is distancing families more than \n     ever. I may never see my other family members in California \n     or Minnesota again unless gas prices drop. I am a 56-year-old \n     widow struggling to make ends meet. I have had to give up \n     driving any long distances. I only drive for local errands. \n     It is a struggle now to pay heat, electric and food bills and \n     it will only get worse. But heck, my family and friends are \n     in the same boat; they cannot afford to visit me either.\n       I am sadly watching the elderly and disabled attempting to \n     walk or ride bicycles to the grocery store that should not. I \n     am seeing empty shelves at the grocery stores and other \n     merchants because the trucks have not come in or are not \n     coming as often. This is nuts.\n       My husband admired you; if he were here now, he would be \n     the one who had a lot to say about the current situation \n     America is in. You met him on a boat in Lake Coeur d'Alene \n     quite awhile ago. He had much knowledge of our current \n     situation as far back as the 1970s and predicted as did many \n     others our current situation. He died of a brain tumor in \n     1999. His resume included work in Libya, Alaska, the Gulf, \n     offshore Santa Barbara working for Baroid, and over 30 years \n     of government service with the U.S. Geological Survey and \n     Bureau of Land Management.\n     Carol, Moscow.\n                                  ____\n\n       In response to your energy prices email--the increase for \n     gasoline has been tremendous for my husband and me. We both \n     are senior citizens, but still have jobs and go to work every \n     day. Bob is a realtor and spends $100 minimum per week. My \n     cost is $50 plus, even though I do not use my vehicle for \n     work. We live about 14 miles from our offices, and we do not \n     have economy vehicles. We probably could not even sell our \n     cars right now. I work on commission and my paycheck for last \n     month was $256; that barely covers the $200 plus for \n     gasoline. Both of these businesses are down right now.\n       We totally agree with your thinking on this--keep up the \n     good work. Why cannot others get it??\n     Cheryl, Coeur d'Alene.\n                                  ____\n\n       Feeling the pinch is an understatement. I am very eco-\n     friendly as much that can be afforded; however, when you \n     weigh in the costs for the current prices, it makes it close \n     to impossible to save to afford to be more eco-friendly. Thus \n     creating a further pinch on my way of life. We are setting \n     back those in our economy and simply making it more difficult \n     to do business. From my aspect, I oversee four hotels in the \n     area and not only is airline travel being down causing an \n     issue to our hotels but the overall cost of operations has \n     risen. These operational costs have been from the increase in \n     food cost many sur-charge related to fuel, to a higher rate \n     of pay to incentive employees to drive that car to work every \n     day, the list can go on.\n       Personally, I am a single mother and all the costs of my \n     child are that for me to provide. The smallest incremental \n     raise in cost creates stress in our way of life. We have to \n     wage out some other wise ``affordable'' fun things to do if \n     driving is (and as I love to see Idaho) involved. My gas \n     costs have nearly doubled, food is costing more, and there \n     are limited options other than facing these and dealing with \n     them at face value. I would love to see there be more \n     alternate fuel options so that we are using only what is \n     necessary when it comes to oil.\n       I support anything you are doing that will make the world a \n     more friendly environment and reusable environment; my \n     greatest hope would be for this evolution to also allow more \n     of my money to stay in my home.\n                                                           Shawna.\n       Thank you for the opp. Our small business is fairly new, \n     started in 2005, when we changed venue from a motel. It has \n     never been a million dollar enterprise, but we did not expect \n     that and did not need that; just hoped it was something we \n     could hand to our kids when we retire. Every time the gas \n     prices went up, business went down. Then the foreclosures \n     started. Now many of our customers are gone. Some are even \n     going back to California! We are now contemplating \n     bankruptcy. The energy costs are a large part of the reason \n     why. We have a small second hand store where we also sell \n     hand crafted furniture and our pottery. When someone comes \n     into our store with a LIST! we know things are going down the \n     tube. This is the kind of store people normally spend time \n     browsing in. Very few customers can afford to just shop \n     anymore. They are struggling to buy gas to even go to town, \n     and to buy groceries. I suggest an investigation into \n     hydrogen power. It was going well in 1978, then no more was \n     heard about it. We are promoting it to anyone who will \n     listen, and I am going to spend time investigating; not just \n     the feasibility of it, but the how. It is now a definite \n     option.\n       Thank you for listening,\n     Nancy, Priest River.\n                                  ____\n\n       I just want to say that as a Disabled American, I feel the \n     pain!! My wife of many years works for the City of Boise \n     while I am disabled and we are no longer moving forward. She \n     works hard at the Water Treatment plant everyday and I battle \n     my conditions equally hard and yet as I fight, the more it \n     costs, electricity for my oxygen machine, co-payments to \n     doctors offices, procedures, medications . . . etc. Now with \n     this INFLATION hitting, we are feeling the effects of $4.00 \n     gas, higher utilities cost across the board, food prices and \n     on and on.\n       See the thing is, we have been preparing for this for \n     awhile now. Back in 2004 we traded in our 1994 Ford Taurus \n     SHO @ 16 MPG Premium Fuel for a 2004 Honda Civic Hybrid that \n     has gotten us to a real 40 MPG regular fuel. About the same \n     time we moved closer to Sandra's work to save on daily \n     driving. We even went to riding trikes to the Pharmacy and \n     the grocery store, and my wife additionally rides hers to \n     work now a couple of times a week or so . . . and yet we are \n     using savings and have even cut back on putting funds that is \n     matched by the City of Boise. We will be in trouble in a few \n     years unless something changes. I do not know what our \n     government is going to do, but I believe that if they gave \n     some sort of incentive to buyers to get into hybrids as well \n     as the new clean burning diesel ala Europe. We could improve \n     the oil situation, we have cut our usage by more than you \n     would believe. Drilling up north is happening next door in \n     Canada, what is up with us? We need to be making changes that \n     the rest of the plant sees. We could help the USD to bounce \n     back some and that would help reduce the cost of gas.\n     Pete.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/12/09/senate-section/article/S10833-1", "month": "12", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10833]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n              125TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE FREDERICK NEWS-POST\n\n Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, today I wish to honor and \ncongratulate the Frederick News-Post on its 125th anniversary. On \nOctober 15, 1883, a printing company in Frederick, MD, published the \nfirst edition of The News, an evening newspaper that reported about \nlocal happenings. In 1916, this printing company purchased another \nlocal paper, the Frederick Post, which it continued to offer in the \nmornings. After almost a century of circulating these two editions, the \ncompany chose to merge the two papers in 2002 and offer just a morning \npaper that included not only great local news stories but also \nimportant national coverage.\n  The Frederick News-Post circulates over 11 million papers a year and \nemploys over 200 people. The company also includes FNP Printing & \nPublishing, a commercial printing venture as well as an Internet \ndivision called FNP Interactive. The Frederick News-Post is a vital \npart of the Frederick community, and I am so proud that this Maryland \nnewspaper has been successful for the past 125 years. I hope that it \ncontinues to bring the news to families around the State for 125 \nmore.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/12/09/senate-section/article/S10833-2", "month": "12", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10833]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/12/09/senate-section/article/S10833-3", "month": "12", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10833]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/12/09/senate-section/article/S10833-4", "month": "12", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10833-S10834]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                          ENROLLED BILL SIGNED\n\n  At 11:14 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby\n\n[[Page S10834]]\n\nMrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker has \nsigned the following enrolled bill:\n\n       H.R. 6859.

Res. 724\n\n       Whereas, on the evening of November 26, 2008, evidence \n     strongly suggests that 10 terrorists came ashore into the \n     city of Mumbai, India, from a hijacked fishing trawler in the \n     Arabian Sea, and conducted coordinated attacks on major \n     hotels, restaurants, hospitals, and transportation hubs, and \n     a religious center;\n       Whereas the attackers entered into a standoff with security \n     forces of the Government of India over the next 60 hours at a \n     number of sites, deliberately holding many hostages while \n     trapping other innocent victims with no means of escape;\n       Whereas authorities of the Government of India brought the \n     horrific three-day siege of Mumbai to a close on the morning \n     of November 29, 2008;\n       Whereas the final death toll from the siege exceeded 170 \n     victims, with hundreds more injured;\n       Whereas those murdered include citizens of India as well as \n     22 foreigners from 11 different countries, including the \n     following six United States citizens: Aryeh Leibish \n     Teitelbaum, Rabbi Gavriel Noah Holtzberg, Ben Zion Chroman, \n     Sandeep Jeswani, Alan Michael Scherr, and Naomi Leia Scherr.\n       Whereas the terrorists who attacked Mumbai attacked a \n     symbol of religious pluralism and outreach, a Jewish outreach \n     center at the Nariman House, murdering six residents of the \n     Nariman House, including Rabbi Holtzberg and his five-month \n     pregnant wife, Rivka, orphaning their two-year old son, \n     Moshe, who was heroically rescued by his Indian nanny, Sandra \n     Samuel;\n       Whereas nine of the attackers were found dead at various \n     sites where they were engaged in a standoff with authorities \n     of the Government of India, with only one surviving attacker \n     taken into custody;\n       Whereas evidence collected to date suggests the involvement \n     of an Islamic militant group, Lashkar-e-Taiba, that has ties \n     to al Qaeda and operates out of Pakistan;\n       Whereas India has endured a series of devastating terrorist \n     attacks in recent years, suffering 3,674 deaths from \n     terrorist attacks in a recent three-year period; and\n       Whereas India, the world's largest democracy, is a \n     strategic partner of the United States, and this bilateral \n     relationship is built on common values and unity against \n     extremism: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) affirms that the people of the United States stand in \n     unison with the people of India in the aftermath of these \n     horrific terrorist attacks;\n       (2) condemns strongly the atrocities perpetrated against \n     the people of Mumbai, conveys its deepest condolences to the \n     families and loved ones of those killed, and expresses its \n     wishes for the speedy recovery of the hundreds of people \n     injured in these senseless attacks;\n       (3) notes that these attacks did not only target citizens \n     of India, but represented a collective assault against the \n     international community, with 22 foreigners, including six \n     Americans, among those murdered;\n       (4) noting that President Bush has offered United States \n     Government assistance, encourages the Government of India to \n     conduct a comprehensive investigation into the attacks and \n     applauds the tone of moderation and restraint exhibited by \n     the Government of India to date in reaction to these horrific \n     attacks;\n       (5) urges the Government of Pakistan to investigate \n     aggressively the possible connection of groups based in \n     Pakistan, including the Lashkar-e-Taiba, to the Mumbai \n     attacks and take definitive action to apprehend and detain \n     suspects, and is thus encouraged by the raid on an apparent \n     militant camp on December 7, 2008, and the arrest of key \n     suspects;\n       (6) calls upon the Government of Pakistan to take all \n     necessary steps to root out all extremist groups operating on \n     its territory, halt attacks aimed at Pakistan and any other \n     countries, and ensure that no elements of the Government \n     support such groups;\n       (7) strongly encourages President-elect Obama to consider \n     ways in which the United States Government can bolster \n     counter-terrorism cooperation with the Government of India to \n     ensure that authorities in that country possess all the \n     requisite equipment and training needed to prevent and \n     respond to future terrorist attacks; and\n       (8) urges bolstered United States efforts to develop and \n     implement policies and projects to combat all forms of \n     religious extremism, including anti-Semitism, in order to \n     deter the type of targeted attacks like that waged against \n     the Chabad Lubavitch center in Mumbai.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/12/09/senate-section/article/S10834-5", "month": "12", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10834-S10835]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 725--ACKNOWLEDGING THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND GOALS OF \n                        THE YOUTH IMPACT PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. VITTER submitted the following resolution;

Res. 724\n\n       Whereas, on the evening of November 26, 2008, evidence \n     strongly suggests that 10 terrorists came ashore into the \n     city of Mumbai, India, from a hijacked fishing trawler in the \n     Arabian Sea, and conducted coordinated attacks on major \n     hotels, restaurants, hospitals, and transportation hubs, and \n     a religious center;\n       Whereas the attackers entered into a standoff with security \n     forces of the Government of India over the next 60 hours at a \n     number of sites, deliberately holding many hostages while \n     trapping other innocent victims with no means of escape;\n       Whereas authorities of the Government of India brought the \n     horrific three-day siege of Mumbai to a close on the morning \n     of November 29, 2008;\n       Whereas the final death toll from the siege exceeded 170 \n     victims, with hundreds more injured;\n       Whereas those murdered include citizens of India as well as \n     22 foreigners from 11 different countries, including the \n     following six United States citizens: Aryeh Leibish \n     Teitelbaum, Rabbi Gavriel Noah Holtzberg, Ben Zion Chroman, \n     Sandeep Jeswani, Alan Michael Scherr, and Naomi Leia Scherr.\n       Whereas the terrorists who attacked Mumbai attacked a \n     symbol of religious pluralism and outreach, a Jewish outreach \n     center at the Nariman House, murdering six residents of the \n     Nariman House, including Rabbi Holtzberg and his five-month \n     pregnant wife, Rivka, orphaning their two-year old son, \n     Moshe, who was heroically rescued by his Indian nanny, Sandra \n     Samuel;\n       Whereas nine of the attackers were found dead at various \n     sites where they were engaged in a standoff with authorities \n     of the Government of India, with only one surviving attacker \n     taken into custody;\n       Whereas evidence collected to date suggests the involvement \n     of an Islamic militant group, Lashkar-e-Taiba, that has ties \n     to al Qaeda and operates out of Pakistan;\n       Whereas India has endured a series of devastating terrorist \n     attacks in recent years, suffering 3,674 deaths from \n     terrorist attacks in a recent three-year period; and\n       Whereas India, the world's largest democracy, is a \n     strategic partner of the United\n\n[[Page S10837]]\n\n     States, and this bilateral relationship is built on common \n     values and unity against extremism: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) affirms that the people of the United States stand in \n     unison with the people of India in the aftermath of these \n     horrific terrorist attacks;\n       (2) condemns strongly the atrocities perpetrated against \n     the people of Mumbai, conveys its deepest condolences to the \n     families and loved ones of those killed, and expresses its \n     wishes for the speedy recovery of the hundreds of people \n     injured in these senseless attacks;\n       (3) notes that these attacks did not only target citizens \n     of India, but represented a collective assault against the \n     international community, with 22 foreigners, including six \n     Americans, among those murdered;\n       (4) noting that President Bush has offered United States \n     Government assistance, encourages the Government of India to \n     conduct a comprehensive investigation into the attacks and \n     applauds the tone of moderation and restraint exhibited by \n     the Government of India to date in reaction to these horrific \n     attacks;\n       (5) urges the Government of Pakistan to investigate \n     aggressively the possible connection of groups based in \n     Pakistan, including the Lashkar-e-Taiba, to the Mumbai \n     attacks and take definitive action to apprehend and detain \n     suspects, and is thus encouraged by the raid on an apparent \n     militant camp on December 7, 2008, and the arrest of key \n     suspects;\n       (6) calls upon the Government of Pakistan to take all \n     necessary steps to root out all extremist groups operating on \n     its territory, halt attacks aimed at Pakistan and any other \n     countries, and ensure that no elements of the Government \n     support such groups;\n       (7) strongly encourages President-elect Obama to consider \n     ways in which the United States Government can bolster \n     counter-terrorism cooperation with the Government of India to \n     ensure that authorities in that country possess all the \n     requisite equipment and training needed to prevent and \n     respond to future terrorist attacks; and\n       (8) urges bolstered United States efforts to develop and \n     implement policies and projects to combat all forms of \n     religious extremism, including anti-Semitism, in order to \n     deter the type of targeted attacks like that waged against \n     the Chabad Lubavitch center in Mumbai.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/12/09/senate-section/article/S10837-1", "month": "12", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10837]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nACKNOWLEDGING THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND GOALS OF THE YOUTH IMPACT PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. REID.
