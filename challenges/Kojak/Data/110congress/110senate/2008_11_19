Mr. President, we received some more bad news today. Today \nit was reported that China has surpassed Japan as the top holder of \nUnited States debt. One out of every 10 dollars of American debt now \nbelongs to the Chinese. As we fall further into debt, our climb back \nfrom recession to economic prosperity grows steeper. But in light of \nthese challenges, there is no reason for Congress to wait until January \nto do some things that will help the economy. We know that before the \nSenate is a comprehensive stimulus plan. I will be discussing ways of \nproceeding on that, or not proceeding on that, with my friend, the \nRepublican leader. Our legislation was worked out with the \nAppropriations, Finance, and Agriculture Committees. This legislation \nwould invest in infrastructure, extend unemployment insurance, provide \nfood stamps and fiscal relief for States to prevent States from being \nforced to cut services and raise taxes more than they already have, and \nit would be providing aid to the ailing United States auto industry.\n  It is important to understand that the authority to provide funds to \nthe auto industry lies with the Treasury Department. The Federal \nReserve can also provide these funds. As the Senate considers whether \nto pass an auto aid package, whether this legislation or other \nlegislation, we all need to remember that we are simply deciding \nwhether Congress will apply additional terms to the funds that the \nTreasury Department can and should ultimately provide. In fact, \nCongress need do nothing. Treasury can put whatever restrictions they \nchoose on that.\n  I hope we can pass legislation to aid the auto industry this next day \nor two. If we cannot do it here legislatively, I hope the Secretary of \nTreasury listens loudly and clearly, because they can take this into \ntheir own hands and do what they think is appropriate from their \nperspective.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/11/19/senate-section/article/S10607-8", "month": "11", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10607]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, the auto industry is an important part \nof the American economy, I certainly agree with my good friend the \nmajority leader, and an important job creator in my State. We are all \naware that one reason Congress is back in session this week is to \naddress the crisis in the\n\n[[Page S10608]]\n\nauto industry. Although our friends on the other side have been talking \nabout this issue with increasing frequency, they have yet to indicate \nhow they plan to move forward. There is clearly a deep controversy \nabout using funds designed to strengthen our credit markets to shore up \ndistressed companies and other industries. We all understand that. It \nis one of the main reasons why there is still a significant lack of \nsupport from both sides of the aisle to that particular kind of \napproach.\n  It is an understatement to say there is deep concern about the impact \nof more than $100 billion of new deficit spending in the bill that has \nbeen put forward. So let me suggest a bipartisan path forward that has \nnot yet been offered by the majority. It is a compromise being worked \non by Senators Voinovich and Bond which reproposes funds already \nappropriated, money we have already appropriated to fund a $25 billion \nloan program for auto makers to build advanced technology vehicles--\ncoupled with new taxpayer protections and Federal oversight about how \nthe money is spent. This is a proposal which I believe has support from \nboth sides of the aisle and that actually has the potential to pass \nright now, not next year. There is a way forward that will help protect \nthe jobs in the auto industry while also protecting the taxpayers. \nSenators Voinovich and Bond are working with colleagues across the \naisle to protect taxpayers and our long-term economic health. Should \nthis compromise approach be approved by the Congress, it is the only \nproposal now being considered that we believe President Bush will sign. \nIt could actually become law and become law in the very near future.\n  As we move forward, we must do so in a bipartisan way on this and the \nmyriad of other issues to come, and a good place to start would be \nright now.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/11/19/senate-section/article/S10608-1", "month": "11", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10608]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise to express my grave concerns about \nall of the auto industry bailout proposals. I do that for two \nfundamental reasons. First of all, I am very concerned of this ever-\nwidening bailout fever, bailout mania. We are now going well beyond the \nfinancial industry. We are crossing what was supposed to be a bright \nline and going to other sectors of major manufacturing, starting with \nthe auto companies, but I am convinced it certainly will not end there.\n  The second reason I am very concerned is for the sake and future of \nthe auto companies and those workers themselves, because I am convinced \nthat if we pass this type of bailout proposal, it will not save the \nauto companies, it will absolutely ensure their demise. That is because \nit is a bailout that is not coupled in any way with fundamental \nrestructuring and fundamental reform.\n  Let me go back to the original financial industry bailout proposal. \nOn September 29, I announced my strong opposition to that, based on \nmany reasons which I articulated here on the Senate floor. One of them \nwas that I thought it would invite many more bailouts to come. As I \nsaid, it was ``an unprecedented government bailout that will almost \ncertainly pave the way for even more, maybe sooner rather than later.''\n  Even as I spoke then on September 29, quite frankly I never would \nhave guessed that we would be at that point now, so soon, a few weeks \nlater. But we are. Again, what started as an idea about the banking \nindustry--don't let it fail; only about financial services industries--\nis now ever widening.\n  First of all, it has been widened within the TARP program itself, \nbecause while Treasury Secretary Paulson came to Congress, came to \nCapitol Hill with a very clear message of what that program was about--\nbuying bad assets, taking them off the books of financial companies--\neven within that program we have already moved on to plan B, which is \ninfusing money directly into banks. And now we are moving on to plan C, \ninfusing money into other sectors such as consumer credit cards, \nstudent loans, and other ventures. So even within that TARP bailout \nstructure we have expanded the bailouts and moved on from plan A, which \nwas the entire premise on which Congress passed the legislation, to \nplan B and to plan C.\n  Now we are about to cross a much brighter line and we are potentially \nexpanding this bailout fever much more by going well beyond the \nfinancial industry, by going well beyond the banking system, well \nbeyond the promise we simply need to stabilize the banking system, to \nnow saving companies because they are big, because they are, in a word, \ntoo big to allow to fail.\n  I think that is a fundamental mistake. But as I said, the other \nreason I think it is a fundamental mistake has to do with the \ncompanies' futures and the workers' futures themselves. I think this \nauto industry bailout proposal is a fundamental mistake because I \nbelieve it will not only not save those companies, but I believe it \nwill absolutely doom them to eventual failure--yes, a few months later \nrather than now, but will absolutely doom them to eventual failure.\n  Why do I say that? For a simple reason; because these proposals are \nnot coupled in any way with the fundamental restructuring that the \nAmerican auto companies need to become competitive and to survive.\n  A few weeks ago when we talked about the financial crisis, we were \nfocused on just that, a financial crisis within the banking industry, \nwithin financial institutions. That was about credit freezing up and \nimpacting the economy in an overall way. But of course auto companies' \nproblems and challenges predate that by years and years. Certainly the \nfinancial crisis made their immediate situation worse, made their \nimmediate straits more challenging, but their ultimate challenge and \ntheir ultimate troubles have nothing to do with this immediate \nfinancial crisis. They have to do with the legacy costs and very high \nlabor and other costs that those companies are burdened by, which makes \nthem fundamentally uncompetitive with their worldwide competitors \ntoday.\n  What am I talking about? That extra burden brought on by legacy costs \nand union obligations is estimated to be about $2,000 per car for the \nbig three auto manufacturers--$2,000 per car. What does that mean? What \nit means is Ford, for example, needs to cut $2,000 worth of features \nout of its Taurus to compete with, say, Toyota's Avalon. It is no \nsurprise that the Avalon feels like a better product. It is a better \nproduct. It has $2,000 more features, in terms of comparable sales \nprices, when it goes to the lot. Of course it is going to be a better \nproduct.\n  Another example is the U.S. auto companies and their unions admit \nthat union demands have driven up labor costs at the big three U.S. \nauto manufacturers to $30 per hour more than their foreign-owned \ncompetitors, including competitors such as Toyota that employ Americans \nand produce cars in America right here and now.\n  How can the big three possibly remain competitive in a worldwide \neconomy with that sort of disadvantage? And throw on top of that the \nfact that the CEO of GM managed to get a 64-percent pay raise recently \ndespite his company's shares dropping more than 90 percent over the \npast 52 weeks. That is not a recipe to stay or become competitive, that \nis a recipe for failure.\n  The reason the auto companies will be doomed to that failure if we \npass this bailout is because we are giving them plenty of taxpayer \ndollars without demanding the fundamental restructuring, the \nfundamental revisiting of those additional costs, these extraordinary \nlabor costs, those burdensome legacy costs that it will take to make \nthem competitive on a worldwide stage.\n  My argument is very simple: Let's not cross that bright line. Let's \nnot expand in a fundamental way bailout fever for the good of our free \nmarket\n\n[[Page S10609]]\n\nsystem. But also, for the good of the auto industry in the United \nStates, for the good of those workers, let's not doom them to failure. \nLet's demand, whatever we do, that they go into a period of fundamental \nrestructuring--the type of fundamental restructuring that is necessary, \nfor instance, in a bankruptcy. It does not have to be done in the \ncontext of an actual bankruptcy. Many people say that would kill auto \nsales; that it is not practical, they cannot survive that.\n  I do not particularly agree with that argument, but that same \nfundamental restructuring can be done in other ways without that \nbankruptcy title looming over the companies' heads. That is what they \nneed to survive. That is what those workers need to keep their jobs. \nLet's not pass this auto industry bailout and deny them the possibility \nof a survivable and brighter future.\n  These remarks apply equally to not only the Democratic leader's \nproposal, under which the $25 billion would come directly out of the \nTARP program, but my remarks and my concerns are fundamental. They \napply equally to President Bush's proposal, which is essentially the \nsame, simply taking the money out of a different pot, simply using the \n$25 billion of low-interest loans we have already authorized, against \nmy objections, to do the same thing.\n  Again, my concerns are not superficial--use this pot of money and not \nthat pot--my concerns are much more fundamental. They go to the center \nof the future of our economy. But they also go to the core of what is \nneeded for the U.S. auto industry to remain competitive, to become more \ncompetitive, and to save those American jobs.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, that was quite a letter. I must say, to \nbe here for this historic moment, my heart is racing. We heard the \nletter from the President-elect resigning from the Senate. This is, \nindeed, a moment of passage in the Senate and for the country. By \nSenator Obama's resignation from the duty and responsibility the people \nof Illinois gave him, it is one more step for him to pick up the \nresponsibilities of the Presidency of the United States. I will cherish \nthis moment because it will be a historic moment, from ``We need \nchange'' and ``Yes, we can'' on the long campaign trail to election \nnight, to a charismatic speech calling us to act like an American \ncommunity, not only a country of which we are proud, a nation we hold \ndear, but an American community. That is the Obama message which I hope \nwill be the Obama effect. As our President-elect lays down these duties \nand takes up others, we need to realize and respond to his call and a \nnew American mandate. Because on November 4, we who hold Federal office \nreceived a new American mandate to change the tone, to change the \ndirection, to change the priorities, and to be able to move on and get \nour economy rolling and bring our troops back home and restore our \nnational honor in the world.\n  Sign me up. Sign me up as an enthusiastic member of this effort. I \naccept that mandate. I accept it. I call upon all my colleagues to do \nthe same, to embrace the message Senator Obama has set, not only in \nterms of a dynamic, robust agenda but how we will work with each other. \nI thought it was grand that he sat down with our colleague from \nArizona, Senator McCain, to talk about how they could work together, \nhow they could find that common ground, how we could find that sensible \ncenter between what we want to do and what we can afford to do. That is \nthe tone Obama set with McCain. Let's set it now with Reid and \nMcConnell. Let's try to find common ground, that sensible center, \npragmatic, affordable solutions we can do now. We have a window. We \nhave a time. As President-elect Obama said: This is our time. Our time \ndoesn't begin January 20. Our time doesn't begin January 6. This is our \ntime now to lay the groundwork for the transition of power, to work \ntogether. I ask us now, as we look at the stimulus package, as we look \nat solutions for our manufacturing area, how to extend the safety net \nfor those people who are already hurting: Let's do that.\n  Right now, once again, back to business as usual, entangled in a \nparliamentary quagmire, digging in our heels, based on rigid ideology. \nThat is not what the people said on November 4. They said they wanted \nchange, and they want it now. Let it begin with us, civilized debate, \nthe clash of ideas to find that sensible center. By the way, that \nphrase is not mine. That phrase is Colin Powell's, a great American.\n  There it is, right there is the center. I am ready to walk over to \nit. Come on over, I say to the other side.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/11/19/senate-section/article/S10609-4", "month": "11", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10609-S10610]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            STIMULUS PACKAGE\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, today I am standing here asking for help \non the stimulus package. I know that part of the stimulus package is to \nextend unemployment insurance. I absolutely support that. But what I \nalso wish to do is not only extend unemployment insurance for those who \nare hurting, I am with the parts of the stimulus package that will \nextend employment, where we will do what we need to do to create the \nsafety net, but we need to have a launching pad to keep jobs in this \ncountry. I wish to vote to extend unemployment help, but I wish to also \nvote to extend employment help. Hello. Let's find that sensible center.\n  I am for saving and creating jobs, and I am also saying: Congress \nmust act now. In the next 48 to 72 hours, we have our own rendezvous. \nIf we do not act, we will create an economic framework that means the \nrecession will be longer and deeper. The cost of doing nothing is more \nthan we can afford to pay.\n  I support the safety net in the economic recovery package--help with \nunemployment, energy assistance, help on Medicaid for the children and \nthe elderly. Medicaid is a children's and elderly program, for children \nwho need health care and elderly who need to be in nursing homes.\n  I also support the part of the stimulus that creates jobs. I salute \nour leadership team for coming up with the framework to create jobs by \nmaking important investments in physical infrastructure--desperately \nneeded. We need to make public investments that generate private sector \njobs. Note what Senator Barb is saying: I am not for make work. I am \nnot for a WPA. I am for public investments that create private sector \njobs. By doing it in building and rebuilding America's infrastructure, \nwe will be safer, and we will have a stronger economy--repairing \nbridges, building highways, mass transit that we need to move people \nand improve the environment, also to build water and sewer treatment \nplants to fix aging sewer systems. In my hometown of Baltimore, our \nmayor is under an EPA court order to rebuild the Baltimore sewer \nsystem. I am for that. My great-grandfather, who came to this country\n\n[[Page S10610]]\n\nsearching for the American dream, believing what Lady Liberty said when \nshe said: Give me your tired, your poor, yearning to be free, another \nmember of my family said: Sign me up. And he was a ditch digger on the \nBaltimore sewer system. My great-grandmother married him because he was \na man of prospects. We rebuilt Baltimore then. I wish to rebuild \nBaltimore today and put people to work, from designing and engineering, \nmoving heavy lifting equipment.\n  The Chesapeake Bay is polluted because we don't have enough water in \nsewer treatment plants. That is one of the reasons. So we can build \nthat by making public investments in physical infrastructure. By \nsending a dollar of taxpayer money today, we will have jobs today and \neconomic recovery on the way.\n  Also, I wished to talk about helping the automobile industry. My \nother colleagues will speak on the floor about the need for the $25 \nbillion plan. My colleagues will also speak about other things to help \nDetroit for which I am supportive. But I also have another idea. See, \nthe way I think, I am old-fashioned. My dad ran a grocery store. While \nothers talk about the big macro picture, I learned economics at the \nmacaroni-and-cheese level in my dad's grocery store. It was about \nsupply and demand. I am saying if we stimulate demand, which actually \ngets people to buy cars, people will have to make them. They will have \nto sell them. They will have to service them. They will have to provide \nthe insurance and other services to do it.\n  Let me tell you how I wish to save jobs in the automobile industry \nand at the same time help our consumers and get our economy back on \ntrack. It is simple. It is straightforward. It is bipartisan. I am \njoined in my framework, which I introduced as a freestanding bill, by \nSenator Kit Bond of Missouri. More cosponsors are pouring in. My \nprovision simply says this: If you buy a new passenger car or light \ntruck between November 12 of this year and December 31 of next year, \nyou will get a tax deduction on your sales tax and on the interest of \nyour loan. Let me repeat that. It is a tax deduction for the sales tax \non buying that car or light truck. You will also be able to deduct the \ninterest on your loan. For many people, depending on the size of the \nvehicle, it can go anywhere from $2,000 to $5,000. It saves jobs. \nRemember where I started. Not only extend unemployment benefits to \nthose who have lost their jobs but extend employment so people don't \nlose their jobs.\n  One out of every ten jobs in America depends on the automobile \nindustry.\n  What is it I mean? First of all, in manufacturing--and we know what \nit feels like in Maryland. See this chart. On Broening Highway we made \nminivans for years. Now it is being cleared for who knows what. We know \nit has new uses but not like this. There were 1,000 jobs that paid good \nwages and good salaries. I do not want ``closed'' signs up all over \nAmerica. So it is jobs in manufacturing.\n  Then there are jobs in car dealerships. Did you know there are 30,000 \ncar dealerships in America, and each one employs about 50 or 60 \npeople--from the people who sell the cars, service the cars, supply the \nparts, and the back office workers handling the bookkeeping and the \naccounting.\n  In my own home State there are 300 dealers. If you look at the \ndealers nationwide, we are talking about 150,000 people. In my own \nState, it is over 25,000 people. In many of my rural communities, \noutside the hospital and local government, they are the major employer. \nDealers are at risk. The people who work at the dealerships are at \nrisk. We can change that.\n  Now, let me go to the rationale. Why now? Why the urgency? Well, \nfirst of all, car purchases, whether you are talking about a Toyota or \na Taurus, whether you are talking about cars made in Detroit or made in \nKentucky, Alabama or Tennessee or Texas, buying cars, with people going \ninto the showrooms, is down by 25 percent.\n  But what we also know from the auto research is that people buy more \ncars during the period of Thanksgiving to New Year's Eve than any other \n6-week period. If you pass the Mikulski-Bond amendment, and it is \nsigned into law, and people come into the showroom, that is the time \nthey want to buy cars, and this is the time we could give them the \nFederal incentive, along with the dealer and manufacturing incentives. \nIt could mean tremendous help.\n  Now, there are those who will say: Gee, how much does this cost, \nSenator Mikulski? It does cost $8 billion. However, the cost of doing \nnothing is phenomenal. The cost to the Government is about $50 billion \na year if we do nothing, if our automobile system goes down. If we face \nthe ``Armageddon'' of one of them going bankrupt, our pension guaranty \nsystem would be in great difficulty. We would lose taxes in \nunemployment benefits. In other words, there is a cost to doing nothing \nthat is 10 to 20 times greater than what we are talking about here.\n  I know my time is about up.\n  I say: Pass this stimulus package. Thanks to the leader, my auto \nprovision is part of it. We need to talk about saving 3 million jobs in \nthe automobile industry. We need to talk about how to help the American \npeople.\n  I conclude by saying, during the break I went around and talked to my \nconstituents. First of all, they are mad as the dickens over the way \nthis bailout package has been handled. They feel we gave it to the \nsharks and the whales on Wall Street, and the little guys--the \nminnows--got no help. What they are worried about is the losing of \ntheir jobs. In many instances, they have already lost their life \nsavings, they have lost their homes or they are already in jeopardy.\n  Let's talk about a car dealer. I walked in to talk to a dealer in \nMontgomery County. The first thing was I noticed two things: an empty \nshowroom and on his lapel he had a Rotary pin. This is a man for which \nthat business, in Montgomery County, was started in 1939, during the \nDepression, because they believed in Roosevelt and they believed in the \nAmerican economy. Can they believe in us?\n  That man, with his Rotary pin and family, has provided jobs. They fix \ncars. They have sold cars and so on. They kept it going and at the same \ntime contributed to the charities in their community, being a good \ncorporate citizen.\n  You talk to the people who work there. Let's talk to the guy I talked \nto who has worked there for 23 years. He said: Senator Barb, all I have \never wanted to do is fix cars. I love fixing cars, and I have fixed \nChevys and now Accords and Acuras, and I have done a great job. I have \nbeen happy, and I have made a lot of people happy. But I have two kids \nin college. I was told that for the kind of job I have, there is a \nworkforce shortage. But now there is more of a shortage of work than a \nshortage of workers.\n  This is whom we are fighting for. We are fighting for our friends. We \nare fighting for our neighbors. We are fighting for the people who have \nkept our communities going. So we come back to wonder: How are we going \nto spend money? We have already spent $350 billion that went to banks \nthat do not care. They have no remorse. They have no sense of \ngratitude, and they did not regard us as an investor. Mr. President, \n$350 billion to banks and Paulson is walking around like a passive \ninvestor. But here, if we make this investment to enable the consumer \nto be in a new car, which will get more fuel efficiency, lower carbon \nemissions, and pick up our economy, I think we are doing something.\n  I hope today we get a chance to vote on the economic recovery bill. \nIt has major components in it, and one of the major component is it \nextends employment, which is what Americans want.\n  On the day Barack Obama resigned from the Senate, let us now resign \nourselves to follow what the mandate was on November 4. They not only \ngave President-elect Obama a mandate; they gave us a mandate: Get \nAmerica rolling again. The Mikulski legislation puts our economy back \non wheels.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alabama.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/11/19/senate-section/article/S10610-1", "month": "11", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10610-S10613]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           WASTEFUL SPENDING\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank the Chair for the opportunity to \nspeak. I appreciate the eloquent remarks of my colleague, Senator \nMikulski. She is a passionate advocate for Middle America, and it is a \npleasure to serve with her in the Senate.\n  I have to say, it is a historic day that Senator Obama has resigned \nand will be on the road now to inauguration as\n\n[[Page S10611]]\n\nthe President of the United States. People are happy about it. For so \nmany people, you can feel their excitement about the possibilities. The \ncountry wanted change, and we have some change out there. I think we \nneed to ask ourselves pretty clearly what kind of change it is they \nwere demanding of Congress. We may well have some disagreements about \nthat.\n  The day after the election, I was doing a little exercise at the park \nback home in Alabama, and I met an African-American with an Army hat \non. He and his friends were talking happily, and there was an \nexcitement about this election. He said: You know, this is the first \ntime I know my sacrifice in Vietnam meant something. He was sincere \nabout that. There is a good feeling out there.\n  I would say that one of the things the American people did not vote \nfor, however, was wasteful Washington spending. It is just not so. One \nof the things they rejected in the Bush administration was reckless \nspending, unprincipled spending. That is something that has worried \nthem. So in interpreting the results of the election, I think we need \nto take care.\n  I noticed a recent Rasmussen Poll showed that 80 percent of Americans \nthink the Government is too involved in the economy, that the \nGovernment is getting its nose too much in this and taking their money \nthey sent here and spending it on somebody the Government wants to \nfavor with Federal largess. I do not think that is what the election \nmeant: that we ought to spend more.\n\n  Also, on the question of the bailout, less than one-third of the \nAmerican people in the Rasmussen Poll said they favored an automobile \ncompany bailout. This is contrary to our fundamental principles. We may \nhave to, at certain times, do things that are a violation of principle. \nWe ought to be very cautious about doing so. These are things that have \nserved this country well for over 200 years. We need to be careful \nabout it.\n  So I do not think the change people voted for was to authorize \nCongress to go on a wild spending spree, throwing money at every \nproblem. We have already had, this year, a $150 billion stimulus that \nwas supposed to ward off the recession--sending out checks to \neverybody, and this was going to fix it.\n  I hated to vote against that, but I could not vote for that $150 \nbillion, every penny of which went to the debt. We were already in \ndeficit, so we added another $150 billion to the deficit in one fell \nswoop. What did we tell people to do? We told them to go out and spend. \nI know the Acting President pro tempore is from Nebraska. I know he was \nraised right. We have had a talk about families and how families work. \nWhen you have a financial problem, you do not tell your children to go \nout and see how much they can spend. You ask them to get smart about \nwhat they have been doing.\n  When the economy goes into a recessionary period, people start \nwatching their spending. They decide they do not eat out as much. They \ndecide they cannot buy as fancy clothes. They decide they cannot afford \na big, expensive house that has also been going up in price, and maybe \nit is not going up now, so they wisely decide to stay renting or stay \nin the house they have, which depresses the price of housing. This is \nthe business cycle, I will just say.\n  I feel like we work our way through that. As people get their debt \npaid down, they start buying more. In the meantime, certain companies \nget hurt. Companies that are selling big gas-guzzling vehicles and are \ncommitted to that product are going to be one of the groups that gets \nhit the hardest. I wish it were not so. I know this is not a matter of \ninsignificance that domestic automobile companies are in financial \ntrouble. But they have been promoting a product the American people do \nnot want right now and they are committed to that product and it is \ntroubling as to how we work our way out of it. But I think rewarding \nmisbehavior is not the way to do it.\n  So it is pretty clear now that we are in a recession and that credit \nhad been too cheap in the years leading up to this. We had a bubble in \nhousing. People thought prices would never go down, and they bought \nhouses larger than they could afford, made payments that stressed them \nto the very limit to afford those big houses, pretty much on the theory \nthat the housing prices were going to continue to go up and would never \ngo down. Those of us who have been around a while should have known \nthat is not a good way to go. We have known, and we have seen it in our \nvery neighborhoods, the young couple buying huge automobiles, borrowing \nmoney to do so--$40,000, $50,000, $60,000--that they could not afford. \nIt also guzzled fuel, cost them more at the pump, and each month they \nran up debts on their credit card, including gasoline. When you get to \nthe maximum limit, you have to cut back.\n  So what do you do? You do not buy as many of these things, you do not \nadd as much, you do not buy the big cars, some people cannot afford to \nhold on to their big houses, and you go through a recessionary period. \nIt is not a matter we ought to treat lightly. I certainly recognize \nthat.\n  But as USA Today said a month or so ago, an economy founded on \nexcessive personal debt, excessive Government debt, and huge trade \ndeficits, is not sound. That is just it. We have to change our ways. We \ncannot buy our way out of this situation. There is no free lunch. For \nanything that somebody puts in front of you to eat, somebody has had to \npay for it to get it there. Debts have to be repaid. We have to be \nhonest about it. We cannot continue to throw money at this problem. We \nare going to have to take our lumps now and come out of it stronger \nrather than trying to postpone the problem, kicking the can down the \nroad in some desperate attempt at stimulus to avoid any pain in a \nnormal recessionary cycle.\n\n  So I worry about it. Let me tell my colleagues about the deficit. The \ndeficit surged after 9/11. We had increased spending at airports and we \ndid all kinds of things and the deficit went up to almost $420 \nbillion--one of the biggest deficits in dollar terms we have ever had, \nnot as a percentage of GDP, but a huge deficit and a reversal of the \nsituation prior to that. That deficit has gone down. A year ago \nSeptember 30, our deficit for the year was $161 billion; still large, \ntoo large, but going in the right direction. As of September 30 of this \nyear, after we popped $150 billion earlier this year directly into the \ndeficit to fund the stimulus that was supposed to avoid a recession, \nnow the deficit this year was $455 billion. And the one we are in \ntoday, I saw an article recently that said the deficit will clearly be \nin excess of $750 billion, the largest deficit in the history of our \ncountry and, probably, as a percentage of GDP, one of the largest we \nhave ever had. Now we are talking about more spending, more spending, \nmore, more, more; we have to bail out this industry, that industry, the \nother industry.\n  Alabama was heavily reliant on textiles. Now, seventy percent of our \ntextile industry is gone. You can go to town after town where sewing \nplants existed--no longer there. Should the Federal Government have \nstopped that? The little community in which I grew up, the original \ncommunity was on the river where steamboats plied the river. After \nrailroads came, the community sort of moved a few miles over to the \nrailroad. That is where I grew up, in a little railroad community. Then \nthe passenger trains stopped, and the freight trains stopped and people \nhad interstates and other ways to communicate and travel and airplanes \ncame along. Should we have passed--we had a railroad depot there, and \nmy friend's dad ran it. Well, it is closed. Should we have passed a law \nto keep the railroads just as they always were and all the depots out \nthere? Years ago you remember the debate over whether the union should \nrequire a fireman, who used to shovel coal into the steam engines, to \nsit on a diesel train. That was part of the union contract. For decades \nafter we ended steam engines, the union contracts required a person \nnamed a fireman to sit on a diesel train with the engineer. This is not \nsound.\n  Change is inevitable. We have to adjust to it. That is what we need \nto do. Maybe there are ways we can help the automobile industry--I \nassume there are, and I would be prepared to discuss that--but we have \nto be realistic and honest. When we start throwing money at private \ncorporations to save them from the forces that are at work in our \neconomy, we are taking on a big challenge.\n\n[[Page S10612]]\n\n  This is a metaphor I have in my mind. Do my colleagues remember the \nstory of the folks who flew airplanes over the hurricanes and threw out \ndry ice and they believed if they could just throw out enough dry ice, \nthey could stop the hurricane? Well, we can't throw money into this \nfinancial hurricane and stop it either. We have to hunker down and do \nwhat we have always done to work through difficult financial \ncircumstances. We can be sophisticated and come up with some good ideas \nthat can help--and I am certainly for that--but I would tell my \ncolleagues as a matter of principle we need to be very cautious about \npicking and choosing who we are going to reward with Federal taxpayer \nmoney.\n  In a meeting yesterday, Secretary Paulson was quite correct. He said: \nLook, any time you take Federal money and insert it into the \nmarketplace--and he was talking about the automobile industry and the \nbanking industry at the time--you distort the market. You help some \ncompanies and industries and you hurt others. I would just add, you do \nso with taxpayer money, you are taking sides in the process. That is \ndangerous, and we need to be as careful about it as we possibly can. So \nI would just raise those points.\n  Do my colleagues know our savings rate in America fell below zero at \nthe height of this boom, at the height of this housing bubble, this \nautomobile bubble? Gasoline prices were through the roof, commodity \nprices through the roof, farm prices surging, gold and other metals \ngoing up at incredible rates. They are all falling now, but during that \ntime we didn't have any savings. Our savings rates fell below zero. Now \nthat we are going into a recessionary period--and we are in a \nrecession--people are saving. The savings rate I saw recently was about \n3 percent. So people are not consuming as much. Is that all bad?\n  When people don't consume as much and don't travel as much, the \nhotels are not as full, the restaurants are not as full, the automobile \ncompanies can't sell as many automobiles, and they are going through \ntough times. But when you have an excessive boom, this is the kind of \nthing that is bound to happen.\n  One observer of the scene made this comment in 2006 about the housing \nmarket. He said:\n\n       Housing prices cannot continue to increase at twice the \n     rate of the growth of GDP, and they cannot continue to \n     increase at this rate when wages are basically flat.\n\n  Now, doesn't that make sense? Didn't we know people who couldn't \nafford a house because the prices were outrageous? There are some \nbenefits from the collapse and the boom on housing prices. An average \nperson now may be able to buy a house at a more reasonable price than \nthey were before. So these are the cycles we go through.\n  The timber industry in my State depends on home building. When \nconstruction is down, our saw mills are shutting down in small towns, \nand that is the only business they have. Are we going to bail out the \nsaw mills today? Is anybody proposing that? Then, the people who work \nin the woods to harvest the timber--good, honest, hard-working \nAmericans--if the saw mills can't buy the lumber--are they getting an \nhourly wage? Are they being laid off? Yes, they are, as part of this \ntough cycle that we are going through.\n  I wish to ask this fundamental question: Who is going to bail out the \nAmerican Government? Who is going to bail out the American taxpayers \nfor the expenditures that we are increasing? I ask this: Isn't it true \nthere are three basic ways to deal with money we are borrowing today, \nperhaps $1 trillion this fiscal year? When I say $750 billion to $1 \ntrillion, I am not counting the $700 billion bailout. That has not been \nscored yet. I am talking about other spending, including some of these \nbailout proposals.\n  So there are three ways we could do it. We could cut spending. Our \nDemocratic colleagues were pretty hard on Republicans for, they said, \nspending too much, and they were right more than I would like to admit. \nI would just say this: Are we getting any better now? The talk we are \nhearing today, is it spend more, more, more, more, or is it a \ndiscussion about a contained spending? No. What we are hearing from the \nchange group, I am afraid, is spend more.\n  Well, that is one way to pay off your debts. Another way would be to \nraise taxes. None of us want to see taxes raised, for heaven's sake, \nespecially not in a time of economic slowdown, so taxes is not a likely \nway to pay off the debt.\n  What has happened throughout history? Fundamentally, the way debts \nare paid off is by debasing the currency.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cardin). The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Is that 10 minutes, I believe?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would ask unanimous consent for 5 \nadditional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Hearing no objection, the \nSenator is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. So I am afraid of inflating the currency, reducing the \nvalue of currency so that when the government has to pay back debts, it \npays back in dollars less valuable than the ones it borrowed, and we \nbasically cheat the people who loaned money. When that happens, they \nare going to demand a higher rate of interest on the trillions of \ndollars of debt we have today.\n  Let me briefly share with my colleagues some thoughts about the \nbailout and why I cannot support the plan that is being proposed and \noffered by Senator Reid, the Democratic leader. I commend to my \ncolleagues the article by Michael E. Levine entitled, ``Why Bankruptcy \nIs The Best Option For GM.'' He is a former airline executive and is a \ndistinguished research scholar and senior lecturer at NYU School of \nLaw. He just points out this fact--and as a lawyer, I think he is \nabsolutely correct. Regarding contracts and ways that would really \nreform and streamline and make these companies competitive, he said \nthis:\n\n       Contracts would have to be bought out. The company would \n     have to shed many of its fixed obligations. Some obligations \n     will be impossible to cut by voluntary agreement.\n\n  Why would somebody agree to have you not pay them what you have been \npaying?\n  Then he said: ``GM will run out of cash and out of time.'' That is \neven if we give them $25 billion. They cannot fix themselves until they \nconfront their costs that are pulling them down.\n  Mitt Romney, whose father was a CEO at American Motors, in his recent \nop-ed estimates that the average American automobile is carrying a \n$2,000-per-car excess cost. If you wonder why foreign automobiles are \nbetter, it is because they can put 2,000 more dollars in it. So how do \nyou get out of that? You have to get out of these contracts.\n\n       Mr. Levine fundamentally points out that through the \n     process of reorganization--not chapter VII liquidation but \n     the process that Delta Airlines used to reorganize itself--is \n     the one way you can get out of these contracts and \n     restructure the company, reduce some of its burdens, and come \n     back again as a fighting, competitive company, producing \n     automobiles that people will buy in large numbers. I think \n     that is very possible.\n\n  So in bankruptcy, those kinds of things can occur that can occur \noutside. Mitt Romney, in his editorial, said:\n\n       A managed bankruptcy may be the only path to the \n     fundamental restructuring the industry needs. It would permit \n     the company to shed excess labor, pension, and real estate \n     costs. The Federal Government should provide guarantees for \n     post-bankruptcy financing and assure car buyers that their \n     warranties are not at risk.\n\n  Now, those are the kinds of suggestions that come close to making \nsense to me.\n  He talked about his father, George Romney, the Governor of Michigan, \nwho also ran for President at one point. This is what he said his \nfather did when he saved American Motors at the time:\n\n       My dad cut his pay and that of his executive team, he \n     bought stock at his company--\n\n  To show faith in it--\n\n     and he went out to the factories to talk to workers directly. \n     Get rid of the planes, the executive dining rooms--all the \n     symbols that breed resentment among the hundreds of thousands \n     who will also be sacrificing to keep the companies afloat.\n\n  I think that is the right way to do it. I think we can do that. I \nreally would urge my colleagues to look for ways for this to happen.\n  Now, you cannot trust the automobile dealers when they come forward \nand say: Well, we are doing all of these things.\n\n[[Page S10613]]\n\n  They don't have the power to do these things. I know they don't want \nto go into reorganization and bankruptcy as Delta Airlines did. But it \nis not going to be a horrible thing. Delta went in and emerged about a \nyear and a half later. They reorganized, reduced expenses, altered and \namended contracts and obligations, and they recently bought Northwest. \nThey went bankrupt in 2005, and they came out leaner and more \ncompetitive and are now a viable company. But these CEOs--if you give \nthem money, they are going to have less leverage with the unions, less \nleverage with their 7,000 automobile dealers, when Toyota has 1,500 \nautomobile dealers. They are going to have less leverage with the lease \nagreements and health care agreements they entered into years ago, in a \ndifferent situation, to deal with people's health care requests and \ndemands at that time. They are stuck with that until they can break \nloose from it.\n  A bankruptcy judge whose motive would be to help them become leaner \nand more effective and sends them out as a viable entity so that jobs \nare saved and debts are fundamentally repaid--that would be the goal of \nreorganization and bankruptcy.

RANDY PAUSCH\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the life of Dr. Randy \nPausch, who died this past July 25 from pancreatic cancer. Dr. Pausch \nwas a rare hero who rose above his illness and fought to the end for \nincreased public awareness of this devastating illness. In doing so, \nDr. Pausch captured the attention of the country, inspiring people with \nhis extraordinary grace, courage, and love of life.\n  Dr. Pausch was a professor at Carnegie Mellon University in \nPittsburgh, in my home State of Pennsylvania. He was an accomplished \nresearcher and dedicated teacher.\n  Many people know what Randy did because of his famous ``Last \nLecture,'' which he delivered at Carnegie Mellon in September of last \nyear. The video of the lecture became an inspirational phenomenon on \nthe Internet. Literally millions of Americans wrote and blogged about \nthe transformational impact Dr. Pausch's lecture had upon them and \ntheir lives. Recently, ``The Last Lecture'' was turned into a best-\nselling book.\n  The lessons from Dr. Pausch that have inspired so many people are \nsimple, but ones we all too easily can forget. He reminds us about \nachieving childhood dreams and maintaining a sense of childhood wonder. \nHe also encourages his listeners to work hard, tell the truth, be \nearnest, help others, apologize for mistakes, listen to advice, and \nnever, ever give up. He helps us remember how important it is to simply \nenjoy life and that each day is a gift.\n  As his disease progressed, Dr. Pausch was also an impassioned \nadvocate for pancreatic cancer research. He testified before the House \nAppropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, and \nEducation, saying:\n\n       We don't have advocates for this disease because they don't \n     live long enough. We don't have a Michael J. Fox because \n     people die too fast. Pancreatic cancer is absolutely \n     ruthless. Part of my job is to put a face on the disease.\n\n  So said Dr. Pausch so poignantly about this disease, because indeed \npancreatic cancer is ruthless. It is the fourth leading cause of cancer \ndeath in the United States of America. Seventy-five percent of \npancreatic cancer patients die within 1 year of diagnosis. The 5-year \nsurvival rate is barely 5 percent. The survival rate for pancreatic \ncancer today is the same as it was 30 years ago.\n  Randy was only 45 when he died of pancreatic cancer on July 25 of \nthis year. He left behind his wife Jai and their three children, Dylan, \nLogan, and Chloe.\n  Dr. Randy Pausch lived life to the fullest in every sense of that \nword, in every sense of that phrase. He was a loving husband and \nfather, a dedicated educator, and an impassioned advocate. While his \nlife was cut short by pancreatic cancer, his legacy for living is one \nwe should all cherish. I ask my Senate colleagues to join me in \ncommemorating the life of Dr. Pausch with the resolution that I and \nothers have introduced. This resolution calls upon communities across \nthis country to recognize November as National Pancreatic Cancer \nAwareness Month, and urges greater public awareness and resources for \nprevention, early detection, and treatment of this disease.\n  Let us, with this resolution, recognize the extraordinary gift that \nDr. Pausch's life was to humanity and strive to make progress with this \ndeadly, ruthless disease.\n  I commend Senator Clinton for her leadership on this issue and for \nintroducing this resolution. I am joined as a cosponsor by my colleague \nfrom Pennsylvania, Senator Specter. For their help, we are greatly \nappreciative.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/11/19/senate-section/article/S10613-2", "month": "11", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10613-S10615]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO RETIRING SENATORS\n\n\n                             Pete Domenici\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, as the 110th Congress draws to a close, I \nrise to say thanks and farewell to one of our hardest working and most \ndedicated Members, Senator Pete Domenici of New Mexico.\n  Pete Domenici's story is truly the American dream come to life. The \nson of immigrants, Pete worked in the family grocery business, earned a \ncollege degree, taught school, obtained a law degree, and served in \nlocal government before his election to the Senate.\n  I cannot overlook one vitally important part of his biography, and \nthat is his stint as a pitcher for a farm team of the old Brooklyn \nDodgers. Who knows how much different history would be if his fast ball \nhad had a little more ``pop'' to it?\n  For 36 years, however, baseball's loss has been the Senate's gain. \nThe character developed by athletic competition--determination, hard \nwork, a sense of fair play--is fully evident in Pete's six terms in \noffice.\n  When the people of New Mexico chose Pete Domenici to be the longest \nserving Senator in their State's history, they chose wisely. His \ntireless work on a wide range of issues has helped to ensure a better \nfuture for all Americans, rural or urban, large State or small. He is a \nrespected leader on some of the most important challenges of our time, \nsuch as strengthening energy security, curbing nuclear proliferation, \nand promoting sound Federal budget policy.\n  Pete's understanding of the budget process is matched only by his \nappreciation of the critical role fiscal responsibility plays. His \nservice on the Budget Committee established his universal reputation as \none of the Senate's hardest working, most intelligent, and best-\ninformed Members. His focus on results rather than the limelight led \none colleague to describe him as having ``a terminal case of \nresponsibility.''\n  Senator Domenici is also a true champion for biomedical research, and \nespecially for Americans suffering from mental illness. He has worked \nunceasingly over the years to increase the understanding and to \neliminate the stigma associated with mental illness. He has led the \neffort in the Senate--first in partnership with Senator Paul Wellstone, \nand later with our colleague Senator Ted Kennedy, to pass legislation \nthat requires insurers to cover mental illness in the same way they \ncover physical illnesses.\n  Thankfully, those efforts have finally borne fruit with the inclusion \nof his legislation in the economic stimulus bill, the stabilization \nbill passed in the Senate. It is a victory not just for Senator \nDomenici's longstanding efforts but also for the estimated 50 million \nAmericans who suffer from some kind of mental illness. It is a \ntestament to his dedication and his compassion.\n  Senator Domenici's tenure has been marked by vision, common sense, \nand a\n\n[[Page S10614]]\n\ncommitment to results. When he became chairman of the Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee in 2003, Senator Domenici set to work to \ncraft the first major comprehensive energy bill in more than a decade. \nMany thought it would be impossible to put together the bipartisan \nsupport to pass the Energy Policy Act of 2005, but Senator Domenici did \nit. That landmark law laid the foundation for American energy \nindependence, the responsible use of existing resources, and the \ndevelopment of new technology. We can build on that foundation by \nfollowing the model he set of informed debate and thoughtful consensus.\n  While most of his many accomplishments have national significance, \nthere is one that may not be well known outside of his home State. More \nthan a decade ago, Pete Domenici introduced a program that has helped \nthe schoolchildren of New Mexico learn trustworthiness, respect, \nresponsibility, fairness, caring, and citizenship. This program is \ncalled ``Character Counts.'' It fully epitomizes what Pete Domenici is \nall about. It fully describes his legacy because, with Pete Domenici, \ncharacter has always counted.\n  Senator Domenici leaves this Chamber with an overflowing and \nbipartisan store of good will and gratitude. We are all losing an \noutstanding colleague. On a personal note, I am also losing an \noutstanding Washington DC neighbor, since Pete and his wonderful wife, \nNancy, live right down the street from me. I am pleased to be among the \nmany Senators offering thanks for his years of service and best wishes \nto him and to Nancy.\n\n\n                              Gordon Smith\n\n  Mr. President, for nearly 70 years, the film ``Mr. Smith Goes to \nWashington'' has inspired Americans and people around the world with \nits uplifting story of how one man of conviction and character can make \na difference. Today, I am honored to offer a few words to the Mr. Smith \nof our time: Senator Gordon Smith of Oregon.\n  Senator Smith came to Washington to make a difference--and he has. He \nand I were sworn into the United States Senate on the same day, January \n7, 1997. Although his State and mine are a continent apart, we quickly \nfound that we had a lot in common.\n  It has been a joy to work with Gordon Smith on so many important \nissues. Of course, where I come from, the name ``Senator Smith'' \nconjures up not just the beloved movie but also a towering, real-life \nfigure, and my inspiration in public service. Although Margaret Chase \nSmith of Maine and Gordon Smith are separated by time, they are united \nin a spirit of independence and integrity. Both served with strong \nconvictions but with respect for the principles of others. Both spoke \nup when they saw wrongdoing. Both had extraordinary courage that \nallowed them to speak out when they thought their own party was in \nerror. Both saw the aisle not as a barrier to progress but as a bridge \nto reaching consensus on behalf of the American people.\n\n  This focus on moving forward is especially apparent in Gordon Smith's \neffective work on issues of great importance in Maine, in Oregon, and \neverywhere in between--health care, tax relief, small business, equal \nrights, and foreign policy. These challenges are ones that require \ncareful consensus-building, a responsible approach that has defined \nGordon Smith's service here.\n  Gordon Smith is simply a wonderful person and an extraordinary \nleader. We all remember the terrible tragedy he suffered with the loss \nof his son during his service here, a terrible tragedy that gave him \nand his family such sorrow. But it is typical of Gordon Smith that out \nof that tragedy, he chose to do something to help prevent other \nfamilies from enduring the tragedy of the loss of a child. That is so \ntypical of Gordon Smith--always thinking of others, always trying to do \nwhat is right, always committed to public service.\n  ``Smith'' is one of the more common names in the English language, \nbut in this Chamber the name has special meaning, one of uncommon \nprinciples and extraordinary accomplishments. It reminds us of a \ncherished film, of the great lady from the State of Maine, Senator \nMargaret Chase Smith, and now of Senator Gordon Smith. I thank him for \nhis service and his friendship, and I wish him all the best in the \nfuture.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Maine is recognized.\n\n\n                             Elizabeth Dole\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, when she came to the Senate 6 years ago, \nElizabeth Dole brought with her a resume that for most would describe a \nfull lifetime of public service and accomplishment. The intellect, \nprinciples, and dedication Elizabeth applied to her earlier endeavors \nhave been readily apparent in the Senate. America has been enriched by \nall of Senator Elizabeth Dole's public service.\n  Her record of public service is truly inspiring. From the Office of \nConsumer Affairs and the Federal Trade Commission to the Secretary of \nTransportation and Labor, she has served five Presidents. Her tenure in \neach of these positions has been marked by the dedication, \neffectiveness, and accomplishments that we have seen firsthand in the \nSenate.\n  Nothing more fully describes Elizabeth's character than the fact that \nshe left Government service only to become the president of the \nAmerican Red Cross, joining founder Clara Barton as the only women to \nhold that position. In the spirit of that great organization, Elizabeth \nworked as a volunteer her first year, accepting no salary. Under her \nleadership, the American Red Cross was a model for charitable \norganizations, with 91 cents out of every dollar contributed going \ndirectly to help those in need.\n  Elizabeth led the American Red Cross by example. Following the gulf \nwar, she visited Kuwait to assess personally the services provided to \nour military personnel. She traveled to famine-stricken Somalia and \nMozambique and to war-ravaged Croatia. She led a humanitarian relief \noperation to Rwanda refugee camps. That same commitment, courage, and \ncompassion have been the hallmarks of her work in the Senate.\n  Those of us who are women also appreciate the many times Elizabeth \nDole has blazed the path forward for other women. We know she was one \nof the very first women to attend Harvard Law School. Think how \ndifficult that must have been for a woman raised in the South. Yet she \npersevered and she excelled and she broke barrier after barrier for \nother women.\n  In her campaign for President in 2000, Elizabeth Dole had a profound \neffect. She attracted legions of new voters into the political process. \nShe encouraged women throughout the country and of all political \npersuasions to step forward and get involved in the campaign and to run \nfor public office themselves. Many of the cracks in the glass ceiling \nare the work of her hands.\n  Here in the Senate, I have been privileged to work alongside Senator \nDole as members on the Senate Armed Services Committee. She has been \none of our strongest and most eloquent voices for the men and women in \nuniform, and her commitment to them is inspiring. Her dedication to \nstrengthening our national security and modernizing our military is \nunsurpassed.\n  It is certainly no accident that she is married to a man--former \nSenator Bob Dole--who exemplifies the quiet courage and devotion to \nduty that are the hallmark of America's armed services and by which \nboth Senator Doles are known.\n  I know that all in the Senate and throughout our Nation will agree \nthat just a few of the words that best describe Elizabeth Dole are \n``intelligence,'' ``principles,'' and ``commitment.'' To those, I am \nproud to add the word ``friend.'' I will miss serving with Elizabeth \nDole. I wish her all the best in the years to come.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S10615]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, next week Americans across our country \nare going to be celebrating Thanksgiving. It is a time that we reflect \nand give thanks for our families and friends and all that we have. But \nfar too many of our families across my State and across this country \nhave far less than they did just a year ago. They lost their homes, \ntheir cars, their health care, their 401(k)s, and their jobs. Just this \nmonth, we learned that this country has lost a total of 1.2 million \njobs this year. Over half of that decrease came in the last 3 months \nalone.\n  Across this country, people are hurting, and some of the hardest hit \nhave been our veterans from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Thousands \nof our veterans are still recovering from physical or psychological \ninjuries that make it very hard for them to pay their bills or to find \na job, and too many find themselves sliding quickly into bankruptcy or \nforeclosure. Yesterday, in fact, the New York Times reported that \nadvocacy groups have seen a huge increase in the number of veterans \nasking for financial help over the last year.\n  Americans made it very clear on election day that they want a new \ndirection in this country. They want action that will help pull us out \nof this economic crisis. President-elect Obama has already announced \nthat his first priority will be an economic recovery plan that invests \nin our country's infrastructure. As chair of the Appropriations \nTransportation and Housing Subcommittee, I stand ready to help with \nthat. But, as the latest jobless reports show, we can't afford to wait \neven until January, when we have a new President, to start providing \nthe help Americans need today. That is why I have come to the floor. We \nneed to take action that will create jobs, diversify and modernize our \neconomy, and help our families cope with this economic downturn.\n  This week, Senator Byrd and our majority leader, Senator Reid, \nproposed an economic stimulus bill that would do just that. Their bill \nis targeted at the biggest needs in our country today. It will create \nmore than 635,000 jobs by investing in infrastructure and green energy \ndevelopment, and it would help our most vulnerable citizens put food on \nthe table and keep a roof over their heads.\n  Congress can make a real difference for millions of families across \nour country. If there was a mandate given on November 4, it was for \nGovernment to work for the people once again. America's working \nfamilies want a government that will turn our economy around and end \nthis war, and they want true progress on health care and on education. \nThat is our mandate. We have an awful lot of work to do, and we need a \nbipartisan effort to do it. But we cannot just sit around waiting until \nwe have a new administration and a new Congress. Americans are hurting \ntoday.\n  We have the ability in this Congress to come together across party \nlines and pass a bill that will put Americans back to work and \nstabilize our communities across this country. I wish to take a couple \nof minutes this morning to outline how that package will help get our \ncountry moving again and help those most in need.\n  First of all, it is critically important that we help families who \nhave already lost their jobs and are drawing unemployment today. \nEspecially with employers cutting jobs each month, there are hundreds \nof thousands of Americans who need help for basic needs while they look \nfor work. This package reaches out to those families by extending \nunemployment benefits by 7 weeks across the country and 13 weeks in \nStates where the jobless rate is the highest. It also brings relief to \ncommunities, since every dollar of unemployment benefits generates \n$1.64 in additional economic activity. This helps everyone.\n  This bill also provides help for the millions of families who are \nstruggling today to find safe and secure housing. Across the country, \npublic housing is badly in need of repair and improvement. This bill \nwill allow communities to rehabilitate vacant public housing units, \nimprove energy efficiency, and jump-start construction of new projects \nthat will serve those tenants. It will also help address a growing \nproblem in our community: renters who lost their homes because their \nlandlords were foreclosed on. This bill will help protect these \ninnocent victims of the foreclosure crisis and help them find immediate \nshelter and long-term housing.\n  One reason we need this bill badly is because it offers help to those \nwho need it most, those who have lost their jobs and homes who are \nstruggling to find housing today. But this bill will also help our \ncommunities and jump-start our economy by creating more than 635,000 \njobs, investing in new technology and repairing our infrastructure. For \nexample, this package would make investments in highway and bridge \nconstruction in every single State--all 50 States--by providing $10 \nbillion to help fund projects that are ready to go today. We know that \nfor every $1 billion we spend on highways, we create more than 34,500 \ngood jobs. So this package will create more than 345,000 jobs.\n  Additionally, it is important to note there are no earmarks in this \nbill, no special projects as part of the highway funding in this bill. \nAll highway dollars will be spent according to the formula that has \nbeen established for the Surface Transportation Program in our SAFETEA-\nLU highway bonds. States would have to put this money to work in 180 \ndays.\n  We also know that roads are not the only area where communities need \ntransportation dollars. Cities across our country are struggling to \nrepair and expand their bus and rail systems as demand for mass transit \nand public transportation is skyrocketing. So this bill will improve \nand expand mass-transit systems so that millions of commuters can get \nto work smoothly and on time. It will help repair and improve our \nNation's airports. It will make needed investments in our Nation's \nferry transportation system and modernize our Nation's shipyards to \nmake them competitive and efficient.\n  While creating these jobs will help get our economy going again, we \nalso need to work to make sure our workers are prepared to compete for \nthe jobs of the future. So this package does that by helping 160,000 \ndislocated workers and youth get education, training, counseling, and \njob assistance. This is particularly important for young people who are \ndisengaged from school and for disadvantaged teenagers who are often \nhurt the most when our unemployment rates are high. It is critical that \nwe enable these young people to get work experience now because if they \nlose out, they are less likely to move successfully into a career \nlater.\n  We know teens without jobs are more likely to turn to crime or join \ngangs which cost our communities millions in law enforcement and lost \nproductivity. Not only will the programs this bill supports pay off as \nthe economy picks up over time, they will help stimulate the economy in \nthe short term too, because, you know, teens spend immediately all the \nmoney they make. So that will help everyone.\n  This package also recognizes that we need to start investing in new \nand healthy industries that will help create new, good-paying jobs and \nhelp strengthen our economy for the long term. I think one of the most \npromising fields is green technology. That is why this package would \ninvest almost $7 billion in research and development that would help us \ncreate new energy sources and improved energy efficiency.\n  Not only is the research and development absolutely vital in order to \ncreate the technology and the new jobs that come with it, but research \nand development and clean technologies are critical if we are going to \nbecome energy independent.\n  So these are parts of the package which I believe will be a shot in \nthe arm, that will help our economy for many years to come.\n  Before I finish today, I do want to address the provisions in this \nbill that would help the country's struggling auto industry. I want the \nauto industry to remain viable and continue to support the millions of \njobs across this country which depend on its success. But I cannot \nsupport any more funds without concrete assurance the automakers have a \nstrategy to restructure and become viable, competitive companies. The \nauto industries cannot continue to follow a failed business model and \nthen come here and ask for help.\n\n[[Page S10616]]\n\n  I supported the $25 billion with strong restructuring language for \nthe auto industry in the continuing resolution we passed a month ago. I \nwill need to be convinced that adding funding will not only save jobs \nbut the industry leaders will take seriously the issue of restructuring \nand work to reinvigorate an industry that continues to teeter on the \nbrink of failure.\n  I am also, I have to say, very concerned about the blame being laid \nat the feet of the hard-working men and women in this industry. The \nauto industry's current financial industry crisis is the result of many \nfinancial factors, not the result of the cost of employee health care \nand negotiated contract benefits upon which numerous working families \nand retirees depend.\n  If the Federal Government, funded by working and taxpaying families, \nis expected to explore financial aid to ailing corporations, then I \nexpect to hear about sacrifices industry management will make during \nthese tough times. I am very hopeful we can do that.\n  A month ago this Congress came together and passed a bill to help \nrestore stability in our financial markets. Well, we need this bill to \nprovide stability for our communities and for our working families at \nhome. We need it to help the most vulnerable among us to keep food on \ntheir table and a roof over their head.\n  We need it to help unemployed workers pay the bills while they start \nanother job search. We need it so that we can create jobs, invest in \nour communities, and support new developments in sustainable and \nemerging industries.\n  We can start solving this economic crisis now. We can provide our \nfamilies with the help they need for the holidays and before this \neconomic situation gets worse. I hope our colleagues will join \ntogether, work across party lines, pass this stimulus bill, and offer \nhope this year to millions of struggling families across this country.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Menendez). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, I want to take a few minutes to say thank \nyou and farewell to a Chicago legend and a national treasure.\n  Studs Terkel--author, actor, television pioneer, civil rights \nchampion, law school graduate, social historian, jazz critic, disc \njockey, champion of little guys and all the underdogs in America--died \nquietly in his Chicago North Side home on October 31. Studs was 96 \nyears old.\n  His interviews over 50 years with the celebrated and the uncelebrated \nmade him famous around the world. But there was no place on Earth where \nhe was better known or loved than in Chicago, his adopted hometown.\n  When he turned 95 in 2007, Chicago threw a party, complete with a \nskywriting plane that proclaimed: ``Happy Birthday, Studs.'' No last \nname was needed.\n  What was remarkable, however, is not how many Chicagoans knew him by \nhis first name, but how many Chicagoans Studs knew by their first \nnames.\n  After Studs died, a British journalist recalled a day he spent with \nStuds more than a decade ago when Studs was still doing his syndicated \nradio program 5 days a week at WFMT in downtown Chicago. This person \nwrote:\n\n       The journey to and from [Stud's] office was through a \n     subterranean labyrinth of corridors and shopping arcades \n     linking the WFMT building with the tower containing the \n     luncheon club. Beside the elevator door was an Irish \n     attendant he knew, and they burst into song. Then there was \n     an extraordinary ritual, involving an employee at Johnny's \n     Shoe Shine. ``Another day!'' bellowed Terkel from quite a \n     distance. ``Another triumph!'' boomed back the reply.\n\n  Forget Sinatra. Chicago was Studs Terkel's kind of town. He loved \nChicago because, in his words, ``Chicago is the country. It is America; \nit is a metaphor for everything.''\n  Elizabeth Taylor, the Chicago Tribune's literary editor and one of \nhis good friends, said Studs Terkel ``was Chicago and everything good \nabout the literary world--make that the world in general.'' I agree.\n  The last time I saw him was about 2 months ago at a bookstore in \nChicago. Studs was signing copies of his second to last book, a \nwonderful memoir called ``Touch and Go.'' He wore his trademark red-\ncheckered shirt. The bookstore was packed with people. Studs was nearly \ndeaf by then, but if he looked straight at you, he could tell what you \nwere saying. But that is what he was doing--still listening, listening, \nlistening to everyone who approached him.\n  It was a slow moving line as we waited to have our books autographed. \nI waited more than an hour to say hello and get my book signed, but I \nam glad I did.\n  ``Calling [Studs Terkel] a `writer and broadcaster' would be like \ncalling Louis Armstrong a `trumpeter' or the Empire State Building an \n`office block.' Strictly and sparsely speaking, it is true.'' So read \nhis obituary in London's Guardian newspaper.\n  On radio, TV, and more than a dozen books, Studs Terkel interviewed \nsome of the most famous of the 20th century--Simone de Beauvoir, Margot \nFonteyn, Arthur Miller, John Kenneth Galbraith, Tennessee Williams, \nMargaret Mead, Leonard Bernstein, Louis Armstrong, Buster Keaton, \nMarlon Brando, Bob Dylan, Aaron Copeland, Zero Mostel, Mahalia Jackson, \nJames Baldwin, and the list goes on and on.\n  He interviewed a 90-year-old Bertrand Russell in a village in North \nWales during the 1962 Cuban missile crisis and almost erased the tape \nof their conversation because he was pretty clumsy with his tape \nrecorder. Studs never overcame that ineptitude. He said it was actually \nan asset because it made the people he interviewed want to help him.\n  But it was Studs Terkel's interviews with ordinary Americans, not \ncelebrities, that set him apart. What guided his work? Studs said: \n``The principle is that ordinary people have extraordinary thoughts--\nI've always believed that--and that ordinary people can speak \npoetically.''\n  Accepting an honorary National Book Award medal in 1997, he said:\n\n       When the Chinese Wall was built, where did the masons go \n     for lunch? When Caesar conquered Gaul, was there not even a \n     cook in the army? And here's the big one, when the Armada \n     sank, you read that King Philip wept. Were there no other \n     tears?\n       That's what I believe oral history is about. It's about \n     those who shed those other tears, who on rare occasions of \n     triumph laughed that other laugh.\n\n  By talking and listening to ordinary Americans, Studs Terkel \nharvested what the Economist magazine called ``not only the most \ncomplete American history of this century, but the most \ncompassionate.''\n  ``De Tocqueville with a tape recorder,'' is what the Times of London \ncalled him.\n  Robert Coles, professor of psychiatry at Harvard, told the L.A. \nTimes:\n\n       I think he was the most extraordinary social observer this \n     country has ever produced.\n\n  Said his son Dan, Studs ``led a long, full, eventful, sometimes \ntempestuous but very satisfying life.''\n  He was born in the Bronx on May 16, 1912, a month after the Titanic \nsank. He used to like to say: ``I came up when she'd gone down.''\n  His real name was Louis. He took the name ``Studs'' in the twenties, \nafter Studs Lonigan, the protagonist of James T. Farrell's 1930s novels \nabout an Irish kid from Chicago's South Side.\n  His father Samuel was a tailor. His mother Anna was a seamstress who \nmoved to America from Poland.\n  The Terkel family moved to Chicago in 1922 after his father suffered \na heart ailment. They ran a rooming house at Wells and Grand.\n  It was there in a small park nearby formally known as Washington \nSquare but better known as Bughouse Square--a place, Studs said, \n``where free speech is the power and the glory''--where he first met \nthe workers and activists who would shape his view of the world and \nfill up his books and tapes.\n  He graduated from the University of Chicago with degrees in \nphilosophy and\n\n[[Page S10617]]\n\nlaw in 1934 but did not care to work as a lawyer. Instead, after a \nbrief stint as a civil servant in Washington, he joined the Work \nProjects Administration's Federal Writers' Project, writing radio \nscripts.\n  Soon he was acting in radio soaps. Usually, he was the voice of the \ngangster.\n  He served a year in the Army Air Corps but was discharged after a \nyear because of perforated eardrums.\n  He landed his own TV show at the beginning of the television age, the \npioneering ``Studs Place'' but lost it after a few seasons when he was \nblacklisted during the dreaded McCarthy era.\n  In the early 1950s, he hooked up with WFMT, a new arts station in \nChicago. It was the start of a great partnership. His syndicated radio \ntalk show, ``The Studs Terkel Program,'' ran on WFMT every weekday from \n1952 to 1997--45 years.\n  He played a sports reporter in the 1988 film ``Eight Men Out,'' about \nthe Chicago Black Sox scandal of 1919. And he continued to write almost \nto the day he died.\n  He was, said an obituary by the Associated Press, ``an old rebel who \nnever mellowed, never retired, never forgot, and `never met a picket \nline or petition' he didn't like.''\n  What made him so good? Bob Minzeshimer, a USA Today reporter who knew \nhim, said:\n\n       He had the listening skills of a psychologist, the timing \n     of a comic, the curiosity of a scholar, and the gravelly \n     voice of a boxing promoter.\n\n  He wrote with honesty, empathy, eloquence, and humor. Above all, he \nwrote with real respect for the people he interviewed.\n  As the writer for the Economist said, ``Talking to Mr. Terkel, the \ncopyboy or the short-order clerk or the welfare mother felt, at last, \nlike somebody. They counted; they had possibilities.''\n\n  His first book, ``Giants of Jazz,'' was published in 1957. Nearly a \ndecade passed before he wrote another, but it was worth the wait. \n``Division Street,'' released in 1966, contrasted rich and poor along \nthat same Chicago street and won him international recognition.\n  Studs' best known book, ``Working,'' was published in 1974. In 1999, \na panel of judges organized by the Modern Library, a book publisher, \nranked ``Working'' as No. 54 on its list of the top 100 best English \nlanguage works of the 20th century. He won a Pulitzer Prize in 1985 for \n``The Good War: An Oral History of World War II.''\n  Among his other books are ``Hard Times: An Oral History of the Great \nDepression''; ``American Dreams: Lost and Found''; ``The Great Divide: \nSecond Thoughts on the American Dream''; ``Race: How Blacks and Whites \nThink and Feel About the American Obsession''; ``Coming of Age: The \nStory of Our Century by Those Who've Lived It''; ``Will the Circle Be \nUnbroken? Reflections on Death, Rebirth''; ``Hope Dies Last: Keeping \nthe Faith in Difficult Times''; ``Touch and Go''; and his final book, \n``P.S. Further Thoughts from a Lifetime of Listening.'' They just \nreleased it last week. It was at his bedside when he passed away.\n  He received so many awards: a Peabody Award for excellence in \njournalism; the National Book Foundation Medal for contributions to \nAmerican letters; the Pulitzer Prize for his book ``The Good War''; the \nPresidential Humanities Medal; the National Medal of Humanities; the \nIllinois Governor's Award for the Arts; and the Clarence Darrow \nCommemorative Award.\n  He was the only white writer to be inducted into the International \nLiterary Hall of Fame for Writers of African Descent at Chicago State \nUniversity.\n  But the recognition that meant the most to him didn't come from the \nmedia. It was comments from people he worked with, people whose eyes he \nopened. Like the man who stopped him on the Michigan Avenue bridge and \ntold him that after reading the words of Delores Dante in ``Working,'' \nhe was never going to be rude to a waitress again.\n  Besides Chicago, the other great love of Studs Terkel's life was his \nwife Ida, with whom he shared a happy marriage for 60 years until she \npassed away in 1999.\n  Mischievous to the end, Studs said he wanted to be cremated and have \nhis ashes mixed with Ida's, and he wanted them both to be scattered in \nBughouse Square. ``Scatter us there,'' he said. ``It's against the law \n(so) let 'em sue us.''\n  In ``Touch and Go,'' Studs Terkel worried that our Nation suffered \nfrom ``a national alzheimer's disease,'' as he said it, and a lack of \nhistorical perspective that made government the perceived enemy.\n  He believed that government ought to stand up for the little guy and \nhold the powerful accountable. He believed it because he had seen it \nbefore.\n  There would never be a good time to lose Studs Terkel but now seems \nlike a particularly bad time for such a loss. Our economy is in crisis. \nReal people are hurting. Ordinary people who worked hard all their \nlives are watching their savings disappear. Millions of Americans are \nlosing their jobs and their homes. They are seeing hundreds of billions \nof their tax dollars handed out to banks and to Wall Street, and I \nguess they are wondering: Is anybody in Government listening to them?\n  In these hard times, in this rare lameduck session of Congress, we in \nthe Senate would do well to follow Studs Terkel's example: to listen \nnot only to the wealthy and well connected but also to the quiet hopes \nand concerns of everyday Americans. As Studs Terkel showed in his \nimmortal works, those everyday Americans are the soul and real strength \nof America.\n  Our condolences go out to Studs' and Ida's son Dan and to all who \nknew and loved Studs Terkel.\n  He stood only 5 feet 5 inches tall, with a slouch that made him look \neven shorter. But in Chicago and so many other places, Studs Terkel was \na giant; and he will be greatly missed.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to speak about the Economic \nRecovery Act, which is a comprehensive stimulus package. We need it. \nOur Nation needs this. It is a much needed shot in the arm for our \nailing economy. When the economy is ailing, there are two choices: We \ncan choose the path of, say, Herbert Hoover and say: Government should \nnot be involved, let an ideological straitjacket tie us up--We know \nwhat happened then--or we can choose the course economists on the left, \nthe middle, and the right have said we should choose, which is we need \na major stimulus package to get the economy going.\n  I would have hoped we would have made the choice to help this economy \nand help the millions of Americans who are worried. Hundreds of \nthousands have lost their jobs, millions more are worried about losing \ntheir jobs, and tens of millions see every week that the paycheck does \nnot stretch as far as it did.\n  We face an economic crisis of a scale and scope that we have not \nexperienced in 25 years, if not longer. By every measure we are headed \ntoward a cliff. We are in the midst of the greatest housing crisis \nsince the Great Depression. Unemployment has been rising rapidly and is \nexpected to hit levels we have not seen at least since the early 1980s.\n  States and localities face massive budget shortfalls that may force \nthem to raise property taxes unless Federal assistance is delivered. \nFamilies are running harder just to stand still, seeing their incomes \nshrink while their costs, especially their food and energy costs, are \nfar greater than they were 1 year ago.\n  The credit contraction that has spread from the financial system to \naverage households has pummeled American businesses in every part of \nthe country, businesses big and small. Not even the most optimistic \namong us can argue that our economic problems will take care of \nthemselves.\n  The question before us is: What are we, as stewards of the public \ntrust, going to do? I believe the answer is clear: The Federal \nGovernment should, it must, provide an economic stimulus to Main Street \nas we have to Wall\n\n[[Page S10618]]\n\nStreet. It must be significant and substantial and it must be targeted \nat our most pressing needs.\n  The plan before us does that. It will prime the pump of America's job \nmachine, by fast-tracking $13.5 billion of investment into our Nation's \ninfrastructure which forms the bedrock of our economy. It will help the \nStates avoid the difficult decision to raise property taxes; you cannot \ndo that now. But some of them may have no choice because they have \nbudget shortfalls. But we can avoid that terrible choice by delivering \n$40 billion in emergency fiscal aid through the FMAP.\n  The stimulus package before us will jump start renewable energy \nproduction by making major investments in the technologies that will \nnot only help America become energy independent but will make us a \nglobal leader in the next generation of fuel-efficient vehicles.\n  Importantly, this bill will also resuscitate small business lending. \nWe all know small businesses are the engine of our economy. But small \nbusinesses have been overlooked in the financial rescue efforts to \ndate.\n  So working with my friend and colleague from Massachusetts, Senator \nKerry, we have worked to include provisions in this stimulus package \nthat will throw our small businesses a life vest to weather this storm \nso they can emerge from it as leaders in job creation.\n  Small businesses generally rely heavily on loans from banks to build \ninventory, meet their payroll consistently, and fuel the growth of the \nbusiness. These loans have all but dried up, threatening the survival \nof car dealerships, mom-and-pop pharmacies, restaurants and shops all \nacross the Nation.\n  The Federal Reserve recently reported that 75 percent of domestic \nbanks said they had tightened their lending standards for small-\nbusiness loans, 75 percent. At the same time, 70 percent of the lenders \ntold the Fed that they would charge more for those loans. According to \nthe New York Times in an August opinion poll, two-thirds of \nentrepreneurs told the National Small Businesses Association that their \ncompanies had been hurt by the credit crunch.\n  Traditionally, Small Business Administration loans have filled this \ngap. But chronic underfunding of the SBA under the Bush administration \nand its outdated fee structure have greatly reduced lender \nparticipation and undermined the valuable function that SBA lending \ncould play during this credit crisis.\n  In October alone, the number of loans made under SBA's largest loan \nprogram dropped over 50 percent compared to the same month last year. \nSo the economy desperately needs this shot in the arm.\n  And SBA's loan program is cut in half. What foolishness. Why do we \nnot change it? That is why Senator Kerry and I fought to include in the \neconomic stimulus package provisions that will modernize the SBA and \njump start lending to small business.\n  Our bill provides $615 million to support $22.5 billion in zero-fee \nloans to small businesses under the 7A and 504 programs. Providing \nzero-fee loans will deliver needed relief to small business on Main \nStreet during Wall Street's financial crisis.\n  The bill also provides $1 million to support $10 million in new \nmicroloans for small businesses and $4 million for critical technical \nassistance for these new ``micro'' borrowers.\n  In sum, our Nation needs this stimulus package, not just for the \nsmall businesses or the large businesses across the Nation but for the \nAmerican families who have faced devastating hits to their wealth and \neconomic security. We need to build a platform from which we can emerge \nfrom this credit crisis as a global leader in energy and innovation and \nhigh-paying job creation. I strongly urge the passage of this proposal.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cardin).

Mr. President, today I come to the floor to tell the \nNation a story, and it is the story of a Wyoming doctor, a doctor by \nthe name of Randy Johnston. He is an ophthalmologist who practices in \nCheyenne, WY. He is very qualified. He is very capable. He is also a \ngood friend.\n  The reason I come to tell you this story is because, like many \ndoctors across the country, Randy takes care of people on Medicare, and \noccasionally in his practice as an ophthalmologist he gives shots to \npeople on Medicare. As a matter of fact, there is a picture of Dr. \nJohnston on the front page of the American Medical News. This is an \narticle dated November 10, written by Jane Cys, and it shows Dr. \nJohnston in his office in Cheyenne getting ready to give a shot.\n  Well, in the past, Randy would buy the drugs that his practice uses \nand then bill the patients for the treatment. The drugs that Randy uses \nare typically injected, but under this Part B Medicare drug program \nsome are infused through a patient intravenously right into the vein.\n  Two years ago, Randy enrolled in a new program created by the 2003 \nMedicare Modernization Act. This Medicare Part B program was called the \nCompetitive Acquisition Program--CAP is the phrase they use. It was \ndesigned to give doctors a choice in the way they administer the drugs.\n  Under the program, the doctor would first see the patient, then order \nthe medicine from a Government vendor, then get the medicine, and then \ngive the injection.\n  Well, the way it worked is, Medicare would then pay the vendor for \nthe drugs. Medicare also would bill the patient if there was a copay or \na premium the patient owed. Randy was only responsible to bill Medicare \nfor the actual treatment of the patient, not for the medicines.\n  Congress and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services hailed \nthis new program as a way to alleviate administrative burdens and \nreduce Medicare costs--a good idea. Doctors could now spend more of \ntheir time with their patients rather than serving as drug purchasers \nand bill collectors.\n  Randy signed up for the program early, and the program that was \npassed as part of the 2003 bill finally got started in 2006. Randy \nthought it made good sense for him, good sense for his patients. Some \nof his Medicare patients could not afford to pay for their office-\nadministered drugs, and Randy saw great potential in this new program. \nHe could transfer the Medicare billing part of it to someone equipped \nto handle the administrative redtape, and this freedom would leave him \nmore time to focus on practicing medicine.\n  The program has now been in place for 3 years. What are the results? \nWell, only 4,200 doctors signed up for the program. You may ask, why is \nthat? Dr. Johnston can tell you, and this article in the American \nMedical News explains it very well. Administrative hassles, burdensome \ndrug transportation and storage rules, and vendor delivery problems--\nand that is just to name a few.\n  For example, the Government rules require doctors to give patients \nthe drugs only in the facility where the vendor delivered the \nmedicine--no exceptions, none. This requirement prevented doctors from \nmoving drugs between their main office and a part-time satellite office \nthey may have in another community.\n  Washington bureaucrats simply do not understand what a burden this \npolicy can be in rural and frontier communities. Seniors living in \nrural States such as Wyoming often have to travel great distances--\nhundreds of miles--to see a specialist like Dr. Randy Johnston. This \nprogram, with good intentions, clearly was not designed to meet the \nunique needs facing rural patients and health care providers who work \ntirelessly to serve their patients.\n  Dr. Johnston was also required to order the drugs for a specific \nindividual patient by name. He was not allowed to restock a general \noffice supply to use on multiple patients.\n\n[[Page S10619]]\n\n  I understand the Government is trying to prevent drug stockpiling. \nBut this rigid program requirement does not give doctors the \nflexibility they need to practice medicine. This is especially true in \nemergency situations.\n  So who is liable when a patient comes to the doctor's office needing \nimmediate treatment but the doctor cannot help because he has to call \nthe Government to send the medicine in the first place, even if he has \na supply on hand for another patient? The program's current design has \nturned out to be a bureaucratic nightmare.\n  After only 3 months in the program, Randy Johnston wrote Medicare a \nletter begging--I say begging--to be let out of the program. Why? Well, \nit was not just the excessive paperwork and the excessive phone calls \nto get the medication; Randy saw how absolutely wasteful this \nGovernment program had become.\n  When Dr. Johnston purchased Medicaid vials himself from a local \npharmacy, the local pharmacy would divide it into multiple doses that \ncould be used for different patients. Using the new Medicare program, \nDr. Johnston had to order an entire vial for each patient, use the one \ndose the patient needed, and then throw the rest away.\n  Why would Medicare force seniors and taxpayers to foot the bill for \nan entire vial of medication containing 400 doses when the patient only \nneeded 1 dose? At a time when Americans are facing such painful \nfinancial times, this wasteful Government spending is appalling. We are \ntalking about lifesaving medicine, expensive medicine. I do not know \nanyone who buys a loaf of bread, takes out one piece and eats it, and \nthrows away the rest of the loaf. This makes no sense to anyone.\n  It is well past the time that Washington bureaucrats start treating \ntaxpayer dollars like the money in their own personal checkbooks. When \nemergencies, illnesses, or major household repairs occur in our \nfamilies, we find a way to pay the bill. We look at our budgets, we \ntighten our belts, and we find alternative places to save. We eliminate \nluxury items. We stop wasteful spending.\n  Dr. Johnston was absolutely right to try to get out of this \nabsolutely wrong, wasteful program. Washington bureaucrats who have \nnever been on the front lines treating Medicare patients developed this \nprogram. They do not understand the practical applications. So I was \nnot surprised when Medicare announced in September of this year they \nwere putting the entire program on hold starting in January 2009. \nWashington bureaucrats claim they are considering alternative ways--\nalternative ways--to improve the program because they want it to \nsucceed.\n  The new administration has a tremendous opportunity to learn from \nRandy Johnston and from the 4,200 other participating doctors. Rather \nthan hamstring providers, perhaps Washington should start to focus its \nefforts on eliminating waste, eliminating fraud, and eliminating abuse \nin the Medicare system.\n  This year alone, we have seen one news report after another \nuncovering Medicare wasting money. These news reports sound the alarm \nto every hard-working taxpayer in the sound of my voice and all hard-\nworking taxpayers across America.\n  Who is holding these bureaucrats accountable? Just this week, the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services issued the Agency Financial \nReport. This document shows that in fiscal year 2008, these Government \ncheck writers made $10.4 billion--$10.4 billion--in improper Medicare \nfee-for-service payments. We can do better. We can do much better than \nthis.\n  Wasteful spending strips Medicare of the vital resources that are \nneeded to care for our elderly, to care for our frail, to care for the \nvulnerable. The new administration has a real opportunity to show \nleadership. Working together, we can fix this flawed policy. Medicare \npatients, doctors who take care of Medicare patients, and the American \ntaxpayers deserve nothing less.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, in September, the Senate considered a $56 \nbillion economic recovery bill, authored by Senator Reid and myself. \nWhile the bill received 52 votes, the minority succeeded in blocking \nits consideration.\n  In the following 2 months, the economy has continued to deteriorate. \nOn Monday, Senator Reid and I renewed our effort to stimulate the \neconomy and help the millions of Americans hurt by the recession by \nintroducing a $100 billion economic recovery bill.\n  In response to higher unemployment, rising food costs, higher energy \ncosts, State budgets in crisis, and increased dependence on foreign \noil, President-elect Obama has called for passage of a second stimulus \nbill. I spoke with the President-elect yesterday, and I committed \nmyself to helping the President implement his agenda.\n  Madam President, it is time to deliver to Main Street USA. S. 3689 is \na $100.3 billion economic stimulus package that would create over \n635,000 jobs. I will repeat that. S. 3689 is a $100.3 billion economic \nstimulus package that would create over 635,000 jobs. The unemployment \nrate now stands at 6.5 percent, the highest rate since March 1994. The \nunemployment rate is up by 1.7 percentage points since October 2007. \nThe U.S. economy has lost jobs every month this year--a total of 1.2 \nmillion jobs, with almost half of the job losses coming in the last 3 \nmonths alone. New unemployment claims filed exceeded 500,000, the \nhighest number since just after 9/11.\n  In order to respond to these grim statistics--and they are grim--the \nstimulus package extends unemployment benefits by 7 weeks in all \nStates, as well as another 13 weeks in high-unemployment States. \nThirty-seven States are facing a shortfall of over $70 billion in their \nfiscal year 2009 budget, necessitating cutbacks in education, cutbacks \nin health care, and cutbacks in law enforcement.\n  The stimulus package includes $37.8 billion--that is $37.80 for every \nminute since Jesus Christ was born--to reduce the State's share of \nMedicaid costs by increasing the Federal share--increasing, I say--the \nFederal share by 8 percent.\n  The economic recovery package also--I emphasize the word ``also''--\nincludes a temporary increase in food stamp benefits. These funds--hear \nme now--these funds will be spent quickly, and they will help to \nstimulate the economy.\n  Over $37 billion is included for essential infrastructure and \ninvestment programs. Now hear me, listen closely. I measure each word. \nThere are consequences for failing to invest in America. For 8 years--8 \nlong years--we have failed to make adequate investments in highways, \ntransit systems, housing, in clean and safe drinking water systems, and \nin energy independence. This bill funds such investments, as well as \nsmall business loans, assistance for rural communities, and disaster \nrelief for farmers hurt by the hurricanes and the floods this summer.\n  I understand, I am sorry to say, there is going to be an objection to \ndebating this bill.

Madam President, it is my sad task today to say \nfarewell to our friend, the Senator from North Carolina, Elizabeth \nDole. It is hard to know where to begin with a woman who has done it \nall and is admired across America.\n  There is an old saying that all politics is local. That is true even \nfor the Senator from North Carolina, who was the first viable female \ncandidate for President, held two different Cabinet positions, and \nworked for four Presidents. You see, Elizabeth's first campaign was for \nthe presidency of her third grade Bird Club. She won that race.\n  Elizabeth began impressing many early on as she earned her bachelor's \ndegree from Duke University and both a master's and a law degree from \nHarvard. Of the 550 members of her Harvard Law class, only 29 were \nwomen.\n  From there, Elizabeth went to the White House Office of Consumer \nAffairs, and then the Federal Trade Commission. In 1972, she met a \nSenator from Kansas when she lobbied him on a consumer-affairs issue.\n  In 1975, Elizabeth and Bob Dole were married in Washington Cathedral, \ncreating one of the most prominent and successful partnerships in \nAmerican public life.\n  Elizabeth later headed President Reagan's Public Liaison Office, and \nthen in 1983 became his Secretary of Transportation. She served for \n4\\1/2\\ years, longer than any previous transportation secretary at that \ntime. And as transportation secretary, she was fond of pointing out \nthat she was the first woman to ever head a branch of the Armed \nServices: the Coast Guard.\n  When her husband Bob introduced Elizabeth at her confirmation \nhearings, he displayed some of his trademark wit by remarking, ``I only \nregret that I have but one wife to give for my country's \ninfrastructure.''\n  When Elizabeth had her turn at the microphone, she got him right \nback. She assured the committee that she knew all about airbags, \nbecause she had been driving around with one for years.\n  In 1989, Elizabeth became one of the few Americans honored to lead \nmore than one Federal department by becoming the first President Bush's \nSecretary of Labor. Among the highlights of her tenure there was \nplaying a key role in resolving a bitter 11-month coal strike in \nsouthwest Virginia.\n  I would even go so far as to say that Elizabeth was the second-best \nSecretary of Labor this country's ever had.\n  Elizabeth went on to become the president of the Red Cross, and \nrevitalized that important institution. And of course, she became a \nfamiliar face to all Americans in 1996 when Bob became the Republican \nnominee for President of the United States, and when Elizabeth blazed \nyet another trail in 2000 as the first viable female candidate for that \nsame office.\n  During her time here in the Senate, Elizabeth used the same desk her \nhusband used. From behind that desk, she has been a powerful advocate \nfor her State and her country.\n  North Carolinians can be proud of her record to strengthen our \nmilitary and to support military personnel and veterans. She worked to \ncraft a farm bill to benefit North Carolina agriculture. She has done \nmuch to address hunger in America, by championing tax incentives to \nencourage volunteerism and charitable giving, and through grant \nprograms to benefit food banks and relief organizations.\n  The ``Dole'' in the McGovern-Dole International Food for Education \nand Child Nutrition Program may be for her husband, Bob, as the program \nis named after him and former Senator George McGovern. But it was \nElizabeth Dole who secured more than $400 million for the McGovern-Dole \nprogram to go toward school-feeding and child-nutrition programs in the \nworld's poorest countries.\n  Let me take this moment to say, on behalf of my wife Elaine and \nmyself, that Elizabeth and Bob have been dear friends of ours for many \nyears. In fact, had it not been for Elizabeth, Elaine probably never \nwould have come to Washington in the first place, therefore I obviously \nnever would have met her, so I feel a special obligation to--and thanks \nto--Senator Dole for that. We value their friendship, and I know we \nwill continue to do so for many years to come.\n  Elizabeth, I want to thank you for always bringing wisdom, grace and \nintegrity to this chamber. Over decades of accomplishments in many \nprominent posts, you have served the people of America and of North \nCaroline extremely well.\n  I know your constituents are proud, and Bob is proud, of your \nservice. Elaine and I wish you both well in whatever the future has in \nstore for you. And we look forward to hearing all about it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina is recognized.\n  Mrs. DOLE. Madam President, I wish to express my deepest thanks for \nthe very kind words of the distinguished ``gentleman'' from Kentucky. I \nfeel very close to this gentleman because we have been very good \nfriends for so many years. Certainly your wife, Elaine Chao, who is \ndoing a tremendous job as Secretary of Labor, has been a friend for \nmany years. In fact, we worked together at the Department of \nTransportation as colleagues and then also when she was president of \nUnited Way and I was president of the American Red Cross. So our paths \nhave continued to cross in terms of our professions but also in terms \nof personal relationships and the warmth and friendship.\n  Mitch, I can't tell you how proud I am of your leadership as the \nRepublican leader, and I am so proud you have been reelected by your \ncolleagues. You do a tremendous job. You are a master of the Senate. \nThrough the years, you and I have had a chance to work together on many \nissues. Of course, it was my privilege early on--I believe in my first \nyear in the Senate--to visit the University of Louisville and the \nMcConnell Center for Political Leadership and to speak to the McConnell \nScholars. That is just one of many things you are doing to help others \noutside the Senate as well as the tremendous work within the Senate.\n  Just know I treasure your friendship. I look forward to being in \nclose touch\n\n[[Page S10621]]\n\nand hope there will be many other initiatives on which we can work \ntogether, Elaine and Bob and I, in the years to come. Thank you so much \nfor those most kind words wishing me well. I wish you all the very \nbest.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, you just witnessed the classic \nElizabeth Dole. I came out here to do a tribute to her, and she turned \naround and did a tribute to me. This is, I would say, indicative of the \nway Senator Dole has conducted herself in public life throughout her \nservice. We are going to miss her in the Senate, but I know she will \ncontinue to make important contributions to our country.\n  We revere your legacy and look forward to continuing our friendship \nin the coming years.\n  Mrs. DOLE. Thank you so much.\n\n\n                              gordon smith\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I rise with sadness to say goodbye to \nour friend the Senator from Oregon, Gordon Smith. For 12 years, he has \nmade the people of Oregon proud by serving as a model legislator: \nthoughtful, independent, and focused on getting results for our country \nand his State.\n  Gordon heard the call to serve others early in life, becoming an \nEagle Scout as a boy and taking a 2-year mission to New Zealand for his \nchurch. He earned his bachelor's degree at Brigham Young University and \nhis law degree at Southwestern University.\n  He then bought back the family business, a frozen vegetable company, \nand transformed it into one of the largest and most profitable in the \ncountry. With Gordon's departure, we are losing the Senate's only \nmember of the Frozen Food Hall of Fame.\n  Gordon's desire to serve led him to run for the Oregon State Senate \nin 1992. His peers recognized the star in their midst when they \nelevated him first to minority leader, then to Senate president during \nhis first term in office.\n  Gordon then entered a special election to fill a vacant U.S. Senate \nseat. Election day fell in January 1996, and Gordon lost that race--the \nwinner was our colleague, his fellow Senator from Oregon.\n  But then Gordon did something no one else has ever done, and proved \nto the people of the Beaver State how much he cared about making sure \nevery Oregonian's voice was heard in Washington.\n  He ran for the Senate again in the regularly scheduled election later \nthat year, making him the only American in history to run for two \nSenate seats in the same year. The people of Oregon gave him their \ntrust and Gordon has never let them down.\n  Oregonians can rightfully be proud of his conservation record, as he \nchampioned legislation to successfully secure the protection of 170,000 \nacres of wilderness on Steen Mountain and the Bull Run watershed.\n  While protecting our natural resources, he also understands the \nimportance of the many working Oregonians who depend on his State's \nnatural resources for their livelihood. The foremost example of his \nwork in that regard is his tireless effort to protect the farmers of \nthe Klamath Basin area, and keep their agricultural lands in \nproduction.\n  He has fought to lower the number of uninsured and drive healthcare \ncosts down, and has been a tireless advocate for the disabled and \nmentally ill.\n  He has sponsored legislation to strengthen the prosecution of child-\nexploitation cases, fought for new protections against Internet \npredators, and led the effort to increase funding for programs that \nhelp victims of rape, sexual assault and domestic violence.\n  Gordon has also been a leading voice on issues of education, and has \nfought to secure rural schools throughout Oregon. And he has fought for \nlower taxes, so more Oregonians can keep more of what they earn.\n  But there is one issue in particular where Gordon led the way in a \nvery personal manner for a cause close to his heart. In 2003, Gordon's \nson, Garrett, committed suicide just one day before his 22nd birthday.\n  The torment a parent must feel after losing a child must be the worst \nhorror imaginable. No amount of sympathy, no words, nothing any of us \ncould do could possibly ease the pain in Gordon's and his family's \nhearts.\n  Yet even in his grief, Gordon showed us the strength of his character \nwhen he wrote about his loss in his moving memoir, ``Remembering \nGarrett.'' And he channeled his sadness into successful legislation, \nthe Garrett Lee Smith Memorial Act, to create screening programs to \nidentify and help youths at risk for suicide.\n  I'll never forget his powerful words on behalf of that legislation in \nthis very chamber. He said:\n\n       [There's] no owner's manual to help you bury a child, \n     especially when the cause is suicide. So I've committed \n     myself to trying to find meaning in Garrett's life.\n\n  Gordon, with that brave act you prevented the tragedy of suicide from \nbefalling countless other families. I can think of no more profound \nexample of strength and leadership than that.\n  Every Senator knows what a pleasure it is to work with Gordon. He \nbelieves we were sent here to find solutions, not confrontations. And \nfor every day he has served in public office, finding solutions has \nbeen his goal.\n  Gordon, it has been a privilege to work with you these many years, \nand to spend time with you and your wife Sharon. America is a stronger \nNation thanks to your dedication and spirit of public service. Please \ndon't forget you have many friends here, and we all wish you well in \nyour bright future.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Cantwell). The Senator from Oregon is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. SMITH. Madam President, I thank my leader, Mitch McConnell. \nWinston Churchill observed that ``Democracy is not always a polite \nemployer.'' That is the case in my reelection effort. Yet I feel \nnothing but gratitude to the people of my State.\n  I acknowledge the wisdom of the people of Kentucky in your reelection \nand of the wisdom of my colleagues for electing you again as our \nleader. You are an articulate advocate for causes that I think are \nimportant for America not to forget in the coming days. It is one of \nthe high privileges of my life that I have been able to serve with you \nas a friend and as a colleague.\n  I thank you and I thank my Senate family, without respect to party, \nfor the help that was given to Sharon and me at the most painful time \nof our lives--to find additional meaning in the life of our son by \nhelping the sons and daughters of others. I hope and pray that my \nSenate colleagues, while I am gone, will not forget those who struggle \nwith mental illness. I am so proud of Senator Domenici, Senator \nKennedy, and others who championed mental health parity. It has been a \nprivilege to be on their team in this cause. It is a silent cause. It \nis one that does not get a lot of ink or much attention because America \nis still opening its mind to this important area of medicine. But we \nhave blazed a new trail, and much of it was because of your leadership, \nsir.\n  For the privilege of serving with you, of serving my State, of \nserving with these colleagues here, I thank God and I thank the State \nof Oregon and I say God bless America.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, may I just add a word to my friend \nfrom Oregon. He has had an extraordinarily successful tenure here. In \nmy view, I would say to my friend from Oregon, you can always look back \non these 12 years with a sense of accomplishment. You have been a major \nplayer in this institution on a variety of different, extremely \nimportant matters that will affect each generation to come. So on \nbehalf of all of our Republican colleagues, and I am sure on behalf of \neveryone in the Senate, I thank you for your extraordinary service.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, before the Senator leaves the floor--I am \nsorry I had to leave, I was called away from my desk--I wanted to say \nthrough the Chair to my friend Gordon Smith that I, of course, watched \nall the election results very closely. But my wife watched one election \nresult, and that was yours, because of the longstanding relationship \nshe has with you and Sharon. The record is very clear of our \nlongstanding friendship and our having had a similar experience with \nour loved ones following suicide.\n  I am sorry I didn't have more time to maybe write something out that \nmay have been more meaningful, but I hope the Senator from Oregon will \nalways understand the affection, respect, and admiration I have not \nonly for what\n\n[[Page S10622]]\n\nyou did in your Senate service but for what you do in your personal \nlife.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Let me say as well, I don't have a prepared statement to \nmake, either, but I want to tell my friend from Oregon how much I have \nenjoyed my work with him over the years on a number of very important \nissues dealing with the issue that the Senator can speak of not only \nwith eloquence but with a great deal of passion, and that is the issue \nof mental illness. We were able to pass, in the waning days of our \nsession, of course, the mental health parity bill. How important that \nwas. Pete Domenici, Ted Kennedy, Paul Wellstone, and others worked on \nit, but Gordon Smith was invaluable in that discussion.\n  I enjoyed immensely my work with him during his two terms in the \nSenate. I will say to my friend, the good Lord is not through with you \nyet. There are a lot of things you can do for our country. You have \ndone a lot already. So I hope you come back often and see us and know \nyou have friends who care about you and cherish you very much. Although \nthere is an aisle here that separates us politically, the aisle doesn't \nexist when it comes to respect and admiration. In those terms, I am \nyour seatmate in terms of my respect for you. I thank you for all you \nhave done.\n\n\n                              John Sununu\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I also rise today to say farewell to the Senator from \nNew Hampshire, John Sununu. Although John is the youngest Senator, he \nis one of our brightest. A reporter once wrote that one of John's \nfellow Senators said that if we were ever to lose John, the rest of us \nwould have to argue over who would be the smartest person in the \nSenate. But as long as we had John around, there was no argument.\n  John impressed people at a young age, earning both a bachelor's and \nmaster's degree in mechanical engineering from MIT and an MBA from \nHarvard. He received real-world experience working as an engineer in \njobs I daresay few of our colleagues could try to explain, myself \nincluded.\n  Then one day a seat from New Hampshire in the House of \nRepresentatives opened up, and John took a good long look at it. John \nhas never been the kind of man who felt he deserved a job on the public \npayroll. He did not crave the power and respect that came with holding \noffice. Yet we are certainly thankful his great State has sent him \nhere.\n  Now, 12 years later, I think we can say with confidence that New \nHampshirites could not have had a more dedicated and principled public \nservant.\n  After 6 years of service in the House, New Hampshire sent John to \nthis Chamber in 2002. To reach the Senate, he had to face an incumbent \nSenator in the primary and then a sitting Governor in the general. \nSince then, John has compiled a record of which every citizen of the \nGranite State can be proud.\n  A student of the free market, John strongly believes lower taxes \npromote growth and expand opportunities. That is why he fought so hard \nto extend the ban on taxes to access the Internet. That tax ban was \nsigned into law, and it protects consumers from taxes on Internet \naccess, e-mail, and instant messaging for 7 years.\n  Just think, if online communications and commerce grow as rapidly \nover the next 7 years as they have over the past 7, John's tax ban will \nnot only have promoted economic growth, it will have spared countless \nsmall businesses and families from a tremendous burden. For that, he \ndeserves all of our thanks.\n  John's voice was one of the loudest to say that we must tackle tough \nissues now, such as entitlements and the future of Social Security. He \nstood up time and again, calling on Congress to reduce Government \nspending, expand telecommunications service to rural areas, and clean \nup air pollution.\n  He also learned firsthand the principle that has made America great, \nour commitment to personal freedom. It is what this country was founded \non. John understands what makes America work is not what we do in this \nChamber but what millions of Americans do every day for their families \nand communities.\n  John is a kind and compassionate man who is a joy to know. I remember \nwell when the senior Senator from Pennsylvania underwent chemotherapy \nin 2005 as part of his treatment for Hodgkin's disease.\n  Like many chemotherapy recipients, the Senator from Pennsylvania's \nhair fell out. In a generous act of solidarity with his colleague, John \nshaved his head. That certainly took more commitment than sending a \nget-well card. But that is John Sununu.\n  John, I am going to miss you. It has been an honor to work by your \nside over these past 6 years. It has been a joy to know you, your \nlovely wife Kitty, and your family.\n  I want them and you to know that we in the Senate admire the depth of \nyour convictions and the strength of your heart. I am sure that \nwhatever the future holds for you, you will be a huge success.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for a \nfew minutes in response to the very kind remarks of the Republican \nleader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. First, it is probably appropriate for me to note that the \nhaircut that I now sport is an echo of that summer a couple of years \nago when I cut my hair, or cut all of my hair, in tribute to the \nsacrifice and the celebration of the final chemotherapy treatment of \nSenator Specter.\n  He underwent another round of chemo this past summer. In the middle \nof the campaign, I did not think it was appropriate to shave my head. \nSo the day after the election, 2 weeks ago, I thought there was some \npent-up demand in my own heart to remember those tough weeks for Arlen \nSpecter. So I was happy to go out and shave my head again. That is why \nit looks a little bit different than it might have during the campaign.\n  The Republican leader has been very kind in his remarks. And I cannot \nhelp but note that I am a little bit too young to have anyone paying \ntribute to my career, as it were, in public service. I believe very \nstrongly that you go out, you find work that you love, a job that \nteaches you great things, and if you have some opportunity to serve \nyour community, your State, your country in public service, then you \nthink seriously about that opportunity.\n  That is how I came to the House and even my work in the Senate. I am \ngoing to have the opportunity to go back and do things that I find \nchallenging being an engineer, coming out of a small business \ncommunity. I know there are a lot of great challenges and opportunities \nthat await. But I also know there may come another time when there is \nan opportunity to serve, and I will always take those opportunities \nvery seriously.\n  On election night, whether you win or lose, you always thank the \npeople who matter most to you. You thank your family, you thank the \npeople of the State of New Hampshire who have been good enough to give \nyou the privilege to serve, but you also thank the people who made your \nwork possible in the Senate, your colleagues. I cannot think of any \ncolleague who has been more supportive and more helpful to me over the \n6 years I have been in the Senate than Senator Mitch McConnell of \nKentucky.\n  The Senator mentioned my work on the Internet tax ban, but the \nSenator from Kentucky did not mention his own work. This was a case \nwhere it helped to have someone with Senator McConnell's leadership and \nexperience because while I waited patiently in the midst of a \nreauthorization of the Amtrak bill, once we had the opportunity to \noffer amendments, I happened to be prepared with an amendment that \nwould ban taxes on Internet access. And the leader from Kentucky just \nhappened to be prepared with a motion to close debate on that amendment \nso we could finally get a vote.\n  While that procedure may sound very arcane to people who may be \nlistening to the Senate debate at home, it was absolutely essential in \nbringing that issue to a successful completion. So only by working \nclosely with the Senator from Kentucky were we able to get that work \ndone on the Internet tax ban. And it is perhaps the work that I am most \nproud of. I think it is the work I have been able to do in the Senate \nthat will probably have the most\n\n[[Page S10623]]\n\nlasting economic impact. It is important to leave behind a record that \nyou are proud of, but it is also maybe even more important to leave \nbehind many fond memories of that work, fond memories of colleagues \nwith whom you were able to spend time and, of course, fond memories of \nthe friendships you were able to form, both with members of your own \nparty and with those on the other side of the aisle.\n  Perhaps what I am most proud of overall is that the pieces of \nlegislation I was able to sponsor and pass, whether it was the Internet \ntax ban, civil liberties protection that we added under the PATRIOT \nAct, the Wilderness Act that protects 25,000 acres of the White \nMountain National Forest, were all bipartisan pieces of legislation. \nThat means a lot to me.\n  I think it will serve me well in any future endeavors I undertake in \npublic service. I thank Senator McConnell, the Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, let me just say to my friend from New \nHampshire, it has been a real privilege to serve with somebody of your \nintellect and ability. I know you are going to be a huge success. You \nhave, as we discussed, a lot of your life left. I know you are going to \nbe a huge success in the coming years, and I am looking forward to \nseeing more of you in the future.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/11/19/senate-section/article/S10623-1", "month": "11", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10623]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   UNANIMOUS-CONSENT REQUEST--S. 3684\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenate proceed to the immediate consideration of a bill I have at the \ndesk which is the text of title VII of S. 3689 regarding the auto sales \ntax deduction, and further that the bill be read a third time and \npassed, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, with no \nintervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SUNUNU. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. It is my understanding I still have the floor?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has the floor.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Boy, am I sorry that is the last act of John Sununu in \nthe Senate. I hope it is not the last thing. I feel so badly about \npeople objecting to me bringing this up. Mine is a bipartisan bill that \nI thought maybe I would win, maybe I would lose, but at least we could \nbring it up and debate it and discuss it and vote on it.\n  My bill was a straight-forward bill. My bill was to help save jobs in \nthe automobile industry, from manufacturing, sales to service, to the \nlittle people who are the bookkeepers in our communities.\n  My bill would give a tax deduction to someone who would buy a car in \nthese 6 weeks and they would be able to take a deduction of interest \nand sales tax. The total cost of my bill was $8 billion. But the cost \nof not doing my bill is going to be horrific. It is going to be \nabsolutely horrific. I cannot get over how these economic conservatives \nhave their ostrich heads in the quicksand of our economy.\n  You know what is going to happen when our automobile industry goes \ndown. Well, let them go. Well, I will tell you, we are going to lose \n$156 billion over the next 3 years in lost taxes, unemployment, and \nhealth care assistance.\n  We are facing the possibility that 3 million people could lose their \njobs. But oh, no, we object. We object to debate. We object to \ndiscussion. We object to taking our ideas and putting them into the \nsunshine and being able to do what I thought you do in a democracy, \nvote ideas up or down.\n  If I lose my bill in a vote, that is the way democracy works. But to \nmove it through a parliamentary maneuver of something called, ``I \nobject,'' I object to the objection. I have no idea why anyone would \nobject to bringing up an idea that has bipartisan support to see if we \ncould stimulate demand in the automobile industry.\n  Well, I tell you what. Senator Barb Mikulski is not the only one who \nobjects. The American people object. And that is what they did when \nthey walked into that voting booth on November 4 and voted for change. \nThey said: Yes, we can. They were objecting to what goes on in this \ninstitution and what has been going on in the White House for the last \n8 years.\n  They said: I object. And they voted. They objected and then they \nvoted. And they object by their vote. There is a reason a political \ntsunami hit this institution. It is because of this continual way of \nthrowing sand in the gears of democracy. So they said: I object. That \nis what the people said.\n  So we can go through these parliamentary shenanigans. We can delay \nwhat we could do in the next 48 hours to get our economy going. But, \noh, no.\n  We are going to do it. The question is, are we going to do it today \nor are we going to do it 8 weeks from today? The longer we wait, the \ndeeper and more prolonged the recession will be. Right now we could \nbegin to not only turn the page but begin to turn the economy around.\n  So those are the rules of the Senate. I signed up for the Senate, so \nI take the rules as they are. But I will tell you, I stand with the \nAmerican people. I object. And I object to the objection. I am going to \nkeep fighting this until we leave. It is my view we shouldn't leave \nuntil we pass legislation to get this economy going. If we cannot do it \nthis week, come back next week because the real turkeys will not be in \nour oven. The real turkeys will be close at hand.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/11/19/senate-section/article/S10623-2", "month": "11", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10623-S10625]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   UNANIMOUS-CONSENT REQUEST--S. 3656\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I inform the Republican leader, I had \narranged to do a unanimous-consent request when the Senator from Iowa \ncould be on the floor.\n  I ask unanimous consent the Finance Committee be discharged from \nfurther consideration of S. 3656, the Senate proceed to its immediate \nconsideration, the bill be read a third time and passed, and the motion \nto reconsider be laid upon the table, with no intervening action or \ndebate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I reserve the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, throughout the years, the Committee on \nFinance has worked to safeguard and improve the programs under its \njurisdiction, including the Medicare and Medicaid Programs. The Finance \nCommittee has a unique expertise on these programs and is the only \ncommittee in a position to assess the possible effects of individual \nchanges on all Social Security programs as a whole. Accordingly, it is \nessential that any legislative proposals impacting these programs be \nconsidered by the full Senate only after the Finance Committee conducts \na thorough analysis of the issues involved and the potential solutions.\n  I would like to bring up one example of how this bill needs scrutiny. \nThere is a provision buried in here that would allow California to \nescape its responsibilities to ensure that illegal aliens are not \ngetting Medicaid benefits to which they are not entitled. Do the \nAmerican people support giving Medicaid to illegal aliens? I don't \nthink so. Simply bypassing the committee process with legislation on \ncomplex issues runs contrary to how this body should function. In fact, \nas my friend from New York is aware, Congress already had extensive \ndebate and enacted a Medicare bill already earlier this year. That bill \nwas authored by the chairman of the Finance Committee. So the Senate \nand the full Congress have already had extensive Medicare debate this \nyear. The Senator from New York, as a member of the Finance Committee, \nhad ample opportunity to raise the issues earlier this year that he now \nraises in a bill he wants to bring up right now. So regardless of the \nmerits of the Senator's proposal, I believe that ship has set sail.\n  I have a more extensive statement on the provisions themselves. Some \nof them, I want the Senator from New York to understand, I actually \nsupport, and I oppose some, obviously. Perhaps we can work together on \nsome of these issues where we agree, if the Senator is interested. \nToday, however, I am forced to object to the Senator's consent request.\n  Notwithstanding the significant jurisdictional and process issues I \njust\n\n[[Page S10624]]\n\nraised, I would also like to note that there are several provisions in \nthe bill I strongly support. However, there are several provisions in \nthis bill that I oppose at this time and do not believe the Finance \nCommittee has given proper consideration through hearings and \ninvestigations.\n  One of the provisions in S. 3656 that I support would delay \nimplementing provisions of a proposed CMS rule that would change \nconditions of participation for rural health clinics and decertify \nrural health clinics that are no longer in nonurbanized areas. It would \nalso delay proposed changes to the existing payment methodology for \nrural health clinics and federally qualified health centers. While I am \nvery concerned about the proposed CMS rule and its impact on rural \nhealth centers, RHCs, unfortunately I cannot support this legislation \nwhich is within the jurisdiction of the Finance Committee but which has \nnot been given any consideration by the committee.\n  The CMS proposed rule would impose new location requirements for RHCs \nand require that clinics be located in a nonurbanized area, as defined \nby the U.S. Census Bureau, as well as meet shortage area designation \nrequirements. Only new RHCs applying for the program are currently \nrequired to meet these criteria but the CMS proposal would extend these \nrequirements to already certified RHCs. According to CMS, about 500 of \nthe approximately 3,700 RHCs operating today may not meet these \nrequirements.\n  Iowa is currently in the throes of a growing shortage of physicians, \nespecially in the more rural areas of the State, due to inequitable \ngeographic adjustments in physician payment that result in Iowa \nphysicians receiving some of the lowest Medicare reimbursement in the \ncountry even though they provide some of the highest quality care. \nThese geographic payment disparities, which discriminate against rural \nareas, have further exacerbated the problems of rural access to care.\n  The CMS proposed rule could have a severe adverse impact on a number \nof rural health clinics in Iowa, including many located in counties \nthat have been declared disaster areas from the severe flooding Iowa \nsuffered earlier this year. Rural clinics in Iowa also could be \nseverely impacted by the CMS proposed payment changes since RHC costs \nin Iowa and other States are already higher than the existing Medicare \nreimbursement cap. If the CMS rule is finalized as proposed, rural \nhealth clinics in Iowa and elsewhere may be forced to close their \ndoors, even though they have served rural populations very well for \nmany years, leaving Iowa with fewer physicians and some patients with \nlittle access to primary care and other critical medical services.\n  This bill would prevent the application of a CMS policy to phase-out \na payment adjustment for indirect medical education, IME, under the \nMedicare capital Inpatient Prospective Payment System, IPPS. Currently, \nteaching hospitals receive this upward payment adjustment under the \ncapital IPPS. CMS announced in the fiscal year 2008, Medicare Hospital \nIPPS Final Rule that they would begin to phase out the IME adjustment \nfor capital IPPS in fiscal year 2009.\n  As the former chair and currently the ranking member of the Senate \nFinance Committee, it has long been one of my priorities to ensure \nMedicare payments are both accurate and equitable. I question whether \nthis bill would further this goal, which many of us share.\n  The appropriateness of the IME capital IPPS adjustment has been \nanalyzed not only by CMS, but also the Medicare Payment Advisory \nCommission, MedPAC, which advises Congress on Medicare payment issues. \nCMS has documented relatively high and continued positive margins for \nteaching hospitals under the capital IPPS compared to nonteaching \nhospitals. In fact, from 1998 through 2006, teaching hospitals had an \naggregate capital IPPS margin of 11.2 percent while nonteaching \nhospitals had an aggregate capital IPPS margin of -0.8 percent.\n  Based on these figures, many, including myself, question the \nappropriateness of this payment adjustment. This is a case in point of \nwhy legislative proposals such as this must first go through the \ncommittee process.\n  S. 3656 puts a moratorium on a CMS rule regarding Medicaid payments \nfor hospital outpatient services. Early this year, Congress placed \nmoratoriums on six other CMS Medicaid regulations. Just as I opposed \nthose moratoriums, I strongly oppose this one as well. The Finance \nCommittee has not held the first hearing as to why this action is \nnecessary. We have not considered whether payments currently being made \nare not consistent with the statute. Medicaid is a critical program for \nchildren, pregnant women, the disabled, and the elderly. We have a \nresponsibility to the people who depend on the program to make sure \nthat funds are being appropriately spent. This moratorium is not \nconsistent with that responsibility.\n  This bill also intervenes in a dispute by CMS and the State of \nCalifornia. The State of California has been seeking approval of an \nextension of their family planning waiver for 6 years. For 6 years, CMS \nhas been pushing California to improve their collection of Social \nSecurity numbers and citizenship documentation for women enrolled in \nthe program. This bill essentially requires CMS to approve of the \nextension of California's waiver without requiring California to do \nanything further to improve their process of ensuring people who \nreceive benefits are actually eligible for those benefits.\n  I would also like to point out that a comprehensive Medicare bill \nwritten by the Chairman of the Finance Committee was passed by the \nSenate this summer. One can presume that the proposals in this bill \nwere considered and rejected for inclusion in that Medicare bill.\n  I understand that legislation is often the art of compromise. We \ncan't always get everything we want in every bill and keep everything \nwe dislike out. It is a balance. However, I think both in terms of \nprocess and policy, this bill does not sufficiently achieve a balance I \nthink is necessary and I must, therefore, object to its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I introduced this bill in October in \nresponse to overwhelming concerns New York health care providers have \nabout three devastating health regulations that the Bush administration \nis pushing.\n  My bill would put a 6-month delay on the Medicare Hospital Capital \nIME payment policy to teaching hospitals, a 6-month delay on the now-\nfinal Medicaid Outpatient Clinic regulation, and a 6-month delay on the \nMedicare Hospice rule--three regulations that affect the heart and soul \nof our health care system--the facilities and health providers that \ntake care of all Americans, rich or poor, rural or urban.\n  Given the urgent challenges we face in our economic health, now is \nnot the time to be cutting hospitals or clinics that serve our physical \nhealth. We should be making health care more effective and efficient--\nnot slashing reimbursement and running these providers out of business.\n  The new Medicare Hospital Capital Indirect Medical Education, IME, \npayment policy is a disaster for teaching hospitals. It went into \neffect on October 1 and will be fully implemented in 2010.\n  This new policy runs counter to what works in American medicine. The \nMedicare program has long served the public good by funding the \ntraining of new doctors in our academic medical centers and teaching \nhospitals, using IME payments.\n  Across the Nation in large and small communities there is a shortage \nof physicians--from primary care to surgeons. We rely on our Nation's \nacademic medical centers, 13 of which are in my State, and teaching \nhospitals to train new physicians.\n  The new policy eliminates critical funding that supports teaching.\n  The total cost of this new policy to New York's teaching hospitals \nwould be $62 million when it is fully implemented in 2010. The total \nfor all U.S. hospitals is $380 million.\n  Let me illustrate what these cuts mean to New York hospitals: Albany \nMedical Center Hospital, $1.2 million; Kaleida Health in Buffalo, $1.3 \nmillion, Montefiore Medical Center, $3.7 million; Strong Memorial \nHospital, $1.6 million; Stony Brook University Hospital, $1.6 million; \nBassett Hospital in Cooperstown, $426,000; and Coney Island Hospital, \n$565,722.\n\n[[Page S10625]]\n\n  These facilities are the same ones in my State who provide the lion's \nshare of uncompensated care to the uninsured.\n  One of the hardest hit hospitals in my State is Mt. Sinai Medical \nCenter in Manhattan. They stand to lose $4.1 million by 2010.\n  This lost funding means Mt. Sinai Medical Center will be forced to \ntake cost cutting steps:\n  First, delay completion of their inpatient electronic medical record \nrollout; second, they won't be able to expand their already crowded \nemergency room that provides over 100,000 patient visits a year; and \nthird, they will scale back many free medical screenings and other \nprograms for patients.\n  These are not the actions we want hospitals to take.\n  Hospitals need our help. The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, \nMedPAC--which is a nonpartisan group--has said that in 2006, hospitals' \nMedicare margins nationwide were in the red at negative 4.8 percent.\n  In New York in 2006, rural hospitals were hit the hardest by low \nMedicare reimbursements with even lower margins of negative 8.2 \npercent.\n  After 7 consecutive years of overall negative margins, the hospitals \nin my State did little better than break even in 2006. It doesn't make \nsense to me that we would gut a source of training for high-paying jobs \nin this country at a time when we are bleeding jobs.\n  This is not just a New York issue. In July, 51 Senators signed a \nbipartisan letter to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, \nCMS, that opposed implementation of the capital IME. We need to pass my \nbill so that these cuts don't hurt all U.S. hospitals.\n  Now I want to speak briefly about the Medicaid Outpatient Clinic \nRegulation that my bill places a 6-month moratorium on.\n  For months I fought with CMS about this regulation. Unfortunately, \nthey finalized it last week.\n  But, I am pleased that in the final version free-standing health \nclinics were saved from massive cuts. There were many clinics in New \nYork that were saved from either closing their doors or saying no to \ntheir patients.\n  I want to talk about Ed, a 62-year-old Buffalo resident, who can only \nmove his head due to his cerebral palsy. With the help of a free-\nstanding clinic in Buffalo, called Aspire, Ed learned to operate his \npower wheelchair with his chin.\n  Even more amazing he can operate a computer using his chin. Ed spent \n5 years mastering desktop publishing and then formed his own successful \nbusiness.\n  If free-standing clinics were included in the final regulation, Ed \ncould not attend Aspire of WNY's wheelchair clinic, where physical, \noccupational and speech therapists customize all sorts of things for \nhim. Without that service, Aspire tells me that he would be completely \nimmobile and not as independent.\n  Let me discuss another New Yorker that the Buffalo-based Aspire \nClinic helped. In 1998, Aspire wanted a woman named Alice to have a \ncolonoscopy. When she did, it was revealed that she had colon cancer. \nBut luckily they found it in time and she had surgery to remove the \ncancer and now, 10 years later, she is doing fine.\n  Alice is just one of hundreds of individuals who receive primary \nmedical care through these essential primary care clinics.\n  Enable, a Syracuse agency that serves children and adults with \ndisabilities, told my office that they would have to stop providing \nphysical and occupational therapy to more than 300 clients on Medicaid \nif the Rule had included freestanding clinics.\n  I wish CMS hadn't made this regulation final, but at least it isn't \nas bad as it could be. We will know the extent of pain that other \nclinics and hospital outpatient services may face on December 8, when \nthe rule must be implemented.\n  Therefore, I hope that the Senate will pass the PATH Act. As we have \nheard, there are just too many terrible cuts underway in health care, \nand we need to be doing all we can right now to stop the bleeding.\n  I understand my colleague has objected. That is unfortunate. To wait \nanother 3 months or 6 months at a time when our economy is in such dire \nshape will do severe damage to health care throughout the country. In \nmy State of New York, for instance, the new Medicare Hospital Capital \nIndirect Medical Education payment policy is a disaster for teaching \nhospitals. It runs counter to what works in American medicine. It \naffects large and small communities. We have a desperate shortage of \nphysicians, from primary care to surgeons. The country relies on \nacademic medical centers. This clobbers them at a time when it should \nnot have happened. Many of us believe this regulation was not within \nthe purview of CMS to enact. They went ahead and did it. I would hope \nthat maybe my colleague will reconsider. We will return to this issue \nwhen we come back in January, but some damage, unfortunately, will be \ndone.\n  I understand why my colleague has objected. I regret it. There was no \ntime to move in the Finance Committee because this regulation didn't \ntake effect until very recently, having many bad affects. I will work \nhard and not rest until we overturn the regulation.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, with the daunting challenges we face on \nour road to economic recovery--and that will come; it is a question of \nwhen--there is no reason to wait for a new year, a new Congress and a \nnew President. We could vote now. We could take action now. We can't \nsolve our economic challenges with one vote, but we could get started. \nSo I say, why wait. Every day that goes by, thousands of Americans lose \ntheir jobs. Thousands of homes are lost. Scores of companies file for \nbankruptcy. So why don't we staunch the bleeding, stop some of the \npain, and begin to turn things around? We have before the Senate a \ncomprehensive economic stimulus plan worked out with the Appropriations \nCommittee, the Finance Committee, and the Agriculture Committee, that \nwe could pass and we should pass. I wish to express my appreciation to \nthe members of the Appropriations, Finance, and Agriculture Committees. \nThey have worked very hard to put this package together under the \nleadership of Senators Byrd, Baucus, and Harkin.\n  What do I mean by ``comprehensive''? Instead of addressing just one \npart of our economic crisis, this legislation takes many steps that \neconomists agree we need.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the consideration \nof Calendar No. 1122, S. 3689; that the bill be read a third time, \npassed, and the motion to reconsider be laid on the table, and there be \nno intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, we have a matter on which the objection \nwas made. I did not cover it all, of course, in that matter. We have \nsignificant things in that piece of legislation that were objected to \ndealing with infrastructure; unemployment benefits; FMAP, which is the \nmatter to give some fiscal relief to our States; and it would give help \nto the auto industry. So this is the type of issue on which I wish we \ncould move forward. I understand my colleagues. They are not going to \naccept this.\n  I think the provision we have dealing with taking the money out of \nthe financial bailout that we have, that the White House has, the \nTreasury Department has--I have talked on the floor over the last 2 \ndays about that. There is no need to belabor that point. But it is too \nbad we could not move forward on that basis.\n  It is my understanding Senators Levin and Bond are going to try to \ncome up with some alternative proposal. When they come up with that, I \nwould be happy to see if there is any way we can move procedurally. \nThat is not going to be easy with what is going\n\n[[Page S10626]]\n\non in the House and, actually, what is going on here. But I will confer \nwith my counterpart, Senator McConnell, and we will do what we can to \nmove forward.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/11/19/senate-section/article/S10626-1", "month": "11", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10626-S10627]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       UNANIMOUS-CONSENT REQUESTS\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that we move \nforward on this bill, S. 3689--there is a provision in that dealing \nwith what we call FMAP--that the FMAP provision be taken out, that it \nbe considered as separate legislation, be read three times and passed, \nthe motion to reconsider be laid on the table, and there be no \nintervening action or debate.\n  The reason that is so very important is that FMAP is something that \nevery State--every State, all 50--is in desperate need of. No part of \nour country has proven immune from our economic struggles. We are all \nsharing the heavy burden of these difficult times. But few places are \nsuffering, though, more than we are in Nevada.\n  Budget shortfalls in Nevada are causing deep cuts in bedrock programs \nthe Government must provide, programs that help and protect children, \nsenior citizens, and people with disabilities.\n  The State of Nevada has been forced to cap enrollment in Nevada \nCheck-Up, our form of children's health insurance. The State recently \nhad to institute cuts to provider reimbursement. What is worse, these \ncuts will not end here unless we act to provide fiscal relief by \nincreasing the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage; that is, FMAP.\n  What are the consequences of inaction? It was reported in the media \nthis weekend that due to the provider rate cut, University Medical \nCenter in Las Vegas, our public hospital, is discontinuing outpatient \ncancer treatment. And that is not just for Medicaid patients, it is for \nall patients. It is not clear if all those patients will be able to \nafford chemotherapy elsewhere, but it is pretty clear they will not be \nable to.\n  Low-income children who need orthopedic treatment will have to leave \nLas Vegas altogether for services elsewhere. They will likely have to \nleave the State.\n  There is more to come. The cuts are not over. This is the way it is \nin many States around the country. The budget shortfalls are deep. When \nStates have to cut provider reimbursement for some of the things I have \noutlined, they have real difficulties in making the safety net not be \none that has big holes in it. States have found no choice but to look \nat cutting services such as mental health and cutting actual people \nfrom the program, adding to the ranks of the insured at the worst \npossible time.\n  We have been working in the Senate to provide help. The stimulus bill \nwe introduced includes a temporary 8-percent FMAP increase to stave off \nthese cuts. It will not fix the problem, but it may make a difference \nin ensuring that our children are not without the care they need. I \nhope we can take that step.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, reserving the right to object, this \nis a spending measure of $37.8 billion which has not been considered by \nthe Finance Committee. We should be asking the States to pay it back. \nWe should require the States to agree to not raise taxes. For all of \nthose reasons, Madam President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I have one final consent request on which \nI would like to move forward. This is the matter dealing with \nautomobiles. We know the issue before this body. There have been \nspeeches given the last several days about where the automobile \nindustry is. We have watched on national TV the congressional hearings \nthat have taken place on this side of the Capitol and on the other side \nof the Capitol. We need to try to figure out some way to move forward.\n  We believe the best way to move forward is taking the money, as I \nhave indicated, out of the so-called TARP money. I do not believe we \nneed the legislation. I think--well, I don't know. I have talked to \nSecretary Paulson twice today. He knows he has authority to take money \nout of that; he just does not want to do it.\n  So I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nconsideration of a bill I have at the desk, which is the text of title \nVI of S. 3689 regarding automotive industry assistance; that the bill \nbe read a third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid on \nthe table, and there be no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, reserving the right to object, the longer \nthis legislation has been lying around, the more objections have been \nheard to it. So, yes, I do object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, the distinguished majority leader was kind \nenough to mention the fact that several of us on our side have been \nworking with leading Members on his side of the aisle to come up with a \ncompromise proposal that would come to the aid of the auto companies \nwhich are facing a very serious situation, without mentioning specific \nones or others, but to say this is a critical time to move to prevent \nperhaps the bankruptcy or the disappearance of a major auto company, \nwhich would cause chaos in our country. Over 3 million jobs are related \nto the auto industry--from the auto assembly plants, to the auto \ndealerships, to the parts suppliers.\n  So we have been working on a bipartisan basis. On my side of the \naisle, Senator Voinovich and I have been working with others on the \nDemocratic side. We took the basic construct of the measure the \nmajority leader had introduced. We took the money out of a previously \npassed bill, which would not cause as much concern down Pennsylvania \nAvenue, and we provide that the money will go back into that program as \nit is returned.\n  In my view, it is essential we work something out. I will tell the \nmajority leader we have made great progress. We are down to the point \nnow where wording challenges are about the only remaining things to \ndeal with. I strongly believe it is in the interest of the country, \nparticularly all of those families whose jobs depend upon the auto \nindustry, and the States, the local governments, and the Federal \nGovernment to move something forward.\n  So I ask unanimous consent that at a time to be determined on \nThursday, November 20, the Senate proceed to the immediate \nconsideration of a bill to be introduced by Senators Bond and Voinovich \nand others; I further ask that there be no amendments in order, with 2 \nhours of debate equally divided, and following the use or yielding back \nof the time, the bill be read a third time and the Senate proceed to a \nvote on passage, and that if there are not 60 votes in the affirmative, \nthe bill be placed on the Senate calendar.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, Madam President, we have had \nno hearings. We have no text. I know my friend, Senator Bond, is a man \nof faith. I think I am too. But this is carrying it a little too far. \nWe do not know anything about this. I look forward to a piece of \nlegislation we can look at. Hopefully, it can be done tonight or \ntomorrow, and we will be happy to look at it.\n  I have had many conversations today and yesterday with the senior \nSenator from the State of Kentucky, Mr. McConnell, and we understand \nthe importance of this issue. We will try to work to move forward on \nit. But I want everyone to understand, no matter how hard we work, how \nhard we try, the House of Representatives is going home tomorrow. OK. \nThey are leaving.\n  I understand the importance. But I would hope that in addition to \nunderstanding the importance, we have to face reality. The reality is, \nwe have tried a number of different approaches.\n  I will be happy to look at the approach my friend from Missouri has. \nHe is a hard-working Senator. I understand how hard he works. He is a \nreal advocate for doing what he thinks is appropriate for his State and \nour country.\n  Senator Levin and I have had hours of conversation regarding this \nissue. Every conversation I have with him he mentions the name of the \nSenator from Missouri. So I understand what this is all about, but, \nrecognizing we have had no hearings, we have no legislation, I object.\n\n[[Page S10627]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                  Auto Manufacturing Industry Bailout\n\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the pending discussion \nand debate in the Senate about subsidies to the auto manufacturers and \nwhether passing a large bailout subsidy package for the auto \nmanufacturers is a good idea. Earlier this afternoon I objected to a \nunanimous consent request by Senator Mikulski and she responded to that \nobjection by noting that she certainly hoped that objecting to a \nbailout package for auto manufacturers wasn't the last thing I did in \nthe Senate, given that my term is going to be expiring and I am going \nto be retiring from the Senate. Well, it won't be the last thing I do. \nIf nothing else, the last thing I will do is to explain why her \nlegislation was such a terrible idea to the people of New Hampshire who \nelected me and to the American people whom I think I have an obligation \nto serve in making sure that their interests are protected, that their \nwallets are protected, and that we act with a commitment to fiscal \nresponsibility.\n  We don't need to be providing subsidies, special benefits or \nprotection to individual businesses, whether they are auto \nmanufacturers or any other business. This is wrong for a large number \nof reasons. To be sure, no one is happy about the fact that our country \nis in a recession, that Europe is in a recession, that we have a global \nslowdown that will affect hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of \nlives across the United States and across the world. But by providing \nsubsidies to the auto manufacturers, we do several things that are \nfundamentally wrong--bad for our economy, bad for taxpayers, bad for \nconsumers.\n  First, quite frankly, we reward bad decisions that have been made by \nthese firms themselves. The problems within the auto industry are \nlargely the making of those in the auto industry: management choices, \nproduction of models that consumers choose not to buy, legacy costs, \ncontracts, health care, pensions. We all understand that within the \neconomic slowdown there has been a significant drop in the number of \ncars being manufactured, but these businesses were losing money well \nbefore the current downturn. By stepping forward now to provide them \nwith $25 billion or $50 billion, depending on which piece of \nlegislation we would be considering and voting on, we, quite frankly, \nwould be taking money from taxpayers across the country and rewarding \nthose poor decisions that have been made by the manufacturers \nthemselves.\n  Second, this would set a bad precedent. There are many businesses \nacross America that are dealing with tough times, a slowdown in their \ngrowth prospects. They have had to deal with layoffs. They have seen a \nsignificant slowdown in construction spending or consumer spending. It \nis affecting every corner of our economy. If we set the precedent of \nstepping forward with $25 billion in subsidies for auto manufacturers, \nevery other business and industry in America would be looking for the \nsame kind of treatment from the Federal Government. That is simply not \nin the taxpayers' interests. It is certainly not fair to the average \ntaxpayer. It is not fair to those taxpayers who work for companies that \nwon't get that kind of special treatment. Any time the Federal \nGovernment starts putting a significant amount of resources--$1 \nbillion, $10 billion, $25 billion--into a particular firm or industry \nwe distort the marketplace. So we would be rewarding bad decisions. We \nwould be setting a bad precedent.\n  Finally, we would be placing taxpayers at even greater risk. We need \nto be honest about the impact of giving $25 billion to the auto \nmanufacturers in order to sustain their unprofitable operations. Many \nobservers have suggested that $25 billion isn't nearly enough, $50 \nbillion probably isn't enough to stave off bankruptcy. So when these \nfirms ultimately did have to file for bankruptcy or when the losses \nmounted over the next 6 months or 12 months or 18 months and the firms \nneeded additional capital, where would they turn? Back to the taxpayer. \nSo the expectation would be--and I think the likelihood would be--that \nthe $25 billion or $50 billion provided today would simply be a \ndownpayment on even greater losses and greater exposure to the \ntaxpayers in the future.\n  Now, the proponents of this legislation have said a number of things. \nFirst and foremost, they have talked about the number of jobs that \nwould be affected. No one relishes the idea of higher unemployment and \njob losses that have already begun in this current recession. But there \nare many businesses and industries across America that employ hundreds \nof thousands of people, that employ even more than the auto \nmanufacturing segment. The\n\n[[Page S10628]]\n\nthree largest technology-based firms in the country employ nearly twice \nas many people as the auto manufacturers. The three largest firms in \nthe financial services industry employ hundreds of thousands more than \nthe auto manufacturers do. These businesses and industries such as the \nauto manufacturers have their own customers and suppliers and vendors \nand contractors who would also be affected by the slowdown or by \nlayoffs at those businesses.\n  We care about the auto manufacturers. We care about manufacturing. We \ncare about every job in our economy, because each job is important to \nthat worker, their family, and their dependents. But we can't be \nproviding unique benefits, unique treatment to one business at the \nexpense of others and at the expense of taxpayers.\n  A second argument that has been made is that since we passed a \nfinancial stabilization package a month ago, we should be willing to \nkeep passing additional subsidy or bailout legislation. I think we need \nto understand that taking the action we took when the credit markets in \nthe United States and across the world froze was action taken only with \nthe greatest imaginable reluctance, and it was only taken to protect \naccess to credit for a home loan or car loan, a small business loan \nthat our economy needs to function every single day. Moreover, only \naction of the Federal Government--and the European governments as \nwell--only that action could provide the capital or had the capacity to \nprovide the capital necessary to enable those credit markets to \nfunction normally again. And they have begun to function more normally \ntoday.\n  Now, normal functioning of credit markets doesn't guarantee economic \ngrowth in this quarter or next quarter, but it does prevent a collapse \nof the credit system that our economy needs to operate on a daily \nbasis.\n  So I think the arguments that there are jobs at stake in the auto \nindustry is a false argument, because there are jobs at stake in every \ncorner of our economy. The argument that an economic recovery package \npassed last month is justification for these kinds of subsidies to \nother manufacturers is mistaken as well, because that was legislation \ndesigned to protect every family, every business in America, given the \nunique crisis we have had in our credit markets.\n  Our economy is built on the idea of freedom, transparency, and \nentrepreneurship. I think we should never forget that. We have the \nfreest economy in the world. If you look at the freest and most open \neconomies in the world and compare them to their more heavily regulated \ncounterparts, in every measure, free and open, transparent markets \nperformed better than their more heavily regulated counterparts. I \nthink there is a lesson here: that we should avoid Government \nintervention wherever possible. We should minimize the cost of \nregulation wherever possible. Of course, we should avoid legislation \nsuch as that being proposed for the auto manufacturers that would \nintervene and subsidize bad economics, poor performance, and bad \nmanagement choices.\n  I hope this legislation will be dealt with in an appropriate way. I \nhope my colleagues will see the value in protecting the taxpayers by \nopposing this kind of intervention, this kind of unnecessary subsidy. A \nlot of people have made the observation that a failure to pass subsidy \nlegislation would make bankruptcy for the auto manufacturers more \nlikely, and that may well be the case. But the bankruptcy protection \nprocess is designed to allow firms, large and small, to reorganize, to \nrestructure, to establish a better, more effective business model, a \nbetter system for producing the kinds of products customers want, for \ndelivering the services our economy needs, improving efficiency and, in \ndoing so, provide strong, well-paying jobs that are secure for as many \nof their employees as possible and for an employment base that suits \nthe marketplace. But when you have a business model that has been \nproven to be as problematic as those of the large three auto \nmanufacturers, sometimes bankruptcy protection is the best possible \nmethodology for restructuring, reorganizing, and putting together a \nfirm that is more competitive and stronger and healthier for the long \nterm.\n  I appreciate the opportunity to speak on these issues. I think it is \nimportant that we protect our economy to the greatest extent possible \nby keeping taxes on capital low, by creating a Tax Code and a \nregulatory structure that encourages manufacturing and investment, that \nrewards entrepreneurship, but none of these things requires that we \nsingle out one firm or one business over another for a handout or a \nsubsidy at the cost of the taxpayers.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Pryor). The Senator from Colorado is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, what is the regular order of business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is considering the motion to \nproceed to H.R. 6867.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Identity Theft\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, first, I wish to thank the Senator from \nNew Hampshire who just spoke for his leadership in the Congress, and it \nhas been a pleasure serving with him. I also will be retiring, but one \nof the people I will miss is John Sununu from New Hampshire, because I \nthink he has contributed a lot to the process.\n  I wish to also take a moment to bring to your attention and the \nattention of my colleagues an issue I have worked hard to address in \nlegislation I proposed this Congress. The issue is identity theft. I \nwas hopeful Congress would pass legislation that addresses the problem \nof unauthorized foreign workers stealing Social Security numbers and \nthen using the numbers to obtain employment and then, eventually, \naccruing Social Security benefits.\n  Almost 2 years ago, I introduced S. 699. It is legislation that \nfacilitated the sharing of existing information among government \nagencies in instances where the infrastructure, if shared, could expose \ncases of identity fraud. Unfortunately, my bill stalled in committee \nand has not since received further action. Congress's failure to enact \nsuch legislation is disappointing, because it has left in place \nexisting law which is ineffectual in deterring unauthorized foreign \nworkers from stealing the identity of citizens--that is Americans--and \nnationals. Individuals continue to engage in this activity in violation \nof our criminal laws as well as our immigration laws while also \ndefrauding Social Security and citizens.\n  Identity theft continues to plague our country at an alarming rate.\n  If there was ever any doubt, let last week's discovery--in Weld \nCounty, Colorado--of 1,300 stolen Social Security numbers by illegal \nimmigrants serve as a reminder of the pervasiveness of this problem. A \nsingle additional case of an unauthorized worker stealing a U.S. \ncitizen's identity is one case too many, for it is well within the \nFederal Government's ability to stop this rampant problem. If my \nlegislation had been enacted, the 1,300 illegal aliens using fraudulent \nSocial Security numbers and resulting in more than $2.6 million in \nstolen tax dollars would have caught the attention of law enforcement \nmuch sooner.\n  Last week, after an intense and lengthy investigation by the Weld \nCounty Sheriff s Office, the Greeley Police Department, and District \nAttorney Ken Buck's office, a series of arrests began in a case that is \nfar-reaching and has national implications.\n  What is upsetting is that Congress has had foresight about the \ndevastating effects of identity theft. We have also been educated, \nnotably by Secretary Chertoff, of the susceptibility for citizens' \nidentities to be stolen by aliens that are in the United States \nillegally and without authorization to work. I introduced legislation \nthat recognizes the compelling need to modify the law in order to allow \nour Government both to enforce immigration laws and also protect the \nvictims of identity theft. Under the current law, by the time identity \ntheft is discovered, the damage has already been done. For instance, an \n84-year-old Grand Junction woman was deemed ineligible for Federal \nhousing assistance because her Social Security number was being used at \na variety of jobs in Denver, making her income too high to qualify. \nSeveral individuals had been using her I.D. number, and each \nindividual's salary was then being reported to Social Security. As a \nresult, her income was recorded much higher than\n\n[[Page S10629]]\n\nwhat she was receiving. If the discrepancy had been discovered earlier, \nbefore she had applied for her housing grants, there would have been an \nopportunity to address the disparity before she became a victim twice \nover.\n  What is incredible is that the Federal Government, specifically the \nInternal Revenue Service, is enabling this. Under current policy, the \nIRS is under no obligation to share information with other agencies \nupon the discovery of a Social Security number being used with multiple \nnames or in the case where it is discovered that an individual has more \nthan one person reporting earnings for him or her during a single tax \nyear.\n  I propose to allow the Commissioner of Social Security to share \ninformation with the Secretary of Homeland Security, where such \ninformation is likely to assist in discovering identity theft, Social \nSecurity misuse or violations of immigration law. It is worth noting \nSecretary Chertoff supports my proposal, believing it is a practical \nsolution that overcomes the current limitations on information sharing.\n  Despite the force of these arguments supporting legislation that \ntears down the wall that prevents the sharing of existing information \namong Government agencies, Congress has so far rejected Secretary \nChertoff's call for a legislative solution.\n  The 1,300 cases of suspected stolen identities exposed in Weld County \nalone were brought to light after authorities discovered that an \nillegal immigrant accused of stealing and using a man's Social Security \nnumber to get jobs, loans, and other services, had also been filing and \nreceiving tax returns from the Federal Government. It did not take long \nfor investigators to come to the realization that this particular \nillegal immigrant's suspected use of stolen identity was not an \nisolated case. As it turns out, these 1,300 other illegal immigrants \nfiled tax returns using the same tax preparer based in Greeley. This is \none tax preparer handling 1,300 fraudulent returns. Take a moment and \nconsider the 1,300 illegal aliens' tax returns, which yielded $2.6 \nmillion in tax refunds, were handled by a single tax preparer; now \nconsider the number of tax preparers nationwide and the exorbitant \namount of tax dollars--likely in the billions--distributed among \nillegal aliens using fraudulent Social Security numbers. The way our \nsystem works, the tax preparer is relieved of liability, absent \nreckless misrepresentation or a finding of exceptional negligence.\n  With whom should the liability lie? The obvious answer is the illegal \nalien guilty of stealing someone else's identity. But what happens to \nthe helpless victim of the identity theft? Shouldn't our law protect \nthe person who has had their identity compromised, and shouldn't our \nFederal agencies be required to communicate information about an \nindividual's compromised identity before the individual is robbed of \nopportunities such as taking out a student loan, purchasing a home, or \npurchasing tools or equipment with a small business loan? Shouldn't we \ndo all that we can to prevent law-abiding citizens falling victim to \nidentity theft?\n  Occurrences of identity theft perpetrated by illegal immigrants have \nrisen and will continue to rise as better systems are developed for \nverifying employment. Illegal immigrants will continue to assume the \nnames and Government-issued ID numbers of American citizens in order to \nthwart detection at workplaces, get driver's licenses and obtain \ncredit. Once a person takes a job in the U.S., one of the first things \nhis employer will likely ask for is his Social Security number. The \nintegrity of the immigration system depends on the genuineness of our \nefforts to protect citizens from immigrant-related identity fraud. \nIdentity theft prevention and immigration enforcement will be greatly \nenhanced by legislation that permits the sharing of social security \ndata among agencies.\n  The Weld County Tax I.D. case is just the tip of the iceberg. If more \nthan 1,300 illegal immigrants can receive more than $2.6 million in tax \nrefunds using stolen Social Security numbers in a community of 100,000 \npeople, how many other cases exist throughout the country? It adds \ninsult to injury that a legislative solution is easily within reach of \nCongress.\n  I know we have a lot on our plate this week, but I would ask the \nSenate to act to close this loophole.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/11/19/senate-section/article/S10629-1", "month": "11", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10629-S10633]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                          TRIBUTE TO SENATORS\n\n\n                             Elizabeth Dole\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I commend Senator Elizabeth Dole \nfor her dedicated work on behalf of North Carolina in the Senate and \nher decades of service to our Nation. In the Senate she has worked hard \nto ensure our veterans and servicemembers receive the benefits they \nhave more than earned. I was pleased to have her cosponsorship and \nsupport for my measure allowing servicemembers to terminate cell phone \ncontracts free of penalties.\n  Senator Dole has also demonstrated a commitment to solving the most \ndifficult crises in Africa, particularly in Zimbabwe and Darfur. We \nboth joined with Senator Clinton and Senator Lugar on legislation to \nassist Zimbabweans in their efforts to promote democracy and human \nrights in their country. I also welcomed Senator Dole's support on a \nresolution condemning the recent flawed elections in Zimbabwe. Her \nvoice in the Senate on these issues will be missed. I thank her for her \nservice to the Senate and the people of North Carolina, and wish her \nall the best for the future.\n\n\n                              Gordon Smith\n\n  Mr. President, today I want to thank Senator Gordon Smith for his \nservice to the people of Oregon. During my time on the Senate Foreign \nRelations African Affairs Subcommittee I have watched Senator Smith \nfight ardently for the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief that \nhas saved countless lives around the globe. His leadership on \nlegislation to fight HIV/AIDS and other diseases has been vital to our \nefforts to bring help to many African nations.\n  I also applaud his work to pass the Employment Non Discrimination \nAct, which I was also pleased to cosponsor. His efforts to end \nemployment discrimination based on sexual orientation represent an \nimportant step toward ensuring equal rights for all Americans.\n  Finally, I want to recognize Senator Smith's work on legislation to \nrequire health insurers to include mental health benefits in their \nhealth insurance coverage. This excellent example of bipartisan \ncooperation, the Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity \nand Addiction Equity Act, was made possible in part by the commitment \nof Senator Smith to ensuring those suffering from mental illness have \naccess to medical treatments that will improve their quality of life.\n  Once again, I thank Gordon Smith for his dedication to the people of \nOregon and the country while in the Senate, and I wish him all the best \nin the future.\n\n\n                              John Sununu\n\n  Mr. President, today I want to take a moment to recognize the service \nof Senator John Sununu during his time here in the Senate. It has been \na pleasure to work with him on a wide range of issues, from protecting \nthe rights of law-abiding Americans to strengthening our foreign policy \ntoward Africa.\n  Senator Sununu has made many important contributions during his time \nin this body, but his work to protect the constitutional rights of \ninnocent Americans is certainly among the most important. He recognizes \nthat our government can wage an effective fight against terrorism that \nstill respects our basic freedoms. Senator Sununu has been a crucial \nvoice on civil liberties issues like reforming the PATRIOT Act and \nkeeping tabs on government data mining efforts. I am proud that we \nworked together on a number of bills. Most recently, we introduced \nlegislation addressing the serious misuse of the FBI's national \nsecurity letter authorities to obtain information about innocent people \nwithout judicial review. We also successfully passed legislation last \nyear requiring Federal agencies to inform Congress about the use and \ndevelopment of the kind of government data mining technologies that \nraise the most serious privacy and efficacy concerns. I will miss his \nvoice on these issues here in the Senate.\n  Finally, I want to recognize Senator Sununu's work on the Senate \nForeign\n\n[[Page S10630]]\n\nRelations Committee's Africa Subcommittee. I had the privilege of \nworking side by side with him when he was ranking member of that \nsubcommittee, and I saw firsthand his commitment to ending devastating \nconflicts in Africa. I deeply appreciate his commitment to his work on \nAfrica, and to so many other issues during his service in the Senate. I \nwish him all the best in the future.\n\n\n                             Pete Domenici\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I wish to honor our distinguished \ncolleague, Pete Domenici, who will be ending his historic Senate career \nat the end of this Congress. For the past 32 years it has been my \nprivilege to serve with Pete Domenici in the Senate. During that time, \nhe has epitomized devotion to public service and to his State of New \nMexico. He will leave the Senate having cast more votes than all but \nsix other Senators in the history of this body. He is the longest \nserving Senator in New Mexico's history, and he rightly occupies an \niconic status in his home State.\n  Pete Domenici experienced a modest upbringing as the only son of \nfirst generation Italian immigrants. He secured his first job after \ncollege as a pitcher for the Albuquerque Dukes, then a farm team for \nthe Brooklyn Dodgers. Following a stint as a teacher, Pete won a seat \non the Albuquerque City Commission in 1966. The next year, we both \nbecame mayors of our respective cities: Pete served Albuquerque as I \nserved Indianapolis. After 6 years in the Albuquerque City Hall, he \nbecame the first Republican to win a Senate seat from New Mexico in 38 \nyears.\n  I entered the Senate in 1977, 4 years after Pete. By that time, he \nalready was recognized as a leading Republican authority on the budget \nprocess. I looked to Pete as a mentor on the intricacies of the Federal \nbudget, and he graciously tutored me on both substance and process. \nYear after year, as the lead Republican on the Budget Committee, Pete \nwas indispensible as floor manager of the budget resolution. \nFrequently, when the Senate lost its way during a difficult budget \ndebate, Senator Domenici functioned as a touchstone to bring the debate \nback to sober reflection and verifiable statistics. I doubt the Senate \nwill ever experience a leader who has a more detailed command of the \nbudget process and who could explain it with greater clarity.\n  It is telling that even though Pete derived much annual power from \nhis roles as Budget chairman and Appropriations subcommittee chairman, \nthis status did not dissuade him from proposing a reform idea that \nimplicitly would reduce his opportunities to exercise this authority--\nnamely a 2-year budget cycle. I have always been impressed by his \nembrace of this idea, and his endorsement influenced my own support for \na 2-year budget process. Senator Domenici's advocacy went against \nstandard expectations that Members of Congress will protect their own \nprerogatives even if their best judgment tells them that reforms are \nnecessary. But Pete's service in the Senate was never based upon \naccruing personal authority or maximizing his notoriety.\n  I was extremely pleased that Senator Domenici's assiduous efforts \nover many years were recently brought to fruition with the passage and \nsignature into law of the Mental Health Parity Act. Pete joined the \nlate Senator Paul Wellstone in promoting this bipartisan legislation \nthat will ensure that health plans make mental health treatment \navailable for those in need. It will provide parity between health \ninsurance coverage of mental health benefits and benefits for medical \nand surgical services and help avert the development of future physical \nproblems that could arise from untreated and increasingly debilitating \npsychological illness.\n  I am especially sad to see Pete leave because he has been an \noutstanding partner in work to prevent nuclear proliferation and to \nimprove response to attacks involving weapons of mass destruction. In \nconcert with the efforts of Senator Sam Nunn and myself to establish \nthe Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction Program at the Department \nof Defense--which is aimed at securing and destroying weapons of mass \ndestruction in the former Soviet Union--Senator Domenici spearheaded \nthe expansion of the Energy Department's involvement in safeguarding \nnuclear material. He also was an effective advocate for the role of our \nNational Laboratories in nonproliferation work. Scientists from the \nNational Laboratories have been on the frontlines of our engagement \nwith the brain trust of the Soviet nuclear program. Pete understood the \nunique skill set possessed by our laboratories, and he made sure that \nthey were well funded and authorized to implement numerous \nnonproliferation projects. Senator Domenici also joined with Senator \nNunn and me to pass the Nunn-Lugar-Domenici Act of 1997. Long before \nSeptember 11, 2001, this legislation was working to improve the \ncapabilities of local and State first responders, especially with \nregard to weapons of mass destruction attacks. The experience, \nawareness, and structure established by this program have been valuable \nto our Nation's post-9/11 homeland security efforts.\n  The Senate will miss deeply Senator Domenici's experience displayed \nover 36 years. He will be remembered as a workhorse able to shoulder \nthe daily burdens of a thousand details, but also as a thoughtful \nobserver who saw beyond the politics of the moment to provide \nperspective on the direction of our country. I wish my good friend the \nbest as he leaves the Senate to experience new adventures with his \nfamily.\n\n\n                              CHUCK HAGEL\n\n  Mr. President, I wish to take this opportunity before the 110th \nCongress adjourns to honor our distinguished colleague and my good \nfriend, Chuck Hagel, who will be leaving the Senate after 12 years of \nachievement.\n  Senator Hagel has applied his estimable talents to many of the most \ncritical areas of public policy. Throughout his time in the Senate he \nwas a stalwart member of the Foreign Relations Committee, where he \nbecame one of the Senate's experts on international affairs.\n  Upon Chuck Hagel's arrival in the Senate in 1996, he had already \ndistinguished himself in service to his country. He was decorated for \nhis service as an infantryman in the U.S. Army during the Vietnam war; \nHe went on to careers as a congressional staffer, a deputy \nadministrator of the Veterans Administration, and a successful \nbusinessman.\n  When Chuck came to the Senate, it was clear that his unique \nbackground would be an asset to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. \nI encouraged him to join the committee and was pleased that he did so. \nIn the Senate, Chuck embraced responsibility for U.S. national security \nas few Senators have in recent decades.\n  Senator Hagel's years in the Senate will be remembered for his \nwillingness to challenge conventional wisdom and his ability to see \nissues from multiple perspectives. He has been a determined advocate \nfor an independent point of view, but also a good listener who has \noften forged compromises that benefited our Nation.\n  For the last 9 years, Chuck has sat next to me through hundreds of \nForeign Relations Committee hearings and meetings. I greatly enjoyed \nthe opportunity to exchange ideas with him, to compare perspectives on \nour witnesses, and to develop common approaches to problems. He was \nalways candid and thoughtful in both his public statements and his \nprivate advice.\n  He understands that the world's problems are our problems; that our \neconomic health is tied to the prosperity of the rest of the \nindustrialized world; that the cleanliness of our environment is deeply \naffected by the environments of those even beyond our continent; and \nthat our access to global natural resources and energy supplies depends \non maintaining stable conditions in some of the most volatile regions \non Earth. In a ``Memo to the Candidates'' written last summer, he \nunderscored the interconnected nature of our world, saying:\n\n     America's long-term security interests are directly connected \n     to alliances, coalitions, international institutions, and our \n     standing in the world. The next President will have to \n     reintroduce America to the world in order to regain its trust \n     in our purpose as well as our power.\n\n  Chuck contributed greatly in recent years to the committee's efforts \nto improve our Government's stabilization and reconstruction capacity, \nto elevate the priority of energy diplomacy, to facilitate NATO \nexpansion, to reauthorize the PEPFAR program, to prevent the \nproliferation of weapons of mass\n\n[[Page S10631]]\n\ndestruction, and to safeguard the international environment.\n  I have greatly appreciated his personal friendship and thoughtful \nremembrances of events in my public and private life. My entire office \nbenefited from his personal generosity in 2001 when the Senate endured \nthe anthrax attack. My staff and I were displaced from our office for \nmore than 3 months. Senator Hagel stepped forward and offered us a \nlarge room in his suite in the Russell Senate Office Building, which \nbecame the nerve center of my Senate office while we were displaced. \nSenator Hagel's thoughtfulness allowed us to continue operations during \nthis difficult period.\n  I will greatly miss Chuck's presence in the seat next to me at \ncommittee hearings, and I know that the Senate as a whole will miss his \nwisdom and well-deserved reputation for humor. But I have no doubts \nthat he will encounter other opportunities to serve the United States. \nHis counsel on foreign and defense policy will be sought out by Members \nof Congress and Presidential administrations for many years to come. I \nlook forward to many insightful conversations with my friend and to \nwitnessing all that he will achieve in the future.\n\n\n                              JOHN WARNER\n\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to join with other Senators in honoring \nour distinguished colleague, John Warner, who will be retiring at the \nend of the 110th Congress. When he steps down, Senator Warner will have \nthe distinction of being the second longest serving Senator in \nVirginia's history. He stands as an example of the type of temperament, \nforesight, and dedication that the Founders envisioned when they \ncreated the Senate. For the past 30 years it has been my privilege to \nserve with John Warner. During that time, we have shared a common \ncommitment to the national security of the United States. We have \nworked together on innumerable issues, and I have witnessed with \nadmiration his strong character, his intellectual independence, and his \nunfailing devotion to public service.\n  Even before John was elected to the United States Senate, he had \ndistinguished himself in service to our country. He joined the U.S. \nNavy before his 18th birthday and went on to serve honorably in World \nWar II. After college and before he was able to complete law school, he \nreturned to the military as an Active Duty marine during the Korean \nconflict. After his service, John came home to complete law school. \nSubsequently he worked as a Federal prosecutor and private lawyer. \nPresident Nixon appointed John to be Under Secretary of the Navy, and \nhe went on to be Secretary of the Navy from 1972 to 1974. When he was \nelected to the Senate in 1978, he was extremely well prepared to take \non the role of a Senator and to contribute greatly to the national \nsecurity of our Nation.\n  Senator Warner has played a prominent role in almost every major \nDefense policy accomplishment of the last three decades. In the Senate, \nhe has been a steadfast supporter of the well-being of the American \nsoldier, sailor, and airman. I know that not a day goes by that he does \nnot devote thought to how he can contribute to improving our Armed \nForces and making our country more secure. It was a special pleasure \nfor me to have chaired the Foreign Relations Committee during a 4-year \nperiod from 2003 to 2007 when John was chairing the Armed Services \nCommittee. I believe relations between the two committees became \nstronger during this time, as we cooperated closely on arms control \nmatters, policies toward Iraq and Afghanistan, arms sales, and many \nother matters.\n  My friendship with John has been strengthened by our mutual \nmembership in the Beta Theta Pi Fraternity, and I was privileged to \nparticipate in the awarding of Beta's Oxford Cup to Senator Warner in \nApril 2008. The award ceremony and dinner took place in the Foreign \nRelations Committee hearing room, and this was a wonderful opportunity \nfor us to share experiences with other Beta members.\n  It is difficult for me to imagine the Senate without John Warner. He \nloves this institution, and he derives great satisfaction from both its \ncollegial nature and the daily opportunities Senators have to improve \nlife in the United States.\n  Senator Warner leaves the Senate after 30 years, having established a \nlegion of friendships and a memorable legacy. We will miss his \nkindness, his steadiness, and his unfailing confidence in the United \nStates. Even as we will miss seeing our friend every day, we know that \nJohn will be blessed by the opportunity to spend more time with his \nfamily. I am sure that he will continue to serve the public, and I join \nthe Senate in wishing him all the best as he moves on to new \nadventures.\n\n\n                             Pete Domenici\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the departure of Senator Pete Domenici \nwill deprive the Senate of our foremost expert on energy and budget \nlegislation, For 36 years, I have enjoyed and learned from Pete's \nfrequent presentations in our Republican Senators' caucus meetings.\n  His chairmanship of the Budget Committee during the Reagan \nadministration led to sensible economies in Federal spending which have \nnot since been duplicated. If his comprehensive ideas on energy had \nbeen followed, the United States would long ago have shed its \ndependence on foreign oil.\n  Through it all, Pete has been a most congenial colleague. Always \nsmiling, always helping, Pete has constantly been available to offer \nguidance to Members not as well-versed on his areas of specialty. \nEnormously popular in New Mexico, it is understandable why he is called \n``Saint Pete.''\n  Senator Domenici came to my rescue when I was called upon to make the \npresentation at the Senate Wednesday prayer breakfast after I had been \na member for a short period of time. I chose to talk about a new \nedition of the New Testament which had been published by a friend, \nIrwin Borowsky of Philadelphia. The text omitted all references which \nmight have been interpreted to be critical of Jewish people in \nconnection with the crucifixion.\n  I made the point that these references had caused young Jewish boys \nto be beaten up in some communities on Christian religious holidays \nmotivated by the anti-Jewish comments in the Bible. My theme was \nsharply, really vehemently, opposed by some Senators at the breakfast. \nPete Domenici then supported my contention reciting some of the barbs, \ninsults and worse which had been inflicted on Italians.\n  When Pete told me of his plan to retire because he thought he was \nfailing, I urged him to make a full disclosure of his medical condition \nto his constituents but to stay on. I told him of a conversation I had \nwith Senator Paul Tsongas in 1984 when Tsongas had announced his intent \nto retire because he had lymphoma, as I recall it. Since the medical \nevidence suggested Paul might well serve out his term, I urged him to \nstay on, leaving the voters to decide after making full disclosure as \nto his medical condition. Paul Tsongas felt otherwise and elected to \nleave. He not only could have served his full term through 1990 but \nthen became a candidate for the Democratic nomination for the \nPresidency in 1992. After telling him about the Tsongas situation, Pete \nstuck by his decision. In recent days, Senator Domenici has looked \nstronger than ever but I totally respect his decision, saying only that \nwe will miss him very much.\n\n\n                              John Warner\n\n  Senator John Warner's retirement is a great loss to the Senate. He \nbrought to this body in 30 years of service wit, wisdom and gallantry. \nAn old-style Southern gentleman, Senator Warner held a unique position \nas the Senate squire. His experience in military matters going back to \nhis sailor days in World War II, to Secretary of the Navy in 1972, and \nChairmanship of the Armed Services Committee, made him a preeminent \nfigure in the Department of Defense legislation. When Senator Warner \nmade a recommendation on defense matters, his word carried great \nweight.\n  Some of my fondest recollections of John Warner come from the squash \ncourt where we regularly engaged until he said his knees wouldn't take \nthe twists or turns any longer although he continued to be an avid \ntennis player. In a squash match more than 20 years ago, I sustained a \nserious gash under my left eye requiring six stitches for closure. At \nthat time, I had read about a Washington hockey player who sustained an \neye injury but came back immediately to play with headgear and a\n\n[[Page S10632]]\n\nplastic cover over the face. I secured one the same day of my injury \nand was back on the squash court the next day.\n  John claims responsibility, perhaps, credit for inflicting the wound. \nMemories fade after a couple of decades, but my recollection is that \nSenator Bob Packwood was the malefactor, although I never challenged \nJohn's recitation because he seemed to enjoy it so much.\n  Some of our longest discussions occurred in the Senate gym where we \nwould talk while awaiting our turn on the massage table. He would \nalways say we came at about the same time although he was precise to \nassert his 2 years' seniority.\n  Senator Warner was a help to me even before I became a Senator when \nhe and his new bride, Elizabeth Taylor, were the star attractions at a \nfundraiser for me in New York City.\n  Senator George Mitchell tells an interesting story about Senator \nWarner. Senator Mitchell recalls a filibuster where cots were set up in \nthe Senate Marble Room where Mitchell was feeling sorry for himself \nabout giving up a lifetime appointment as a Federal judge then becoming \na Senator and wasn't too happy about the all-night sessions. As George \nput it, he was stumbling his way through the cots during the 1980 \nfilibuster all-nighter when he stumbled across newly wed John Warner \nsnoring on one of the cots. George commented that John was giving up \nmore than he was so it wasn't so bad after all.\n  My speculation is that Senator Warner will be called back for more \npublic service because he still has a lot of vim, vigor and vitality, \nbut we will sorely miss him in the Senate.\n\n\n                              Larry Craig\n\n  Larry Craig has made significant contributions to the Senate during \nhis three terms. He has been a leader on energy, agriculture policy and \nveterans affairs. During the debate on immigration, he was a forceful \nspokesman for a guest farm workers program. When we next take up \nimportant subjects, his leadership will be missed,\n  I worked with him closely on veterans affairs where he chaired that \ncommittee after I moved from chairman there to chair the Judiciary \nCommittee. His leadership on a Codel to the World War II battlefields \nin France over Memorial Day 2006 was particularly noteworthy. Our \nvisits to U.S. cemeteries in France and inspection of the Normandy \nbeaches were memorable.\n  I was glad to see Larry finish out his full third term after the \nincident at the Minneapolis airport. When I heard the recording of the \npolice officer's questioning him, I immediately thought that there was \ninsufficient evidence of wrongful conduct. I heard the reports that he \nplanned to resign at the end of September 2006 and called him to \nsuggest that he modify his public statement to allow for \nreconsideration of that decision. He did so, and as the record shows, \nhis legal challenges well within his rights, enabled him to stay \nthrough the conclusion of the 110th Congress.\n  Since that event, he has weathered the storm, conducted himself with \ndignity on his official duties and made a real contribution to the \nSenate. It was definitely in the interests of his Idaho constituents \nand the Senate for him to stay on and complete his term.\n\n\n                              Chuck Hagel\n\n  Senator Chuck Hagel's intellectualism and independence will be sorely \nmissed in the Senate. Chuck Hagel's service in Vietnam, where he earned \nmilitary decorations and honors including two Purple Hearts, has given \nhim special standing on key defense issues. With that background, he \nenjoys a sort of immunity from a charge of being soft on defense and \nhis views are more closely followed.\n  Senator Hagel will be especially missed by the few Republican \nmoderates who were encouraged by his independence.\n  My sense is that Chuck Hagel will stay in public life in one form or \nanother, but I would have preferred to have seen him stay in the Senate \nto promote the resurgence of moderation within the Republican ranks and \nbipartisanship extending across the aisle for important legislation.\n\n\n                              Wayne Allard\n\n  The Senate Appropriations Committee, as well as the Senate generally, \nwill miss Senator Wayne Allard. Wayne has been a strong voice for \nfiscal responsibility. His background as a veterinarian has provided an \ninteresting dimension beyond members who have legal, business, or \nacademic backgrounds.\n  Senator Allard has led by example, demonstrating his frugality by \nreturning more than $4 million in unspent office funds to the U.S. \nTreasury since being elected to Congress. In retiring after two terms, \nhe has stuck by his commitment on term limits. My personal preference \nwould have been for Wayne to stay on because, building on his \nexperience, he would have made additional significant contributions to \nthe benefit of his State, Colorado, and the Nation.\n\n\n                              Gordon Smith\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, when a departing colleague has been a \nstrong working partner as well as a friend, saying good-bye is not \neasy. I have had the pleasure of serving on several committees with \nGordon Smith over the course of his career. We have sat across the dais \nfrom each other at the Budget Committee, the Indian Affairs Committee, \nand the Finance Committee.\n  I am proud of what Senator Smith and I have been able to accomplish \nin promoting savings and capital preservation for people in their \nretirement years. He recognized a long time ago that the sooner workers \nbegin saving for retirement--and the longer they sustain that \ncommitment--the better off they and their families will be when they \nhave to depend on those savings.\n  The successes we enjoyed in getting some of our ideas included in the \nPension Protection Act of 2006 led to more ambitious proposals to \naddress the special retirement savings and income needs of women and \nolder workers. And Gordon Smith was the first to join the effort to \npromote lifetime income instruments as a response to longevity \nadvances, which constitute the greatest threat to the retirement income \nsecurity of the baby boom generation.\n  In view of the economic situation the country now faces, the efforts \nthat Senator Smith and I began must continue. I sincerely regret that \nhe will not be my primary partner on this agenda in the 111th Congress. \nI certainly hope that he will continue to use his influence and \nintelligence to keep the focus on this clear national priority.\n  Finally, I want to salute Senator Smith for the character of his \nservice to his State, this body, and to the Nation. He is the kind of \ndeliberate, open-minded, and thoughtful public servant the Founders \nmust have had in mind when they conceived the Senate. We will truly \nmiss this distinguished gentleman from Oregon.\n\n\n                             Elizabeth Dole\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to acknowledge my colleague from North \nCarolina, Senator Elizabeth Dole, who will be leaving this body after \nserving the people of North Carolina for the past 6 years.\n  Senator Dole and I have had the opportunity to work together on \nvarious issues important to the future of our nation. Senator Dole has \nbeen a strong advocate for the interests of not only her State, but the \nU.S. in general.\n  For example, just recently, Senator Dole and I worked together to \npursue a more sustainable energy policy for our country. One of our \ngoals was to transition new vehicles to an alternative source of energy \nby 2020 and reduce our dependence on foreign oil. This commitment to \nimproving the nation is what defined Senator Dole's tenure in the \nSenate.\n  Senator Dole has also been active on agricultural issues. Because \nboth of our States have a strong agricultural sector in our economy, \nthis issue is very important to our constituents. From her time on the \nSenate Agricultural Committee early in her Senate career through the \nfarm bill recently, Senator Dole has consistently looked out for the \nNorth Carolina farming community and the farming industry itself.\n  Senator Dole has had a long career of public service. She served as \nSecretary of Transportation under President Reagan and Secretary of \nLabor under President George H.W. Bush. This gave her the distinction \nof being the first woman to serve in two different Cabinet positions \nduring two different administrations. She also served as the president \nof the American Red Cross, heading one of the largest humanitarian \norganizations in the world.\n\n[[Page S10633]]\n\nThis list of accomplishments underscores Senator Dole's commitment to \nserving the public at large.\n  Again, I have appreciated the opportunity to work with Senator Dole \nand wish her well as she leaves the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/11/19/senate-section/article/S10633-1", "month": "11", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10633-S10634]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       BUDGET SCOREKEEPING REPORT\n\n  Mr. CONRAD.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor Cpl Scott Dimond of \nFranklin, NH. On Monday, October 13, 2008, Corporal Dimond was \ntragically taken from us when his vehicle struck an improvised \nexplosive device and his patrol was engaged in small-arms attack in \nKandahar, Afghanistan. My deepest sympathy, condolences, and prayers go \nout to Scott's family and loved ones who have suffered this grievous \nloss. At 39 nine years old, Scott will always be remembered as a \ndedicated citizen who consistently put others before himself.\n  Scott enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps during his senior year in \nhigh school but was medically discharged after a serious football \ninjury. Still determined to serve his fellow citizens, Scott began a \ncareer in law enforcement. He served 18 years with the Franklin Police \nDepartment, retiring in 2006 as a sergeant. Upon his retirement, \nScott's unwavering determination to serve others remained. He enlisted \nin the New Hampshire National Guard while working toward a degree as a \nregistered nurse, enabling Scott to assist others in a new way--the \nhealth care profession. To any observer, Scott's professional pursuits \nwill forever echo selflessness, sacrifice, and patriotism, and for \nthat, we are eternally grateful.\n  As a member of an embedded tactical training team, there is no doubt \nthat Scott's law enforcement background and his willingness to help \nothers successfully contributed to the mentoring and strengthening of \nthe Afghan army and police force, accelerating the eventual return of \nAmerican military personnel from the battlefield. Consistent with the \nrest of his life, Scott routinely put his country and his fellow \nsoldiers before himself. Because of his devotion and sense of duty, the \nsafety and liberty of countless Americans is more secure. \nUnquestionably, Scott is a shining example of the highest caliber of \nperson that New Hampshire, and this country, can produce. We are \nhonored to speak of his contributions, spirit, and dedication. In the \nwords of Daniel Webster--``what a man does for others, not what they do \nfor him, gives him immortality.'' May God bless Cpl Scott Dimond, his \nfamily, and all those who are currently serving in uniform.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/11/19/senate-section/article/S10634-2", "month": "11", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10634]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               PROTECTIVE FORESTS AND WILDLIFE IN SUMATRA\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I want to take a moment to call attention \nto the recent action of the Government of Indonesia to preserve the \nendangered rain forests an ecosystems of Sumatra.\n  On October 10, 2008, the Indonesian Government, in cooperation with \nthe World Wildlife Fund, WWF, announced an agreement between the 10 \nprovincial governors of Sumatra to protect biodiversity on the world's \nsixth largest island. Although long overdue, this is an important first \nstep towards conservation of a unique habitat at a critical time.\n  Sumatra is the only place on Earth where tigers, elephants, rhinos, \nand orangutans co-exist. It has also gained a reputation for having \nlost almost half of its natural forest cover since 1985. The rapid \nexpansion of palm oil and pulpwood plantations, as well as rampant \nillegal logging, have been largely to blame. These activities have \ncontributed to the precipitous decline in numbers of these endangered \nspecies, whose habitat has become a patchwork of disconnected small \nparcels of forest.\n  This action to protect the forests is important not only for \nIndonesia but for the rest of the world. Thirteen percent of \nIndonesia's remaining forests grow on peat soil, which emits large \namounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere when trees are felled. \nFurther destruction of these forests will contribute to global warming \nat a time when we should be doing everything possible to reduce \ngreenhouse gases.\n  This agreement represents a significant change of attitude and \npolicy, for which President Yudhoyono and his government deserve \ncredit. Implementing the agreement will be difficult, requiring \nadditional resources for alternative economic opportunities for people \nliving in these areas, and for enforcement, and I urge the U.S. Agency \nfor International Development and other donors to support it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/11/19/senate-section/article/S10634-3", "month": "11", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10634-S10635]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    MILLENNIUM CHALLENGE CORPORATION\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, as Chairman of the State and Foreign \nOperations Subcommittee, I want to take a moment to speak about the \nbudget of the Millennium Challenge Corporation, MCC.\n  The fiscal year 2009 State and Foreign Operations bill, reported by \nthe Appropriations Committee on July 18, 2008, recommends $254 million \nfor the MCC. Since this is substantially less than the $2 billion \nrequested by the President, it was predictable that the Senate \ncommittee's action would cause concerns among the MCC and many of its \nsupporters, as well as governments that seek MCC funding. Those \nconcerns have been expressed and I want to address them briefly today. \nWhile differences are inevitable in the legislative process, it is \nimportant that such differences not be based on a misunderstanding or \nconfusion about the facts.\n  During the past several months, I have heard that some of those who \nhave complained about the Senate committee's action have suggested that \nit was motivated by an antipathy towards the MCC and a desire to close \nit down or dramatically curtail its functions. That is incorrect.\n  To begin with, we have commended the MCC for what it has accomplished \nsince its inception 4 years ago. Several compacts are beginning to show \ntangible results, including the implementation of agriculture, \ninfrastructure and other projects. Ambassador John Danilovich, the \nMCC's CEO, has been a strong leader at a critical time, and I commend \nhim as well as deputy CEO Rodney Bent. They have both done a fine job \nof representing the MCC, both here and abroad.\n  Earlier this year, when the subcommittee was dividing up funds \nallocated to State and Foreign Operations, we faced many difficult \nchoices. Our fiscal year 2009 allocation was $2 billion below the \nPresident's budget request, and the President underfunded or failed to \nfund many critical programs of interest to both Democrats and \nRepublicans. For example, he cut funding for family planning/\nreproductive health by over $100 million below the fiscal year 2008 \nlevel. He cut the U.S. contribution to the global fund to fight AIDS, \nTB and malaria by $350 million. He shortchanged humanitarian relief \nprograms, peacekeeping, democracy programs, environment and energy \nprograms. There are many other examples.\n  We also considered the fact that Congress had appropriated $7.5 \nbillion for the MCC, and by July 18 only $235 million had been \ndisbursed of which a significant portion was for administrative \nexpenses. While we made clear that we were not advocating faster \ndisbursements, we do not support additional compacts until more of the \nfunds we have already appropriated produce sustainable results.\n  Many compacts were slow getting off of the ground, in some cases \nbecause the MCC rightly insisted that governments make further \nrefinements, or because the contracting process took longer than \nexpected. These kinds of delays are predictable and do not reflect \npoorly on the MCC. Unfortunately, I have heard that some MCC personnel \nin country are being urged to disburse funds more quickly. As we have \nsaid before, this is not our intent, particularly if it risks short-\ncutting procurement guidelines or other safeguards, or otherwise \nnegatively affects the quality of implementation of compacts.\n  I do not know what the optimal rate of disbursement is for the MCC. \nIt may be disbursing funds at the right rate.\n\n[[Page S10635]]\n\nBy pointing out the rate of disbursement the committee has simply \nsought to explain why, in part, we are unable to support hundreds of \nmillions of dollars for new compacts when compacts that are several \nyears old have only disbursed a fraction of their funds. More time is \nrequired to review the effectiveness of the 18 compacts that already \nexist. I am told that the MCC's board of directors will meet in \nDecember to discuss which additional countries will be eligible to \napply for compact funding in fiscal year 2009. Since we will not have a \nfinal fiscal year 2009 funding level for the MCC until late January at \nthe earliest, I urge board members to act judiciously and to keep in \nmind that eligibility does not assure that a compact will be funded.\n  The many competing demands placed on the State and Foreign Operations \nAppropriations bill will only increase over the next few years, given \nthe global financial crisis, which will have direct and indirect \nconsequences for the world's poorest countries. We also expect to be \nasked to increase funding for international HIV/AIDS programs due to \nthe recent PEPFAR reauthorization.\n  The MCC is a new and innovative form of assistance, and we want it to \nsucceed. I was involved in drafting the authorizing legislation that \nestablished the MCC, and I have said many times that I strongly support \nthe concept of providing governments with incentives to combat \ncorruption, improve governance, and address the basic needs of their \npeople. If the MCC shows that it can achieve the results we all want, \nit could become a model for other forms of foreign assistance.\n  But we cannot ignore other pressing short-term and long-term needs. \nSome have claimed that not providing another billion dollars for the \nMCC in fiscal year 2009 will delay progress toward long-term \ndevelopment goals. I would argue that funding to address the acute \npersonnel shortages at the Department of State and USAID, which the \nPresident's budget largely ignores, is a priority for effective U.S. \ndiplomacy and development assistance programs now and in the future.\n  It is also notable that a number of governments that were awarded \ncompacts are not performing as expected. According to the 2009 Country \nScorecard Index, 5 of the 8 MCC lower middle income countries that have \ncompacts have failed 8 of 17 indicators. Similarly, with the reports of \nsystemic voter fraud in the recent Nicaraguan elections, I am concerned \nthat President Ortega's government may have jeopardized the MCC compact \nin that country.\n  The future of the MCC is now up to the Obama administration, and I \nexpect President-elect Obama will explore all options for how the MCC \nshould by managed and implemented, as he will for other Federal \nprograms. However, before major adjustments, if any, take place, \nCongress has to finish the remaining fiscal year 2009 spending bills.\n  Senator Gregg and I will be working with our colleagues in the House. \nThere are several areas in the State and Foreign Operations bill where \nthe Senate and House positions differ, and the MCC is one obvious \nexample. Until then, I would encourage those who care about the MCC, as \nmany of us do, to focus on ensuring that funds already appropriated are \nused effectively.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/11/19/senate-section/article/S10635-1", "month": "11", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10635-S10636]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO BOB MILLER\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the great \nachievements of a wonderful Vermont businessman, Bob Miller, president \nof R.E.M. Development Company in Williston.\n  Bobby started R.E.M. Development in 1984, and over the last quarter \ncentury, the company has grown to become one of Vermont's largest \ncommercial real estate developers. While it is hard to travel around \nVermont without running into one of Bobby's projects, his lifelong \ncommitment to bettering his community is both admirable and \ncommendable.\n  Bobby recently received two special awards for his outstanding \nbusiness practices and devotion to the community. Citing ``their \ndetermination, success, and philanthropy,'' the Lake Champlain Regional \nChamber of Commerce honored R.E.M. Development as its 2008 Large \nBusiness of the Year. In addition, saying that Bobby ``typifies the \ntrue spirit of service and self-sacrifice in representing the finest \nideals of Vermont citizenship,'' the Vermont Chamber of Commerce \npresented him with its 2008 Citizen of the Year Award. I congratulate \nBobby and R.E.M. Development for both of these well-deserved \nachievements.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have a November 17, 2008, Burlington Free \nPress article about Bobby Miller's successful career printed in the \nRecord so all Senators can read about a prosperous Vermont businessman \nwho continually gives back to his community.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n        [From the Burlington Free Press, Monday, Nov. 17, 2008]\n\n                    Miller Is a Builder and a Giver\n\n                          (By Adam Silverman)\n\n       Williston.--Just about anybody can create and run a \n     thriving business when times are good. When the economic \n     outlook is gloomier, though, success requires more careful \n     planning and management.\n       That's both a piece of advice from and a guiding philosophy \n     for Bob Miller, president of Williston-based R.E.M \n     Development Co., a 24-year-old company that builds and leases \n     commercial real estate. Even with recession fears spreading, \n     Miller said business is flourishing.\n       ``There is always demand,'' he said last week while sitting \n     behind his granite-topped desk at an industrial park he owns \n     on Avenue D. ``I don't think there's a good time or a bad \n     time to go into business. Either you have a business plan \n     that's going to work, or it's not. Anyone can make it in good \n     times.''\n       Outside, cars, trucks, big rigs and package-delivery vans \n     frequented the businesses that rent space in his buildings. \n     The park represents just a fraction of the 2 million square \n     feet of real estate R.E.M rents, a total that makes the \n     company ``the region's largest commercial industrial \n     developer of manufacturing, distribution, warehouse, and flex \n     space,'' it boasts on its Web site.\n       Miller, 73, of Burlington, whose initials compose his \n     company's acronym, incorporates another component into his \n     philosophy: the need for philanthropy, for businesses to give \n     back to their communities. He has donated money and \n     construction services to hospitals, exposition centers and \n     youth recreational facilities, among many others. Miller and \n     his wife, Holly, give what they call the ``three Ts''--time, \n     talent and treasure.\n       ``It's kind of fun to take on one of these projects and \n     stand back and say, `We really helped this neighborhood,' '' \n     Miller said. ``It's a great way to get your name out. There \n     are rewards for philanthropy. People know you're out in the \n     community giving back and not just taking, taking, taking. \n     That's not why we do it--we do it because we want to--but \n     there is that relationship in getting involved.''\n       Those components of Miller's work, the successful company \n     and the devotion to philanthropy, led to two awards he \n     received last week.\n       The Lake Champlain Regional Chamber of Commerce honored \n     R.E.M Development on Tuesday as its large business of the \n     year, citing Miller and the company for ``their \n     determination, success, and philanthropy.'' Three days later, \n     the Vermont Chamber of Commerce presented Miller its Citizen \n     of the Year Award, also championing his business acumen and \n     his good works.\n       Miller ``typifies the true spirit of service and self-\n     sacrifice in representing the finest ideals of Vermont \n     citizenship,'' the Vermont Chamber says on its Web site. \n     ``His commitment to the prosperity of the people and \n     businesses in Vermont reaches statewide.''\n       Among Miller's projects is Burlington's Gosse Court Armory, \n     an old National Guard facility the military donated to the \n     city in 2005 for transformation into a community center.\n       The city approached Miller about a potential contribution \n     after budget estimates exceeded available resources. Miller \n     looked at the plans, said he could do the work for $500,000 \n     less than the $1.3 million estimate, and agreed to serve as \n     general contractor. Later he wrote a check for $100,000.\n       ``It's really extraordinary to have a developer with his \n     skills and expertise step forward to do this for his \n     community,'' the city's chief administrative officer, \n     Jonathan Leopold, said earlier this year.\n       Sitting in his office last week, Miller fielded a phone \n     call from a construction worker at the armory. Without \n     referring to any plans or drawings, Miller helped solve an \n     engineering challenge from memory, delivering precise \n     instructions. Then he drew a sketch on a blank sheet of paper \n     to help an observer understand the issue: the alignment of \n     basketball hoops and the configuration of lines on the \n     gymnasium floor.\n       Miller's talent for drawing and engineering came naturally, \n     he said. A Rutland native, Miller thought during high school \n     he wanted to be a mechanic, but after graduation he turned \n     toward engineering. His first job was as a draftsman.\n       He moved to Burlington in 1959 and helped draft electrical \n     plans for the University of Vermont's library and Burlington \n     High School; because the money wasn't great, Miller also \n     tended bar, he said. In 1972 he started New England Air \n     Systems, which he ran for\n\n[[Page S10636]]\n\n     a dozen years, and then he sold it to the employees and \n     created the company he continues to run--with 12-hour days \n     during the week and seven hours on Saturdays.\n       ``One of my philosophies is, you've got to make money or \n     you're not going to be in business,'' he said. ``I love the \n     business. I love the challenge of negotiating. I'm fiercely \n     competitive. I may not look that way, but I'm a highly \n     competitive guy. But I'm not a sore loser, either.''\n       Miller is especially happy to see businesses ``grow with \n     us,'' starting out small and expanding as their success \n     increases. R.E.M Development, which Miller runs with his son, \n     Tim, is devoted to helping its tenants, but expects serious \n     effort in return, Miller said.\n       ``We try to help people get started. I'm a great advocate \n     of the underdog, because that's where I came from,'' he said. \n     ``We want people to make a profit, but they've got to work \n     for it, as we do.''\n       Businesses first must craft a solid, well-researched, \n     thorough, realistic business plan, Miller suggested. Then \n     they must forge relationships with customers and with \n     vendors, and develop and maintain a positive reputation. \n     That's helped Miller thrive.\n       ``When we really need a product, we can get that product,'' \n     he said, referring to critical building components. ``People \n     know they will get paid. We don't cry wolf every day, but we \n     do cry wolf from time to time.''\n       Last, and sometimes of special importance, is for an owner \n     to be able to abandon an unsuccessful venture, as he did with \n     a portable-storage project he launched just before 9/11, even \n     though a stigma can be attached, Miller said.\n       ``If you're successful, everyone thinks you're a genius. If \n     you fail they think you're a schmuck,'' he said. ``Don't fall \n     in love with 'em. Drop 'em if it doesn't work. You have to be \n     a realist.''\n       Regardless of the situation, Miller encourages other \n     business owners to give back. He likes to quote fellow \n     Vermont philanthropist J. Warren McClure, who died in 2004: \n     ``If you can't give a dollar, you'll never give a hundred.''\n       ``Give what you can,'' Miller said. ``We have an \n     obligation. There are many, many, many needs. And you can \n     have a lot of fun doing it.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/11/19/senate-section/article/S10636-1", "month": "11", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10636]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           HEALTH CARE REFORM\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I wanted to take this opportunity to share \nwith my colleagues an especially poignant and meaningful column that \nappeared in the Boston Herald last week by Wayne Woodlief honoring the \nefforts Senator Edward M. Kennedy has made to enact legislation to \nprovide health care for all Americans--and looking forward to his \nleadership on this issue. As Senator Kennedy recently said ``It is \npainfully obvious that our health care system costs Americans too much, \ncosts employers too much, denies too much needed care and leaves out \ntoo many Americans.'' He is right. We need to take immediate action \nnext year to reform our health care system. I look forward to working \nwith Senator Kennedy to enact broad reform of our health care system to \nhelp every American gain access to high-quality, affordable health \ncare.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have the column to which I referred, \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    Barack Obama, Listen to Dr. Ted\n\n                          (By Wayne Woodlief)\n\n       Now's the time for President-elect Obama and Congress to \n     seize the moment and enact health care for all Americans. \n     ASAP.\n       Sen. is pressing a new strategy--shaped in bipartisan \n     meetings--for one consensus bill that can be moved swiftly \n     through the Senate and the House, perhaps even in Obama's \n     first 100 days.\n       Kennedy has courted and listened to allies on both sides of \n     the aisle. Sen. Mike Enzi (R-Wyo.), ranking Republican on the \n     Health Care Committee that Kennedy chairs, is working with \n     Teddy. And Senate Finance Chairman Max Baucus (D-Mont.) \n     weighed in this week with his own ideas on health care; ideas \n     that look a lot like Kennedy's and like the Massachusetts \n     universal coverage law that Teddy touts as a national model.\n       Kennedy said Baucus' White Paper ``brings us closer to our \n     goal.'' Especially since the finance committee has to find a \n     way to pay for a law that would cost billions, yet help tens \n     of millions of struggling citizens, many without jobs now, \n     pay their health care bills.\n       That is different from the early 1990s when then-Chairman \n     Daniel Patrick Moynihan's opposition doomed health care \n     reform championed by Kennedy and the Clintons.\n       And Obama--though treading carefully--said recently that \n     health reform is ``priority number three,'' right after the \n     economy and energy independence, adding, ``I think the time \n     is right to do it.''\n       Amen. Passage of universal health care would be the \n     capstone on Kennedy's legacy. And Obama owes him. The passing \n     of the Kennedy torch to Obama by Teddy and niece Caroline \n     just before Super Tuesday was a turning point in Obama's path \n     to the presidency. He also owes it even more to all those \n     people to whom he promised relief.\n       In last Sunday's Washington Post, Kennedy wrote, ``it is no \n     longer just patients demanding change. Businesses, doctors \n     and even many insurance companies are demanding it ... The \n     cost will be substantial, but the need for reform is too \n     great to be deflected or delayed.''\n       For those who would say, ``That's just a liberal talking,'' \n     hear this:\n       David Blumenthal, director of the Institute for Health \n     Policy for the Partners Health Care System and an Obama \n     adviser, said, ``Some of the largest corporations in America \n     are struggling to compete in the world marketplace because of \n     high health care costs.''\n       Rick Umbdenstock, president and CEO of the American \n     Hospital Association, said the economic turmoil, coupled with \n     health care's high costs, ``will likely mean the loss of jobs \n     and employer-related health coverage ... and possibly even \n     diminishing access to health care services.''\n       Nancy Nielsen, president of the American Medical \n     Association, said, ``The cost of doing nothing is much higher \n     than the alternative''--the scuffling to pay for good care, \n     including preventive care, and dooming millions to ``live \n     sick and die younger.''\n       These aren't socialists. These are people who work with \n     health care daily and know the crisis it is in.\n       Kennedy has worked behind the scenes to craft health reform \n     since Memorial Day, by phone, by e-mail and even by face-to-\n     face meetings despite his illness. He's back in Washington, \n     and he's not slowing down.\n       As soon as Obama takes that oath that Kennedy's slain \n     brother took 48 years ago, he should start preaching and \n     working for health care for all. And Congress, which Kennedy \n     has served for so long, should do it for Teddy--and for the \n     American people. It's time to strike while those stars are \n     aligned.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/11/19/senate-section/article/S10636-2", "month": "11", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10636-S10637]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 SPACE\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I wish to address the report to Congress \nof the Independent Assessment Panel on the Organization and Management \nof National Security Space, which was released on Tuesday, September \n16. The Institute for Defense Analyses, led by Mr. A. Thomas Young and \na team of six qualified and experienced experts, undertook this project \nto provide the Congress with a comprehensive assessment of the state of \nour national space policy, especially as it relates to our national \nsecurity and our position as the global leader in space.\n  I raised concerns in 2006 when then-Secretary of Defense Donald \nRumsfeld suggested that the commander of Air Force Space Command, based \nin Colorado Springs, should be downgraded from the four-star level to \nthree stars. I reminded the Secretary that space is critical to our \nArmed Forces; that nearly every military operation we carry out makes \nuse of assets in space in one way or another, be it using our \nsatellites to locate the position of the enemy, providing instant \ncommunications, or gathering dependable intelligence. I was pleased the \nPentagon opted not to institute this troublesome proposal.\n  Following this episode, I authored legislation in the 2007 Defense \nauthorization bill to establish a new space commission, similar to the \n2001 Commission to Assess U.S. National Security Space Management and \nOrganization. I wanted an independent panel of space, intelligence, and \nmilitary experts to study, analyze, and make recommendations to the \nCongress on the current state and future vision of America's national \nspace agenda. This review began last fall, and I am pleased that it was \ncompleted in a timely manner.\n  The panel began their report articulating what I have always \nunderstood to be true, that U.S. leadership in space is paramount to \nthe preservation of our national security. It is key to our lasting \nability to ward off modern and unexpected threats against our homeland \nor our allies and essential to maintaining our economic superiority in \nthe ever-changing information age. Most importantly, the report \nreinforced that space-based technology is essential to our intelligence \ngathering and warfighting capabilities. As such, according to the \npanel, and I agree, updating and modernizing our national space policy \nand its related personnel structure must be a top priority. America's \nwillingness and capacity to continue to lead in space provides our \nNation with a priceless strategic advantage that will pay dividends for \ngenerations to come.\n  As a result of their extensive research and thorough investigations,\n\n[[Page S10637]]\n\nthe panel uncovered what they believed were fundamental structural and \norganizational flaws with the Federal Government's space sector. Such \nflaws include major management problems, poor communication among and \nbetween involved agencies, a lack of proper oversight and direction, a \nlack of expert professional personnel, and a host of others. The panel \nalso recognized a scary reality--space technology is rapidly \nproliferating to all corners of the Earth, and America is not keeping \nup with its space competitors. This proliferation, combined with our \nspace industry bogged down by aging legacy space projects that take \nvital resources away from newer, more modern projects, has taken its \ntoll on our competitive edge with China and other emerging nations.\n  Although some of these and other deficiencies were recognized and \nexposed by the 2001 Space Commission, drastic measures to adequately \ndeal with the problems uncovered were not proposed and undertaken. This \npanel, however, took an alternate route and recommended bold proposals \nto redirect and radically improve our national space agenda. The panel \nrecommends, and again I agree, that America needs a top-to-bottom \noverhaul to restore the vitality of our space programs and regain and \nsustain the competitive advantages afforded the United States by our \npreeminence in space. In no uncertain terms, the panel outlined a bold \nnew vision for the future of America's role in space. It laid out four \nsuggestions of significant substance to restructure our approach to \nspace and realign our defense, intelligence, and commercial priorities \nas they relate to space.\n  First, it calls for the President to create and implement a truly \nnational space strategy. The President should announce to the American \npeople that he is updating and modernizing America's space program \nimmediately and elevating its priority status to the top tier of the \nnational agenda.\n  The panel recommends the President reestablish the National Space \nCouncil in the Executive Office of the President, under the leadership \nof the National Security Advisor, to implement the new strategy and \ncoordinate its activities with the Department of Defense, the \nintelligence community, NASA, and other responsible agencies. This will \nprovide one of the President's top advisers with the power to assign \nresponsibilities, set priorities, and break through the barriers to \ncooperation that have stymied progress on key space programs in the \npast.\n  Second, the panel believes that no one is really in charge of the \nnational space agenda. They discovered that in the midst of so much \nbureaucracy and competing authorities, regrettably there has been no \none at the helm. This needs to change.\n  The authorities and responsibilities for all Government space \nprograms are spread widely throughout the Pentagon and within various \nintelligence agencies. Therefore, the panel recommends the creation of \na National Security Space Authority that will be responsible to the \nSecretary of Defense and the Director of National Intelligence. The \nproposed arrangement is needed to remedy the ruinous deficiencies in \nthe current system, including the frequent inability to reconcile \nbudget priorities and the common failure to ensure that innovative \nacquisition program requirements are affordable and integrated across \nmilitary and intelligence space domains.\n  Third, the panel recommends to strip the National Reconnaissance \nOffice and the Air Force Space and Missile Systems Center of their \nstatus as traditional, independent entities and incorporate their \npersonnel and functions, as well as the functions of other parts of the \nAir Force Space Command, into a single National Security Space \nOrganization. Under unified leadership, this organization could allow \nall the space experts to work more effectively together. The panel \nrecommends this path because it most effectively utilizes the scarce \ntalent available to achieve our Nation's goals in space. Under this \ntype of organizational structure, the Government's space management \nteam can focus on installing best engineering and acquisition \npractices, including early systems engineering and cost estimating. I \nam not sure I agree yet with this recommendation, but I think it does \nwarrant serious consideration by the Congress.\n  It is true that the continual problem of space acquisition program \ndelays, cost overruns, and cancellations has drained resources and \ncaused America to rely heavily on satellite constellations that have \nmatured beyond their original design lives. This is simply \nunacceptable, and I think the panel is correct when they say that small \nmodifications to the status quo, which have been proposed time and \nagain in the past, are not enough. A new and innovative organizational \nstructure is a good idea, but the details of the panel's third \nrecommendation need to be vetted before I can lend my full support.\n  Finally, the panel suggests that the intelligence community and each \nof the military branches adopt and execute strategies for identifying, \nselecting, educating, training, and managing a sufficient number of \nGovernment experts and professionals to support the country's space \nacquisition obligations. The careers of these space acquisition and \ntechnical professionals should be designed and administered so that \nthey can provide continuity for the execution of long-term projects, \nwhile remaining eligible and competitive for career advancement.\n  It is unrealistic to expect that we can modernize our space strategy \nand succeed in developing complex space systems without enough \ntechnically capable and sufficiently experienced Government scientists, \nengineers, and acquisition experts that are immersed in the space arena \nand assigned to see projects through to completion. These types of \nprofessionals are critical to the success of our future endeavors in \nspace.\n  Throughout my time in the Congress I have fully supported science-\nrelated education. This support includes space, defense, and national \nsecurity studies as well. For example, I have supported funding \nrequests for the Center for Space and Defense Studies at the U.S. Air \nForce Academy. The mission of this center is to build and define space \npolicy studies curriculum for the undergraduate cadets. I have long \nsupported the Center for Geosciences and Atmospheric Research at my \nalma mater, Colorado State University. This center is a national \nresource for the Department of Defense in the areas of atmospheric and \nhydrologic research, which are both critical to our national security.\n  America needs more engineers, physicists, rocket scientists, \nmathematicians, and the like. We need them now and in the coming \ndecades more than we ever have in the past. The future of our national \nsecurity and defense capabilities rests with our ability to recruit, \ntrain, and equip more and more Americans with the critical knowledge \nand know-how of the hard sciences. The first step is making this type \nof education a top national priority, and it is my hope that America's \nfuture leaders will do so.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate all four and fully support three of the \npanel's suggestions for the improvement of our national space strategy. \nIn my opinion, if we fail to act on these recommendations, we face the \npossibility that our preeminence in space will erode to the point at \nwhich we will no longer enjoy a significant competitive national \nsecurity advantage in an all-important global arena.\n  Along with the American people, I am indebted to the panel for their \nhard and thoughtful work on this study. Their discoveries and \nsuggestions for improvement are invaluable. It is my hope that the next \nCongress and the next administration will take a serious look at this \nstudy and craft an aggressive and coherent strategy for America's \nfuture presence in space.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/11/19/senate-section/article/S10637-1", "month": "11", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10637-S10638]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                COLORADO DRUG INVESTIGATORS ASSOCIATION\n\n  Mr. ALLARD.

Mr. President, Labor Day is our opportunity to \ncelebrate the millions of American workers who have given, and continue \nto give, so much of themselves to make our Nation great. I am happy to \nhave had the opportunity to celebrate this Labor Day in Racine, WV, \nwith many old friends. Today, on the holiday especially devoted to the \nsocial and economic achievements of the American workforce. I would \nlike to thank all of the miners, teachers, nurses, service technicians, \nfirefighters, police, repairmen, and all those who dedicate their lives \nto making their communities and their country a better place. As summer \nis winding down and children are preparing to go back to school, we \nshould all take a moment to appreciate what working Americans do for \nus.\n  Honest, hard-working people, with the core American values of faith \nand family, are what make West Virginia such a wonderful place to live \nand call home. Miners work long shifts, miles under the ground, often \nin tight spaces with frigid water up to their knees, to get the coal \nthat provides 50 percent of our Nation's electricity. Yet people rarely \nthink of that when they flip on the light switch. Teachers spend much \nof their own personal time preparing lesson plans and finding creative \nways to teach our next generation. They always go above and beyond the \ncall of duty for their students. Those in public service work day in \nand day out to get Social Security checks processed and in the mail on \ntime, to manage tax returns, or to deliver basic health services to our \ncitizens. I applaud each and every one of these Americans.\n  I am glad Congress succeeded, finally, this year in raising the \nminimum wage to $6.55, to help our working families. Increasing the \nminimum wage so it is a living wage is something I have advocated since \n1998, and now all of our workers will get the increase they need and \ndeserve to help make ends meet in this struggling economy. This Labor \nDay I am especially aware of the need to change the direction of our \ncountry and that has to start with turning around our economy. It is \nunfair for hard-working Americans to have to deal with stagnant wages \nand rising costs for gas, food, and health care with no help. The \nminimum wage will continue to rise until it reaches $7.25 in 2009.\n  These workers are the heart and soul of West Virginia. Opportunities \ndo not come easily to them. They work hard every day to get the things \nthey need for their families--gas, school supplies, and maybe new \nsneakers or a pair of jeans for the next school year. Before the rise \nof unions, we did not enjoy a 40-hour work week, the benefits of Social \nSecurity, or the right to organize. But West Virginians always fought \nfor the American dream. They have a high regard for quality and strive \nfor excellence in everything that they do. In an unfortunate Forbes \nsurvey, West Virginia was listed as one of the least desirable states \nin which to do business. But that is only because some companies do not \nyet know the men and women that make up West Virginia's workforce; they \ndo not realize that West Virginia's future and potential is about more \nthan just coal. They do not see the small business owners, the nurses \nand doctors, the educators, the entrepreneurs, the manufacturers, and \nartists who keep our State moving and make it so special. They must not \nhave heard that companies from all over the world such as DuPont, Union \nCarbide, and Phone Poulenc have put plants in West Virginia and tapped \ninto our dedicated work force. Northrop Grumman, MPL Corporation, \nOrrick, Herrington, and Sutcliffe, that's the real West Virginia--with \na bright future fueled by all its abundant resources, the most precious \nof which are the men and women of our workforce. Our Toyota plant is \nthe fastest growing plant in the history of Toyota Motor Company. It \nhas been named the plant with the most productive workers in all of \nNorth America 5 years in a row. This is a testament to West Virginia \nemployees' unmatched work ethic.\n  As we celebrate Labor Day, we need to remember that it is the \ncommitment and diligence of our workers that makes us great.

Mr. President, as we continue to debate national \nstrategy and the way ahead in Iraq and Afghanistan, there is one thing \nthat is not debatable, and that is the courage and valor of our troops. \nToday, I wish to honor one of those brave troops, MSgt Brendan \nO'Connor, a medic in the Special Forces of the U.S. Army.\n  Master Sergeant O'Connor distinguished himself by extraordinary \nheroism in action during a fierce battle in Kandahar Province, \nAfghanistan, when his small detachment engaged an estimated 200 Taliban \nfighters on June 24, 2006. For his heroism, Master Sergeant O'Connor, \nwho held the rank of sergeant first class at the time of the battle, \nwas honored with the Nation's second highest award for valor, the \nDistinguished Service Cross.\n  After awarding the Distinguished Service Cross to Brendan, ADM Eric \nOlson, the head of U.S. Special Operations Command, hailed the \ncontributions of the Army's Special Forces and said, ``Master Sergeant \nBrendan O'Connor exemplifies the spirit of these warriors.''\n  Leading a quick reaction force during a mission against Taliban \nleaders, Master Sergeant O'Connor and his team found themselves \noutnumbered and surrounded by hundreds of Taliban fighters in one of \nthe most hotly contested areas of Afghanistan. After calmly maneuvering \nhis force through enemy Taliban positions, Master Sergeant O'Connor \ncrawled over 150 yards alone through enemy machine-gun fire across an \nopen field to rescue two wounded comrades. Rallying and motivating his \nseverely outnumbered team throughout a day-long battle, he saved the \nlives of 21 soldiers and prevented his detachment's destruction while \ninflicting heavy casualties on the enemy.\n  The heroism of Brendan O'Connor and his team in Afghanistan received \nnational media attention on the CBS News program ``60 Minutes,'' which \naired a segment on April 20 of this year, ``Ambush in Afghanistan.''\n  Brendan O'Connor comes from a long and distinguished family history \nof military service to our Nation, with deep roots in the U.S. Army and \nat West Point. Brendan's father, LTC Mortimer O'Connor, who graduated \nfrom West Point in 1953, was killed in action in Vietnam in 1968 while \nleading men into battle as commander of the 1st Battalion, 2nd \nInfantry, in the famed ``Big Red One,'' the oldest continuously serving \ndivision in the U.S. Army.\n  A true ``warrior-poet'', Mort O'Connor was not only decorated several \ntimes for valor on the battlefield, but taught English at West Point \nand earned a graduate degree in English literature from the University \nof Pennsylvania. A remembrance of Mort O'Connor in a March 1978 West \nPoint Alumni publication recalled his spirit on the athletic fields as \na young cadet:\n\n       When victorious he would exultantly claim to be descended \n     from ancient Irish warrior kings. And it may be true, for he \n     had in him a wild romanticism, a tragic lilt of heart, which \n     only the Irish have.\n\n\n[[Page S10639]]\n\n\n  Brendan O'Connor's grandfather, and Mort O'Connor's father, was BG \nWilliam ``Bill'' O'Connor, a graduate of West Point in 1924. Bill \nO'Connor served in Europe in World War II, including in the Battle of \nthe Bulge.\n  And three of Brendan's great-uncles followed their brother Bill to \nWest Point--Richard O'Connor in the Class of 1926, George Brendan \nO'Connor in the Class of 1936, and Roderic O'Connor in the Class of \n1941.\n  Today, the O'Connor family tradition of military service continues \nwith the next generation. Attending his Distinguished Service Cross \naward ceremony on April 30th were two of Brendan's cousins, Brian \nO'Connor, who is now at the Air Force Academy, and Rory O'Connor, who \nis now at West Point.\n  We are grateful to families such as the O'Connors, who for \ngenerations have answered the Nation's call and worn the uniform with \nsuch courage and distinction. There is no finer example of this \ntradition than MSgt Brendan O'Connor and his heroic action in \nAfghanistan. I ask unanimous consent to have the full text of his \nDistinguished Service Cross citation, as well as the narrative that \naccompanies the award, printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Citation to Accompany the Award of the Distinguished Service Cross to \n                Sergeant First Class Brendan W. O'Connor\n\n       For extraordinary heroism in combat as the senior Medical \n     Sergeant for Special Forces Operational Detachment Alpha-765 \n     in support of Operation Enduring Freedom in Panjwai District, \n     Kandahar Province, Afghanistan. On 24 June 2006, during \n     Operation Kaika, Sergeant O'Connor led a quick reaction force \n     to reinforce a surrounded patrol and to rescue two wounded \n     comrades. He maneuvered his force through Taliban positions \n     and crawled alone, under enemy machinegun fire to reach the \n     wounded soldiers. He provided medical care, while exposed to \n     heavy volumes of Taliban fire, then carried one of the \n     wounded 150 meters across open ground to an area of temporary \n     cover. He climbed over a wall three times, in plain view of \n     the enemy, to assist the wounded soldiers to cover while \n     bullets pounded the structure around him. Sergeant O'Connor \n     assumed duties as the detachment operations Sergeant and led \n     the consolidation of three friendly elements, each \n     surrounded, isolated, and receiving fire from all directions. \n     His remarkable actions are in keeping with the highest \n     traditions of military heroism and reflect distinct credit \n     upon himself, the Combined Special Operations Task Force-\n     Afghanistan, Special Operations Command-Central, and the \n     United States Army.\n\nNarrative to Accompany the Award of the Distinguished Service Cross to \n                Sergeant First Class Brendan W. O'Connor\n\n       Sergeant First Class Brendan W. O'Connor, United States \n     Army, distinguished himself by extraordinary heroism in \n     action as the Senior Medical Sergeant for Special Forces \n     Operational Detachment Alpha-765 in support of Operation \n     ENDURING FREEDOM. On 24 June 2006, while conducting Operation \n     KAIKA, a cordon and search mission to capture or kill Taliban \n     leadership in Pashmul, Panjwai District, Kandahar Province, \n     Afghanistan, the detachment became engaged with an estimated \n     200 Taliban fighters. MSG Thomas Maholic led a patrol from \n     the detachment's perimeter to secure a compound situated on \n     key terrain. As the assault began, a large Taliban force \n     counterattacked, flooded the battlefield, and immediately \n     separated the assault element from SSG Matthew Binney's \n     support by fire position, creating two distinct detachment \n     elements outside the perimeter, each isolated, surrounded, \n     and receiving enemy fire from all directions. SSG Binney and \n     SGT Joseph Feurst were seriously wounded at the support by \n     fire position. SFC O'Connor volunteered to lead a quick \n     reaction force to reinforce MSG Maholic in the compound, and \n     recover the two wounded soldiers. SFC O'Connor departed the \n     detachment's perimeter under heavy enemy fire, with SFC \n     Mishra, eight Afghan soldiers and an interpreter. By \n     employing fire and maneuver, SFC O'Connor destroyed an enemy \n     machinegun position, broke out from the encircled patrol \n     base, and evaded enemy fighters that were now swarming \n     toward the compound. After link-up with MSG Maholic, SFC \n     O'Connor was directed toward the support-by-fire position. \n     He led his small relief force along a wall that provided \n     cover from the heavy volume of machinegun and rocket-\n     propelled grenade fire, as they evaded attackers and broke \n     out from the encircled compound. At the end of the wall, \n     he encountered an open field, 80 meters across to a small \n     building, which was the next available covered position. \n     The flat field was covered by enemy grazing fire from \n     three directions. He established a support-by-fire \n     position to suppress enemy machinegun fire and began to \n     crawl, alone, across the field, leaving a third isolated \n     element amid the chaos of the battlefield. Afghan soldiers \n     attempted to follow him but turned back under the \n     extraordinary volume of fire. As bullets impacted all \n     around him and cut the grass directly over his body, he \n     quickly realized that his cumbersome load was creating too \n     large a target for the enemy. He returned to the cover of \n     the wall and removed his body armor and assault pack. \n     Informed that Apache gunships were en route to strafe the \n     area he was attempting to crawl through, SFC O'Connor \n     attached an orange panel to his back in order to mark \n     himself as a friendly element to the pilots. Without \n     hesitation he immediately resumed crawling the 80 meters \n     across the field, in plain sight of the enemy, toward his \n     two wounded comrades. He moved slowly, just inches below \n     the enemy fire, miraculously escaping injury from hundreds \n     of Taliban machinegun rounds. He jumped over a wall into a \n     vineyard and moved forward along mounds of dirt, with \n     bullets impacting all around him each time he exposed \n     himself. He continued moving alone, for 150 meters, \n     yelling for SSG Binney. Once again, he evaded enemy \n     fighters that were as near as 3 meters, and were firing \n     over a wall and shouting insults and threats at the \n     surrounded position, and made contact with his wounded \n     teammates. SFC O'Connor fought with his personal weapon, \n     performed life-saving measures on the two wounded soldiers \n     in the open, exposed to enemy fire, shielding the \n     casualties from debris and shrapnel with his own body, and \n     gave instructions to begin the evacuation. As an Afghan \n     soldier assisted SSG Binney, SFC O'Connor picked up SGT \n     Feurst and began carrying him, unassisted, back to the \n     cover of the small building 150 meters away. He dodged \n     rocket-propelled grenade and machinegun fire, while \n     methodically maneuvering from one covered position to \n     another, without the benefit of his protective body armor, \n     carrying the unconscious SGT Feurst. He climbed over a two \n     meter high wall, into the building, as bullets pounded the \n     wall all around him. The frightened Afghan soldiers were \n     unable to assist in lifting SGT Feurst over the wall, \n     which required SFC O'Connor to climb back over the wall in \n     the face of heavy, accurate, enemy fire. He lifted and \n     pushed SGT Feurst over the wall, assisted SSG Binney over \n     by offering his own body as step, and climbed over a third \n     time himself, while a storm of bullets began \n     disintegrating the structure around him. As Apache \n     gunships suppressed the enemy, SFC O'Connor led the group \n     from the surrounded building, while still under fire, back \n     toward the quick reaction force. He then led his entire \n     force back toward MSG Maholic's compound. He engaged enemy \n     fighters and broke through to link up with the last of the \n     isolated elements. Inside the compound, he learned that \n     MSG Maholic had been killed. SFC O'Connor assumed duties \n     as Detachment Operations Sergeant and continued \n     coordinating the defense of the compound against renewed \n     Taliban attacks. He supervised all medical treatment of \n     the casualties, coordinated the medical evacuation flight \n     and organized the movement of ammunition from the resupply \n     aircraft. After nightfall, under SFC O'Connor's \n     leadership, the group broke out once again from their \n     isolated location and moved undetected through Taliban \n     positions to reunite all friendly elements at the \n     detachment's patrol base. SFC O'Connor's extraordinary \n     actions, performed at tremendous risk of life, \n     successfully rescued two wounded comrades, saved the lives \n     of 21 soldiers, and prevented his detachment's \n     destruction. He consolidated four friendly elements, each \n     isolated and surrounded by an aggressive, numerically \n     superior, and well armed enemy force during the confusion \n     of combat, and brought all soldiers to safety. The heroic \n     accomplishments of Sergeant First Class Brendan W. \n     O'Connor reflect great credit upon himself, the Combined \n     Joint Special Operations Task Force-Afghanistan, Special \n     Operations Command-Central, and the United States Army.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/11/19/senate-section/article/S10639-1", "month": "11", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10639]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO LINDA LONG\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER.

In \nfact, she served two terms on the Madison County Commission from 1994 \nto 2002. There is no doubt that Linda went above and beyond to help all \nconstituents.

Mr. President, in mid-June, I asked Idahoans to share with \nme how high energy prices are affecting their lives, and they responded \nby the hundreds. The stories, numbering well over 1,200, are \nheartbreaking and touching. While energy prices have dropped in recent \nweeks, the concerns expressed from June remain very relevant. To \nrespect the efforts of those who took the opportunity to share their \nthoughts, I am submitting every e-mail sent to me through an address \nset up specifically for this purpose to the Congressional Record. This \nis not an issue that will be easily resolved, but it is one that \ndeserves immediate and serious attention, and Idahoans deserve to be \nheard. Their stories not only detail their struggles to meet everyday \nexpenses, but also have suggestions and recommendations as to what \nCongress can do now to tackle this problem and find solutions that last \nbeyond today. I ask unanimous consent to have today's letters printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       I was/am in full support of your GPRA Energy Legislation. \n     You were right on. Please continue to fight for energy \n     independence for Idaho and the U.S. This is essential to our \n     national security and prosperity. It is never too late to do \n     the right thing (even if we should have done it ten years \n     ago). Please keep the pressure to allow Congress to vote on \n     crucial energy legislation. We deserve to know how our \n     Congress stands/votes on important issues like this. I am \n     also in favor of the President calling an emergency session \n     of Congress to pass energy legislation. It is that important.\n       Drill here, drill now, pay less.\n     Teresa, Twin Falls.\n                                  ____\n\n       Since July 11, [2008,] crude oil prices have declined over \n     16% yet gasoline prices at the pump have remained steady. \n     When is Congress going to start putting real pressure on the \n     oil companies to stop gouging the American consumer? If \n     Congress wants to turn the economy around, then start by \n     addressing energy prices. The oil companies raised gas prices \n     as crude oil prices escalated but there is no indication that \n     the reverse is true as crude prices continue to come down. \n     Enough is enough.\n     Galyn.\n                                  ____\n\n       You have expressed a desire to hear of our experiences and \n     hardships with the rise in gasoline prices. I have a daily \n     routine when I get to work. I get online and check for recent \n     news on gasoline prices and so forth. The next thing I do is \n     check on local gas prices by utilizing Mapquest.com. It is \n     severely disappointing to see that our eastern Idaho gasoline \n     prices have stabilized at $4.12 a gallon when the national \n     average is below $3.90 a gallon, according to a recent \n     yahoo.com article. Be that as it may, $3.90 is still a harsh \n     amount. This has become a pain not only economically but \n     domestically as well. Between my wife and I for the last \n     month and a half, there has been strife about our finances \n     and being able to afford the next meal, the bills, and all \n     that we wish we could do to make an advance in finances. \n     Colleagues and friends would argue the same domestic \n     problems. So you see that this problem is not only hurting \n     America economically but socially as well.\n       I have done my part in decreasing the amount I drive and \n     the amount of times I fill up on gasoline but this can only \n     go so far. I bought a scooter back in June just before \n     gasoline prices hit $120 a gallon and it has saved a \n     percentage of what we would have spent on filling our car. \n     Americans are aware of the problem and doing what they can \n     with reservation to consequences that may arise in their \n     conservation efforts. The question is not ``what should \n     Americans do to avoid the high prices in gasoline?'', rather; \n     the question is ``Why is the American government not making a \n     reasonable effort to free its people from economic \n     desperation?''\n       Start drilling now; let us build up a reserve and release \n     the current one, let us start looking for alternatives and \n     renewables. Our understanding will progress as the science \n     behind these progresses.\n       Sincerely,\n     Michael, Rexburg.\n                                  ____\n\n       Since I do not have unlimited income (I am an underpaid \n     Idaho teacher), or someone paying my fuel bills, the rising \n     cost of gas and diesel is taking spending money out of our \n     pockets and into our tanks since we need to drive to perform \n     many daily activities. We also spend less at other retailers \n     since the money went for fuel. We also get less for the same \n     dollar at the store since the price of goods has gone up due \n     to the rising costs of shipping using diesel fuel which is \n     the most expensive and should be the cheapest since it costs \n     less to make and comes off first in the processing of crude \n     oil to fuel. When we spend less the retailers get less and it \n     becomes a vicious circle. Let us start using our own oil and \n     uncap the wells in our country just sitting there. The \n     wildlife will be just fine in Alaska and elsewhere as long as \n     we are careful while drilling and transporting the oil. We \n     need to quit fueling the Arab terrorist groups by buying \n     their oil at inflated prices or at all. Do not tell me the \n     Saudis are our friends. The only thing they like about us is \n     our money.\n     Mel, Post Falls.\n                                  ____\n\n       Why do not the forces to be work together to get this \n     solved--or is there no representation for improving the \n     energy quantity?\n     Jim.\n                                  ____\n\n       We received an email at work stating that you would like to \n     know how we felt about high energy prices, along with ideas \n     on how to improve the situation. The energy prices are a \n     nuisance to me. I can handle the $50 per week it takes me to \n     get to and from work. What concerns me are my neighbors who \n     may be on the edge, or who need gasoline to make a living \n     (trucking, farming, construction).\n       To me the solution seems simple. Increase the supply. Let \n     us drill in ANWR. A vast majority of Alaskans favor the \n     proposition. We could do so in an environmentally responsible \n     way. Let us drill in the area between 50 miles and 200 miles \n     off the coast in those areas where the population is for it. \n     I understand in Virginia, most are in favor of it. I \n     understand that we are the only country that prevents its \n     people from doing this. And, by the way, why have not we \n     opened a refinery in the last 25 years? Many say that even if \n     we drill in ANWR, we will not see any oil for 10 years. That \n     may be, but if we had acted 10 years ago, we would be reaping \n     the benefits of it now. Besides, that might convince foreign \n     countries who have raised their prices so much that we are \n     serious about using our own resources and it may convince \n     them it is time to lower prices. The solution to energy \n     problems is going to take leadership, not short-sighted \n     thinking.\n       Also, we need to start building power plants powered by \n     nuclear energy. A power plant that uses petroleum for its \n     power source should no longer be allowed to be built. We can \n     no longer afford to waste petroleum like that, nor should we \n     pollute the air with those wastes, when we can capture and \n     process all nuclear wastes safely.\n       Of course we can use solar energy including wind where \n     feasible, but that will not solve our energy needs in the \n     future.\n       We should also not use crops that we need for our food \n     supply to produce ethanol, especially when it takes more \n     energy to produce the ethanol that we receive from the \n     resulting fuel. No wonder food prices are through the roof.\n       Some want to blame oil companies for making excessive \n     profits. A profit of 6 to 8% does not seem excessive to me. \n     When did it become illegal to make a profit in this country? \n     Higher taxes will not lower the price of gasoline. Let us \n     level the playing field and remove excessive regulations. \n     Sure, global warming is taking place, but we are not the \n     cause of that. It has to do with solar cycles. Spend a winter \n     in Idaho if you want to see global warming at work. The \n     farmers I know had to plant late this season because their \n     fields were covered with snow. The temperature in the world \n     decreased last year. It did not increase. Global warming is \n     not the problem. High energy prices are crippling the \n     economy. The polar bear population has increased, not \n     decreased. We are being sold a bill of goods that we cannot \n     afford to buy.\n       I know that the liberals are against everything I have \n     proposed. We are opposed to their supposed solution of \n     raising taxes. So does that mean that we have a stalemate and \n     nothing is going to be done? We need leadership.\n     Norman, Idaho Falls.\n                                  ____\n\n       I own a small 5-employee, garbage company that services the \n     cities of Kuna and Melba and indeed the recent run up in \n     diesel prices from $3/gallon to the current $4/gallon in the \n     last ten months has been a major impact on my business of \n     transporting solid waste for my small communities. I have \n     seen my fuel bill increase by nearly $4,000/month, a 63% \n     increase in that time frame.\n       As difficult as that is for me, the run up in prices has \n     had a major impact on my employees and their ability to come \n     to work and this is so true for all of Idaho's employees, \n     particularly those on the very bottom of the economic scale \n     of which there are too many in Idaho.\n       I could go on longer, but you know the impact. More \n     importantly, I think you need to hear from your constituents \n     regarding the solutions. We need a Manhattan-style project to \n     electrify our transportation sector of this country. We need \n     tax incentives for production and purchase of electric \n     vehicles.\n       We need tax incentives for wind, solar, lithium ion \n     batteries and electric motors (retrofitting out current gas \n     fleet with electric drive trains will provide a sustainable \n     new job creation and a finance business model that will be a \n     boon to our poor, who are being priced out of transportation, \n     and this will be paid for from displaced fuel dollars from \n     foreign oil purchases). We need to re-industrialize the USA \n     to create high paying jobs in the energy sector that will \n     give us sustainable energy so we can get out of our many oil \n     entanglements throughout the world.\n       Our nation mobilized itself to re-tool its whole industrial \n     base during WWII to create a war machine, plus provide all \n     the oil needed to win that war in the short span of 4-6 \n     years. In the same short time frame we have\n\n[[Page S10641]]\n\n     bankrupted ourselves in this senseless oil war in Iraq. We \n     need to understand that we need to get off of fossil fuels.\n       We can and we have to do better. The country needs strong \n     leadership and I have watched you, you are a person of \n     integrity. You can give us the leadership, even though it \n     will not be the party line. I pray you have the courage to \n     make a difference.\n       The American public deserves a choice to our energy needs \n     and tax incentives for solar and wind energy for our homes, \n     will take us in that direction. I know this is not consistent \n     with the Big Business energy and automobile business model, \n     but I think they do not see the wisdom of making hard \n     changes, tough choices and creating our own energy future.\n       The whole period of deregulation we have just gone through \n     has not been healthy for our country. Deregulation, from \n     Enron to sub-prime lending is bankrupting our country. For \n     the past 60 years the housing market has been stable and \n     predictable. Deregulation has been regulation for the wealthy \n     and well-positioned. We cannot continue to steal the hope for \n     the middle class on the back of the rich.\n       There have been two major fallacies foisted on the American \n     public. One is that tax cuts will stimulate jobs and drilling \n     oil will reduce gas prices. The wealthy citizens of our \n     country and the oil companies can be multi-national citizens \n     and their allegiances are to their own wealth accumulation, \n     just a factor of human nature.\n       We do not have nationalized oil, therefore oil drilling \n     will benefit the oil companies and the highest bidders in the \n     world market, yet the American public is led to believe, oil \n     drilling will have an appreciable impact on our local gas \n     prices, but indeed the nations with more wealth, able to bid \n     and buy the commodity will benefit. We are a debtor nation, \n     unlike China. Producing our own source of energy is critical \n     to changing that reality.\n       Tax cuts given to the wealthiest of our nation, without a \n     requirement that those tax cuts be re-invested in the USA \n     leaves those individuals the option to take those tax cuts \n     and invest them in the country of their choice, wherever they \n     can get the best return, again leaving the human instinct of \n     wealth accumulation to play out.\n       If we invest our tax cuts, in our own country and our own \n     energy interests, that will create local high paying jobs, we \n     will be investing in our own future, taking us out of the \n     status of debtor nation.\n       By the way, I, as well as Warren Buffet, am in the tax \n     bracket that was advantaged by the big tax cuts, and I and \n     Warren Buffet have both felt we would be glad to forego those \n     tax cuts for a strong economy.\n       Again, I ask that you have the courage to engage with any \n     in congress, in a bipartisan way, who is of a like mind to \n     take us to energy freedom. Jay Inslee the representative from \n     Washington State is a great proponent of energy issues and a \n     person like you, who is a person of integrity. I pray that \n     our representatives in Washington will have the sense of \n     urgency required to take the bold steps needed for the \n     American People.\n       As well, I might suggest, your staff get the hearing \n     minutes from a Senate hearing held this week on the energy \n     grid where T. Boone Pickens gave testimony where he stated \n     ``we cannot drill our way out of our current energy crisis'' \n     proposing wind energy as a major part of the solution. It was \n     a very enlightening hearing.\n       Thank you for your concern for the plight of your \n     constituents.\n     Tim, Kuna.\n                                  ____\n\n       As a person living on a fixed income, I find that the \n     soaring costs of energy in all forms are creating a \n     considerable burden on me. With gas at $4 per gallon, the \n     cost of everything is sky rocketing.\n       The U.S. is being held hostage by two bit dictators in the \n     energy market. And it is unnecessary. We are a country that \n     put a man on the moon over forty years ago, yet we have not \n     found ways of using our abundant coal resources in an \n     environmentally safe manner, and I am not seeing anything \n     being done about it. Why?\n       We spend hundreds of billions on foreign oil imports yet we \n     allow a few vocal nuts to keep us from developing our own \n     resources. We must tap the oil in the Alaska Wildlife \n     Reserve. Contrary to their claims, oil production and \n     wildlife are not incompatible. The noise and bustle of \n     drilling will cause the animals to leave temporarily, after \n     the drillers leave and the pumps and pipelines are in place \n     they will return.\n       We are often told that the lack of refinery capacity is \n     also a cause of high gas prices. How many new refineries are \n     currently under construction? How many are planned? When was \n     the last completed?\n     Alfred, Twin Falls.\n                                  ____\n\n       I wrote a response to your email about energy yesterday and \n     as I sat here another issue presented itself to me. This is \n     on a community level. My wife and I (with bad forethought) \n     bought The Roxy Theatre in Cascade. I say the above because \n     now many people do not have the extra money to spend seeing \n     movies or plays or concerts. Now after two years, seeing my \n     available credit shrink, and energy costs of my theatre go \n     up, I am looking at hard choices. I have chosen not to hire \n     employees back. This further hurts the overall economy as \n     there are 4 people who now have to find jobs. I have tried, \n     but I cannot find a way to end this bleeding. The power \n     company asked and got two very large rate hikes. Why are we \n     spending almost 2/3 of all the fuel refined in the USA making \n     power for the grids? We have been cut in the heel by a very \n     small but loud group of people who say we should have no more \n     reactors in the USA. Enough--the good of the few do not \n     outweigh the good of the many. We have always been a nation \n     formed on that. From my grandfather to my dad to my service \n     in the military, I know that. I have served for the good of \n     the many. I am still a police officer for the good of the \n     many. It is sure not for the pay. I read bills all of the \n     time that you all are debating on the Hill. I laugh; we spend \n     millions of bucks to help out some performing arts center in \n     New York. I provide the same arts to Americans too. I guess \n     we are too small in Idaho or Cascade, I should say. We could \n     all sit around and cry the blues, but nothing gets done. I \n     put on my uniform 4 days a week and my theatre clothes 7 days \n     a week, 364 days a year. I do this because it is for the good \n     of the many. [I think earmarks should be allowed for projects \n     that provide for the good of the many and my theatre would \n     qualify for assistance.] You, sir, are elected to serve. I \n     hear it just as much as you do. I do not mean that I am your \n     boss. I mean we put you there because we feel you can fix it. \n     I feel, given the responses you have seen, that Idaho's gems \n     have given you the ways to fix the problems you asked about. \n     We have to all give something up. Again, I have not asked you \n     to put me on a spending bill for aid to my 1939 theatre that \n     I am sure will not make it through the year. The small \n     business will not make it that long. When something big \n     happens to this country, everyone asks for federal aid. Major \n     snowstorms happen here, and it is not even reported. Four \n     inches of snow in Florida and every news channel is calling \n     it a disaster. We want this fixed before there is not debate \n     about it. . . It will be a disaster that no one will have \n     thought could happen. Many politicians say all of the time \n     small business is the backbone of the USA. We are all hurting \n     in this town. We are all getting close to going under. No \n     joke, come up here, I will buy you a movie. I'll show you \n     around like when the mill closed in 2000. We are on the \n     threshold of something very bad. Thanks for your time, I know \n     like me you do not have much to spare.\n     Jason, Cascade.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/11/19/senate-section/article/S10641-1", "month": "11", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10641-S10644]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         PAYMENTS TO RADIO HOST\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, several years ago, I started looking at \nthe financial relationships between physicians and drug companies. I am \ndoing this because I am concerned that there is very little \ntransparency on this issue. I have also learned that the little \ntransparency that does exist is not being enforced or is being enforced \ninconsistently.\n  For instance, the National Institutes of Health requires researchers \nto report outside payments to their institution if they receive a grant \nfrom the NIH. But I have learned that some researchers are failing to \nproperly report this money.\n  Recently, I examined payments from pharmaceutical companies to a \nprofessor of psychiatry at the University of Cincinnati. I found out \nthat she was not reporting tens of thousand of dollars in outside \nincome.\n  I then looked at a group of the world's most prominent child \npsychiatrists, in particular, three researchers at Harvard who have \ntaken millions of dollars from the drug companies. These doctors are \nfunded by several NIH grants, but they were not reporting all of their \nmoney from the drug companies as required by NIH regulations.\n  I then discovered a department chairman at Stanford who founded a \ncompany that was seeking approval from the Food and Drug Administration \nto market a drug for depression. The NIH is funding some research on \nthis drug which was being led by this same Stanford scientist. Because \nthere were some obvious conflicts with this situation, the NIH recently \nforced Stanford to pull this professor off the grant.\n  I also sent letters to the University of Texas and Emory University \nabout researchers at their institutions.\n  I would now like to discuss another troubling aspect about the lack \nof financial transparency in medicine.\n  ``The Infinite Mind'' is a radio show that is independently produced \nbut runs on over 300 public radio stations. It is possibly the most \nauthoritative program on psychology and neuroscience in America. This \nshow has won over 60 journalism awards. According to a biography of the \nshow's host, it has an audience of over half a million people.\n  Back in my home State of Iowa, ``The Infinite Mind'' is broadcast on \nmost Sundays, early in the evening. My guess is that thousands of \nIowans tune in. According to its own website, ``The Infinite Mind'' \nprides itself on its\n\n[[Page S10642]]\n\n``independence.'' But there may be some problems with their financial \ntransparency.\n  Last May, a couple of reporters for a news site called ``Slate'' \nwrote about an episode of ``The Infinite Mind'' called Prozac Nation: \nRevisited. During this episode, three guests on the show discussed \nproblems with antidepressants. After listening to a recording of the \nshow, it appeared to me that the real effect of this particular episode \nwas to undercut any criticism that antidepressants might be linked to \nan increased risk of suicide. This is an issue I tackled a few years \nback.\n  Maybe these three guests felt that there really is no problem with \nantidepressants. But a large number of experts believe that \nantidepressants may be associated with an increased risk of suicide, \nparticularly in kids. In fact, last March, two months before this show \naired, Britain's Medicines and Healthcare Regulatory Authority MHRA, \nconcluded a 4 year investigation of the antidepressant, Paxil. That \nreport found that GSK had been aware since 1998 that Paxil was \nassociated with a higher risk of suicidal behavior in adolescents.\n  Now don't get me wrong, experts on public radio have a right to \nexpress their own opinions. However, I am concerned that the host of \n``The Infinite Mind'' never pointed out that all three of the show's \nguests had strong financial ties to the pharmaceutical industry.\n  That is right. Every one of them. And this was never mentioned during \nthe program or by the guests who appeared.\n  What listeners also never learned is that the host of ``The Infinite \nMind'' has his own ties to drugmakers. When a show runs on National \nPublic Radio, NPR, doesn't the public have a right to know where the \nshow's host gets his money?\n  The host of ``The Infinite Mind'' is Dr. Frederick Goodwin, who I am \ntold, is one of our country's leading experts on bipolar disorder. In \nfact, he has written the definitive textbook on bipolar disorder. He is \nnow an adjunct professor at George Washington University Medical Center \nand was formerly the director of the National Institute of Mental \nHealth.\n  But what you would never know about Dr. Goodwin is that he is also a \npaid spokesman for several drug companies. Now, I don't know how much \nmoney Dr. Goodwin actually receives from all the drug companies, but \nbased on documents my office has received from GlaxoSmithKline, I do \nknow that GlaxoSmithKline pays him around $2500 for every talk his \ngives on treatments for bipolar disorder and depression. These talks \nconcerned several drugs such as Wellbutrin, Eskalith, and Lamictal.\n  Based on documents that my office received from GlaxoSmithKline, Dr. \nGoodwin gives these talks to doctor groups around the country. So far \nthis year, Glaxo reports that the company paid Dr. Goodwin over \n$130,000 for over 50 different talks. Of course, Dr. Goodwin may be \nmaking more money from other drug companies, but I only asked \nGlaxoSmithKline for their information. I do know from a scientific \npaper that Dr. Goodwin published that he has also given talks on behalf \nof Pfizer, Solvay, Janssen, Eli Lilly, Astra Zeneca and Bristol Myers \nSquibb. And he has served as a consultant for many of these companies, \nas well.\n  In fact, Dr. Goodwin was very busy the week that the episode of \nProzac Nation: Revisited started airing last March 26. \nGlaxoSmithKline's records show that the company paid Dr. Goodwin for \nseveral talks he gave that week on bipolar disorder and Lamictal.\n  In fact, records show that he gave around eight talks at $2500 each, \nbringing him around $20,000 in payments. Several of the talks were done \nby teleconference, but Dr. Goodwin also spoke about Lamictal at \nFleming's Prime Steakhouse in Birmingham, Michigan and the Rosebud \nSteak House in Schaumburg, IL.\n  Based upon the information provided to my staff, Dr. Goodwin was also \nvery active on behalf of Glaxo in 2005. That year, Glaxo paid Dr. \nGoodwin over $300,000 in speaking fees and around $25,000 in expenses \nto discuss their products. And this was the same year that he hosted an \nepisode for ``The Infinite Mind'' on bipolar disorder in kids. Again \nthere was no disclosure on the show about Dr. Goodwin's financial ties \nto GlaxoSmithKline or other drug companies.\n  Let's take this one step further. When an episode on bipolar disorder \nfirst aired on September 20, 2005, Dr. Goodwin was once again on the \nroad for the Glaxo. Glaxo's records show that the company paid him \n$2500 for a talk he gave that day on drug therapy for bipolar disorder. \nThe talk was at Lemonia, a Tuscan restaurant located at the Ritz \nCarlton Golf Resort in Naples, FL.\n  I don't think it takes a journalism or ethics professor to figure out \nthat listeners of a national radio show should be told about the host's \nfinancial interests. It just seems obvious. This type of information \nshould be out in the open and transparent.\n  People should know that since 2000, GlaxoSmithKline has paid the host \nof a radio program on psychiatry over $1.2 million in speaking fees and \nover $100,000 in expenses. People should know that, based on \ninformation from Glaxo, most of these fees were paid to Dr. Goodwin \nthrough Best Practice, a pharmaceutical consulting firm that he helped \nestablish in the late nineties. Among the many services that have been \noffered by Best Practice are marketing consultation, and the \n``dissemination of new off label information.''\n  Now, I have already pointed out that this independently produced \nradio show runs on over 300 public radio stations. But it also runs on \nNPR's satellite station. This got the attention of Margaret Low Smith, \na vice president at NPR. She has stated that any show that runs on \nNPR's satellite station, and I quote, ``must live up to NPR standards \n.''\n  So I would like to go over some of those standards as found on NPR's \nown website. According to NPR's own policies, and I quote, ``confidence \nin us as independent and fair means avoiding actual and apparent \nconflicts of interest or engaging in outside activities, public comment \nor writing that calls into question our ability to report fairly on a \nsubject.''\n  The policy also states that an individual covered under this code \n``has the responsibility to disclose potential conflicts of interest.''\n  I think these are very fair standards on transparency, and I hope \nthat shows running on NPR will try to live up to them in the future.\n  It is not my job as a Senator to screen newspapers, the evening news \nor national radio for my constituents. But it is my job to watch out \nfor taxpayers' money. According to its website and promotional comments \nmade during many of the show's episodes, ``The Infinite Mind'' has been \nmade possible, at times, by major underwriting from the National \nScience Foundation and the National Institutes of Health.\n  And that is why I am sending out two letters one to the National \nInstitutes of Health and another to the National Science Foundation.\n  The recently departed director of NIH has already acknowledged that \nthey have problems with their policies when it comes to researchers not \nreporting outside income. I commend him for recognizing this fact. I \nalso know that the NIH plans on changing its regulations to tighten up \ndisclosure requirements.\n  But I am not certain about the disclosure requirements when the NIH \nhelps to fund a show like ``The Infinite Mind.'' I am going to ask the \nNIH to see if they require ``The Infinite Mind'' to disclose the money \nthat drug companies pay to the show's host.\n  And I am asking the NSF to explain their policies on financial \ndisclosure to see if they might need some changes as well.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have my letters to the National Institutes \nof Health and the National Science Foundation printed in the Record. I \nwould also like to commend GlaxoSmithKline for their cooperation with \nthe Committee and their commitment to transparency. It is greatly \nappreciated.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                         Committee on Finance,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 19, 2008.\n     Raynard S. Kington, M.D., Ph.D.,\n     Acting Director, National Institutes of Health,\n     Rockville Pike, Bethesda, MD.\n       Dear Acting Director Kington: As a senior member of the \n     United States Senate and the Ranking Member of the Committee \n     on\n\n[[Page S10643]]\n\n     Finance (Committee), I have a duty under the Constitution to \n     conduct oversight into the actions of executive branch \n     agencies, including the activities of the National Institutes \n     of Health (NIH/Agency). In this capacity, I must ensure that \n     NIH properly fulfills its mission to advance the public's \n     welfare and makes responsible use of the public funding \n     provided for medical studies. This research often forms the \n     basis for action taken by the Medicare and Medicaid programs.\n       Once again I would like to bring to NIH's attention my \n     concerns about the lack of oversight regarding conflicts of \n     interest relating to the almost $24 billion in annual grants \n     that are distributed by the NIH. I understand that you are \n     now attempting to change the regulations covering the \n     extramural research program to ensure more accountability in \n     financial disclosure. I appreciate your work in this area.\n       As you know, institutions receiving an NIH research grant \n     are required to manage the grantee's conflicts of interest. I \n     would like now to let you know that I have discovered another \n     problem with an NIH grantee and a lack of financial \n     transparency.\n       In particular, I am concerned about a radio show that \n     discusses psychology and neuroscience called ``The Infinite \n     Mind.'' This show, as I understand it, is independently \n     produced and is distributed to over 300 public radio stations \n     and appears on National Public Radio's (NPR) satellite \n     channel. According to this show's website and promotional \n     comments made during several of the show's episodes, ``The \n     Infinite Mind'' claims to receive major underwriting from the \n     National Institutes of Health and the National Institute of \n     Mental Health.\n       The host of the ``The Infinite Mind'' is research professor \n     Dr. Frederick Goodwin. However, I have learned that while \n     hosting this radio program, Dr. Goodwin also received \n     substantial compensation from drug companies. In the fine \n     print of an article he published in the Journal of the \n     American Medical Association in 2003, Dr. Goodwin \n     acknowledged that he ``has served on the speaker's bureaus \n     of Glaxo, Solvay, Janssen, Pfizer, Lilly, AstraZeneca, and \n     Bristol-Myers Squibb; and has served as a consultant for \n     Glaxo, Solvay, Pfizer, Lilly, Bristol-Myers Squibb Elan, \n     and Novartis.'' For example, over the last seven years, \n     Dr. Goodwin received over $1.3 million in speaking fees \n     and honoraria from GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) for giving over \n     480 talks. I discovered this fact through documents that I \n     received from GSK.\n       I have attached a chart detailing the information that GSK \n     supplied to my staff. Many of the payments to Dr. Goodwin \n     were made through a company called Best Practice LLC (BP). \n     Based upon independent research conducted by my staff, it \n     appears that Dr. Goodwin founded BP along with several other \n     scientists in the late nineties. It is my understanding that \n     BP advises pharmaceutical companies.\n       As mentioned earlier, when one listens to ``The Infinite \n     Mind'' there is an acknowledgment that NIH money helps to \n     underwrite its production. Accordingly I would appreciate any \n     information that you could provide me regarding financial \n     disclosure requirements applicable to this situation. It \n     seems to me that if the federal government provides financial \n     support for a radio program that is heard by hundreds of \n     thousands of American citizens, then the financial \n     transparency of that show's host is important.\n       In light of this, I would appreciate gaining a greater \n     understanding of the NIH grants received by ``The Infinite \n     Mind'' and the applicable NIH policies on financial \n     disclosure. Accordingly, please respond to the following \n     questions and requests for information. For each response, \n     please repeat the enumerated request and follow with the \n     appropriate answer. The time span of this request covers \n     January 2000 to the present.\n       (1) Please provide a list of all NIH grants that have \n     supported ``The Infinite Mind.''

Bement, Jr.\n     Director, National Science Foundation, Wilson Boulevard, \n         Arlington, VA.\n       Dear Director Bement: As a senior member of the United \n     States Senate and the Ranking Member of the Committee on \n     Finance (Committee), I have a duty under the Constitution to \n     conduct oversight into the actions of executive branch \n     agencies, including the activities of the National Science \n     Foundation (NSF). In this capacity, I must ensure that NSF \n     properly fulfills its mission to advance the public's welfare \n     and makes responsible use of the public funding provided for \n     scientific studies and education. Research and educational \n     programs sponsored by the NSF may influence public opinion \n     and can affect actions taken by the Medicare and Medicaid \n     programs.\n       I would like to bring to your attention my concerns about \n     the apparent lack of oversight regarding conflicts of \n     interest relating to the almost $6 billion in annual grants \n     that are distributed by the NSF. As you know, institutions \n     receiving an NSF research grant are required to ``manage'' \n     the grantee's conflicts of interest.\n       In particular, I am concerned about a radio show that \n     discusses psychology and neuroscience called ``The Infinite \n     Mind.'' This show, as I understand it, is: independently \n     produced; distributed to over 300 public radio stations; and \n     appears on National Public Radio's (NPR) satellite channel. \n     According to this show's website and promotional comments \n     made during several of the show's episodes, ``The Infinite \n     Mind'' claims to receive major underwriting from the NSF.\n       The host of the ``The Infinite Mind'' is research professor \n     Dr. Frederick Goodwin. However, I have learned that while \n     hosting this radio program, Dr. Goodwin also received \n     substantial compensation from drug companies. In the fine \n     print of an article he published in the Journal of the \n     American Medical Association in 2003, Dr. Goodwin \n     acknowledged that he ``has served on the speaker's bureaus of \n     Glaxo, Solvay, Janssen, Pfizer, Lilly, AstraZeneca, and \n     Bristol-Myers Squibb; and has served as a consultant for \n     Glaxo, Solvay, Pfizer, Lilly, Bristol-Myers\n\n[[Page S10644]]\n\n     Squibb Elan, and Novartis.'' For example, over the last seven \n     years, Dr. Goodwin has received over $1.3 million in \n     speaking fees and honoraria from GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) for \n     giving over 480 talks. I discovered this fact through \n     documents that I received from GSK.\n       For your review and future reference, I have attached a \n     chart detailing the information that GSK supplied to my \n     staff. Many of the payments to Dr. Goodwin were made through \n     a company called Best Practice LLC (BP). Based upon \n     independent research conducted by my staff, it appears that \n     Dr. Goodwin founded BP along with several other scientists in \n     the late nineties. It is my understanding that BP advises \n     pharmaceutical companies.\n       As mentioned earlier, when one listens to ``The Infinite \n     Mind'' there is an acknowledgment that NSF money helps to \n     underwrite its production. Accordingly I would appreciate any \n     information that NSF could provide regarding financial \n     disclosure requirements applicable to this situation. It \n     seems to me that if the federal government provides financial \n     support for a radio program that is heard by hundreds of \n     thousands of American citizens, then the financial \n     transparency of that show's host is important.\n       In light of this, I would appreciate gaining a greater \n     understanding of the NSF grants provided to ``The Infinite \n     Mind'' and the applicable NSF policies relating either \n     directly or indirectly to financial disclosure. Accordingly, \n     please respond to the following questions and requests for \n     information. For each response, please repeat the enumerated \n     request followed by the appropriate answer. The time span of \n     this request covers January 2000 to the present.\n       (1) Please provide a list of all NSF funds that have \n     supported ``The Infinite Mind.'' For each grant, please \n     provide the following:\n       a. Name of grant and/or contract;\n       b. Topic of grant/contract; and\n       c. Amount of funding for grant/contract;\n       d. Amount of funding provided in grant/contract for the \n     host of the show; and\n       e. Supporting documents on financial disclosure, pertinent \n     to the grant/contract.\n       (2) Please provide a list of all NSF grants, if any, made \n     to Dr. Frederick Goodwin. For each grant, please provide the \n     following:\n       a. Name of grant;\n       b. Topic/purpose of the grant; and\n       c. Amount of funding for the grant.\n       (3) For each of the above identified grants, please answer \n     the following questions regarding financial disclosure:\n       a. Please explain the applicable NSF rules on financial \n     disclosure required for the grant; and\n       b. Please confirm that applicable rules on financial \n     disclosure were followed by the grantee.\n       (4) Please provide a list of any other interactions that \n     Dr. Goodwin has had with the NSF including membership on \n     advisory boards, peer review on grants, or the like.\n       (5) Please provide a list of all NSF grants that have \n     supported National Public Radio. For each grant, please \n     provide the following:\n       a. Name of grant;\n       b. Topic of grant; and\n       c.

Please explain the applicable NSF rules on financial \n     disclosure required for the grant/contracts; and\n       b. Please confirm that applicable rules on financial \n     disclosure were followed by the grantee.\n       In cooperating with the Committee's review, no documents, \n     records, data, or other information related to these matters, \n     either directly or indirectly, shall be destroyed, modified, \n     removed, or otherwise made inaccessible to the Committee.\n       I request your prompt attention to this matter.

Mr. President, I wish to commemorate I Love to Write Day. \nThe designation of November 15 as I Love to Write Day allows the Nation \nto focus much-needed attention on the value and importance of \npracticing writing skills at every age.\n  I Love to Write Day was created by Delaware author John Riddle in \n2002. John came up with the idea for I Love to Write Day while driving \nfrom his home in Delaware to the Blue Ridge Mountain Christian Writers \nConference in Ashville, NC. That first year, more than 11,000 schools \nacross the country signed up to participate in I Love to Write Day \nevents and activities.\n  Since Delaware Governor Ruth Ann Minner officially declared November \n15th as I Love to Write Day in 2002, nine other Governors have joined \nin recognizing it, and more than 20,000 schools participated last year.\n  This year, Children's Way Foundation teamed up with Mr. Riddle to \nbring together 50,000 elementary schools throughout the country to \nprovide students with the opportunity to discover and develop the \ntalent of writing.\n  John Riddle currently resides in Bear, DE, and knows the value of \nwriting first hand. For the last 30 years, he has been a freelance \nauthor writing for magazines, trade journals and Web sites, and is the \nauthor of 34 books. He is a frequent presenter at writers conferences \nall across the country and spoke last year at the National Press Club \nin Washington, DC.\n  Writing is vital to improve communication skills and to challenge \nminds.

Mr. President, I would like to take this \nopportunity to recognize an extraordinary couple in the musical world, \nAlan and Marilyn Bergman, who were recently honored by the renowned \nPaley Center for Media. Formerly known as the Museum of Television & \nRadio, the Paley Center for Media is nationally recognized for its \nefforts to engage communities in a dialogue around the cultural, \ncreative, and social significance of television, radio, and other \nemerging media platforms.\n  This year, Alan and Marilyn Bergman are celebrating 50 years of a \nmusical partnership that has enchanted and engaged people around the \nworld. In honor of their extraordinary careers, the Paley Center for \nMedia hosted two very special events to pay tribute to the Bergmans, \nthe first in New York on May 21, 2008, and the second in Los Angeles on \nNovember 3, 2008. The two events were part of the Paley Center for \nMedia's ``Paley After Dark'' series, which features only a select few \nartists each year.\n\n[[Page S10645]]\n\n  Though Alan and Marilyn's personal life stories may not be widely \nknown--both were born and raised in the same Brooklyn, NY, \nneighborhood, but it wasn't until they moved to Los Angeles in the \n1950s that they met, fell in love, and married--it is hard to find a \nperson who isn't familiar with one of the Bergmans' many famous songs. \nStarting with one of their first breakthrough successes, a song \nentitled ``Sleep Warm,'' which appeared as the title track on an album \nreleased by Dean Martin in 1959, the Bergmans kicked off a musical \ncareer that has lasted half a century.\n  In 1968, the Bergmans won their first Oscar for ``The Windmills of \nYour Mind,'' the theme song from the ``Thomas Crown Affair.'' This was \njust the beginning for Alan and Marilyn. Later, in 1968, ``The \nWindmills of Your Mind'' also won a Golden Globe award. In 1973, Alan \nand Marilyn won two Grammys, an Oscar, and a Golden Globe award for \n``The Way We Were,'' starring Barbara Streisand and Robert Redford. In \n1984, they won another Oscar for the score for ``Yentl,'' and won Emmys \nfor ``Sybil,'' ``Queen of the Stardust Ballroom,'' ``Ordinary \nMiracles'' and ``A Ticket to Dream.'' In 1995, Alan and Marilyn wrote \nthe Golden Globe-, Oscar-, and Grammy-nominated song ``Moonlight.'' \nJust a few years ago, Alan and Marilyn were commissioned by the Kennedy \nCenter to write a jazz song cycle which received widespread acclaim. \nAnd just last year, Alan released his first album as a vocalist, \n``Lyrically,'' featuring some of his and Marilyn's most well-known \nsongs. The reviews were phenomenal.\n  During their New York and Los Angeles visits, the Bergmans performed \na few of their hit songs and treated the audiences to a special \nquestion-and-answer session with Pat Mitchell, the Paley Center for \nMedia's president and CEO. Though the Bergmans have been partners for \nmore than 50 years, it was clearly evident that their rapport with each \nother shines through as strongly today as it did when they first met.\n  For half a century, Alan and Marilyn have written the lyrics and \nmusic to some of the world's most recognizable and unforgettable songs. \nTheir dedication and passion for life is evident in both their marriage \nand in the work they do. It is no wonder, then, that the Paley Center \nfor Media has honored the Bergmans as part of its ``Paley After Dark'' \nseries.\n  As their U.S. Senator, I join the Paley Center for Media in honoring \nand giving my most sincere congratulations to Alan and Marilyn, one of \nthe most respected songwriting teams in music today, for enriching the \nlives of so many. And for the sake of all of us, I trust that their \njoint efforts will continue for many more years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/11/19/senate-section/article/S10645-1", "month": "11", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10645]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO LAWERENCE CANFIELD\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in \nhonoring the life of Sacramento County sheriff's deputy Lawrence \n``Larry'' Canfield, who was tragically killed in the line of duty on \nNovember 12, 2008, when his patrol motorcycle was hit while pursuing a \nspeeding vehicle.\n  Deputy Canfield was raised in Galt, CA, where he graduated from Galt \nHigh School. After graduation he joined the U.S. Army where he served \nfor 4 years. He later followed his father's footsteps and joined the \nSacramento County Sheriff's Department. For 13 years, Deputy Canfield \ntook great pride in his service to the Sacramento County Sheriff's \nDepartment. To his colleagues he was known for his dedication to law \nenforcement and passion for serving with the motorcycle division.\n  Deputy Canfield is survived by his loving wife of 16 years, Michelle, \nand children Tyler and Bryce. Deputy Canfield will be remembered as a \ndedicated husband, proud father, loving son, devoted friend, and \nrespected colleague. Deputy Canfield served Sacramento County with \nhonor and bravery and fulfilled his oath as an officer of the law. His \ncontributions to public safety and dedication to law enforcement are \ngreatly appreciated and will serve as an example of his legacy.\n  We shall be grateful for Deputy Canfield's heroic service and the \nsacrifices he made while serving and protecting the community that he \nloved.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/11/19/senate-section/article/S10645-2", "month": "11", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10645-S10646]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    REMEMBERING JAMES JOSEPH DURANT\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, today I wish to commemorate the \nlife of a true American patriot--Mr. James Joseph Durant of Scarborough \nME--and to mourn his passing.\n  Mr. Durant died in the line of duty almost two years ago while \nserving his community through the Volunteers in Police Services, VIPS, \nprogram.\n  His premature death not only devastated his family but left a void in \nthe life and social fabric of his community and his State.\n  Mr. Durant led an admirable and remarkable life. He was married for \n47 years to his high school sweetheart, Janine. They began dating in \ntheir sophomore year when they were forced to share her English book \nbecause he had conveniently forgotten his own. Mr. Durant was a \ndedicated and caring father to their three children and a doting \ngrandfather of five.\n  He was a decorated U.S. Army soldier and combat veteran of the \nVietnam War. Mr. Durant's loyalty to the Army and to his country was so \nprofound that he refused a deferral from deployment to Vietnam to which \nhe was entitled when his wife discovered that she was pregnant with \ntheir second child.\n  After his return from Vietnam, Mr. Durant dedicated his life to \npublic service. He worked with distinction for over 25 years as an \nelectronic technician for the Federal Aviation Administration at the \nPortland International Jetport. He also volunteered for many activities \nand programs in Scarborough, including VIPS, where he patrolled parking \nlots on behalf of the local police department.\n  Sadly, it was this commitment to public service that ultimately cost \nhim his life. On December 15, 2006, while serving the citizens of \nScarborough in his capacity as a member of VIPS, Mr. Durant responded \nto a nearby traffic accident.\n  He was helping the under-manned police department by directing \ntraffic when a vehicle struck him from behind. Although Mr. Durant was \nnot a career officer, Scarborough honored him with local law-\nenforcement honors at his funeral. His was the first death of an \nofficer in the line of duty in Scarborough's modern history.\n  Mr. Durant responded to the Nation's call for citizens to volunteer \nto help secure our homeland after the terrorist attacks of September \n11, 2001. Managed on behalf of the Departments of Homeland Security and \nJustice by the International Association of Chiefs of Police, VIPS \nprovides an opportunity for ordinary citizens to volunteer in law \nenforcement. As a volunteer law enforcement officer, Mr. Durant made \nhis community safer, stronger, and a better place to live.\n  Unfortunately, after Mr. Durant sacrificed his life heeding that call \nto service, the Federal government compounded his family's loss by \ndenying their application for federal death benefits under the Public \nSafety Officer Benefits, PSOB, program.\n  According to the Department of Justice which administers the PSOB \nprogram, Mr. Durant did not qualify as a ``public safety officer'' \nwithin the meaning of the law.\n  The PSOB program has been plagued with problems since its inception. \nMost of the national law enforcement and fire services organizations, \nsuch as the International Association of Fire Fighters, the \nInternational Association of Fire Chiefs, the Fraternal Order of \nPolice, and the National Sheriff's Association, have long complained \nabout the huge backlog of benefit applications and DoJ's overly strict \ninterpretation of the law.\n  If we truly hope to encourage more Americans like Mr. Durant to \nengage in volunteer activities that safeguard our homeland, we must \nensure that their families are taken care of in the event that they die \nwhile performing duties that public safety officers would have \notherwise performed.\n  Mr. Durant is the first and so far only VIPS participant to have died \nin the line of duty. It would be folly to assume that he will be the \nlast. That is why I believe that Congress should provide volunteers \nparticipating in VIPS and the Fire Corps, another potentially dangerous \ncitizen volunteer program, with death benefits similar to those \nprovided under the PSOB program.\n\n[[Page S10646]]\n\n  I fully recognize that proposing to expand the PSOB program--even if \nnarrowly--is controversial. But I also believe that such an expansion \nis necessary. In the future, I hope to reach agreement with my friends \nin the first responder community on a way to protect the families of \nvolunteers, like Mr. Durant, who lose their lives protecting the \ncitizens of this Nation.\n  I also pledge to continue working with them to ensure that the DoJ \naddresses their justifiable concerns with the administration of the \nPSOB program.\n  As a nation, we owe it to our first responders--whether career or \nvolunteer--to care for their families when they have made the ultimate \nsacrifice to protect us. While I regret that the Federal Government has \nnot fulfilled this obligation to Janine Durant and her family, I am \ncommitted to ensuring that our Nation treats its heroes honorably.\n  Mr. Durant was an ordinary American who did extraordinary things. \nHaving already served his country in combat, having work and family \nobligations, he made the extra effort to serve his community, and lost \nhis life in the process.\n  We are all poorer for his death, but we can redeem it by providing \nequitable treatment for the families of other volunteers who may perish \nwhile serving the public good.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/11/19/senate-section/article/S10646-1", "month": "11", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10646]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO MARTIN HANSON\n\n Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I would like to commemorate \nthe life of the great Wisconsin conservationist Martin Hanson. \nWisconsin lost one of the best environmental stewards of the last \ncentury on October 22 when Martin passed away in beautiful northern \nWisconsin. I join so many other Wisconsinites, and conservationists \nnationwide, in paying tribute to Martin Hanson's memory.\n  Martin Hanson dedicated his life to protecting the Wisconsin \nlandscape he loved. His legacy will carry on for many years to come in \nthe peaceful shorelines, deep forests, and shimmering lakes of our \nState. Thanks to Martin's tireless work, future generations of \nWisconsinites will fall in love with the great outdoors just as he did.\n  The Apostle Islands, a great Wisconsin treasure along Lake Superior, \nhave been kept nearly pristine because of his environmental advocacy. \nLike so many other Wisconsinites, I travel to the Apostle Islands as \noften as I can to enjoy the spectacular scenery. Wisconsin has Martin \nHanson, as well as Gaylord Nelson, to thank for protecting this \nWisconsin treasure. The work of these two giants of Wisconsin's \nconservation movement helped make possible my own efforts to preserve \nthe Apostle Islands and designate almost 80 percent of them as \nfederally protected wilderness.\n  Generations of Wisconsinites are indebted to Martin Hanson, who was a \nkey architect of our State's tradition of environmental conservation. \nSo today I honor his memory, celebrate his extraordinary life, and give \nthanks for his outstanding legacy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/11/19/senate-section/article/S10646-2", "month": "11", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10646]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO BILL QUINBY\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, there are few more accomplished \ncitizens of Iowa than Bill--William--Quinby. I use the word ``citizen'' \non purpose because along with his wife Janice, Bill's life continues to \nbe a model of ideal citizenship and embodies what it means to be an \nIowan.\n  Bill has spent his life living by a simple mantra: work hard and give \nback. In college at the University of Iowa, Bill was a two-time letter \nwinner in baseball as an athlete and again in football as a team \nmanager. He used these experiences to help his community, and for 11 \nyears he served as an educator in the Cedar Rapids School District in \nvarious positions as an athletic director, teacher, and principal. \nAfter a stint in the private sector, he later served as the director of \ncareer counseling and as the athletics director at Coe College, one of \nIowa's finest small colleges. Along with these years of service to his \ncommunity, Bill also served for years as a high school, college, and \nprofessional football official, serving in such big games as the Rose \nBowl, Orange Bowl, and Super Bowl XIX.\n  Yet despite this impressive career, I know that Bill would tell you \nthat he is just as proud, if not more so, of his combined 150 years of \nservice on boards and commissions of various charitable organizations \nin his community. Some of these groups include the Hawkeye Area Boy \nScouts, the Cedar Rapids Jaycees, the Cedar Rapids Community Theater, \nHabitat for Humanity, the Cedar Rapids Community Free Clinic, and the \nCedar Rapids Board of Ethics in Government.\n  I would be remiss if I did not emphasize the large amount of time \nthat Bill has put into a cause that is also close to my heart. As a \nvolunteer for the Special Olympics, Bill has been fighting for equality \nfor persons with disabilities. While the legislative work in Washington \ncan help create a more equal legal framework, the work of volunteers \nlike Bill is what allows equality to emerge in practice.\n  To honor these services to the community, Bill was recently awarded \nthe University of Iowa's Lifetime Achievement award. Congratulations, \nBill. And let me extend to you heartfelt thanks for your inspiration \nand work to better eastern Iowa.\n  I ask to have an article about Bill from the August 27, 2008, Cedar \nRapids Gazette printed in the Record.\n  The material follows.\n\n                    Quinby Gives Lifetime of Service\n\n             [From the Cedar Rapids Gazette, Aug. 27, 2008]\n\n       Cedar Rapids.--Bill Quinby once punched in the stomach a \n     Minnesota football fan who was pestering Iowa Coach Forest \n     Evashevski, thus earning the nickname ``Punchy'' from the \n     appreciative head coach.\n       But that's not why he'll receive a lifetime achievement \n     award from the University of Iowa on Saturday when the \n     Hawkeyes host Maine.\n       Quinby, 76, will be honored for his lifetime of community \n     service in Cedar Rapids and the surrounding area. That punch \n     during a Big Ten game at Minnesota in 1952 is just one of the \n     many stories he has from a lifetime of memories as an \n     educator, Big Ten and NFL referee, philanthropist, public \n     servant, and all-around good guy.\n       Quinby will be saluted Saturday along with retired Air \n     Force Gen. Donald J. Kutyna, who had a distinguished military \n     career. Quinby marvels at the company he's in: A working-\n     class kid from Cedar Rapids and a decorated U.S. general.\n       ``Let's put it this way,'' he said Wednesday. ``I'm humbled \n     as hell. And honored.''\n       Quinby's many friends and admirers will tell you it's a \n     well-deserved award and has little to do with his work as a \n     Big Ten football official for 13 years or his service as an \n     NFL referee for 17 years. Rather, it's a tribute to all the \n     help he's given others.\n       He's served on the board of directors for the Hawkeye Area \n     Boy Scouts, Cedar Rapids Jaycees, Cedar Rapids Community \n     Theatre, Cedar Rapids Kids League Baseball, Cedar Rapids \n     Sports Club, Cedar Rapids Professional Baseball Club, \n     Cerebral Palsy Association, Arc of Eastern Iowa, Cedar Rapids \n     Kernels Foundation, Cedar Rapids Ice Arena, Camp Courageous, \n     Habitat for Humanity, Special Olympics, National Shrine \n     Athletic Committee, and the Linn Area Credit Union. He's \n     served on the Regional Planning Commission, the Cedar Rapids \n     Recreation Commission, the Five Seasons Facility Commission, \n     the Civil Service Commission, and the Cedar Rapids Board of \n     Ethics in Government.\n       ``I always felt it was best to help people who possibly \n     needed help,'' he said. ``I mean, look at how lucky I've \n     been. I truly feel very good about being born here, raised \n     here and I've lived here all my life. Look how good it's been \n     for me.''\n       Quinby and his wife, Janis, have been married for 53 years. \n     They have four children and nine grandchildren, although one \n     of their children, Billy, died tragically in a traffic \n     accident as a young man.\n       Quinby was an accomplished athlete at Franklin High School \n     in Cedar Rapids, but three knee operations prevented him from \n     playing football at Iowa. He received two varsity letters in \n     baseball with the Hawkeyes and got two varsity letters in \n     football as the team's manager, which is why he was at \n     Evashevski's side when that unruly Minnesota fan left his \n     seat behind the UI bench and confronted Evy, claiming players \n     were obstructing his view of the field.\n       Quinby, who did a little boxing in college, rushed to \n     Evashevski's side and slugged the guy a couple of times in \n     the stomach, making him double over in pain. ``Thanks,'' \n     Evashevski said after the game.\n       ``See how lucky I've been to be around?'' Quinby said with \n     a smile. ``For a guy that grew up at Daniels Park and was \n     nothing at Iowa, I feel very lucky.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/11/19/senate-section/article/S10646-3", "month": "11", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10646-S10647]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO GENERAL BRUCE CARLSON\n\n Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize GEN Bruce \nCarlson, one of our most distinguished commanders who will retire from \nthe U.S. Air Force on January 1, 2009, after\n\n[[Page S10647]]\n\ncompleting 37 years of distinguished service to our Nation.\n  General Carlson currently serves as the Commander of the Air Force \nMateriel Command--AFMC--in Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, OH. As \nCommander of AFMC, General Carlson manages the command's 77,000 people \nin research, development, test, and evaluation while providing the \nacquisition management services and logistics support required to \ndevelop, procure, and sustain Air Force weapon systems. His workforce \nof active duty, civilian, and contractor personnel are the unsung \nheroes, managing an annual budget of over $56 billion, more than 40 \npercent of the total AF budget, and ensuring our warfighters are \nequipped with the best equipment in the world.\n  General Carlson was born in Hibbing, MN, and began his accomplished \ncareer in 1971 when he graduated as a ``Distinguished Graduate'' from \nthe Air Force ROTC program at the University of Minnesota, Duluth. From \nthe day he pinned on his butter bars through his four silver stars, Gen \nBruce Carlson has been a leader and continues to lead and mentor airmen \nin the air and on the ground.\n  After graduating from the University of Minnesota, he went on to \nundergraduate pilot training at Vance Air Force Base in Oklahoma--a \nbase I know well and the finest pilot training base in the U.S. His \nfirst assignment out of pilot training was in the F-4 Phantom II and \nthen he transitioned into the OV-10 Bronco and A-10 Warthog. During his \ncareer he logged over 3,300 flying hours to include combat time in the \nOV-10. His work ethic and unparalleled skill resulted in his posting to \npositions of influence in the offices of the Secretary of the Air Force \nand Secretary of Defense. His skill as a pilot and a leader led to \nvarious flying assignments, including commanding the 49th Fighter Wing \nat Holloman Air Force Base, NM, the Air Force's first stealth fighter \nwing.\n  As with every great officer, his star continued to rise as he met \nevery promotion with dedication and integrity. Moving on to serve as \nthe Director of Force Structure, Resources, and Assessment on the Joint \nStaff and finally, prior to assuming Command of AFMC, General Carlson \nserved as the Commander, 8th Air Force, Barksdale Air Force Base, \nLouisiana and Joint Functional Component Commander for Space and Global \nStrike, U.S. Strategic Command, Offutt AFB, NE.\n  General Carlson has received several distinguished awards including \nthe Defense Distinguished Service Medal with oak leaf cluster, Legion \nof Merit, Meritorious Service Medal with two oak leaf clusters, Air \nForce Commendation Medal with two oak leaf clusters, and the 2007 Order \nof the Sword, Air Force Materiel Command. He was also awarded master's \ndegrees from Webster University in St. Louis, MO, and the Naval War \nCollege in Newport, RI.\n  In the Chief of Staff's recommendation for the Order of the Sword, \nGeneral Schwarz wrote, ``General Carlson culminates a distinguished \ncareer of more than 37 years of Air Force service, with focused \nleadership, a selfless commitment to excellence and tireless \ndedication. His vision and leadership transformed Air Force Materiel \nCommand into the preeminent provider of war-winning capabilities . . \n.'' I cannot agree more. In an era of persistent conflict and \nconstrained budgets, General Carson's dedication to making sure the \nwarfighter has what he needs to fight and win is inspiring.\n  I offer my sincere thanks and appreciation to Gen Bruce Carlson, his \nwife Vicki, and his three children, Bryan, Jani, and Scott. The \nstrength of our airmen is in their families, and their support allowed \nhim to dedicate 37 years of leadership and service to the men and women \nof the Air Force and our country. I wish him and his family well in all \nhis future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/11/19/senate-section/article/S10647-1", "month": "11", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10647]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO PABLO RAUL ALARCON\n\n Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, today I honor the life of Pablo \nRaul Alarcon. His dedication and achievements in overcoming the tyranny \nof the Castro regime to found the largest publicly traded Hispanic-\ncontrolled media company in America stands as a powerful example of the \nrealization of the American dream. While we mourn the passing of this \nbroadcasting pioneer, we celebrate his legacy and the profound impact \nhis life has had on the United States.\n  Today, the Spanish Broadcasting System owns and operates 20 radio \nstations across the country, including the No. 1 Spanish-language radio \nstation in America--which I have the privilege of listening to when I \nam home in New Jersey. They own a popular television station and \noperate a bilingual Web site dedicated to Latino culture and news. \nUnder the exemplary leadership of Mr. Alarcon's son, Raul Alarcon, Jr., \nSBS continues to be the gold standard in Hispanic-operated \nbroadcasting.\n  The Alarcons were born in Cuba, where Pablo Raul Alarcon founded his \nfirst radio station in 1951. He found success creating a network of 14 \nstations across the country, which were ultimately seized by the Castro \ndictatorship. The Alarcons fled to America with few possessions. But \nthe tyranny of Castro could not crush the spirit of their \nentrepreneurship. Mr. Alarcon worked his way up in Spanish language \nradio, doing programming, sales, and advertising. In 1983 Mr. Alarcon \nand his son, Raul Alarcon, Jr., fulfilled their long-held dream of once \nagain owning a broadcast station. They purchased a small AM station \nlicensed in my home State and created the first Spanish language format \nto be introduced into the New York/New Jersey market in over 25 years.\n  Since 1983, the Alarcons have overseen the expansion of SBS to become \none of the premier Hispanic-controlled broadcast companies in America. \nSoon after its founding, SBS expanded to Los Angeles and Miami. In \n1993, their KLAX-FM station achieved a historic overall No. 1 ranking \nin southern California.\n  As the torch was passed from father to son, SBS continued its rise. \nIn 1999, SBS completed the second largest IPO in radio history and \ncontinued expanding their network of broadcast stations. That same \nyear, SBS went online with the purchase of lamusica.com. In 2001, SBS \nproduced a sell-out Madison Square Garden charity concert to honor the \nvictims of September 11. In 2006, SBS entered the television \nbroadcasting business with the creation of the MEGA-TV network.\n  Raul Alarcon, Jr., is well known for his tremendous successes as the \npresident and CEO of SBS. He has been recognized as one of the 100 most \ninfluential Hispanics and as one of the 40 most powerful people in \nradio. In 1994, Raul Alarcon, Jr., was given the Lifetime Achievement \nAward for Business Excellence. In 1995, he received both the Ellis \nIsland Medal of Honor and the Human Rights Committee Radio \nContributions Award. He has testified before Congress and his position \nas an authority in the field of minority media ownership is \nunparalleled.\n  There is no doubt that the Alarcons exhibit the embodiment of the \nAmerican dream.

Mr. President, today I recognize Kate's Homemade \nButter of Old Orchard Beach, ME, a family-owned company whose attention \nto detail and excellence recently earned it the top honors at the World \nDairy Expo, also known as the Academy Awards of the dairy industry.\n  Kate's Homemade Butter is a dairy farm that is recognized worldwide \nfor producing slow-churned butter. The recipe for fresh homemade butter \nhas been passed down for four generations, dating back to the early \n1900s. In 1981, Daniel Patry, founder and president of Kate's Homemade \nButter, unleashed his family secret and developed it into an award-\nwinning, profitable business. In 2005, Daniel's son Lucas joined the \ncompany to continue a family tradition.\n  The Patry family is committed to maintaining the degree of quality \nthat originated back in the early 1900s. They have stayed true to their \ngrandfather, Alphonse Hemond, who passed down the family secrets to his \nson, Roland Hemond. Daniel Patry, learned\n\n[[Page S10648]]\n\nthe business from his uncle, Roland Hemond, making note of textures and \ntastes, but, most critically, realizing that the key to award-winning \nproducts is time, patience, and diligence. The Patrys ensure that all \ntheir ingredients come from local farmers so as to maintain the \nintegrity and freshness of their world-class dairy.\n  After generations of making the butter for friends and family, Mr. \nPatry decided to share this creamy spread with the world. The same \nprocess for making butter that was used in 1900 is still employed \ntoday, further proving Kate's Homemade Butter's commitment to quality \nover quantity. In 2006, the Patry family's hard work was rewarded when \nKate's Homemade Butter won the first of its two gold medals from the \nWorld Dairy Expo, beating out thousands of entrants from around the \nworld!\n  Winning their first gold medal in 2006 helped put Kate's Homemade \nButter on the map in the eyes of national producers and highly esteemed \nculinary circles, including Food & Wine Magazine and Down East \nMagazine. In a move rarely seen at the World Dairy Expo, Kate's won \nagain in 2008, achieving a very improbable score of 98.8 out of a \npossible 100. This accomplishment was described as a David versus \nGoliath moment by the Professor Emeritus in the Department of Food \nStudies at the University of Wisconsin, Dr. Robert Bradley, who is \nwidely regarded as a pre-eminent industry authority. Dr. Bradley noted, \n``Here you have this relatively small producer in Maine, who, \nliterally, makes his butter just in time to give his customers the \nabsolute freshest product possible. He comes into the Expo arena this \nyear, going up against the biggest names in the business--the largest \nmanufacturers in the entire industry--and walks away with a near-\nperfect score. The finished product is his passion.''\n  So, thank you, Daniel Patry for your passion and commitment to \nexcellence at Kate's Homemade Butter and congratulations to you and \nyour family on your award-winning product at the World Dairy \nExpo.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/11/19/senate-section/article/S10648-1", "month": "11", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10648]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO DONALD AND ELEANOR BUNN\n\n Mr. THUNE, Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Donald and \nEleanor Bunn of Colorado Springs, CO. Donald and Eleanor will celebrate \ntheir 50th wedding anniversary this year on December 23.\n  Donald and Eleanor first met in 1947 while on a double date to a \ndrive-in movie; however, at the time the two of them were on the date \nwith other people. Following this meeting, they began dating \nsporadically until Don finished his active duty in the Navy. After \nDon's service in the Navy, their courtship resumed in full, and Donald \nand Eleanor were married on December 23, 1958 at the Virginia Avenue \nBaptist Church in Bristol, TN. The service was performed by Reverend \nHaynes with Don's father, Silas Clifton Bunn, and Eleanor's sister, \nAnne Blevins Helms, as their witnesses. Eventually, Don and Eleanor \nmade their home in Garden Grove, CA, where they raised their only \ndaughter, Sharada.\n  I offer my congratulations to Donald and Eleanor on their 50th \nwedding anniversary and wish them many years of continued \nhappiness.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/11/19/senate-section/article/S10648-2", "month": "11", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10648]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mrs. Neiman, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/11/19/senate-section/article/S10648-3", "month": "11", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10648]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/11/19/senate-section/article/S10648-4", "month": "11", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10648]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           MEASURES PLACED ON THE CALENDAR DURING ADJOURNMENT\n\n  Under the authority of the order of the Senate of November 17, 2008, \nthe following bills were read the second time, and placed on the \ncalendar:\n\n       S. 3526.

A joint resolution adopted by the Alaska State \n     Legislature relative to security and defense matters; to the \n     Committee on Armed Services.\n\n                    House Joint Resolution No. 40 am\n\n       Whereas the Constitution of the United States imposes on \n     the national government a duty to provide for the common \n     defense, and the states and the national government work \n     together toward the security of each state; and\n       Whereas the Congressionally mandated Commission to Assess \n     the Threat to the United States from Electromagnetic Pulse \n     Attack found, in its report delivered July 2004, that an \n     enemy using a low-yield nuclear weapon detonated at a high \n     altitude above the United States, delivered by even a \n     relatively unsophisticated short-range or medium-range \n     ballistic missile, could make an electromagnetic pulse attack \n     against the United States, and that an electromagnetic pulse \n     attack has the potential to place our society at risk and to \n     defeat our military forces; and\n       Whereas the Alaska State Legislature views with growing \n     concern the development of nuclear weapons technology \n     worldwide and the proliferation of ballistic missile delivery \n     systems that are controlled by unstable and potentially \n     hostile foreign regimes; and\n       Whereas the threat from nuclear-armed ballistic missile \n     attack has been reduced but not eliminated by the initial \n     limited deployments of ground-based interceptors in Alaska \n     and California; and\n       Whereas the Cold War doctrine of mutually assured \n     destruction no longer represents a plausible security \n     strategy because of the proliferation of ballistic missiles \n     around the world; and\n       Whereas the testing of ballistic missiles launched from \n     ships by enemies of the United States could indicate the \n     intention of those enemies to use a platform off the coast of \n     Alaska to employ short-range or medium-range missiles for a \n     nuclear-generated electromagnetic pulse attack on American \n     citizens; and\n       Whereas, in 1997, the Alaska State Legislature was the \n     first of many state legislatures to petition the federal \n     government to develop and deploy a robust and layered missile \n     defense system that includes the most effective combination \n     of land-based, sea-based, air-based, and space-based \n     architectures;\n       Be it Resolved, That the Alaska State Legislature urges the \n     United States to work with the State of Alaska to ensure that \n     the state is prepared to respond to and recover from an \n     electromagnetic pulse attack; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Alaska State Legislature urges the \n     United States to expand its ballistic missile defense system, \n     and also to develop other methods, to defend against \n     electromagnetic pulse attacks delivered by ballistic \n     missiles, including missiles launched at American cities from \n     ships off the coast of Alaska; and be it further\n       Resolved, That it is the policy of the state to include in \n     its preparedness planning defense against electromagnetic \n     pulse attacks, as those attacks intersect with the full range \n     of risks, threats, and hazards confronting the state; and be \n     it further\n       Resolved, That it is the policy of the state to educate \n     Alaskans about the threat of electromagnetic pulse attacks \n     causing massive losses of electric power and disruption to \n     telecommunications and other vital services, including \n     health, public safety, food, and transportation services that \n     depend on reliable electric power; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Alaska State Legislature encourages \n     municipalities and private industry in the state to examine \n     critical vulnerabilities in their infrastructures and to \n     prepare for massive disruptions that could be caused by \n     electromagnetic pulse attacks.\n       Copies of this resolution shall be sent to the Honorable \n     George W.

A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the State of Pennsylvania memorializing \n     the Congress of the United States to urge the Comptroller of \n     the Currency for the United States Treasury to add the \n     Pittsburgh Metropolitan Statistical Area as a new Community \n     Reinvestment Act assessment area for Bank of America; to the \n     Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 789\n\n       Whereas, Congress passed the Community Reinvestment Act \n     (CRA) in 1977, which states that ``regulated financial \n     institutions have continuing and affirmative obligations to \n     help meet the credit needs of the local communities in which \n     they are chartered''; and\n       Whereas, the original act established a regulatory \n     mechanism for monitoring the level of lending, investments \n     and services in low-income and moderate-income neighborhoods, \n     traditionally underserved by lending institutions; and\n       Whereas, in the spring of 1995, the Federal regulatory \n     agencies released new CRA regulations that outlined how \n     Federal agencies are to assess the activities of lending \n     institutions in traditionally underserved neighborhoods; and\n       Whereas, the regulations, which became effective in January \n     1996, established three different tests for lending \n     institutions, involving the lending, investment and service \n     records of banks and provided a strategic plan option in lieu \n     of a regulator evaluation; and\n       Whereas, examiners rate lending institutions as either \n     ``outstanding,'' ``satisfactory,'' ``needs to improve'' or \n     ``substantial noncompliance''; and\n       Whereas, scores falling within the categories of ``needs to \n     improve'' or ``substantial noncompliance'' can result in \n     delays or denials of mergers, acquisitions or expansion of \n     services; and\n       Whereas, Countrywide Home Loans currently issues the most \n     single-family home loans in the Pittsburgh Metropolitan \n     Statistical area at 4,763 loans and maintains 8.98% of the \n     market share; and\n       Whereas, Bank of America is ranked tenth in the number of \n     single-family home loans issued in the Pittsburgh \n     Metropolitan Statistical Area at 888 loans, or 1.67% of the \n     market share; and\n       Whereas, the total market share of home loans in the \n     Pittsburgh Metropolitan Statistical Area is likely to be \n     11.38% after the merger of Countrywide Home Loans and Bank of \n     America; and\n       Whereas, the most recent examination under the Community \n     Reinvestment Act did not include the Commonwealth of \n     Pennsylvania or the Pittsburgh region as an official \n     assessment area for Bank of America; and\n       Whereas, an analysis of fair lending practices conducted by \n     the National Community Reinvestment Coalition (NCRC) \n     reflected that Countrywide Home Loans provided African \n     Americans with only 2.3% of total prime loans issued, \n     although they represented 7.4% of all households in the \n     Pittsburgh Metropolitan Statistical Area and lagged behind \n     all lenders as a group; and\n       Whereas, the analysis further reflected that Countrywide \n     Home Loans lagged behind all lenders in the Pittsburgh region \n     in the proportion of both prime and subprime loans to \n     residents of low-income and moderate-income tracts, and \n     borrowers in minority tracts received a disproportionately \n     small share of prime loans at 0.99%; and\n       Whereas, Bank of America also provided African Americans \n     with a disproportionately small share of prime loans issued, \n     1.65%, as compared to representing 7.4% of Pittsburgh's \n     population; and\n       Whereas, the NCRC's analysis further reflected that while \n     low-income and moderate-income borrowers comprised 40.4% of \n     the households in the Pittsburgh Metropolitan Statistical \n     Area in 2006, they received a disproportionately small number \n     of the bank's prime loans, 30.6%, and a larger share of \n     subprime loans, 72.2%; and\n       Whereas, a merger of these institutions would make Bank of \n     America the largest lender in the Pittsburgh Metropolitan \n     Statistical Area; and\n       Whereas, without oversight under the Community Reinvestment \n     Act, the credit needs of the local community could be \n     disproportionately affected and impact the level of lending, \n     investments and services in Pittsburgh's underserved \n     populations; therefore be it\n       Resolved, That the House of Representatives of the \n     Commonwealth of Pennsylvania memorialize the Congress of the \n     United States to urge the Comptroller of the Currency for the \n     United States Treasury to add the Pittsburgh Metropolitan \n     Statistical Area as a new Community Reinvestment Act \n     assessment area for Bank of America; and be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the Pittsburgh Community Reinvestment Group in appreciation \n     and recognition of its efforts in providing economic justice, \n     equitable investment practices and sufficient financial \n     resources to revitalize communities throughout Allegheny \n     County; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the Comptroller of the Currency for the United States \n     Treasury and the presiding officers of each house of Congress \n     and to each member of Congress from Pennsylvania.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-450. A resolution adopted by the Senate of the State of \n     Michigan memorializing the United States Congress and the \n     President of the United States to support additional funding \n     to expand Amtrak's capacity and routes in Michigan; to the \n     Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n                       Senate Resolution No. 200\n\n       Whereas, ridership has increased 47 percent on all three \n     Michigan Amtrak routes in the last six years. The Wolverine \n     route, from Pontiac through Detroit to Chicago, increased its \n     passenger load 2.5 percent in 2007 alone. The state-supported \n     Blue Water route between Port Huron and Chicago saw increased \n     ridership of 3 percent in 2007. Ridership on the state-\n     supported Pere Marquette route between Grand Rapids and \n     Chicago increased 2.8 percent. All three corridors \n     experienced sold-out trains in 2007, some on a regular basis, \n     which may have limited their true earning potential. The \n     trains contributed $500,000 of unanticipated ticket income to \n     the state of Michigan; and\n       Whereas, the trend of increasing passenger numbers \n     continues in 2008. Over the first ten months of the fiscal \n     year, Pere Marquette ridership is up 9.8 percent and Blue \n     Water ridership has increased 6.5 percent. Revenues have \n     grown as well, from 4.5 to 9.2 percent. These trends over the \n     last six years suggest continued record numbers of passengers \n     but less than potential revenue because of limited capacity, \n     as witnessed by frequent sold-out conditions; and\n       Whereas, Amtrak employs 114 Michigan residents and pays \n     over $6.6 million annually in salaries and wages. Amtrak \n     contracts with Michigan businesses for more than $5.7 million \n     in goods and services.\n       Whereas, Michigan residents continue to face increasing \n     fuel prices, traffic congestion, and limited access to public \n     transportation. We believe the time has come to generate \n     additional economic growth and public transportation \n     alternatives for Michigan and its residents by increasing \n     passenger rail capacity and service; Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate, That we memorialize Congress and \n     the President to support additional funding for passenger \n     rail cars on Michigan's three train routes, to consider \n     increasing capacity and routes in Michigan, and to consider \n     the restoration of a second, mid-day passenger train from \n     Chicago to Grand Rapids; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States, the President of the \n     United States Senate, the Speaker of the United States House \n     of Representatives, the members of the Michigan congressional \n     delegation, the Governor of Michigan, the Surface \n     Transportation Board, the United States Department of \n     Transportation, the Michigan Department of Transportation, \n     and Amtrak.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-451.

A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the State of Pennsylvania memorializing \n     the Congress of the United States to oppose the New York/New \n     Jersey/Pennsylvania metropolitan airspace redesign proposals; \n     to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 673\n\n       Whereas, the basic air traffic structure of the New York/\n     New Jersey/Philadelphia metropolitan area airspace was \n     designed and implemented in the 1960s and was last modified \n     in 1987 with the Expanded East Coast Plan (EECP); and\n       Whereas, the EECP proved inadequate in addressing the \n     changes in volume and type of aircraft used by the National \n     Airspace System and also caused major noise problems that \n     resulted in a congressional mandate in the Aviation Safety \n     and Capacity Expansion Act of 1990, requiring the Federal \n     Aviation Administration (FAA) to perform an environmental \n     impact study of the EECP and mitigate the noise; and\n       Whereas, in the 1995 final environmental impact study, the \n     FAA committed to mitigate noise in a follow-up regional \n     study; and\n       Whereas, in 2001, the FAA determined that aircraft noise \n     pollution was the strongest and most widespread concern \n     raised by the public, however, the FAA failed to include the \n     reduction of aircraft noise as a formal goal of its regional \n     redesign project; and\n       Whereas, on December 20, 2005, the FAA issued a draft \n     environmental impact statement containing several proposals \n     to redesign the New York/New Jersey/Philadelphia metropolitan \n     airspace; and\n       Whereas, the airspace redesign involves a 31,000 square \n     mile, five-state area with a population of 29 million \n     residents and 21 airports, with particular focus placed on \n     air traffic operations at five major airports, including the \n     Philadelphia International Airport in the Commonwealth of \n     Pennsylvania; and\n       Whereas, the FAA began implementation of the airspace \n     redesign in December 2007; and\n       Whereas, the FAA did not conduct proper environmental \n     reviews or seek proper input from the public and air traffic \n     controllers at Philadelphia International Airport; and\n       Whereas, the FAA has shunned additional public hearing \n     requests made by Federal and State legislators representing \n     affected areas; and\n       Whereas, since southeastern Pennsylvania does not have a \n     regional airport authority, it lacks the ability to \n     coordinate airport planning and operations, ensuring underuse \n     of regional airports and the overuse of the Philadelphia \n     International Airport; and\n       Whereas, the Commonwealth should not appropriate State \n     money for improvements to the infrastructure of the \n     Philadelphia International Airport until such time as the FAA \n     fully addresses the safety and environmental impact of the \n     airspace redesign plan and offers a modified plan that \n     incorporates the use of regional airports; and\n       Whereas, the New Jersey Coalition Against Aircraft Noise \n     and the Citizens Coalition Against Noise Pollution oppose \n     these proposals, arguing that the interests of the citizens \n     of affected areas have not been considered and that the \n     proposals no longer promote aircraft noise reduction; and\n       Whereas, it is in the best interest of the Commonwealth of \n     Pennsylvania to oppose the FAA's proposal to redesign the New \n     York/New Jersey/Philadelphia metropolitan airspace; therefore \n     be it\n       Resolved, That the House of Representatives of the \n     Commonwealth of Pennsylvania call upon the Congress of the \n     United States to immediately suspend the FAA's implementation \n     of the New York/New Jersey/Philadelphia metropolitan airspace \n     redesign and hold additional hearings seeking the input of \n     elected officials and concerned citizens; and be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration and \n     each member of the Pennsylvania Congressional Delegation now \n     serving in the United States Senate and House of \n     Representatives.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-453. A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the State of Pennsylvania relative to the \n     Susquehanna Flood Forecasting and Warning System; to the \n     Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 929\n\n       Whereas, the United States Army Corps of Engineers has \n     fiscal year 2009-2010 operation and maintenance funding for \n     six or seven stream gauges between the New York border and \n     Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, that are a part of the Cooperative \n     Streamgauging Network in the Susquehanna River Basin, \n     necessitating stopgap measures to allow the United States \n     Geological Survey to continue ongoing operation and \n     maintenance of the gauges; and\n       Whereas, Congress has reduced the appropriation and not \n     made available the entire $2 million necessary for the \n     Susquehanna Flood Forecasting and Warning System, which \n     includes the operation and maintenance of the stream gauges; \n     and\n       Whereas, the real time data provided by the stream gauges \n     is of critical importance to water managers and others for a \n     host of water management programs such as flood forecasting \n     and warning, drought monitoring, water quality monitoring, \n     regulatory purposes and recreational uses; and\n       Whereas, the Susquehanna River Basin is one of the most \n     flood-prone watersheds in the United States, with average \n     annual flood damages of nearly $150 million; and\n       Whereas, real time data are of particular importance for \n     timely and accurate flood forecasts and warning activities in \n     the Susquehanna River Basin, where the Susquehanna Flood \n     Forecasting and Warning System has helped to prevent injury \n     and loss of life, to reduce flood damages by tens of millions \n     of dollars and to deliver a benefit-to-cost ratio of 20:1; \n     and\n       Whereas, these water resource management programs are \n     inextricably linked to the public health, safety and welfare \n     of the citizens of the Susquehanna River Basin; and\n       Whereas, given the above considerations, there is a long-\n     term, ongoing need for the operation and maintenance of \n     stream gauges for these various purposes and for sustainable \n     sources of funding to allow that need to be met in the \n     future; and\n       Whereas, in the interest of avoiding duplication of effort, \n     maximizing available resources and promoting good government, \n     the Susquehanna River Basin Commission plays an important \n     coordinative role with Federal and State agencies through the \n     Susquehanna Flood Forecasting and Warning System and also \n     provides important technical assistance and public \n     information services to the system; therefore be it\n       Resolved, That the House of Representatives of the \n     Commonwealth of Pennsylvania urge the Congress of the United \n     States to restore full funding for fiscal year 2009-2010 and \n     provide sufficient funding in the Federal fiscal year 2010-\n     2011 budget and beyond for the National Oceanic and \n     Atmospheric Administration to fully fund at $2 million the \n     Susquehanna Flood Forecasting and Warning System to enable \n     timely and accurate flood forecasts and warnings to be issued \n     by the National Weather Service for the Susquehanna River \n     Basin; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the administrator of National Oceanic and \n     Atmospheric Administration be urged to discontinue \n     withholding funds that are used for administrative purposes, \n     are critically needed for program implementation and are \n     appropriated for the Susquehanna Flood Forecasting Warning \n     System; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States; the Director of the \n     Office of Management and Budget; to the presiding officers of \n     each house of Congress and to each member of the Congress \n     from Pennsylvania;

and\n       Whereas, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania is a member of \n     several interstate river basin commissions, including the \n     Susquehanna River Basin Commission, the Delaware River Basin \n     Commission and the Interstate Commission on the Potomac River \n     Basin, hereinafter referred to as the ``Mid-Atlantic \n     Commissions''; and\n       Whereas, the jurisdiction of the Mid-Atlantic Commissions \n     encompasses approximately two-thirds of the land area of this \n     Commonwealth and approximately two-thirds of the stream miles \n     in the State; and\n       Whereas, the Mid-Atlantic Commissions provide invaluable \n     water resource functions, including planning and management \n     activities to avoid conflicts between states sharing the same \n     watersheds and among water users; and\n       Whereas, the Mid-Atlantic Commissions were established by \n     legislation enacted by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and \n     the other member jurisdictions to each of the compacts, \n     including the Federal Government; and\n       Whereas, the interstate compacts that were created as a \n     result of this legislation require their member \n     jurisdictions, including the Federal Government, to provide \n     equitable shares of funding in support of the Mid-Atlantic \n     Commissions' annual expense budgets; and\n       Whereas, the Federal Government has provided no direct \n     funding to the Mid-Atlantic Commissions for the past decade \n     in fulfillment of its interstate compact obligations, \n     resulting in the burden of financial responsibility being \n     shifted to the member states of the Mid-Atlantic Commissions, \n     including the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania; and\n       Whereas, the President of the United States did not request \n     funding in his budget request for fiscal year 2009 to fulfill \n     the Federal Government's equitable share of funding in \n     support of the Mid-Atlantic Commissions' annual expense \n     budgets for fiscal year 2009; and\n       Whereas, the 110th Congress of the United States, in its \n     first session, enacted the Water Resources Development Act of \n     2007; and\n       Whereas, section 5019(b) of the Water Resources Development \n     Act of 2007 requires the Secretary of the Army to allocate \n     funds to the Mid-Atlantic Commissions to fulfill the \n     equitable funding requirements of the respective interstate \n     compacts; and\n       Whereas, the Mid-Atlantic Commissions have officially \n     requested that funding be included in the fiscal year 2009 \n     Energy and\n\n[[Page S10654]]\n\n     Water Development Appropriations Bill in the amount of $1 \n     million for the Susquehanna River Basin Commission, $715,000 \n     for the Delaware River Basin Commission and $650,000 for the \n     Interstate Commission on the Potomac River Basin; and\n       Whereas, Federal funding is needed for the Mid-Atlantic \n     Commissions to address vitally important water resource \n     needs, among them the establishment of flow targets to guide \n     the Susquehanna River Basin Commission's management of major \n     withdrawals in the Susquehanna River Basin, the initiation of \n     flood mitigation activities in the Delaware River Basin and \n     the coordination with community leaders on drinking water \n     source water protection activities; therefore be it\n       Resolved, That the House of Representatives of the \n     Commonwealth of Pennsylvania wholeheartedly endorse the \n     request of the Mid-Atlantic Commissions for funding from the \n     Federal Government in fiscal year 2009; and be it further\n       Resolved, That all members of the Commonwealth of \n     Pennsylvania's Congressional Delegation are strongly \n     encouraged to actively support the funding request of the \n     Mid-Atlantic Commissions;

A resolution adopted by the Senate of the State of \n     Michigan memorializing the United States Congress to enact \n     legislation to help revitalize the economy in states with \n     exceptionally high rates of unemployment by the creation of a \n     Recovery State Renaissance Zone Act; to the Committee on \n     Finance.\n\n                       Senate Resolution No. 222\n\n       Whereas, our nation, the state of Michigan in particular, \n     is being buffeted by the tumultuous seas of economic change. \n     Global manufacturing shifts have had a disproportionate \n     impact on the Great Lake State's manufacturing sector. \n     Indeed, despite years of diversifying our economy and \n     streamlining our state's governmental operations, Michigan \n     continues to be one of those states trapped in this economic \n     maelstrom; and\n       Whereas, according to the latest U.S. Department of Labor \n     employment statistics, Michigan continues to lead the nation \n     in the\n\n[[Page S10655]]\n\n     rate of unemployment. Our average unemployment rate has \n     exceeded the national average by more than 50 percent in each \n     of the past two calendar years, and the state is on track to \n     break this mark again in 2008. This disparity clearly points \n     to the fact that Michigan cannot wait for its long-term \n     economic development initiatives to see fruition. The need \n     for federal assistance in our efforts is immediate and \n     pressing; and\n       Whereas, Congress must enact a federal law that mirrors \n     Michigan's Renaissance Zone statute to create federal \n     Renaissance Zones. States with average unemployment rates of \n     50 percent above the national average for at least the past \n     two years must be designated as renaissance states. As \n     renaissance states, they would qualify for two recovery \n     benefits: (1) a statewide 100 percent increase in the federal \n     investment tax credit; and (2) the ability to designate \n     certain areas of the state as exempt from federal corporate \n     taxes with a cap of $1 billion per year; now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved by the Senate, That we hereby memorialize the \n     Congress of the United States to enact legislation to help \n     revitalize the economy in states with exceptionally high \n     rates of unemployment by the creation of a Recovery State \n     Renaissance Zone Act; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-461.

to the Committee on Finance.\n\n                              CSHJR No. 41\n\n       Whereas sec. 511 of P.L. 109-222 (Tax Increase Prevention \n     and Reconciliation Act of 2005) will require states, cities, \n     counties, and boroughs that spend more than $100,000,000 each \n     year on goods and services after December 31, 2010, to \n     withhold three percent of their payments to nearly all \n     vendors and contractors for federal income purposes and to \n     report nonwage payments; and\n       Whereas sec. 511 of P.L. 109-222 (Tax Increase Prevention \n     and Reconciliation Act of 2005) was added by a congressional \n     conference committee without benefit of any public hearings \n     in either the United States House of Representatives or the \n     United States Senate; and\n       Whereas, although sec. 511 of P.L. 109-222 (Tax Increase \n     Prevention and Reconciliation Act of 2005) was inserted into \n     the legislation to save approximately $7,000,000,000 in \n     federal taxes between 2011 and 2015, the effect of the \n     provision is to increase the burden and costs to state and \n     local governments by making these governments uncompensated \n     and involuntary federal tax collectors because no federal \n     funding is provided to cover the costs of implementing sec. \n     511 of P.L. 109-222 (Tax Increase Prevention and \n     Reconciliation Act of 2005); and\n       Whereas sec. 511 of P.L. 109-222 (Tax Increase Prevention \n     and Reconciliation Act of 2005) creates another unfunded \n     federal mandate that will add a cost to state and local \n     governments that exceeds the threshold of P.L. 104-04 \n     (Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995), and sec. 511 of P.L. \n     109-222 (Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act of \n     2005) will therefore short-circuit the public process \n     required by P.L. 104-04 (Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of \n     1995) and thus violate that Act; and\n       Whereas the Department of Administration, the University of \n     Alaska, the Municipality of Anchorage, the Fairbanks North \n     Star Borough, and the Anchorage School District, all \n     governmental entities in Alaska that are affected by sec. 511 \n     of P.L. 109-222 (Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation \n     Act of 2005), have expressed serious concerns about it and \n     have urged its repeal; and\n       Whereas local governmental officials have stated that sec. \n     511 of PL. 109-222 (Tax Increase Prevention and \n     Reconciliation Act of\n\n[[Page S10656]]\n\n     2005) will be extremely difficult and expensive to implement, \n     requiring major programming changes to financial and \n     accounting systems and the hiring of additional staff; and\n       Whereas, because of the three percent withholding \n     requirement, local businesses will be discouraged from \n     bidding on state and local governmental contracts for \n     products and services, thereby dampening competitive bidding \n     and driving up the prices to offset the three percent \n     withholding, and this, in turn, is likely to increase the \n     cost of procurement by state and local governments; and\n       Whereas sec. 511 of P.L. 109-222 (Tax Increase Prevention \n     and Reconciliation Act of 2005) will pose significant \n     difficulties for the State of Alaska in its efforts to \n     procure goods and services for the state, because\n       (1) the state accounting system is 23 years old and cannot \n     accommodate mandatory backup withholding;\n       (2) it would take about a year to make the necessary \n     systemic changes and require substantial additional record \n     keeping to reconcile the amounts paid to vendors and those \n     amounts reported and remitted to the Internal Revenue \n     Service;\n       (3) obtaining exemptions to sec. 511 of P.L. 109-222 (Tax \n     Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act of 2005) would be \n     difficult and costly; and\n       (4) vendors might inflate their bids to compensate for the \n     tax withheld, resulting in higher prices to the state; and\n       Whereas the state government accounting system does not \n     currently have the capability to withhold vendor payments, \n     and the state need only report payments for services over \n     $600 a year to each unincorporated vendor; sec. 511 of P.L. \n     109-222 (Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act of \n     2005) will increase the accounting burden on the state by\n       (1) requiring most but not all payments, no matter how \n     small, to be reported, an extremely expensive and burdensome \n     mandate;\n       (2) requiring payments to all corporations to be reported, \n     significantly increasing the number of vendors for which \n     information reports would have to be submitted to the \n     Internal Revenue Service;\n       (3) requiring withholding on credit card purchases, a \n     process unknown complexity; and\n       (4) exempting certain types of payments that will likely \n     require manual intervention, which would drive up the cost of \n     compliance with sec. 511 of P.L. 109-222 (Tax Increase \n     Prevention and Reconciliation Act of 2005) even further; and\n       Whereas government agencies will have to obtain employee \n     identification numbers or social security numbers for \n     numerous individual vendors to allow reporting to the \n     Internal Revenue Service, thereby invading those citizens' \n     rights of privacy and exposing them to the dangers of \n     identity theft; and\n       Whereas complying with sec. 511 of P.L. 109-222 (Tax \n     Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act of 2005) will have \n     serious adverse effects on the procurement practices of \n     larger local governments in Alaska; for example, the \n     Municipality of Anchorage, the state's largest city, with a \n     population of about 261,446, which is 42 percent of the \n     State's total population, will incur costs of approximately \n     $250,000 a year to reprogram municipal computers and \n     financial systems, plus an estimated $100,000 to $200,000 a \n     year of additional costs for ongoing operating expenses; the \n     Municipality of Anchorage's financial computer system is not \n     set up for this procedure and will require extensive \n     modifications at a significant cost, including the hiring of \n     at least one full-time municipal employee; the use of \n     procurement cards by the Municipality of Anchorage may have \n     to be discontinued, and the use of checks, which are slower \n     and more costly, may be reinstituted; the Municipality of \n     Anchorage's online purchasing system will have to be modified \n     and likely will no longer be cost-effective; and\n       Whereas the additional costs of complying with sec. 511 of \n     P.L. 109-222 (Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act \n     of 2005) will place the State of Alaska and Alaska local \n     governments at a competitive disadvantage in the procurement \n     of goods and services;

A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the State of Michigan memorializing the \n     Congress and the President of the United States to enact the \n     Breast Cancer Patient Protection Act; to the Committee on \n     Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 296\n\n       Whereas, in spite of progress that has been made in its \n     diagnosis and treatment, breast cancer remains one of the \n     most serious threats to the health of women. Its devastating \n     impact is felt across our country. According to the American \n     Cancer Society, excluding cancers of the skin, breast cancer \n     is the most common cancer among women and accounts for one of \n     every 4 cancers diagnosed. It is estimated that 178,000 new \n     cases of invasive breast cancer were identified in 2007 and \n     that an estimated 40,000 women died; and\n       Whereas, although the frightening realities of breast \n     cancer can strike any woman, success in combating the disease \n     is, unfortunately, less universal. A patient's chances of \n     survival are increased with early identification of the \n     disease, access to good care at all stages of treatment, and \n     comprehensive monitoring afterwards; and\n       Whereas, congress is considering legislation that would \n     take a strong step in the effort to combat breast cancer in \n     our country. The Breast Cancer Patient Protection Act, S. 459 \n     and H.R. 758, would require health plans to provide coverage \n     for minimum hospital stays for mastectomies, lumpectomies, \n     and lymph node dissection for the treatment of breast cancer, \n     as well as secondary consultations. Among the legislation's \n     specific provisions is a requirement that a patient \n     undergoing a mastectomy or lumpectomy to treat breast cancer \n     be permitted a hospital stay of no less than 48 hours; and\n       Whereas, the Breast Cancer Patient Protection Act would \n     increase access to a level of care that can save lives and \n     mitigate suffering; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, By the House of Representatives, that we \n     memorialize the Congress and the President of the United \n     States to enact the Breast Cancer Patient Protection Act; and \n     be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the Office of the President of the United States, the \n     President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-468. A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the State of Michigan relative to Agent \n     Orange and Parkinson's disease; to the Committee on Health, \n     Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 273\n\n       Whereas, Agent Orange was an herbicide used in Vietnam to \n     kill unwanted plants and to remove leaves from trees which \n     otherwise provided cover for the enemy. After its use, it was \n     realized that Agent Orange contained dioxin, which is related \n     to a number of diseases, cancers, and other disorders. Many \n     U.S. veterans are known to have been exposed to significant \n     amounts of Agent Orange while fulfilling their military \n     obligations; and\n       Whereas, as required by law, the U.S. Department of \n     Veterans Affairs (VA) recognizes many diseases as being \n     associated with Agent Orange, including chloracne, acute \n     peripheral neuropathy, and numerous cancers such as Hodgkin's \n     disease, multiple myleoma, and prostate cancer. Veterans who \n     served in Vietnam between January 9, 1962, and May 7, 1975, \n     and who acquire one of the recognized diseases are entitled \n     to VA-furnished hospital care, medical services, and possibly \n     nursing home care; and\n       Whereas, several studies performed at internationally \n     recognized research institutions, including St. Jude \n     Children's Research Hospital, have linked Parkinson's disease \n     to Agent Orange and other pesticides. Research work at St. \n     Jude Children's Research Hospital linked genetic alterations \n     associated with an increased risk of Parkinson's disease to \n     pesticide exposures; and\n       Whereas, Parkinson's disease should be added to the VA list \n     of recognized diseases associated with Agent Orange. The \n     Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in Winston-\n     Salem, North Carolina, has determined in two cases that the \n     Parkinson's disease of veterans could have been caused by \n     their contact with Agent Orange while on active military \n     duty; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, That we \n     memorialize the United States Congress to acknowledge that \n     the neurological disorder known as Parkinson's disease can be \n     caused by exposure to Agent Orange and to require that the \n     United States Department of Veterans Affairs offer assistance \n     to U.S. Military members who, while serving their country, \n     have acquired Parkinson's disease through their exposure to \n     Agent Orange; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, the members of the \n     Michigan congressional delegation, and the Secretary of the \n     U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-469. A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the State of Michigan urging the Congress \n     of the United States and the United States Department of \n     Agriculture to continue to promote and prioritize the \n     establishment of local farm-to-school initiatives; to the \n     Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 413\n\n       Whereas, local farm-to-school initiatives improve child \n     nutrition and promote local farming communities. These \n     programs emphasize the purchase and availability of fresher \n     and more nutritious local foods for consumption in schools. \n     In addition, they provide an opportunity for students to gain \n     a greater appreciation of where their food comes from and \n     enhance markets for local farmers. Strong local markets \n     reduce food costs and fuel use associated with transporting \n     foods long distances and increase food security; and\n       Whereas, the federal government plays a critical role in \n     the success of local farm-to-school initiatives. Federal \n     support can make the difference between a successful farm-to-\n     school program and a failed one. In particular, placing a \n     priority on farm-to-school programs and giving schools \n     flexibility in the use of federal funding received for school \n     meal programs would make a huge difference; and\n       Whereas, the 2008 federal farm bill (P.L. 110-246) made \n     major strides to remove roadblocks and encourage the \n     establishment of farm-to-school initiatives. Under the \n     enacted bill, schools will now be able to show a preference \n     for locally grown and raised foods without risking the loss \n     of critical funds. In addition, the bill authorizes funding \n     for grants that may be used to make fresh fruits and \n     vegetables available in elementary schools and develop hands-\n     on school vegetable gardening and nutrition education \n     programs at high-poverty schools; and\n       Whereas, the promise of the 2008 federal farm bill will \n     only be met if Congress and the U.S. Department of \n     Agriculture follow through and continue to expand on the \n     commitments made. Full funding, regulatory flexibility, and a \n     cooperative and collaborative relationship with the states \n     and local schools are needed to maintain the momentum; now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, That we urge the \n     Congress of the United States and the U.S. Department of \n     Agriculture to continue to promote and prioritize the \n     establishment of local farm-to-school initiatives; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, the members of the \n     Michigan congressional delegation, and the Secretary of \n     Agriculture.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-470.

Fibromyalgia \n     symptoms include chronic pain throughout the body, extreme \n     fatigue, sleep disorders, stiffness, weakness, migraine \n     headaches, and impairment of memory and concentration; and\n       Whereas, fibromyalgia is a common condition with no known \n     cure that affects women, men, and children of all \n     ethnicities; and\n       Whereas, an estimated 10 million people in the United \n     States and millions of people worldwide have been diagnosed \n     with fibromyalgia; and\n       Whereas, there is no test for fibromyalgia, so it often \n     takes an average of five years to receive a diagnosis. \n     Furthermore, medical professionals are frequently \n     inadequately educated on diagnosis and treatment of \n     fibromyalgia; and\n       Whereas, many fibromyalgia patients find themselves \n     underinsured or uninsured because they are too sick to work \n     or have been denied health care coverage and access to \n     treatments because they have fibromyalgia; and\n       Whereas, fibromyalgia costs the United States health care \n     system $20 billion annually and strongly impacts families who \n     experience lost wages and extensive out-of-pocket medical \n     costs; and\n       Whereas, the California Legislative Women's Caucus \n     recognizes that 80 percent of fibromyalgia patients are \n     women, that hundreds of thousands of those affected by \n     fibromyalgia live in California, and that there is an urgent \n     need to respond to the vast needs of this patient population; \n     and\n       Whereas, the California Legislative Women's Caucus has \n     taken the National Fibromyalgia Association's Pledge to Care \n     by advocating for improved treatments, expanded research, \n     comprehensive health insurance coverage, and increased \n     awareness of fibromyalgia; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate and the Assembly of the State of \n     California, jointly, That the Legislature respectfully urges \n     the Congress of the United States to accelerate the federal \n     investment in fibromyalgia research at the National \n     Institutes of Health, to ensure adequate Medicare and \n     Medicaid reimbursement and coverage of fibromyalgia \n     therapies, and to launch a multifaceted public awareness \n     campaign on fibromyalgia; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Secretary of the Senate transmit copies \n     of this resolution to the President and Vice President of the \n     United States, to the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives, to the Majority Leader of the Senate, and to \n     each Senator and Representative from California in the \n     Congress of the United States.\n\n[[Page S10658]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n       POM-471.

A joint resolution adopted by the Alaska State \n     Legislature encouraging the repeal of the Real ID Act of \n     2005; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n                           Resolution No. 68\n\n       Whereas the federal government has failed to show any \n     measurable evidence that the implementation of the Real ID \n     Act of 2005 will make our borders more secure and better \n     protect our citizens from terrorism; and\n       Whereas the state, under the Tenth Amendment to the \n     Constitution of the United States, has always exercised its \n     exclusive power to establish standards and regulations for \n     the issuance of Alaska state driver's licenses and Alaska \n     state identification cards; and\n       Whereas the federal government imposes a huge fiscal burden \n     on the division of motor vehicles to implement the Real ID \n     Act of 2005; and\n       Whereas noncompliance with the Real ID Act of 2005 will \n     result in the federal government punishing individual \n     Alaskans for the actions of the state by placing limitations \n     on Alaska residents' freedom of travel and access to federal \n     facilities: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved That the Alaska State Legislature does not believe \n     government should wage the war on terrorism at the expense of \n     states' rights and liberties of citizens protected by the \n     United States Constitution and the Bill of Rights; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That the Alaska State Legislature does not \n     believe the Real ID Act of 2005 will make the United States \n     measurably safer and encourages the United States Congress to \n     repeal the Real ID Act of 2005.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-474.

Res. 111 and establish a Select \n     Committee on POW and MIA Affairs; and be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this resolution be transmitted to \n     each member of Congress from Pennsylvania.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-475.

Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself and Ms. Snowe):\n  S. 3698. A bill to prohibit any recipient of emergency Federal \neconomic assistance from using such funds for lobbying expenditures or \npolitical contributions, to improve transparency, enhance \naccountability, encourage responsible corporate governance, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \nAffairs.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of myself and \nSenator Snowe to introduce legislation that will enhance transparency, \nstrengthen oversight, and encourage responsible corporate governance \nfor firms receiving financial lifelines from the Federal Government.\n  Our bill--the Accountability for Economic Rescue Assistance Act--will \nachieve four essential objectives.\n  It will prohibit firms receiving loans from the Federal Reserve or \nany of the $700 billion economic rescue funds from Treasury from using \nthis money for lobbying expenditures or political contributions; \nrequire that firms receiving\n\n[[Page S10661]]\n\ngovernment assistance provide detailed, publically available quarterly \nreports to Treasury outlining how taxpayer dollars have been used; \nestablish corporate governance standards to ensure that firms receiving \nfederal assistance do not waste money on unnecessary expenditures; and, \ncreate penalties of at least $100,000 per violation for firms that fail \nto meet the corporate governance standards established in the bill.\n  The need for such legislation has become apparent in the weeks since \nCongress approved the economic rescue plan.\n  Since then, news reports have uncovered multiple instances in which \nrescued firms have been caught making unnecessary and outrageous \nexpenditures, which calls their assistance from taxpayers into \nquestion.\n  Last week, Treasury Secretary Paulson announced that the $700 billion \napproved by Congress to stabilize financial markets would not be used \nto purchase illiquid assets but rather to make direct capital \ninjections into financial institutions.\n  Given this new mission, the need for additional transparency and \ndisclosure is striking.\n  We have learned that we cannot necessarily count on these firms and \ntheir executives to act sensibly and do what is right.\n  The public needs to know that their tax dollars are being put to good \nuse. A simple ``trust me'' from the bank executives is not enough.\n  On October 16th, the Wall Street Journal reported that American \nInsurance Group, AIG, which received billions of dollars in Federal \nrescue funds, was continuing to lobby state regulators to delay \nimplementation of strengthened licensing standards for mortgage brokers \nand lenders.\n  AIG was lobbying against sensible standards created by the SAFE \nMortgage Licensing Act of 2008. This bill, introduced by Senator \nMartinez and myself, established basic minimum regulations for the \nmortgage industry to ensure consumers were adequately protected.\n  Before this bill, in some states virtually anyone--even those with \ncriminal records--could go out and get a mortgage broker's license.\n  Left unchecked, and with no regulations to stop them, unscrupulous \nmortgage brokers and lenders flooded the markets with subprime loans \nthat they knew would never be paid back, and this served as one of the \ncatalysts for our current economic predicament.\n  Now AIG, having succumbed to bad investments and propped up by \nbillions in government money, was lobbying against the strong \nenforcement of state laws that might have helped prevent this \ncatastrophe in the first place.\n  Senator Martinez and I wrote a letter to AIG and, to the company's \ncredit, CEO Edward Liddy immediately suspended the company's lobbying \noperations.\n  I find it completely unacceptable that taxpayer dollars intended to \nstabilize the economy could find their way into the bank accounts of \nlobbying firms. The legislation which I introduce today will make sure \nthat doesn't happen.\n  I do not mean to pick on AIG, but they have also been the poster \nchild for wasteful spending by rescued firms.\n  In September, just days after receiving an $85 billion federal \nlifeline, the management of AIG treated itself to a $444,000 spa \nweekend at the St. Regis resort in Monarch Beach, California. This \nincluded $200,000 for rooms, $150,000 for fine dining and $23,000 in \nspa charges.\n  AIG executives spent the last two days of September on a golf outing \nat Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas at a cost of up to $500,000. They were \nplanning to follow this with a few days at the Ritz Carlton in Half \nMoon Bay, but cancelled after it hit the news and drew fire from \nCongressional leaders.\n  As news of these wasteful expenditures was making headlines, AIG \nreceived another $37.8 billion in emergency loans from the Federal \nGovernment. Shortly thereafter, the Associated Press reported that--\neven as AIG was asking Congress for these loans--AIG executives were \nspending $86,000 on a pheasant hunting expedition in England. During \nthe trip, they stayed at a 17th century manor.\n  One AIG executive named Sebastian Preil was quoted as saying that: \n``The recession will go on until about 2011, but the shooting was great \ntoday and we are relaxing fine.''\n  Once these lapses in judgment came to light, AIG chief executive \nEdward Liddy informed Congress that he was putting an end to all \nnonessential expenditures. Yet earlier this month, an undercover news \ncrew caught AIG executives at the Hilton Squaw Peak Resort in Phoenix, \nhosting a seminar for financial planners complete with cocktails and \nlimousines.\n  One would think that a brush with collapse and total failure might \nhave a sobering effect on some of these firms.\n  But this penchant for wasteful junkets in the face of complete \nfailure was not unique to AIG.\n  The Wachovia Corporation was caught shipping its top brokers off to \nthe Greek Isles on a cruise ship for an all-expenses paid luxury trip--\neven as the company awaited a buyout potentially backed by taxpayers.\n  Wachovia cancelled the trip due to the storm of criticism attracted \nby this stunning display of what the ancient Greeks called hubris.\n  While the economic rescue legislation passed in September includes \nseveral oversight boards and accountability provisions to ensure that \npublic funds are effectively distributed, the bill does not include any \nreporting requirements for firms that receive Federal dollars.\n  This is a significant omission, especially given the amount of \nFederal money that some firms are receiving.\n  The Treasury Department has already approved the purchase of $160 \nbillion of preferred stock in 30 financial institutions. We know that \nof these funds $125 billion was allocated to nine large national banks.\n  It was also reported last week that AIG will receive an additional \n$40 billion, meaning that at least $165 billion of the economic rescue \nfunding will be allocated to only 10 firms.\n  When you add up all of the taxpayer dollars put on the line--from $30 \nbillion provided to Bear Stearns in March, $200 billion available to \nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac, $150 billion to AIG, $700 billion in \neconomic rescue funds, plus the direct lending programs at the Federal \nReserve--we are talking about well over 1 trillion Federal dollars.\n  I certainly don't think it is unreasonable for the public to know how \ntheir money is being spent.\n  As the end of the year nears, we are approaching bonus time on Wall \nStreet. Certainly Americans deserve assurances that struggling firms \nwill not use public funds to pay higher bonuses.\n  The same can be said for these funds going towards dividend payments, \nor mergers and acquisitions.\n  Shining light on how firms use public dollars not only makes good \nsense, but it will also act as a deterrent to irresponsible behavior.\n  My vote on the economic stabilization bill was one of the toughest I \nhave taken during my time in the Senate.\n  My office received more than 160,000 calls, letters, and e-mails from \nCalifornians concerned about this course of action.\n  But, I decided to support the bill to ensure that action would be \nquickly taken to ease the flow of credit to consumers and businesses.\n  Our economy continues to struggle today. The money approved by \nCongress must be used sensibly to ensure its maximum impact.\n  Americans are struggling, and the pain in my State of California, \nwhere unemployment is 7.7 percent, and foreclosure filings exceed \n680,000 this year, is especially acute.\n  This bill puts in place commonsense solutions to fix some of the \ndeficiencies in the economic stabilization bill.\n  This bill is significant and sorely needed. We must act soon to help \nrestore confidence in this effort and shed light on how public funds \nare used. We promised the American people transparency and oversight, \nand this legislation will make good on that promise.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me to ensure that taxpayer dollars are \nspent efficiently and responsibly.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE:\n  S. 3699. A bill to direct the Administrator of the Small Business \nAdministration to reform and improve the HUBZone program for small \nbusiness concerns, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Small \nBusiness and Entrepreneurship.\n\n[[Page S10662]]\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the passage of \nthe HUBZone Improvement Act of 2008. This vital legislation would \naddress the Government Accountability Office's recent recommendations \nto improve the Small Business Administration's administration and \noversight of the Historically Underutilized Business Zone, HUBZone, \nprogram and ensure that only eligible firms participate in this crucial \nprogram.\n  As former chair and now ranking member of the Senate Committee on \nSmall Business and Entrepreneurship, I have been a longstanding \nchampion for small business programs such as the HUBZone program. The \nHUBZone program provides Federal contracting assistance to small firms \nlocated in economically distressed areas, with the intent of \nstimulating economic development. According to the GAO, as of February \n2008, 12,986 certified businesses have participated in the HUBZone \nprogram since its inception. And in fiscal year 2007, over 4,200 \nHUBZone firms obtained approximately $8.1 billion in Federal contracts. \nIn these troubling economic times, the HUBZone program is something our \ncountry needs now more than ever.\n  The mechanisms that the SBA uses to certify and monitor HUBZone firms \nprovide limited assurance that only eligible firms participate in the \nprogram. Unfortunately, according to a recent GAO report and analysis \nof 125 applications submitted in September of 2007, the SBA only \nrequested supporting documentation, which helps to clarify the status \nof the business, for 36 percent of the applications and only conducted \na single site visit for all 125 applicants. While the SBA's policies \nand procedures require program examinations, the agency only conducts \nthem on 5 percent of certified HUBZone firms each year. This is a \nglaring lack of oversight that must be rectified.\n  The legislation I introduce today, the HUBZone Improvement Act of \n2008, would take immediate steps to correct the lack of effective \nadministrative oversight by requiring more routine and consistent \nsupporting documentation during the program's application process. In \nits report, the GAO found that the SBA relies on Federal law to \nidentify qualified HUBZone areas, but the map it uses to publicize \nHUBZone areas is inaccurate, and the economic characteristics of \ndesignated areas vary widely. My bill would require that the SBA take \nimmediate steps to correct and update the map that the SBA uses to \nidentify HUBZone areas and implement procedures to ensure that the map \nis updated with the most recently available data on a more frequent \nbasis.\n  The GAO also found that the mechanisms that SBA uses to certify and \nmonitor firms provide limited assurance that only eligible firms \nparticipate in the program. The GAO found that more than 4,600 firms \nthat had been in the program for at least 3 years went unmonitored. My \nlegislation would require the SBA to develop and implement guidance to \nmore routinely and consistently obtain supporting documentation upon \napplication and conduct more frequent site visits, as appropriate, to \nensure that firms applying for certification are eligible. These \ncommonsense achievable steps would help to eliminate participant fraud \nand misrepresentation, and ensure that firms applying for HUBZone \ncertification are truly lawful and eligible businesses.\n  In its report, the GAO illustrates the SBA lack of a formal policy on \nhow quickly it needs to make a final determination on decertifying \nfirms that may no longer be eligible for the HUBZone program. According \nto the GAO, of the more than 3,600 firms proposed for decertification \nin fiscal years 2006 and 2007, more than 1,400 were not processed \nwithin 60 days--the SBA's targeted timeline. As a result of these \nweaknesses, there is an increased risk that ineligible firms have \nparticipated in the program and had opportunities to receive Federal \ncontracts based on their HUBZone certification. My legislation would \nrequire the SBA to formalize and adhere to a specific timeframe for \nprocessing firms proposed for decertification in the future, as well as \nrequire further developed measures in assessing the effectiveness of \nthe HUBZone program.\n  Moreover, the Federal Government must strive to continue to provide \nadditional contracting opportunities to those who are legitimate \nHUBZone firms. I am dismayed by the innumerable ways that government \nagencies have time and again egregiously failed to meet most of their \nsmall business contracting goals. I am alarmed that only one Federal \nsmall business contracting program--the small disadvantage business \nprogram--has met its statutory goal, and that the three other small \nbusiness goaling programs have all fallen drastically short. For \nexample, in fiscal year 2007, the HUBZone program met only 2.2 percent \nof its three percent government-wide goal. The Federal Government can \nand must provide more to our country's hardworking small businesses.\n  In my home State of Maine, only 118 of 41,026 small businesses are \nqualified HUBZone businesses. HUBZones represent a tremendous tool for \nreplacing lost jobs for our Nation's declining manufacturing and \nindustrial sectors--clearly, this program should be better utilized.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3699\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``HUBZone Improvement Act of \n     2008''.\n\n     SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act--\n       (1) the terms ``Administration'' and ``Administrator'' mean \n     the Small Business Administration and the Administrator \n     thereof, respectively;\n       (2) the terms ``HUBZone'' and ``HUBZone small business \n     concern'' have the meanings given such terms in section 3 of \n     the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632); and\n       (3) the term ``recertification'' means determining whether \n     a business concern that was previously determined to be a \n     qualified HUBZone small business concern is a qualified \n     HUBZone small business concern under section 3(p)(5) of the \n     Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632(p)(5)).\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSE; FINDINGS.\n\n       (a) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to reform and \n     improve the HUBZone program of the Administration.\n       (b) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The HUBZone program was established under the HUBZone \n     Act of 1997 (Public Law 105-135; 111 Stat. 2627) to stimulate \n     economic development through increased employment and capital \n     investment by providing Federal contracting preferences to \n     small business concerns in economically distressed \n     communities or HUBZone areas.\n       (2) According to the Government Accountability Office--\n       (A) as of February 2008, 12,986 certified firms have \n     participated in the HUBZone program since its inception; and\n       (B) in fiscal year 2007, over 4,200 HUBZone small business \n     concerns obtained approximately $8,100,000,000 in Federal \n     contracts.\n       (3) The Government Accountability Office also identified \n     numerous concerns with the HUBZone program, including that--\n       (A) the Administration verifies the information received by \n     the Administration from HUBZone small business concerns in \n     limited instances and has limited assurances that only \n     eligible firms participated in the HUBZone program;\n       (B) by not obtaining documentation and conducting site \n     visits on a more routine basis during the certification \n     process, the Administration cannot be sure that only eligible \n     firms are part of the HUBZone program; and\n       (C) although the examination process of the Administration \n     involves a more extensive review of documentation, the \n     examination process cannot be relied upon to ensure that only \n     eligible firms participate in the HUBZone program because the \n     examination process involves only 5 percent of firms in any \n     given year.\n\n     SEC. 4. HUBZONE IMPROVEMENTS.\n\n       The Administrator shall--\n       (1) as soon as is practicable, correct and update the map \n     that is used by the Administration to identify HUBZones and \n     implement procedures to ensure that the map is updated with \n     the most recently available data on a more frequent basis;\n       (2) develop and implement guidance for determining whether \n     an applicant is a qualified HUBZone small business concern \n     under section 3(p)(5) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. \n     632(p)(5)), including more routinely and consistently \n     obtaining supporting documentation from an applicant and \n     conducting more frequent site visits, as appropriate;\n       (3) establish a date by which the Administrator shall \n     eliminating the backlog of applications for recertification;\n       (4) ensure that the Administration eliminates the backlog \n     described in paragraph (3) by the date established under \n     paragraph (3), using officers and employees of the \n     Administration or by entering into a contract with a private \n     entity;\n\n[[Page S10663]]\n\n       (5) establish and implement a time period for completing a \n     recertification; and\n       (6) develop measures and implement plans to assess the \n     effectiveness of the HUBZone program that take into account--\n       (A) the economic characteristics of the HUBZone; and\n       (B) contracts being counted under multiple socioeconomic \n     subcategories.\n\n     SEC. 5. REPORT.\n\n       Not later than 2 years after the date of enactment of this \n     Act, the Comptroller General of the United States shall \n     submit to the Committee on Small Business and \n     Entrepreneurship of the Senate and the Committee on Small \n     Business of the House of Representatives a report regarding \n     the implementation of this Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERRY (for himself, Mr. Specter, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. \n        Inouye, Mr. Brown, Ms. Stabenow, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Dodd, Mr. \n        Casey, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Whitehouse, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. \n        Schumer, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Menendez, and Mr. Carper):\n  S. 3700. A bill to encourage and support the development of high-\nspeed passenger rail transportation in the United States, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, this has been a volatile time for our \nfinancial system and our economy. Hopefully, we will be able to agree \non a short-term stimulus relief that will help families who are \nsuffering and states meet their financial obligations.\n  Next, we need to create new jobs by updating our infrastructure to \nhelp respond to the current challenges to our economy. I believe a \nfirst-rate American rail system is a critical part of the efforts to \ncreate jobs and expand our economy. It will also help make our air \ncleaner, ease traffic congestion, save families' money and time, and \nlessen our dependence on foreign oil.\n  That is why today, Senator Specter and I are introducing the High-\nSpeed Rail for America Act of 2008. Senators Lautenberg, Inouye, Brown, \nStabenow, Feinstein, Dodd, Casey, Lieberman, Whitehouse, Clinton, \nSchumer, Snowe, and Menendez are cosponsors. This legislation provides \na bold new vision of how we approach transportation policy to expand \nour economy and keep up with changes in our society.\n  The High-Speed Rail for America Act of 2008 builds upon the Passenger \nRail Investment and Improvement Act of 2008 which reauthorizes Amtrak \nand authorizes $1.5 billion over a five-year period to finance the \nconstruction and equipment for 11 highspeed rail corridors. I want to \nthank Senator Lautenberg for his leadership on reauthorizing Amtrak and \nmaking investment in high-speed rail a priority.\n  Today, Amtrak's Acela train on the Northeast Corridor is capable of \nreaching 150 miles per hour. However, due to a lack of infrastructure \nimprovements, the Acela train only travels at 150 miles per hour on an \n18-mile stretch in Rhode Island and a 10-mile stretch in Massachusetts. \nWe must make appropriate improvements to our railroad tracks and \nbridges to allow high speed rail to work properly.\n  While the U.S. is investing heavily in other forms of transportation, \nour investment in world class rail is dwarfed by other countries. For \nexample, Germany's federal government gives its states $8.9 billion a \nyear for rail projects, France spends twenty times more per capita on \nrail than the U.S., and the Ministry of Railways in China invested \n$19.6 billion in rail in the first half of 2008 alone. That is why we \nneed to provide a constant source of funding for investment in high-\nspeed rail. The High-Speed Rail for America Act of 2008 will take our \noutdated and underfunded passenger rail system and transform it into a \nworld class system.\n  The High-Speed Rail for America Act of 2008 builds on the \nauthorization of highspeed rail grants by providing billions of dollars \nin both tax exempt and tax credit bonds. It provides assistance for \nrail projects of various speeds. The bill creates the Office of High-\nSpeed Passenger Rail to oversee the development of high-speed rail and \nprovides a consistent source of funding. This office will ensure that \nwe have the leadership to keep this mission on track.\n  High-speed rail is often the fastest and most reliable way to get \nfrom downtown to downtown between most cities 100-500 miles apart. \nHigh-speed rail can save up to an hour per trip when compared to air \ntravel and reduces trip time by more than 50 percent compared to \ndriving. The legislation provides $8 billion over a 6-year period for \ntax-exempt bonds which finance high-speed rail projects which reach a \nspeed of at least 110 miles per hour. This speed is often most \npractical for corridors of less than 100 miles or for less travelled \nroutes which cannot justify the investment into world class high-speed \nrail traveling at 150 miles per hour.\n  The High-Speed Rail for America Act of 2008 also creates a new \ncategory of tax-credit bonds: qualified rail bonds. There are two \ntypes: super high-speed intercity rail facility bond and rail \ninfrastructure bond. Super high-speed rail intercity facility bonds \nwill encourage the development of true high-speed rail. The legislation \nprovides $10 billion for these bonds over a six-year period. Rail \nprojects that reach a speed of at least 150 miles per hour will be \neligible for these bonds. This would help finance projects including \nthe proposed California corridor and make needed improvements to the \nNortheast corridor.\n  Rail infrastructure bonds will fund projects approved by the U.S. \nDepartment of Transportation and be part of a State's official rail \nplan. The High-Speed Rail for America Act of 2008 provides $5.4 billion \nover a 6-year period for this type of bond. The Federal Rail \nAdministration has already designated ten rail corridors that these \nbonds could help fund, including connecting the cities of the Midwest \nthrough Chicago, connecting the cities of the Northwest, connecting the \nmajor cities within Texas and Florida, and connecting all the cities up \nand down the East Coast. These are projects that are ready to go, but \nthey need a source of financing.\n  The need for a bold shift in the way we approach transportation is \nclear. Traffic congestion continues to worsen in cities across the \ncountry, creating a $78 billion drain on the U.S. economy with 4.2 \nbillion lost man hours of work and 2.8 billion gallons of wasted fuel. \nLast year, domestic flight delays cost the economy $41 billion and \nconsumed about 740 million additional gallons of jet fuel waiting on \nthe ground. Passenger rail reduces congestion and is an effective \nalternative to highway and air transportation. Americans want \nalternatives--and we can deliver them.\n  We must focus on making the transportation sector part of the \nsolution to global climate change. The transportation sector accounts \nfor approximately one-third of U.S. CO2 emissions--and \nautomobiles make up 60 percent of that. Public transportation is an \nessential part of the solution to global warming. According to the \nAmerican Public Transportation Association, public transportation \nreduces CO2 emissions by 37 million metric tons annually and \nsaves the average American household over $6,000 annually.\n  The demand for alternative forms of transportation is only growing. \nThe number of people riding Amtrak surged by more than 13 percent in \nJuly 2008 from a year earlier--the most passengers carried in any month \nduring Amtrak's 37 year history. Amtrak ridership set an all-time \nrecord for fiscal year 2008, achieving growth of 11 percent.\n  As we look towards economic stimulus legislation next year, we must \nrethink the approach we have taken towards mobility in this country. \nCountries around the world have realized the benefits of high-speed \nrail and continue to build out their systems as we fall farther and \nfarther behind. For far too long, we have not made adequate investment \nin our infrastructure. We cannot let this pattern continue.\n  We have all heard the skeptics and cynics dismiss the idea of high-\nspeed rail for decades, but due to high energy prices, increased \npassenger rail ridership, and the need to reduce greenhouse gasses, the \ntime is ripe for a big change. Not only will this change create a \nmodern and reliable transportation network in the Untied States, it \nwill provide tens of thousands of good new jobs and help stimulate the \nsluggish economy.\n  I pledge to continue fighting for the development of a modern high-\nspeed rail system connecting the major cities across America, and I ask \nall my colleagues to support making this vision a reality.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD (for himself and Mr. Hatch):\n\n[[Page S10664]]\n\n  S. 3701. A bill to provide assistance to Best Buddies to support the \nexpansion and development of mentoring programs, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce with Senator Orrin \nHatch the Best Buddies Empowerment for People with Intellectual \nDisabilities Act of 2008. The bill we are introducing would help to \nintegrate individuals with intellectual disabilities into their \ncommunities, improve their quality of life and promote the \nextraordinary gifts of these individuals.\n  I am proud to be introducing this bill with my good friend Senator \nHatch. He has been a long time leader in this cause, and most recently \nworked with Senator Harkin, Senator Kennedy, myself and others to pass \nthe Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act of 2008. We, as a \nsociety, have an obligation to do all we can to include individuals \nwith disabilities and help them to reach their full potentials.\n  Yet, as one study on teen attitudes notes: ``Legal mandates cannot, \nhowever, mandate acceptance by peers, neighbors, fellow employees, \nemployers or any of the other groups of individuals who directly impact \nthe lives of people with disabilities.'' People with intellectual \ndisabilities have indeed gained many rights that have improved their \nlives; however, negative stereotypes abound. Social isolation, \nunfortunately, is the norm for people with intellectual disabilities.\n  Early intervention, effective education, and appropriate support go a \nlong way to helping someone with intellectual disabilities achieve at \nthe best of his or her abilities and lead a meaningful life in the \ncommunity. I would like to tell you about the accomplishments of Best \nBuddies, a remarkable non-profit organization that is dedicated to \nhelping people with intellectual disabilities develop relationships \nthat will provide the kind of support that will help them reach their \npotential.\n  Founded in 1989, Best Buddies is the only national social and \nrecreational program in the United States for people with intellectual \ndisabilities. Best Buddies works to enhance the lives of people with \nintellectual disabilities by providing opportunities for friendship and \nintegrated employment. Through more than 1,000 volunteer-run chapters \nat middle schools, high schools and colleges, students with and without \nintellectual disabilities are paired up in a one-to-one mentoring \nfriendship. Best Buddies also facilitates an Internet pen pal program, \nan adult friendship program, and a supported employment program.\n  Approximately 7 million people in the United States have an \nintellectual disability; every one of these individuals would benefit \nfrom the kind of relationships that the Best Buddies programs help to \nestablish. The resulting friendships are mutually beneficial, \nincreasing the self-esteem, confidence, and abilities of people both \nwith and without intellectual disabilities.\n  The legislation we are introducing today allows the Secretary of \nEducation to award grants to promote the expansion of the Best Buddies \nprograms and to increase participation in and public awareness about \nthese programs. The bill authorizes $10 million for fiscal year 2009 \nand such sums as necessary through fiscal year 2013. If passed, this \nlegislation would allow Best Buddies to expand their work and offer \nprograms in every state in America, helping to create a more inclusive \nsociety with a direct and positive impact on more than 1.2 million \ncitizens.\n  I thank my colleague Senator Hatch for working with me on this \nlegislation. And I applaud Representatives Hoyer and Blunt, who have \nintroduced a similar measure in the House. I urge my colleagues to join \nwith me in supporting this important legislation that will make a \npositive--and needed--difference in the lives of individuals with \nintellectual disabilities and in the lives of those with whom they \ndevelop relationships.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3701\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Best Buddies Empowerment for \n     People with Intellectual Disabilities Act of 2008''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

A bill to authorize additional Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation field agents to investigate financial crimes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation with \nSenator WHITEHOUSE to extend the reach of the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation into financial crimes that may have helped precipitate \nthe economic meltdown of the past several months.\n  We must investigate and scrutinize this financial crisis as we would \na terrorist attack in order to determine its causes and how to preempt \nanother economic collapse in the United States.\n  Following the September 11th attacks, the FBI re-directed \napproximately 1,000 agents to counterterrorism and counterintelligence \nactivities. Without a doubt, there is no argument that our country has \nbenefitted from the dedicated efforts of the men and women of the FBI \nwho are performing this valuable work.\n  Over a 10-year period, from fiscal year 1999 to fiscal year 2008, \nCongress has increased direct appropriations for the FBI from $2.993 \nbillion and 26,693 positions to $6.658 billion, 122 percent increase, \nand 30,211 positions, 13 percent increase. Most of these new resources \nwere provided in the wake of the September llth terrorist attacks, as \nthe FBI redirected its resources toward combating domestic and \ninternational terrorism by improving its intelligence gathering and \nprocessing capabilities. As a consequence, for fiscal year 2008, about \n60 percent of FBI funding and staffing is allocated to national \nsecurity programs, including counterterrorism and counterintelligence.\n  In view of the breadth and severity of the economic crisis brought on \nby events in U.S. financial markets, however, I am very concerned that \ncriminal wrongdoing may have played a significant role in crippling \nsome of America's largest companies. Criminal activity, such as fraud, \nmisrepresentation, self-dealing, and insider trading may have \ninstigated or exacerbated the financial industry upheaval of 2008.\n  In order to augment FBI investigations of financial crimes, the FBI \nPriorities Act of 2008 authorizes $150 million for each of the fiscal \nyears 2009 through 2013 to fund approximately 1,000 Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation field agents in addition to the number of field agents \nserving on the date of enactment. It is my hope that this extra \nmanpower will enable the FBI to develop leads on unlawful actions, dig \ndeeply into those leads, and bring responsible parties to justice. The \nAmerican public deserves no less.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE:\n  S. 3705. A bill to amend the Small Business Act and the Small \nBusiness Investment Act of 1958 to stop the small business credit \ncrunch, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the 10 Steps for \na Main Street Economic Recovery Act of 2008, a measure that will take \ndramatic action to finance the growth of our Nation's small businesses, \nwhich represent 99.7 percent of all employers and create approximately \n75 percent of net jobs each year. Our country faces a financial crisis \nof unprecedented severity that is choking off economic growth and small \nbusiness survival by denying all businesses, but especially small \nfirms, access to the capital they need.\n  As Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship, it has long been my goal to expand access to capital \nfor small businesses. One of the most valuable assets for realizing \nthis goal are the Small Business Administration's, SBA's, core lending \nprograms, including the 7(a) and 504 programs. Historically, when \ncredit to small businesses has contracted, as is presently the case, \nbanks have turned to the SBA in order to make loans to small business \nowners. Yet, regrettably, during these arduous economic times--we are \nnot only seeing a significant drop in the amount of business loans made \nbut we are also seeing credit lines completely shut down and commercial \nloans canceled.\n  Our current economic downturn is drastically more dangerous than any \nthreat to our financial system in decades. Banks are tightening their \nlending standards without a similar increase in the volume of SBA \nguaranteed loans to small businesses, creating a domino effect on small \nbusinesses' job creation ability. The Federal Reserve's November 2008 \nQuarterly Loan Officer Survey finds that, in the last quarter, 75 \npercent of banks state that they have tightened their lending standards \nfor small firms. Not surprisingly, lending in the SBA's 7(a) and 504 \nprograms have declined dramatically. Over the past year, lending in the \n7(a) program has decreased by 55 percent while loan volume in the 504 \nprogram is down 36 percent. Since the U.S. financial market turmoil \nbegan in September, overall SBA lending is down by 50 percent from the \nprevious year.\n  This is why I am introducing the 10 Steps for a Main Street Economic \nRecovery Act, which, as its title indicates, contains a series of 10 \nachievable, commonsense steps that could be implemented immediately to \nhelp thaw out frozen credit markets so that small businesses--both in \nMaine and across the country--can continue to be the driving force of \nour Nation's economy. All of the provisions included in my legislation \nwould directly address the credit crunch small firms are facing and \nhelp them get the capital necessary to finance business growth.\n  First, my bill would improve the Small Business Administration's \nflagship lending program, the 7(a) program, by increasing the amount of \nfinancing, from $2 million to $3 million, that small firms can secure; \nallowing small firms to refinance their 7(a) loans if they can get \nbetter terms with another lender; and simplifying procedures for the \nloan poolers who bundle SBA loans in a secondary market that will \ngenerate additional liquidity for small firms and banks.\n  As a second step, my bill would directly expand small firms' access \nto credit by making the SBA's Community Express lending program \npermanent. This year, as credit has contracted, demand for the SBA's \nCommunity Express program has increased dramatically. But, because this \nis a pilot program, its ability to meet this loan demand has been \nseverely restricted, forcing lenders to turn borrowers away who qualify \nfor Community Express loans.\n  My legislation also seeks to bring in new and rural lenders, and \nteach them how to make SBA loans, by establishing an online loan \nunderwriting guide to walk lenders through the process. This would \nincrease the number of banks making SBA loans, from rural Maine to \nsmall towns in California, and ultimately promote small business \nowners' overall access to capital.\n  As a third step, my bill would improve the SBA's 504 loan program by \nraising the loan limit from $2 million to $3 million. It would also \npermit borrowers to refinance some existing debts into a 504 loan, and \nexpands the 504 program's ability to finance projects in low-income \ncommunities.\n  Fourth, the 10 Steps for a Main Street Economic Recovery Act would \nrectify the current lack of liquidity in the 504 program by providing a \nnew short-term guarantee on the first loans in the 504 loan package in \norder to encourage investors to buy these securities. Currently, \nwithout such a guarantee, investors are not purchasing the first loans \nin the 504 loan package. This is preventing Community Development \nCompanies, CDCs, from making new 504 loans to small firms. The cost of \nthis guarantee will be fully covered by participating 504 lenders. Once \nenacted into law, this temporary guarantee, which would expire at the \nend of fiscal year 2010, would increase investor confidence, encourage \nthem to buy 504 investments and resurrect demand for 504 loans.\n\n  Fifth, my legislation contains large, temporary fee reductions to \ndefray the cost of borrowing for small business owners and SBA lenders. \nMy proposal would reduce overall fees for 7(a) and 504 lenders and \nborrowers by $510 million dollars, a hefty sum considering that the \nSBA's fiscal year 2008 budget was only $663 million. When small firms \nlack access to capital, they are unable to buy new inventory, finance \nnew expansions, or often even cover their payrolls. During these \ntroubled times, the SBA should do everything within its power, \nincluding lowering lending fees, to help ensure that small\n\n[[Page S10666]]\n\nfirms have access to the credit they require.\n  Sixth, as small firms are being turned away from banks and are \nseeking credit through micro-lending organizations, my legislation \nrecognizes that the credit crunch has increased the demand for SBA \nmicroloans. It dedicates $25 million so that SBA microloan providers \ncan make additional loans and cover the costs of technical assistance \nassociated with these microloans.\n  As a seventh step, my bill would raise the maximum amount of \ngovernment guaranteed capital a Small Business Investment Company, \nSBIC, can control, from $130.6 million to $150 million for a single \nSBIC and $225 million for a group of SBICs. This will enable SBICs to \nhave additional funds to invest in start-up small businesses, which \nwill be critical in driving economic recovery.\n  Eighth, this legislation would direct the SBA to develop a nationwide \nadvertising strategy to direct small firms to SBA lenders, and \ndedicates $5 million to pay for this strategy. Today, many local and \ncommunity banks have credit they can extend to small firms. \nUnfortunately, many small businesses hear that there is a credit crunch \nand erroneously believe that no other lenders have financing options \navailable. This vital advertising will guide small firms to find the \navailable resources they need through SBA lenders.\n  As a ninth step, my legislation recognizes that taxes \ndisproportionately impact small firms' bottom lines. It would provide \ntax breaks that will spur small business growth by extending the \nincreased $250,000 small business expensing limit through 2009. This \nwill provide small businesses with incentives to invest in plants and \nequipment by reducing their cost of capital. Additionally, the bill \nwould provide small firms with an immediate capital injection by \nallowing them to carryback their 2008 or 2009 net operating losses for \n5 years and provide business owners with a longer period over which to \noffset current losses. These measures will help small companies sustain \noperations and continue to employ workers.\n  Finally, this legislation would clarify that 7(a) and 504 loans are \neligible for the Treasury Department's Troubled Asset Relief Program, \nTARP. I have sent a letter, with Senator Kerry, directing the U.S. \nTreasury Department to immediately purchase illiquid 7(a) and 504 \nsecurities from the secondary market in order to free these markets up \nand once again create liquidity for small businesses. Though the \nTreasury already has this authority under the TARP, this provision \nwould clarify that authority so the Treasury can act promptly and \ndecisively to address the credit crunch's impact on small firms.\n  In developing this bill, my office reached out to a host of small \nbusinesses and lenders, and consulted with the National Association of \nDevelopment Companies and National Association of Guaranteed Government \nLenders.\n  Given the dimensions of what is occurring in our economy, the SBA and \nthe Administration must do everything possible to help credit worthy \nsmall businesses secure the loans they need to innovate, access new \nmarkets, hire new employees, and grow. Today, as banks are raising \ntheir credit requirements in order to avoid risk, it is becoming more \nand more difficult for small businesses to qualify for loans. The SBA's \nlending programs are critical to small businesses in this endeavor.\n  By implementing the vital provisions contained in the 10 Steps for a \nMain Street Economic Recovery Act, we can increase the opportunities \nfor our Nation's small businesses to not only survive during this \ndownturn, but to be a catalyst for turning around and reinvigorating \nour economy.

A bill to amend part D of title IV of the Social Security \nAct to prohibit States from charging child support recipients for the \ncollection of child support; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, in a time of rising prices and historic \neconomic turmoil, single parents deserve our support more than ever. \nThat is why I am introducing the Elimination of the Single Parent Tax \nAct of 2008. I am proud to join my colleague Congresswoman Gillibrand \nin introducing this important legislation to help single parents by \nsuspending State fees to fund child support enforcement.\n  Many states, including New York, were forced to institute this fee \nafter the Republican-lead Congress passed the Deficit Reduction Act of \n2005, which slashed funding for child support enforcement. The fee is \nexpected to affect 170,000 families in New York alone. These single \nparents need every penny of their child support income to go towards \nfood, medicine, and other important expenses. The Elimination of the \nSingle Parent Tax Act ensures that hard-working single parents don't \nface an extra tax.\n  In September, I joined my Senate colleagues in urging the Senate \nAppropriations Committee leadership to increase funding for child \nsupport enforcement to stave off these deep cuts. And today, I \nencourage my colleagues to join me in sponsoring this critical measure \nto support single parents.\n  For too long, single-parent households have been ignored at a time \nwhen raising children has only become more of a struggle. Yet despite \nthese challenges, single parents heroically soldier on. This bill is \nonly a critical first step to a more comprehensive approach to \nsupporting single parents raising children. I look forward to \ncontinuing to fight in the Senate to stand up for our most vulnerable \nchildren and our hardest-working families.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. CLINTON:\n  S. 3707. A bill to recruit, train, and support principals for high-\nneed schools who are effective in improving student academic \nachievement; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \naddress the urgent need of our underserved urban and rural school \ndistricts\n\n[[Page S10671]]\n\nby creating a corps of principals who are well-prepared, supported, and \neffective in improving student academic achievement in high-need \nschools and ensuring our schools are provided the leadership they need \nto prepare our children to compete in the 21st century.\n  The U.S. Department of Labor estimates that nearly 40 percent of the \n90,000 principals in this country are nearing retirement, and over half \nthe Nation's school districts are facing immediate administrator \nshortages. This problem is particularly prevalent in urban and rural \ndistricts with large concentrations of high-poverty schools, where \nturnover rates can reach as high as 20 percent per year, and academic \nachievement is persistently low.\n  That is why I'm introducing the National Principal Recruitment, NPR, \nAct, which seeks to address the impending shortage by establishing a \ncorps of principals who are well-prepared, supported, and effective in \nimproving student achievement in high-need schools. This corps is \ncreated through the recruitment of results-oriented candidates who \npossess personal leadership and management skills, knowledge of \neffective instruction, and commit to serve in high-need schools for \nover 5 years. Once selected, these candidates would undergo a year-long \nprincipal residency program, and receive support and mentoring to help \nthem develop and maintain a data-driven, professional learning \ncommunity.\n  This bill leverages non-Federal dollars with targeted funding to \nperformance-based work done in partnership with school districts. It \nalso includes an evaluation to capture knowledge and best practices and \ncreates a prototype of a performance-based Federal education program by \ntying funding levels to an evaluation of student achievement results.\n  An effective and capable school leader can make the difference in \nproviding the tools and instructional support needed to foster the type \nof school environment conducive to student academic success. The NPR \nAct will ensure that our neediest schools have effective leaders, who \nare well-equipped and supported, to close the achievement gap and \nprepare our students to compete in a global economy.\n  I am hopeful that my Senate colleagues from both sides of the aisle \nwill join me today to move this legislation to the floor without delay.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. CLINTON:\n  S. 3708. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act with respect \nto health professions education, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, today, I am introducing the Health \nProfessions and Primary Care Reinvestment Act in order to improve \naccess to quality health care for all Americans. By significantly \nreinvesting in the training and education of our health professionals, \nwe are reinvesting in our communities where care is most needed.\n  This bill reinvests in health professional training in three ways--by \nexpanding the training our health professionals receive, by improving \nour efforts to recruit and retain health professionals, and by \nincreasing incentives for health professionals who are serving in \ncommunity settings, particularly in rural and urban underserved areas.\n  Most Americans prefer to get their health care through a personal \nphysician operating as part of a team-based primary care practice, yet \nthe number of health professional students entering these fields is \ndecreasing. We need more workers in primary care at the front lines of \nthe health care system. Primary care professionals can help to \nestablish a ``medical home'' for patients, providing preventive care to \nhelp people stay healthy and provide coordination of care for those \nwith multiple or chronic diseases. This bill would achieve this goal by \nproviding incentives for training primary care professionals, by \nstrengthening primary care departments at the school and community \nlevel, and by supporting improved infrastructure to assist those \nserving in primary care settings.\n  Minorities, disadvantaged and rural students are underrepresented in \nour health professional workforce. We need to increase their numbers in \nthe medical fields, and provide incentives for them to return to \nunderserved areas to practice. As an example of what can be done, one \nprogram targeting rural students has returned eight times the usual \nnumber of trained family physicians to rural settings. We need to train \npeople from all backgrounds--from underrepresented minorities, from \ndisadvantaged backgrounds, from rural and urban underserved \ncommunities. This bill helps to achieve this goal by strengthening \npipeline programs, expanding loans and scholarships, and by increasing \nthe availability of care in underserved communities.\n  We need health care where people live and work. Americans should be \nable to access care in communities that are located far from hospitals \nand medical centers, in the poorest neighborhoods of cities and \nisolated rural areas. We need to support the institutions that the most \nvulnerable rely on for care, like community health centers, local \ndepartments of health, and nursing homes. This bill supports new models \nof care for training, recruiting, supporting and retaining faculty to \nserve in underserved settings, and provides infrastructure support for \ntraining students in community settings outside of the hospital, where \npatients need care.\n  In addition to addressing primary care, the legislation also works to \naddress other health fields which are often inaccessible to patients. \nDental care in the United States has become a luxury that is \nunaffordable to many people. Dentists are often unable to sustain \ncareers by teaching in dental schools training the next generation of \nprofessionals, or to work in communities where the need is greatest. \nThis bill provides support for dentists to pursue academic teaching \ncareers and to provide general care to both adults and children. It \ntargets underrepresented minority dentists and those who will serve in \ncommunities where the need is greatest.\n  One impediment to good health for people with mental health problems \nis lack of care coordination. Too often the psychological problem goes \nundiagnosed or untreated, because our health care system operates in \nsilos. Patients are often asked to go one place to meet physical health \nneeds and another place to meet mental health needs. This bill provides \nsupport for training and care where the health professionals work \ntogether to co-manage mental health and physical health problems toward \nbetter overall health.\n  We, as a nation, are getting older. As we age, our health concerns \nchange. Many seniors take multiple medications which need to be \ncoordinated by a team of doctors, pharmacists, and other caregivers. \nThe Health Professions and Primary Care Reinvestment Act reinvests in \nour geriatric training programs by expanding opportunities for doctors, \npharmacists, psychologists, dentists and others to work with patients \nin rehabilitation centers, at home, in nursing homes or other settings \nwhere people live or work.\n  Our public health and preventive medicine professionals respond to \ncrises like SARS, anthrax, and other infectious disease outbreaks. But \nthey also work to educate the public about ways to stay healthy, and \nprevent chronic diseases. They contribute to the health care safety net \nwith services like adult and childhood vaccinations. This bill helps to \nsupport these efforts by reinvestment in training for prevention. It \nlinks schools of public health with local and State departments of \nhealth in order to train professionals to work and serve in settings \nwhere they are most needed.\n  Finally, and very importantly, we must better understand the demands \nthat will be made upon our health professional workforce. This bill \nprovides authorization for the formation of a national and multiple \nregional health workforce analysis centers, along with an advisory \ncommittee comprised of administrative and health professional \nleadership. These entities will assess, review and oversee health \nprofessional workforce needs so that we can plan and prepare a new \ngeneration of health professionals in our schools and communities.\n  The Health Professions and Primary Care Reinvestment Act addresses \nthe multiple challenges facing healthcare workforce development in our \ncountry.\n\n[[Page S10672]]\n\nIt will invest in primary care, expand the number of health \nprofessionals truly representative of the communities they serve, and \nimprove the availability of care in places where Americans need it \nmost. I look forward to working with my colleagues in the Senate on the \nmany issues of our health care workforce, and I would urge their \nsupport of this legislation.\n  Multiple organizations, including Advocating for Family Medicine, \nAmerican Academy of Family Physicians, American Academy of Physician \nAssistants, American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine, \nAmerican College of Preventive Medicine, American Dental Association, \nAmerican Dental Education Association, American Geriatrics Association, \nAmerican Osteopathic Association, American Psychological Association, \nAssociation of Departments of Family Medicine, Association of Family \nMedicine Residency Directors, Association of Minority Health \nProfessions Schools, Inc., Association of Schools of Public Health, \nHospital Association of New York State, National AHEC Organization, \nNational Council for Diversity in the Health Professions, North \nAmerican Primary Care Research Group, Society of General Internal \nMedicine, and the Society of Teachers of Family Medicine have endorsed \nthis legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that letters of support be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be placed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                               Advocating for Family Medicine,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 18, 2008.\n     Hon. Hillary Rodham Clinton,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Clinton: On behalf of the undersigned \n     organizations, we would like to thank you for introducing the \n     Health Professions and Primary Care Reinvestment Act. Health \n     professions programs, authorized under Title VII of the \n     Public Health Service Act, are vital to enhancing and \n     expanding our nation's health workforce. The Health \n     Professions and Primary Care Reinvestment Act reauthorizes, \n     improves, and revitalizes these programs.\n       Within the primary care cluster (Section 747) we are very \n     pleased to see the following:\n       Continued support for programs that have proven \n     successful--training in primary care and capacity building in \n     primary care.\n       New recognition that an environmental scan of the community \n     and region is a necessary precursor to development of \n     creative training programs that will get primary care \n     physician training out into the community, rather than \n     training remain mostly within the academic health centers.\n       Recognition that production of primary care physicians must \n     be increased.\n       Recognition that funding for these programs must increase \n     in order to provide a well-prepared workforce for the 21st \n     century, particularly as we move to health care reform.\n       In addition, within the scope of the bill as a whole, we \n     appreciate the modification of the statute so that all of the \n     programs authorized by the bill have similar goals and \n     expected outcomes.\n       As the Senate begins its work on overall health care \n     reform, we support your efforts to have this bill serve as \n     one of the foundations of reform. True health reform in this \n     country will not be possible without including programs that \n     increase the number of well-trained health professionals. As \n     the Massachusetts experience clearly demonstrates, increasing \n     the number of insured individuals will not ensure increased \n     access to care if there are not enough doctors to treat the \n     newly insured.\n       As you know, Title VII Health Professions Programs, \n     particularly those authorized under Section 747, are designed \n     to strengthen our primary care infrastructure. Studies have \n     shown that areas which depend more heavily on primary care \n     within their health care system spend less on health care and \n     have better health outcomes. For example, a study published \n     in Health Affairs from April, 2004 found, ``States with more \n     general practitioners use more effective care and have lower \n     spending, while those with more specialists have higher costs \n     and lower quality.'' (Baicker and Chandra) We know that \n     health reform has two goals: bettering the health of our \n     nation and keeping it as cost efficient as possible. \n     Increasing the proportion of primary care medicine is a major \n     step towards meeting both of these goals, and Title VII, \n     Section 747 programs are the only federal programs that aim \n     to increase the number of primary care physicians.\n       Title VII programs have also demonstrated the ability to \n     produce physicians that serve in underserved areas. A recent \n     article in Annals of Family Medicine (Rittenhouse, et al \n     2008) shows that students and residents exposed to Title VII \n     funding are more likely to participate in the National Health \n     Service Corps or practice in a community health center upon \n     completing their training. Both of these programs \n     successfully place physicians where they are most needed.\n       Thank you for all of your hard work on the Health \n     Professions and Primary Care Reinvestment Act and for your \n     continued leadership and dedication to health care throughout \n     your career. We urge you to ensure that this important piece \n     of legislation makes its way through the legislative process \n     and is passed as quickly as possible.\n           Sincerely,\n     Scott Fields, MD,\n       President, Society of Teachers of Family Medicine.\n     Eilssa Palmer, MD,\n       President, Association of Family Medicine Residency \n     Directors.\n     Michael K.

Hillary Rodham Clinton,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Clinton: On behalf of the nearly 75,000 \n     clinically practicing physician assistants (PAs) in the \n     United States represented by the American Academy of \n     Physician Assistants (AAPA), I thank you for introducing the \n     Health Professions and Primary Care Reinvestment Act of 2008. \n     The reauthorization of the Public Health Service Act's Title \n     VII Health Professions Programs is a top priority of the \n     AAPA. Accordingly, AAPA is pleased to support this \n     legislation, and looks forward to working with you and your \n     colleagues in the Senate and House of Representatives to \n     secure the strongest possible investment in and reinforcement \n     of the nation's primary care workforce.\n       The Title VII safety net programs are essential to the \n     development and training of primary health care professionals \n     and, in turn, provide increased access to care by promoting \n     health care delivery in medically underserved communities. \n     Title VII funding is especially important for PA programs as \n     it is the only federal funding available on a competitive \n     application basis to these programs.\n       A review of PA graduates from 1990-2006 demonstrates that \n     PAs who have graduated from PA educational programs supported \n     by Title VII are 59 percent more likely to be from \n     underrepresented minority populations and 46 percent more \n     likely to work in a rural health clinic than graduates of \n     programs that were not supported by Title VII.\n       The AAPA is very pleased to see included in this \n     legislation several very important updates and additions to \n     the Title VII statute related to physician assistant \n     training. Specifically, the updated definition of PA \n     education programs is long overdue and accurately reflects \n     the educational preparation of PAs, as well as the definition \n     and standards of the approximately 140 PA programs in the \n     U.S. Additionally, we strongly support the inclusion of a set \n     15 percent carve-out for PA programs within the primary care \n     medicine and dentistry cluster. Finally, we support the \n     inclusion of PA education programs within many new or \n     expanded programmatic sections of the bill, including \n     geriatric training centers and continuing education programs \n     for health professionals in underserved areas.\n       The AAPA applauds your efforts to support and expand \n     America's primary care workforce through a clarified and \n     strengthened Title VII. We are pleased to work with you and \n     to support the Health Professions and Primary Care \n     Reinvestment Act of 2008.\n           Sincerely yours,\n\n                                         William F.

Clinton,\n      Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Clinton: On behalf of the American College of \n     Preventive Medicine I write to express our sincere \n     appreciation and thanks for your efforts to reauthorize the \n     Title VII health professions training programs at the Health \n     Resources and Services Administration, HRSA. As a result of \n     your steadfast commitment to bolstering our health care \n     safety net in underserved communities and extending the \n     reaches of preventive medicine physicians, health care \n     services--including important preventive services--will reach \n     the doorsteps of countless Americans who currently lack \n     access to a health care provider.\n       With your legislation the time has now come to reinvigorate \n     and refinance the Title VII health professions training \n     programs at the necessary levels in order to protect access \n     to health care for vulnerable populations, improve disease \n     prevention and health promotion efforts, and maintain our \n     graduate medical education commitment to quality and \n     workforce diversity.\n\n[[Page S10673]]\n\n       While a limited number of preventive medicine residency \n     training programs in New York and other states have benefited \n     from Title VII funds, it is important that Congress act now \n     to expand the reaches of Title VII's mission to enhance the \n     supply, diversity, and distribution of the health care \n     workforce in all underserved communities across the country. \n     A key step toward addressing health system reform is ensuring \n     availability of services across all communities.\n       We thank you for recognizing the importance of preventive \n     medicine physicians in securing our health care safety net \n     and promoting disease prevention and health promotion \n     programs. We look forward to our continued dialogue and thank \n     you for the opportunity to work with you and your staff to \n     address this very important issue.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                     Michael D. Parkinson, MD,\n\n                                                       MPH, FACPM,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                              ADA/American Dental Association,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 19, 2008.\n     Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton,\n     Russell Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Clinton: The American Dental Association, ADA, \n     which represents 156,000 dentists, congratulates you on \n     introducing the ``Health Professions and Primary Care \n     Reinvestment Act.'' The ADA greatly appreciates the attention \n     that you and your staff have given to the unique needs of \n     Title VII federal dental programs and believe that many of \n     the changes incorporated in this bill will help greatly to \n     advance these programs.\n       We are especially pleased that your bill provides general \n     practice and pediatric dental residency programs with a \n     funding line. This acknowledgement underscores that oral \n     health care is as equally important as medical care and \n     should not be a subset of medical program funding. We believe \n     that by creating Section 748 Training in General and \n     Pediatric Dentistry that Congress will be better able to \n     effectively address dental education training needs.\n       We also appreciate the inclusion of dentists in Section 9, \n     which focuses on geriatric training. The ADA has placed a \n     high priority on addressing the oral health needs of \n     ``vulnerable'' older adults--individuals over age 65 with \n     limited mobility and/or limited resources and/or complex \n     health status. Older adults face a variety of special oral \n     health challenges, including root and coronal caries, \n     periodontal disease, tooth wear, edentulousness, oral cancer, \n     complications from taking prescription and over-the-counter \n     medications and other medical concerns that affect oral \n     health. We recognize that a key component in addressing these \n     needs is to enhance the educational infrastructure and \n     dentist education and training. We believe that your bill has \n     opened the door to accomplish these goals.\n       Addressing the oral health care needs of the older \n     generation often overlaps with providing care to children and \n     adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities. \n     While the bill does not include a new section to address the \n     training of dentists to work with these patients, we \n     understand the time constraints your staff faced in getting \n     this bill introduced this year. We look forward to continuing \n     to work with you on this issue and remain hopeful that we \n     will be able to include a provision dealing with this \n     important issue next year.\n       Thank you and your staff, particularly Dr. Kathleen Klink, \n     for working with the American Dental Association to enhance \n     dental education programs. We believe that the ``Health \n     Professions and Primary Care Reinvestment Act'' will \n     contribute to the ADA's own efforts to improve dental \n     education programs and improve the oral health care of all \n     Americans.\n           Sincerely,\n                                          John S. Findley, D.D.S.,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n         ADEA and AAPD,\n                                                November 19, 2008.\n     Hon. Hillary Clinton,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Clinton: The American Dental Education \n     Association (ADEA) and the American Academy of Pediatric \n     Dentistry (AAPD) are pleased to endorse the Health \n     Professions Primary Care Reinvestment Act. Our organizations \n     represent dental education and the practicing pediatric \n     dentists.\n       The primary care dental provisions contained in the \n     legislation continue and enhance the cost-effective General \n     Dentistry and Pediatric Dentistry residency training \n     programs. The bill also authorizes support of dental loan \n     repayment for those who teach or conduct research in General \n     or Pediatric Dentistry residencies, which is particularly \n     important to maintaining a cadre of well-trained dentists to \n     meet the oral health care needs of the nation. Most \n     importantly, we are delighted with the language which allows \n     dental schools to apply for grants for faculty development \n     and academic administrative units. We applaud the decision to \n     provide a guideline authorization of $20 million for these \n     important programs.\n       Our Associations appreciate the time and effort that you \n     and your staff made to consider our analysis of important \n     trends and needs in dental education, and to address our \n     concerns about the bill. The Health Professions Primary Care \n     Reinvestment Act is a significant improvement over \n     legislation in the last Congress in terms of provisions \n     affecting health workforce, information, evaluation and \n     analysis, and geriatric training. Your staff is to be \n     commended for drafting legislation that is performance-based \n     and ensures that important strides made to date will not be \n     diminished.\n       Please contact our legislative representatives if we can be \n     of further assistance: Myla Moss at ADEA 202-289-7201 or \n     Scott Litch at AAPD 312-337-2169 ext. 29.\n           Sincerely,\n     Beverly Largent, D.M.D.,\n       AAPD President.\n     John S.

The \n     Title VII Health Professions programs help strengthen and \n     diversify our nation's primary care workforce. The Health \n     Professions and Primary Care Reinvestment Act reauthorizes \n     these vital programs while greatly improving them.\n       AMHPS is particularly interested in your efforts to \n     continue to strengthen the diversity cluster of the Title VII \n     programs--Centers of Excellence (COI), Health Careers \n     Opportunities Program (HCOP), Faculty Loan Repayment, and \n     Scholarships for Disadvantaged Students (SDS). These programs \n     have been a tremendous federal government investment into the \n     institutions that focus on increasing the number of health \n     professionals and the diversity of the health professions. In \n     the November 2008 issue of Academic Medicine, the article \n     ``Funding the Diversity Programs of the Title VII Health \n     Professions Training Grants: An Urgent Need,'' written by two \n     AMHPS institution presidents--Dr. John Maupin of Morehouse \n     School of Medicine and Dr. Wayne Riley of Meharry Medical \n     College--confirms that your efforts making a tremendous \n     effort towards improving the health of all Americans.\n       Again. thank you for introducing the Health Professions and \n     Primary Care Reinvestment Act. Your continued leadership and \n     dedication to health care is greatly appreciated. We urge you \n     to do all that you can to see that building a stronger \n     workforce of primary care professionals that is more diverse \n     is a top priority during the current health care debate. \n     Ensuring passage of your important bill would be a very good \n     first step,\n           Sincerely,\n     Wayne Harris, Ph.D.,\n       Chairman, Board of Directors, Association of Minority \n     Health Professions Schools.\n                                  ____\n\n                                         Association of Schools of\n\n\n                                                Public Health,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 18, 2008.\n     Hon. Hillary Rodham Clinton,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Clinton: On behalf of the Association of \n     Schools of Public Health (ASPH), I would like to thank you \n     for introducing the Health Professions and Primary Care \n     Reinvestment Act. Your leadership in introducing legislation \n     that would reauthorize Title VII of the Public Health Service \n     Act takes a vital step in providing support to the health \n     care delivery system, health care and public health \n     professionals.\n       By 2012 over 100,000 public health workers are eligible to \n     retire (23 percent of the workforce). More importantly, in \n     order to have the same public health workforce to population \n     ratio in 2020 as existed in 1980, the public health workforce \n     would need to add an additional 250,000 workers. As Congress \n     begins to consider legislation that would overhaul the health \n     insurance system in this country, we hope that the Health \n     Professions and Primary Care Reinvestment Act will be \n     considered to ensure a well trained health care workforce \n     will be in place to meet the increased demand for basic \n     health care services.\n       We would like to thank you for the inclusion of public \n     health in several sections of the bill including the Health \n     Professions Training for Diversity provisions of the \n     legislation. Expansion of the program to include training for \n     the next generation of researchers and educators is important \n     as public health researchers in the early stages of their \n     careers offer novel investigator-initiated research ideas \n     that could transform science and policy.\n       We applaud the establishment of the Academic Health \n     Department (AHD) Program to establish partnerships between \n     accredited Schools of Public Health (SPH) and state or local \n     public health departments. This program has demonstrated \n     success in expanding SPH/health department partnerships with \n     the goal of developing models of collaboration in the areas \n     of teaching and service. The\n\n[[Page S10674]]\n\n     training programs offered by AHDs will provide learning \n     opportunities for public health professionals throughout \n     their careers. We also appreciate the continued support of \n     the existing Public Health and Preventive Medicine Program \n     which offers vital support to train health professionals in \n     this important area.\n       Again, we would like to thank you for your leadership and \n     we look forward to working with you as you work to advance \n     this legislation. We are glad to see your commitment to \n     addressing workforce shortage issues in health care and offer \n     our support of the Health Professions and Primary Care \n     Reinvestment Act.\n       Sincerely,\n                                     Harrison C.

The \n     Title VII Health Professions programs help strengthen and \n     diversity our nation's primary care workforce.

For \n     many years, these programs have demonstrated a tremendous \n     federal government investment into the institutions that \n     focus on increasing the number of health professionals and \n     the diversity of the health professions.\n       Again, thank you for introducing the Health Professions and \n     Primary Care Reinvestment Act.

Hillary Rodham Clinton,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Clinton: On behalf of the Society of General \n     Internal Medicine, I want to applaud your leadership in \n     advancing national policies that promote improved patient \n     care for all Americans. In particular, I want to commend you \n     on the introduction of the Health Professions and Primary \n     Care Reinvestment Act.\n       By any measure, primary care, including general internal \n     medicine, is the cornerstone of our nation's health care \n     system. Patients with primary care physicians have better \n     health status, longer life expectancy and lower health care \n     costs. Moreover, for the poor, the uninsured and the elderly, \n     primary care functions as a safety net, serving as the first \n     and often the only contact for care and treatment.\n       For more than three decades, the Title VII Training in \n     Primary Care Medicine and Dentistry (TPCMD) program, in \n     particular, has contributed significantly to improving the \n     quality of education and training of the nation's primary \n     care workforce, with special emphasis on individuals from \n     disadvantaged backgrounds and underrepresented minorities. \n     But challenges remain. For example, forecasts are that the \n     demand for general internists will increase by 38 percent \n     within the next 15 years, while the number of new physicians \n     entering the field of general internal medicine continues to \n     decline.\n       By strengthening and expanding the TPCMD program, your \n     legislation recognizes that primary care is the linchpin of \n     our health care system and that an adequate, well-trained \n     primary care workforce is critical to the success of any \n     health care reform measures Congress undertakes.\n       In addition, your legislation calls for a more \n     comprehensive approach to addressing the systemic needs of \n     our health care system, including the creation of primary \n     care training institutes that will promote all-important \n     collaboration across all primary care disciplines, as well as \n     partnering with community health centers in a way that will \n     speed the translation of research into community practice. \n     Furthermore, the work of these institutes will help \n     contribute to better health outcomes by fostering the \n     development of the patient-centered medical home model.\n       At a time when 47 million Americans lack health coverage, \n     when increasing numbers of elderly are entering the age of \n     highest risk of chronic disease, and when racial and ethnic \n     disparities persist, the Health Professions and Primary Care \n     Investment Act provides a solid framework for meeting these \n     challenges.\n       Again, thank you for introducing this important \n     legislation.

which was referred to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation:\n\n                              S. Res. 709\n\n       Whereas Atlantic bluefin tuna fishery is valuable \n     commercially and recreationally in the United States and many \n     other countries;\n       Whereas the International Convention for the Conservation \n     of Atlantic Tunas entered into force on March 21, 1969;\n       Whereas the Convention established the International \n     Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas to \n     coordinate international research and develop, implement, and \n     enforce compliance of the conservation and management \n     recommendations on the Atlantic bluefin tuna and other highly \n     migratory species in the Atlantic Ocean and the adjacent \n     seas, including the Mediterranean Sea;\n       Whereas in 1974, the Commission adopted its first \n     conservation and management recommendation to ensure the \n     sustainability of Atlantic bluefin tuna throughout the \n     Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea, while allowing for the \n     maximum sustainable catch for food and other purposes;\n       Whereas in 1981, for management purposes, the Commission \n     adopted a working hypothesis of 2 Atlantic bluefin tuna \n     stocks, with 1 occurring west of 45 degrees west longitude \n     (hereinafter referred to as the ``western Atlantic stock'') \n     and the other occurring east of 45 degrees west longitude \n     (hereinafter referred to as the ``eastern Atlantic and \n     Mediterranean stock'');\n       Whereas, despite scientific recommendations intended to \n     maintain bluefin tuna populations at levels that will permit \n     the maximum sustainable yield and ensure the future of the \n     stocks, the total allowable catch quotas have been \n     consistently set at levels significantly higher than the \n     recommended levels for the eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean \n     stock;\n       Whereas despite the establishment by the Commission of \n     fishing quotas based on total allowable catch levels for the \n     eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean bluefin tuna fishery that \n     exceed scientific recommendations, compliance with such \n     quotas by parties to the Convention that harvest that stock \n     has been extremely poor, most recently with harvests \n     exceeding such total allowable catch levels by more than 50 \n     percent for each of the last 4 years;\n       Whereas insufficient data reporting in combination with \n     unreliable national catch statistics has frequently \n     undermined efforts by the Commission to assign quota \n     overharvests to specific countries;\n\n[[Page S10676]]\n\n       Whereas the failure of many Commission members fishing east \n     of 45 degrees west longitude to comply with other Commission \n     recommendations to conserve and control the overfished \n     eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean bluefin tuna stock has \n     been an ongoing problem;\n       Whereas the Commission's Standing Committee on Research and \n     Statistics noted in its 2006 report that the fishing \n     mortality rate for the eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean \n     stock may be more than 3 times the level that would permit \n     the stock to stabilize at the maximum sustainable catch \n     level, and continuing to fish at the level of recent years \n     ``is expected to drive the spawning biomass to a very low \n     level'' giving ``rise to a high risk of fishery and stock \n     collapse'';\n       Whereas the Standing Committee's 2008 report recommended \n     that the annual harvest levels for eastern Atlantic and \n     Mediterranean bluefin tuna be reduced from 32,000 metric tons \n     to 15,000 metric tons or less to halt decline of the resource \n     and initiate rebuilding;\n       Whereas the Standing Committee has stated that time and \n     area closures could greatly facilitate the implementation and \n     monitoring of rebuilding strategies and recommended a closure \n     of the Mediterranean Sea in May, June, and July, as well as a \n     minimum size limit of 25 kilograms;\n       Whereas in 2006, the Commission adopted the \n     ``Recommendation by ICCAT to Establish a Multi-Annual \n     Recovery Plan for Bluefin Tuna in the eastern Atlantic and \n     Mediterranean'' containing a wide range of management, \n     monitoring, and control measures designed to facilitate the \n     recovery of the eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean bluefin \n     tuna stock;\n       Whereas the Recovery Plan is inadequate and allows \n     overfishing and stock decline to continue, and initial \n     information indicates that implementation of the plan in 2007 \n     by many eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean bluefin tuna \n     harvesting countries has been poor;\n       Whereas since 1981, the Commission has adopted additional \n     and more restrictive conservation and management \n     recommendations for the western Atlantic bluefin tuna stock, \n     and these recommendations have been implemented by Nations \n     fishing west of 45 degrees west longitude, including the \n     United States;\n       Whereas despite adopting, fully implementing, and complying \n     with a science-based rebuilding program for the western \n     Atlantic bluefin tuna stock by countries fishing west of 45 \n     degrees west longitude, catches and catch rates remain very \n     low;\n       Whereas many scientists believe that mixing occurs between \n     the western Atlantic bluefin tuna stock and the eastern \n     Atlantic and Mediterranean stock, and as such, poor \n     management and noncompliance with recommendations for one \n     stock are likely to have an adverse effect on the other \n     stock; and\n       Whereas additional research on stock mixing will improve \n     the understanding of the relationship between eastern and \n     western bluefin tuna stocks and other fisheries, which will \n     assist in the conservation, recovery, and management of the \n     species throughout its range: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that the \n     United States delegation to the 16th Special Meeting of the \n     International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic \n     Tunas, should--\n       (1) pursue a meaningful assessment of Commission member \n     compliance with the ``Recommendation by ICCAT to Establish a \n     Multi-Annual Recovery Plan for Bluefin Tuna in the eastern \n     Atlantic and Mediterranean'' (Recommendation 06-05), \n     including seeking detailed explanations from Commission \n     members that have failed to effectively implement the terms \n     of the recommendation;\n       (2) pursue the adoption by the Commission of measures \n     designed to eliminate non-compliance, including, as \n     appropriate, deducting a portion of a future quota for a \n     party to compensate for such party exceeding its quota in \n     prior years, and where appropriate, steps should be taken to \n     link non-compliance with reductions in fishery or market \n     access;\n       (3) seek a temporary suspension of the eastern Atlantic and \n     Mediterranean bluefin tuna fishery, including all trade, if \n     significant progress toward establishing science-based \n     management measures, improving monitoring and control \n     measures, and addressing compliance issues is not made at the \n     Commission this year;\n       (4) seek to strengthen the conservation and management of \n     the eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean bluefin tuna by making \n     recommendations to halt the decline of the stock and begin to \n     rebuild it, including reducing annual harvest levels so that \n     they do not exceed recommendations of the Standing Committee \n     and expanding the time and area closure for the Mediterranean \n     purse seine fleet to include May, June, and July; and\n       (5) pursue additional research on the relationship between \n     the western Atlantic and eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean \n     bluefin tuna stocks and the extent to which the populations \n     intermingle.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/11/19/senate-section/article/S10676-1", "month":
