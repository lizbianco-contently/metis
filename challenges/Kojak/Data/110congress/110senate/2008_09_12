The senior Senator from Michigan is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, as previously announced, there are no \nrollcall votes today or Monday. Senators should expect the next vote to \noccur on Tuesday. However, Senator Warner and I will be here today, we \nwill be here Monday, and we will, of course, be here Tuesday morning to \ndiscuss amendments with Senators to try to get these amendments \nconsidered or at least in line to be considered. We are clearing \namendments. We have a managers' package already that is ready to go \nwith--I am not sure how many amendments we have already put in there--\nperhaps 15 or 16 amendments that have already been cleared. We can't \nget them passed yet because of an objection, but we would expect that \nobjection would be removed by Tuesday. We will continue in the next few \ndays, over the weekend, to try to agree upon many of the 200-plus \namendments that have been filed so that we would be hopeful that we \nwould have a large\n\n[[Page S8458]]\n\nnumber of amendments in a managers' package ready to go on Tuesday if \nwe can get the objection removed.\n  We also hope that we could, today and Monday, debate amendments which \nwill be requiring rollcall votes on Tuesday. Our goal is to try to \ncomplete consideration of this bill by Tuesday night. The majority \nleader has indicated he will be filing cloture today, which means there \nwould be a cloture vote on Tuesday, and hopefully we would get to the \npoint on Tuesday where the amendments which need rollcall votes could \nbe voted on Tuesday and that we would have a large managers' package \nand that we would not have to go to a cloture vote on Tuesday and \ninstead try to get to final passage without it. That is the lineup. My \ndear friend from Virginia and I are here to work with Senators to try \nto see if we can't get amendments lined up for votes and other \namendments agreed upon so that they will be part of the managers' \npackage.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The senior Senator from Virginia is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank the Presiding Officer. I join my \ncolleague. We are here.\n  I wish to also bring to the attention of colleagues that at the close \nof business last night we were informed there are over 200 amendments \nat the desk. It is our hope that perhaps Senators who have filed those \namendments could work with the managers and/or our staffs such that \nthey could be added to, hopefully, a future package that will receive \nthe support of the Senate by a UC. So therein is a very significant \namount of work resting at the desk.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, if I could add one further thought, with \nthe help of our staffs, we have actually been making some progress in \nterms of some significant discussions that have not been on the Senate \nfloor but nonetheless are taking place, so that we are making some \nprogress on some sticking points, to try to resolve some sticking \npoints to at least get them to a position where they can be voted upon \neven if they can't be agreed to. So I am optimistic, if everybody \ncooperates----\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, in that vein, Senator Vitter and Senator \nDeMint worked with us last night, and Senator Coburn.\n  Mr. LEVIN. And others, yes. The leaders are involved through their \nstaffs and perhaps personally in these discussions. But it is our \neffort, our intent, our goal, and our hope that we can get this bill \nready for passage, either without a cloture vote or with one, by the \nend of Tuesday night. That is our goal. The leadership has been very \nhelpful in trying to help us reach that goal, and that is our intent.\n  I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5296\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I am rising to speak in regard to the \nDefense authorization bill, which is now being considered on the floor \nof the Senate. I am delighted that we are moving forward with this \npiece of legislation. It is something that gets passed every year. It \nis important that we get this kind of legislation passed because, with \nthe challenges the country is facing, we need to deal with some very \nvital issues in the defense of this country and also take care of the \nfamilies and the men and women in the armed services.\n  I want to mention a few things about a couple of amendments I plan on \nintroducing at some point in time for consideration by the Senate. One \nof them has to do with Fort Carson, which is located in Colorado \nSprings, CO. It is an attractive place, if you are in the Army, to be \nassigned. It is one of the bases where we are looking at some expansion \npossibilities.\n  One of the key points with the new personnel we are bringing is that \nthey need more training space. So I have been working with the Colorado \nSprings community and the commander at Fort Carson, as well as the \nArmy, to facilitate this so it can move forward and everybody would be \ncomfortable with what is being done. Earlier in our discussions, when I \nvisited with the commander, he assured me that in the process of \nacquiring property he would protect private property rights. That is \nextremely important to the people of Colorado, particularly in the \nrural areas. This expanded training area is in a very rural area in \nsouthern Colorado. With the assurance that they would protect private \nproperty rights, I began to say that now you need to talk to the \nmembers of the communities and elected officials and see if you cannot \nwork out some agreement. The Army has put forth considerable efforts up \nto this particular point in time. I have been asked to begin to \npropound an amendment that would support the Army's position on \nprotecting property rights.\n  Last year, as part of the fiscal year 2008 Defense Authorization Act, \nI included language that would require the Army to submit to Congress \nan outline of their justification for the expansion of the Pinon Canyon \nmaneuver site. I was pleased with the Army's findings and am convinced \nthere is a critical need for additional training space for the new \ntroops that are set to arrive at Fort Carson in the near future.\n  Although the Army identified a need of 418,577 acres, they have \ndecided that just over 100,000 acres will be adequate to meet their \nimmediate needs. These 100,000 acres will still provide the necessary \nspace for enhanced training but will have less of an impact on the \nsurrounding community.\n  In reading the Army's report, I believe they have shown their \nwillingness to work with the community on a variety of issues: land, \ncultural resources, and historic preservation concerns in the area. For \nexample, Otero County, one of the neighboring counties to Pinon Canyon, \nhas asked that the footprint of the expansion not invade the Comanche \nNational Grassland, and the Army's new plan leaves that area untouched. \nAdditional community leaders suggested that the expansion site not \ncross Interstate 350, which the Army has also agreed to.\n  I also want to draw attention to the economic impact data that \nsignals significant increases in revenue for the surrounding area. The \nexpansion would generate more than 100 full-time civilian and \ncontractor positions, equalling as much as $5 million in payroll. These \nwould be civilian jobs and would yield increased property and tax sale \nrevenue for the area.\n  Now, that is important, because if you have Federal facilities in \nyour county, the Federal Government doesn't pay taxes. They make \npayments in lieu of taxes. Many times, the complaints we have from \nlocal governments in Colorado say it doesn't measure up to the lost \nrevenue if that had been a facility in the private sector. This is an \nimportant part of that, so this part of Colorado wants and needs \neconomic development. They need ways to be able to expand their \nproperty tax base so they can support their schools and support their \ncommunity infrastructure in that area and in the country. So this is a \nvery important provision, as far as the elected officials in that \narea. Most importantly, the Army has again reiterated their commitment \nto acquire the land from willing sellers only.\n\n  In spite of the Army's continued commitment to acquire the land for \nexpansion only from willing sellers, there is still apprehension among \nthe landowners, and I want to help ease that concern. That is why I \nwill be proposing later on this amendment to the Defense authorization \nbill. It is an amendment which will take the possibility of eminent \ndomain completely off the table.\n  As I said time and again, we must remember that property rights go \nboth ways. Landowners should have the right to keep or sell their land \nif they so choose. If there are willing sellers in the area of the \nproposed expansion, then I see a very win-win solution.\n  Again, property owners don't want to have the Army come in and begin \nto condemn their property. Many of the farmers and ranchers have \nproperty in their families that date clear back to the Mexican land \ngrant era in Colorado. They are very established in those areas and \nhave no desire to move and want to be a part of the community and do \nnot want to be forced out of the area.\n\n[[Page S8459]]\n\n  I have said time and again, we must be very sensitive about property \nrights. The Army now has issued this comprehensive plan which shows the \ncritical need for expansion. The Army has completed everything Congress \nhas asked of them in the previous legislation. They continue to work \nwith community leaders and landowners to find a win-win situation.\n  Fort Carson is growing fast and will soon have an additional brigade \ncombat team. The United States has a responsibility to ensure our \nservice men and women who have so courageously chosen to serve this \ngreat country receive the best training possible. I believe this \nexpansion will help them do so.\n  I hope this amendment I will be offering will ease the concerns of \nour ranchers in the area, and we can soon move forward with a decision \nfrom the Army and from the locally elected officials and ranchers \ninvolved in the area.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5298\n\n  Mr. President, another amendment I have been working on is an \namendment to bring attention to the fact that our military \nservicemembers are faced with an ineffective process and unnecessary \nhurdles when attempting to exercise their right to vote.\n  Military absentee voting gained attention in the 2000 Presidential \nelection. The Government Accountability Office reported that military \nballots during the 2000 election were disqualified five times as often \nas civilian ballots. Despite numerous attempts by the Congress, our \nmilitary continued to face voting problems in the 2002, 2004, and 2006 \nelections.\n  In 2006, Active-Duty military voted at a rate of 42 percent lower \nthan the general population. It reported 47 percent of servicemembers \nwho wanted to vote never got the chance to do so. This amounts to over \n110,000 of our Nation's bravest and most patriotic men and women who \nwere denied the right to vote.\n  Of those who were able to cast a vote, only 20 percent of them were \neven counted. This is simply unacceptable. These men and women risk \ntheir lives for democracy and freedom and voting rights all over the \nworld. As we did over 60 years ago during World War II, the voting \nprocess still depends on a single soldier in the field reading a large \nnumber of pages in a guide--I am told up to 466--and being informed on \nhow each individual soldier is to vote under specific precinct \nguidelines. If a soldier is able to complete this step in the process, \nthe mail system must still track down a moving target in order to get \nthe ballot to a soldier who has the intention of voting. Warfighting \nand technology have come a long way since World War II, and in my view \nit is unconscionable that our voting capabilities have failed to keep \nup for our men and women in the military.\n  In recent years, there have been several voting ballot programs that \nwould allow the soldier to request, receive, download, and print their \nabsentee ballots no matter where they are deployed. We now have the \ncapability to use electronic signatures. These are effective programs \nand would remove most, if not all, major hurdles facing our men and \nwomen in uniform who would like to exercise their right to vote. \nDespite these attempted advancements, none have been universally put \ninto place. Our military men and women remain disenfranchised at the \npolling place.\n  It is time the United States ensures their right to vote. We have \ndeployed these men and women to all corners of the world. We have sent \nthem to Iraq and Afghanistan to fight for our security and freedom. \nThey help to ensure the rights of others to have a voice in their \nGovernment. As we approach November and arguably the most monumental \nelection of our time, I call on our colleagues to ensure that our men \nand women in uniform are given the opportunity to have their votes \nheard.\n  I will be offering an amendment at some point to the Defense \nauthorization bill, and the amendment will basically do two things: \nFirst, it will eliminate the notary requirement on both the Federal \npostcard application to request absentee ballots, as well as the notary \nrequirement on voted ballots. This is unnecessary as civilians in most \nStates are not required to even do this.\n  Second, this amendment will permit electronic submission of the \nFederal postcard application. The Federal postcard application is an \napplication needed to request an absentee ballot. By allowing \nelectronic submission of this document, it will not just allow greater \naccessibility in a timely manner but will also allow servicemembers to \nrequest their absentee ballots closer to the election date, hopefully \ngranting them additional time to know where they may be stationed in \nNovember.\n  Additionally, this amendment expresses the sense of Congress to \nencourage the States to permit members of the Armed Forces to apply \nfor, receive, and submit absentee ballots for elections for Federal \noffice by electronic means and to encourage the Department of Defense \nto implement and maintain programs that permit the secure submittal by \nmembers of the Armed Forces of absentee ballots for election for \nFederal office by electronic means.\n  It is simply time for Congress to ensure our military men and women \nthe accessibility and right to vote, particularly at a time when we \nhave the technology to provide the reliability and integrity of the \nsystem. I call on my colleagues to support me in this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nletters from the Colorado Secretary of State, the American Legion, Vets \nfor Freedom, and the National Vietnam & Gulf War Veterans Coalition.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                State of Colorado,\n\n\n                                          Department of State,\n\n                                         Denver, CO, May 27, 2008.\n     Hon. Wayne Allard,\n     Dirksen Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Allard: Thank you for your consideration of \n     the amendment expanding voting rights for our overseas \n     military personnel. This proposal is the result of a military \n     voting task force I convened last year in Colorado Springs. \n     Members included active-duty voting assistance officers from \n     Ft. Carson, Peterson AFB and the Air Force Academy, in \n     addition to the El Paso County Clerk and Recorder and other \n     elections officials.\n       As you know, this task force was obviously close to home \n     for me as Secretary of State and my service in the military. \n     During a tour in Iraq in 2005, I witnessed first-hand some of \n     the impediments to voting for military personnel in field. \n     Continuing to streamline the voting process for overseas \n     military is a priority for my administration and hopefully, \n     this amendment will help raise the bar nationally.\n       In working with the voting assistance officers, we felt \n     that requiring notarized voter registration and absentee \n     ballot applications are undue burdens on overseas military, \n     especially those on the front lines and forward operating \n     bases. In addition, overseas personnel should also be \n     permitted to submit their postcard applications \n     electronically, either through fax or e-mail.\n       Last September I attended a working conference hosted by \n     the Election Assistance Commission on facilitating UOCAVA \n     voting. There were a number of stakeholders in attendance \n     including representatives from the Federal Voting Assistance \n     Program and several state and local election officials. \n     During the conference, there was significant support from the \n     attending election officials for federal legislation that \n     would eliminate barriers for military voters.\n       Like many other States, Colorado is already compliant with \n     this proposed amendment and our military voters have \n     certainly taken advantage of these opportunities. Our State \n     election officials carefully monitor these applications and \n     have built-in safeguards to ensure the integrity of the \n     process.\n       Again, thank you for pursuing this necessary amendment to \n     ensure that our overseas citizens have every opportunity to \n     participate in their elections back home.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Mike Coffman,\n     Secretary of State.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                          The American Legion,\n\n                                    Indianapolis, IN, May 7, 2008.\n     Hon. Wayne Allard,\n     U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Allard: The American Legion fully supports \n     your proposed amendment to the Defense Authorization Bill \n     that would improve and speed the process of procedures \n     relating to overseas voting by members of our Armed Forces. \n     As I understand it, the amendment would eliminate the notary \n     requirement on voted ballots, and allow electronic submission \n     of the Federal Postcard Application for absentee ballot \n     requests.\n       The American Legion has been an advocate of the voting \n     rights of members of the U.S. Armed Forces for many years. We \n     believe that the improvements you have proposed will make it \n     possible for increased numbers of our service members \n     deployed around the world to participate in our election \n     process.\n\n[[Page S8460]]\n\n       Thank you for your continued support of our military forces \n     and their families.\n           Sincerely,\n                                        Martin ``Marty'' Conatser,\n     National Commander.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                             Vets for Freedom,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 29, 2008.\n     Hon. Wayne Allard,\n     U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Allard, On behalf of all the members of Vets \n     for Freedom, the largest Iraq and Afghanistan veterans \n     organization in the United States, I am honored to stand \n     beside you in support of your proposed amendment related to \n     improving the military voting process.\n       This important piece of legislation ensures that the men \n     and women who wear our nation's uniform are not left out of \n     the election process while serving in harm's way. These brave \n     and patriotic soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines who \n     protect the very right to vote deserve nothing less. As such, \n     Vets for Freedom strongly supports this bi-partisan effort.\n       As this piece of legislation makes its way through \n     Congress, Vets for Freedom looks forward to working with you \n     to ensure passage. Thank you for your continued support of \n     our nation's veterans.\n           Warm regards,\n                                                     Pete Hegseth,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                  National Vietnam\n\n\n                                & Gulf War Veterans Coalition,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 7, 2008.\n     Re Amendment to the Defense Reauthorization Bill.\n\n     Hon. Wayne Allard,\n     U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Allard, On behalf of the members of the \n     National Vietnam & Gulf War Veterans Coalition, an \n     organization comprised of more than eighty veterans \n     organizations and veterans advocacy groups, which is \n     committed to advocating for our troops and veterans, we \n     support your efforts to eliminate the hurdles currently faced \n     by deployed members of our armed services who endeavor to \n     vote.\n       The above-referenced amendment will provide improvements \n     long overdue in enabling members of our armed services to \n     cast their ballots. Currently, there are over 848,000 members \n     of our armed forces serving in overseas assignments. These \n     men and women are willing to risk their lives to ensure \n     democracy throughout the world. It is important that our \n     military personnel be provided with the same opportunity to \n     exercise their right to vote as enjoyed by those Americans \n     citizens who do not serve in the armed forces. Accordingly, \n     the National Vietnam & Gulf War Veterans Coalition fully \n     supports this bipartisan amendment.\n       The National Vietnam & Gulf War Veterans Coalition as an \n     organization dedicated to the members of our armed services \n     greatly anticipates the passage of this legislation and \n     encourages your efforts to improve the currently ineffective \n     voting process available to our military.\n       Our brochure, reflecting the names of the Coalition's \n     member organizations, is enclosed for your reference.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   John J. Molloy,\n                                                         Chairman.\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I am glad to see we are able to move \nforward with the Armed Services bill. I have taken some time and talked \nabout a couple of amendments that I will offer that I think are \nimportant. I fully intend to call them up as we proceed with the debate \non this important bill, important not only to our men and women in the \nArmed Forces but to the process, and important to the country as a \nwhole.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I understand Senator Bill Nelson was \nhere earlier. I ask unanimous consent that he be recognized at the \nconclusion of my remarks.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                       Honoring our Armed Forces\n\n                     Specialist Ronnie D. Williams\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, we are honored to live in a country \nwith the bravest men and women in uniform in the world. I rise to pay \ntribute to one of those warriors, SP Ronnie D. Williams of Morning \nView, KY, tragically killed on July 17, 2005, after his tank overturned \nwhile on patrol in Baghdad.\n  Specialist Williams was 26 years old. It was his second tour of duty \nin Iraq. For his bravery in uniform, he received several awards, \nmedals, and decorations, including the National Defense Service Medal \nand the Army Commendation Medal.\n  Although his Army files may list him as ``Ronnie,'' just about anyone \nwho knew Specialist Williams called him by his nickname, ``John Boy.'' \nHis mom Sharon Williams explains why.\n  ``When he was born, `The Waltons' was on TV,'' she says. ``His uncle \nwas named Ronnie [and] we called him John, so when my son was born we \nnicknamed him John Boy, just like on the show.''\n  John Boy grew up in a big family and had an active childhood. He \nloved to hunt and would go hunting for deer and turkey. One frequent \nhunting companion was his uncle, Lance Anderson.\n  He loved fishing as well and once went fishing with his father-in-\nlaw, William O'Banion, and caught a 42-pound catfish.\n  ``If I had a choice out of a million boys to be my son-in-law, he \nwould have been No. 1,'' Williams said.\n  John Boy's wife Darlene also knew him when he was young and remembers \nthe fun he used to have as a child. ``John Boy grew up next door to \nme,'' Darlene says. ``We rode the same bus together. . . . He and my \nbrother were best friends. . . . They would go to the trestle in \nDeMossville to fish, but they wouldn't tell anybody so that they could \nkeep it a secret. They didn't want anyone to find their fishing hole.''\n  ``Growing up we fought like cats and dogs,'' she said. ``I grew up \nwith a bunch of boys--never any girls. I always played with my \nbrother's friends and he'd get mad.''\n  John Boy enjoyed spending time with his friends and family. ``When he \ncould come home, he'd say, 'OK, Mom--get the family together. It's time \nfor a card game.'''\n  John Boy's Uncle Lance was in the Marines, perhaps inspiring John Boy \nto follow in that tradition. According to Darlene, he was also \nmotivated by a love of his country. ``After 9/11, he said he wanted to \nmake a difference,'' she said.\n  John Boy graduated from Simon Kenton High School in Independence, KY, \nin 1998, and joined the Army in 2002. He was eventually assigned to the \n3rd Squadron, 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment based in Fort Carson, CO.\n  Even while serving his country away from home, however, John Boy \ndidn't forget the girl who had been, literally, next-door. ``Growing \nup, John Boy always told my dad that he'd marry me,'' Darlene says.\n  While back home on leave, John Boy and Darlene spent a lot of time \ntogether and, in her words, they ``hit it off pretty quick.'' Their \ndevotion to each other continued even across great distances, once he \nhad returned to his squadron.\n  ``I went out to Fort Carson to see him every other week,'' Darlene \nsays. ``It was a 24-hour drive. . . . It's a haul, especially in my '89 \nCavalier.''\n  On his last trip home, John Boy celebrated his birthday with his \nfamily,and he and Darlene took a belated honeymoon to Florida.\n  John Boy also made time to speak to kids when he was home and tell \nthem about his experiences in uniform. Some schoolchildren had written \nhim letters while he was away. He wanted to thank them personally.\n  ``When he came home, he visited River Ridge Elementary School because \nhis nieces attended there,'' Sharon recalls.\n  Darlene remembers how eager John Boy was to see the kids when he came \nhome. ``He had blisters on his feet and back, but instead of going home \nand relaxing, he went to his nieces' school to talk about the Army, and \nhe handed out candy to all the kids.''\n  Mr. President, our thoughts are with John Boy's family after their \nhorrible loss. We are thinking of his wife, Darlene Williams; his son, \nHouston David Williams; his mother, Sharon Williams; his father, Howard \nWilliams; his sisters, Crystal Herzog and Kathy Williams; his brothers, \nGeoffrey Williams and Howard Williams; his grandparents, David and Kay \nRedmond; his uncle, Lance Anderson; his parents-in-law, William Henry \nO'Banion, Jr. and Corinne O'Banion; and many other beloved friends and \nfamily members. Darlene adds about her husband:\n\n       I just want everyone to know what a wonderful man he was; \n     that he would do anything for anyone. He was so wonderful to \n     me.\n\n  I trust those who knew and loved SPC Ronnie D. Williams will not soon \nforget his enormous service and sacrifice for our Nation, and this \nSenate stands in admiration of devotion like his that continues to keep \nour Nation safe and free.\n\n[[Page S8461]]\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The senior Senator from Florida is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, as soon as the copy of my \namendment arrives, I will send it to the desk to file, not to offer at \nthis point. Although it is applicable to the Defense bill, I will save \nit, at the request of the chairman of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee, for next week's consideration of the Energy bill. It is an \namendment to protect the interests of the Department of Defense; to \nprotect the largest testing and training range in the world for our \nDefense Department.\n  Let me show you where it is. It is in the Gulf of Mexico, off of \nFlorida. It is all of this area outlined in yellow that is east of this \nlongitudinal line. That area in yellow, including this area up here, \n125 miles off Pensacola, is what was etched into law in 2006, 2 years \nago, as a protected area from drilling for oil and gas. And why is \nthat? Because everything east of that longitude-latitude line, all the \nway close to the coast of Florida, is the largest testing and training \narea for the United States military in the world.\n  Now, you may wonder why in the last round of base closures and \nrealignment--and remember, the acronym is BRAC, Base Realignment and \nClosure Commission, that is what BRAC stands for--in the realignment \nall of the pilot training for the new F-22 stealth fighter came to \nTyndall Air Force Base at Panama City. You may wonder why. Well, that \nF-22 does a dogfight at 1\\1/2\\ mach. You can imagine what the training \nradius, the turning radius, is for an F-22 as it is in a dogfight. It \nis at 1\\1/2\\ times the speed of sound. So it has all of that area out \nthere in which to train.\n  Why also, under the realignment, the BRAC process, did all of the \nnewly developed F-35s, called the Joint Strike Fighter, for the Navy, \nthe Air Force, and the Marines--and it is still being developed--why \ndid they determine that all of the pilot training for the new F-35s was \ngoing to be at Eglin Air Force Base, which is located right here, right \nwhere that military mission line hits the shore? That longitude line--\nEglin Air Force Base--why right there? It has all of that training area \nwhich is protected airspace.\n  Why is this area off bounds here? Well, certainly when we passed the \nlaw 2 years ago, the interests of a $65 million a year tourist \nindustry, dependent on pristine beaches, was considered. And by the \nway, Florida has more beaches than any other State. As a matter of \nfact, Florida has more coastline than any other State save Alaska, and \nAlaska doesn't have a lot of beaches. But we in Florida have barrier \nislands on most of Florida, and those barrier islands have \nextraordinary white sand beaches. So certainly that was an interest to \nprotect there. But there is another reason. Guess what is right there. \nPensacola Naval Air Station. That is where most of the Navy pilots and \nMarine pilots, naval aviators, that is where most of them learn to fly. \nSo they have all this training area and they can go out on a carrier \nand train as Navy pilots.\n  Now, speaking of the U.S. Navy, you will remember about 4 or 5 years \nago there was a big brouhaha over the U.S. Atlantic Fleet training down \noff the island which is a part of Puerto Rico--off the shore of Puerto \nRico and the island of Vieques. For decades, the U.S. Navy had trained \nits pilots there. But the people of Puerto Rico took great umbrage at \nthis, and they wanted it changed and they wanted it removed. They were \nafraid it was a health hazard, and so the United States acceded to that \nrequest. As a result, Vieques was shut down for the Atlantic fleet.\n  Well, where is the Atlantic fleet going to train? They have to train. \nWell, guess what. They came here--the largest testing and training area \nfor the United States in the world. And in all of this protected space \nthere are designated areas for the Navy, specifically off of Pensacola, \nup here, and then big areas of this part of the gulf for the Navy. The \nAir Force has mainly the rest of it, including some Air Force training \nover here.\n  Now, here is what happens with the Navy. We have the Key West Naval \nAir Station right here. It is actually not on Key West. There are \nheadquarters there on Key West, but the actual airfield is on the \nisland to the north of Key West called Boca Chica. So what happens is \nthey bring these Navy squadrons that are assigned to an Atlantic Fleet \nnaval aircraft carrier, they fly them into Boca Chica, they spend 2 or \n3 weeks there--these are the F-18s and will be the F-35s in the \nfuture--and then for that period of time they come out here and they \nhave all of this area that is restricted space in order to train.\n  The good news about that is that when they lift off from the runway \nhere at Boca Chica, within 2 minutes they are over restricted space. So \nthey do not have to fly a long way burning up a lot of fuel to get \nthere. In 2 minutes they are ready to start their aerial training and \ntheir dogfights.\n  Now, there is something else that is going on here. Because up here, \nat Fort Walton Beach, this huge Air Force facility called Eglin Air \nForce Base, is the test and evaluation center for all of the U.S. \nmilitary--all of the Department of Defense. And what they do is they \ntake all of these weapons systems--not just airplanes but air-to-\nsurface missiles, air-to-air missiles, surface-to-air missiles, \nsurface-to-surface missiles--and they shoot them and they train and \nthey test. This is the Air Force test and evaluation center, but for \nall of the Department of Defense, and we have some weapons systems that \nwe are shooting for hundreds of miles. From here to here is \napproximately 300 miles. So we have some weapons systems that are \nshooting hundreds of miles, and as a result, we need all of that.\n  Now, when we passed this law protecting this area from any drilling 2 \nyears ago, I had a statement in writing from the Secretary of Defense \nof what the policy is of the Department of Defense, which is that they \ndo not want drilling out here in this test, training, and evaluation \nrange. That is the operative policy as confirmed to me by the Deputy \nSecretary of Defense, Gordon England, in a phone call with him 2 days \nago. That is the operative policy.\n  The Department of Defense, presently the Secretary of the Navy, is \nconsidering whether they need all of this, but Secretary England told \nme that there is no way they are going to have a decision made before \nwe finish our session by the end of this month, and, therefore, we \nshould plan on the operative policy to be that the U.S. Department of \nDefense does not want any drilling of oil and gas out here because it \nwould mess up their testing, their evaluation, and their training.\n  So the amendment I am going to offer would apply to this Gulf of \nMexico area, east of this military mission line, which is this \nlongitude line, everything east of there to the coast. And I want to \nread it specifically. It is defined as the ``Joint Gulf Range Complex'' \nor the ``Gulf of Mexico Range.'' It would also include any military or \nNational Security Agency operations training or testing area that is \nused by a military or national security agency of the United States.\n  It says:\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary \n     of the Interior shall not issue any permit for oil and gas \n     leasing or extraction in an area described--as I have just \n     indicated--unless and until the President certifies, based on \n     written opinions provided by each of the Secretary of \n     Defense, the Secretary of the Navy, and the Secretary of the \n     Air Force, and the head of each appropriate national security \n     agency of the United States, that in balancing the national \n     security interests of the United States the advantages of oil \n     or gas extraction in the area outweigh the military and \n     national security missions being conducted in the area.\n\n  In other words, it is a fail-safe approach to say that it is going to \nforce us in the future--whenever we are considering changing laws like \nthis that protect this area for the military, that it shall have the \nforce of law that the Secretary of Interior has to get a written \ncertification from the President that the oil and gas extraction \noutweighs the military and national security missions being conducted \nin the area.\n  We are in a time in which our enemies want to do us harm. We are in a \ntime in which we have to be prepared. In order to have that \npreparation, we not only need the personnel and the intelligence, but \nwe need the equipment. We have to test that equipment under all kinds \nof conditions to make sure it works when we have to have it work. That \nis what this testing and evaluation and training range is for.\n\n[[Page S8462]]\n\n  This Senator is not going to let the U.S. defense preparedness be a \nsacrificial lamb for the interests of the oil and gas companies in \norder to satisfy their hollow-ring rhetoric that says ``drill, baby, \ndrill.'' You have heard me before on this floor say that the mantra \nought not be ``drill, baby, drill.'' As Tom Friedman says, the mantra \nought to be ``invent, baby, invent.'' That is how we are going to break \nthe stranglehold of oil that is around our neck. But until we get to \nthat point--and I hope we are rapidly moving to that point of \nalternative fuels--this Senator is going to stand up and not let the \ndefense preparedness of this country be sacrificed as a lamb on the \naltar of the oil and gas companies.\n  This Senator also wants to clearly say this to the Gang of 10 that \nproposes to drill up to 50 miles off the Florida coast. That would \nbring it up to a point about like this on this map. You can see how \nthat would cut out the heart and the lungs of the military mission test \nand evaluation. The Gang of 10 that wants to vote on their proposal \nnext week says: By the way, we are going to do that drilling all the \nway up to 50 miles off of the west coast of Florida, but we are not \ngoing to do that off of anybody else's coast. We will let there be \ndrilling at the OK of the States of Virginia, the Carolinas, and \nGeorgia, and we are not going to touch anybody else, but we are sure \ngoing to touch the west coast of Florida and this military mission \nline.\n  This Senator wants to clearly say he is not going to let Florida be \nthe sacrificial lamb. I just hope my colleagues understand that this \nSenator is not going to let that happen.\n  We concocted, crafted, and compromised to pass this law 2 years ago \nto satisfy the Senator from Louisiana, the Senators from Mississippi, \nand the Senators from Alabama who wanted additional drilling while at \nthe same time this Senator and my colleague, Senator Martinez, brought \nto the table that we wanted to protect the military and we wanted to \nprotect Florida. We crafted this compromise. Now, 2 years later, they \nwant to blow it out of the water and they want to blow the U.S. \nmilitary out of the water.\n  We have a few tools at our disposal called parliamentary rules of the \nSenate. We are simply not going to let this happen. This Senator is \nabout as bipartisan as anybody on this floor. This Senator is about as \nreasonable as anybody on this floor. This Senator does believe what the \nGood Book says, which is ``Come, let us reason together.'' That is how \nwe ought to forge compromise and make law, recognizing that you have to \nbuild consensus. That is what we ought to do, and we ought to do it in \na bipartisan fashion. But the Gang of 10 wants to run over the \ninterests of this Senator and the interests of the military. Every now \nand then, we have the opportunity to stand up and say no.\n  I want everybody to be clear where this Senator is. Let me tell you, \nthe Speaker of the House of Representatives came out yesterday with a \nproposal that this Senator would certainly consider, and I think \nfavorably. What the Speaker of the House has said is honor the 2006 \nlaw, and on the rest of the Outer Continental Shelf, all over the \nUnited States beyond 100 miles, drill; between 50 and 100 miles, if the \nState concurs, drill. Those being Federal lands, those revenues would \ninure to the benefit of the U.S. Treasury, not to the States. This \nSenator will certainly consider that, but not when they say the \ninterests of Florida and the interests of the Defense Department are \nthe ones that are going to have to completely give, since we worked \nthis and etched it into law for the first time 2 years ago. I want \neverybody to understand what the position of this Senator is.\n  What I would like to do is to send this amendment to the desk to \nfile. I will not offer it because, as I said, the chairman of our Armed \nServices Committee has enough on his plate--I am one of his \nsubcommittee chairmen--in order to get this Defense authorization bill \npassed. But this issue will certainly be ripe next week when we take up \nthe energy provisions.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The amendment will be printed.\n  The senior Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for up to 20 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, also, before he leaves the floor, I intend \nto talk about the ethical quagmire at the Minerals Management Service. \nI commend Senator Nelson, who really, just as he said, always does try \nto be bipartisan. We work together as part of a large health care \ngroup. Senator Nelson was one of the first to spot these flagrant \nexamples of abuse at the Minerals Management Service. I know he is \ngoing to be part of our effort to finally drain the swamp at the \nMinerals Management Service next week. I thank my friend from Florida \nfor his efforts in that regard.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/12/senate-section/article/S8462-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8462-S8471]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MINERALS MANAGEMENT SERVICE\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, 2 days ago I came to the floor of the \nSenate to describe specifically the horror story of misconduct and \nmismanagement at the Minerals Management Service. Today, this morning, \nin coffee shops across the country, in addition to talking about the \npain at getting clobbered by these gasoline prices at the pump, a lot \nof Americans are wondering how can it possibly be that in these Federal \nenergy development programs, the tax money of the American people is \nbeing used to prop up sweetheart contracting, flagrant conflict of \ninterest violations, drug abuse, apparently all kinds of sexual \nescapades, and lots more.\n  I have been trying to clean up these royalty programs for more than 5 \nyears. I stood right in this spot 2 years ago and spent almost 5 hours \ntrying to force a vote here in the Senate to clean up these royalty \nprograms.\n  Some of these royalty problems, of course, began when the price of \noil was $19 a barrel. The day that I spoke at length to try to force a \nvote, the price of oil was $70 a barrel. Of course, for quite some time \nthe price of oil has been $110, $120, $130--of course 8, 10, 12 times \nwhat it was when this program began.\n  The Bush administration has repeatedly indicated that they would take \ncare of these problems. We have had Secretary Kempthorne, for example, \nin the Energy Committee even 19 months ago essentially saying they \nwould get on top of the program.\n  I came to the floor today because I would like to describe how it \nlooks as though once again the Department of Interior is especially \ninterested in trying to keep the Congress from stepping in and taking \nbold action to try to drain the swamp. For example, the statement the \nSecretary of Interior made--I brought it to the floor--came out \nyesterday. It states, for example:\n\n       The conduct of a few has cast a shadow on an entire agency.\n\n  That is not what the inspector general said about this program. The \ninspector general didn't talk, as Secretary Kempthorne did, about the \nconduct of a few. What the inspector general said--I will just read it:\n\n       We discovered that, between 2002 and 2006, nearly one-third \n     of the entire royalty-in-kind staff socialized with and \n     received a wide array of gifts and gratuities from oil and \n     gas companies with whom the royalty-in-kind program was \n     conducting official business.\n\n  Let's unpack that for a minute. Secretary Kempthorne has said \nrepeatedly that we are only talking about the conduct of a few people \nand offered up once again, just in the last 24 hours, an argument \nclearly designed to keep the Congress from stepping in next week and \nfinally draining the swamp at the Royalty-in-Kind Program. The \ninspector general found that there were gifts and gratuities on at \nleast 135 occasions from major oil and gas companies. The inspector \ngeneral called it a textbook example of improperly receiving gifts from \nprohibited sources. And then the inspector general said:\n\n       When confronted by our investigators, none of the employees \n     involved displayed remorse.\n\n  They found a culture at this program of ethical disregard--substance \nabuse, promiscuity. They go on and on to talk about an entire program. \nThey certainly do not talk about how these problems took place in the \npast. They talk about how this is an ongoing problem that certainly is \nnot going to be taken care of, in my view, as Secretary Kempthorne has \nsuggested in the past, with one of his kind of ethics training\n\n[[Page S8463]]\n\nprograms. There are going to have to be substantial changes. I am very \nhopeful that finally, after the Congress has gotten report after report \nabout the problems at this agency, the Senate will not accept the \nargument from Secretary Kempthorne that once again the Congress ought \nto just trust the agency to take care of things on its own.\n  Let me outline just a few of the areas that I hope the Senate would \nconsider in changing these flagrant abuses at Minerals Management.\n  It seems to me, first, that this program, the Royalty-in-Kind \nProgram, should be suspended until the Secretary certifies that each of \nthe inspector general's ethical and business recommendations is \nimplemented.\n  That strikes me as pretty obvious. You have all of these problems. It \nhas been documented in report after report after report. The Secretary \nhas come to the committee, and said he would take care of it. It has \nnot been done. It would seem to me that you suspend this program until \nthe Secretary certifies that the recommendations from the inspector \ngeneral are implemented.\n  Second, I am sure people listening to this say, ``hello,'' when you \nmake this particular recommendation. It is time to get rigorous audits \nback in the Minerals Management Royalty Program. You think to yourself, \nhow can it be that millions of dollars go in and out the door in these \nprograms? There have been problems documented again and again in these \ninspector general reports and they still do not have rigorous audits. \nSo that is the second thing the Senate ought to require with respect to \nthis program.\n  I personally would favor a limited continuation of the Royalty-in-\nKind Program to a fixed term, choose 1 year, 2 years, and then it would \nbe sunset unless it would be reauthorized. This would be a process that \nwould make sure the program either gets fixed and the Senate comes away \nconvinced that it works or the program goes away. So I would hope the \nSenate would look at that.\n  Finally, I think it is worth noting that the Minerals Management \nService is the only major bureau within the Interior that does not have \na Senate-confirmed director. It is my view that the head of the \nMinerals Management Service, particularly at a time such as this, when \nthe very programs in its charge, and the programs the Congress is \nlooking to expand next week, that the head of the Minerals Management \nService should be a Senate-confirmed position. This way it would be \npossible for the Senate Energy Committee--and I know Senator Nelson has \na great interest in this as well--would have a say in who the next \ndirector of that office is, and the Energy Committee would be in a \nposition to hold that individual accountable.\n  As I have indicated, the Minerals Management Service is the only \nmajor bureau within Interior that does not have a Senate-confirmed \ndirector. It is obvious you cannot wave your wand and legislatively fix \nevery ethical consideration imaginable. But it would seem to me, given \nthe blockbuster nature of this inspector general's report, and the \ntenacious work that has been done by Earl Devaney there, that Congress \nwould be negligent, that Congress would be more than remiss, that \nCongress would be negligent to not step in next week when we are \nworking on these very programs--there is discussion of expanding them \ndramatically--to not step in and make sure the taxpayers' interests are \nprotected.\n  This is not a question of whether you are for drilling or against \ndrilling here. Senators will have differences of opinion surely on \nthat. But as Senator Nelson has said over a period of years, and I have \nsaid over a period of years, this ought to be something every Member of \nthe Senate would agree on.\n  I think back to 2 years ago, and I got up in the morning and did not \nexpect to be on this floor for 5 hours trying to force a vote to change \nthese programs. It was clear that if we had gotten the votes, we would \nhave won. That was when the price of oil was $70 a barrel, not $100 a \nbarrel; $100 often seems reasonable these days to people given the \nshellacking they are taking.\n  But the Congress will have a vigorous debate next week on a host of \nissues with respect to energy policy. What I would hope is that 100 \nMembers of the Senate would say, given what the inspector general has \nsaid, No. 1, given the fact that Secretary Kempthorne has again in his \nstatement yesterday--and I read this specifically--suggested that we \nare talking about a few individuals:\n\n       The conduct of a few has cast a shadow on an entire agency.\n\n  That is not what the inspector general said. One-third of the \nemployees in this program, one-third, colleagues, were involved in \nthis. Given what the inspector general has said, given the facts that \nthe agency has repeatedly said it would clean up these programs, and it \nhas not done it, that under the leadership of Chairman Bingaman of the \nEnergy Committee, he always works closely with the ranking minority \nmember, our colleague from New Mexico, Senator Domenici, that finally \nnext week the Congress, on a bipartisan basis, end these disgraceful \npractices that have been documented repeatedly in these independent \nreports.\n  If the Congress does not step in and finally adopt specific measures \nto hold this agency accountable, I believe when the headlines are no \nlonger the topic of kitchen table conversation, I believe what will \nhappen, certainly regrettably in this administration, we will not see \nthe changes needed to protect the American people.\n  I do not see how you can make a case for playing down this set of \nproblems that has been so well documented. I hope all Members of the \nSenate, all 100 Senators, will back our efforts next week to clean up \nthis program.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The senior Senator from Florida is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I want to say a word of \nappreciation to the Senator from Oregon for his leadership on this, and \nhis courage. He had the courage of his convictions 2 years ago to stand \nup and to not relinquish the floor in the midst of all kinds of \npressure to get on with the legislation in order to get his point \nacross.\n  From time to time, each of us, when we feel passionately and very \nstrongly about an issue that we do not think is right, has a right here \nto do that. I thank him for that. I thank him for his courage. I second \nwhat he has said about the skullduggery that is going on.\n  Is it not interesting that there is no consequence as a result of \nwhat the inspector general has found, all of this skullduggery--it is \nhis words, not ours--all kinds of sexual liaisons going on, all kinds \nof drugs, all kinds of gifts, some of this supplied by the oil \ncompanies over which this administrative executive department agency is \na watchdog, and it is going to be in an inspector general's report. The \nDepartment of Justice, the Attorney General's Office, has said they are \nnot going to prosecute the two main people in the office who carried on \nall of this scandalous activity; they have resigned. So where is the \naccountability?\n  When I served in the military a long time ago, I was taught clearly \nthat the commanding officer was accountable for what happened to that \ncommanding officer's troops or ship.\n  Where is the accountability? What about the head of the Minerals \nManagement Service? The head of the Minerals Management Service is \nthere. Where is the accountability? Why should not the head of the \nMinerals Management Service, on something that went on for one-third of \nthe employees of this office for some period of time, say: I am \nresponsible, I am accountable, and face the music, and face the \nconsequences?\n  But, no, it is always dodge, weave, deflect. It is always somebody \nelse's fault. How much of a pattern have we seen of that over the last \n8 years? The American people are getting tired of it. And they are \ngetting tired of it especially when those same kinds of interests, in \nthis case the oil companies influencing an executive branch department \nto get what they want by using illegal gifts, the offer of sexual \nfavors and drug use.\n  This is the same group that wants to come in, as I was pointing out \non that map, and drill all the way up through and cut out the heart and \nthe lungs of the U.S. military testing and training area.\n  No, there is too much that is not in sync here. I thank the Senator \nfor his very prescient and courageous and consistent stance he has had.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S8464]]\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n    Journalists M. Charles Bakst, Scott Mac Kay, and Mark Arsenault\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, today the largest daily newspaper in \nmy home State of Rhode Island, the Providence Journal, is losing three \nextraordinary journalists. Columnists M. Charles Bakst, better known as \nCharlie; reporter Scott MacKay; and Mark Arsenault have covered \npolitics in Rhode Island and around the country for a combined total of \nabout 70 years, and they are retiring from the paper as of today. There \nis a larger story about what is happening to America's newspapers, but \nmy purpose is not to talk about that but about them.\n  All of them are gifted writers, and all have brought to the Journal \nsharp eyes for detail, long memories, and distinctive voices. They will \nbe sorely missed.\n  Scott is a particular friend, and I am sorry I will no longer have \nthe pleasure of reading Scott's colorful political takes on the State \nwe both love. I hope he will return to the Providence Newspaper Guild \n``Follies'' to continue his traditional role emceeing that evening of \nalleged music, wit, and humor.\n  I wish well to Mark Arsenault, whose talent supports a bright future \nin whatever new endeavors he chooses to pursue.\n  But the remainder of my remarks will be about Charlie Bakst. If you \nare from Rhode Island and involved in politics, you know Charlie Bakst. \nYou see him in the statehouse, at city hall. You see him at fundraisers \nand roasts and meatball dinners and clambakes, and you see him at lunch \nat Angelo's on Federal hill.\n  Everywhere there is politics--and in Rhode Island, that is \neverywhere--Charlie is there, soaking in the scene, talking to people, \nand commenting on the food.\n  Everything is grist for what Charlie is pleased to call his \n``excellent columns.'' Charlie's memory for history and for detail is \nlegendary, as is his miraculous success at landing interviews that are \neither totally forbidden or extraordinarily difficult to get. He has \njumped into limousines and lain in wait by backdoors. He has talked \nwith United States Presidents, past and future. He has questioned \nSenators, Governors, party leaders, political operatives, even world \nleaders. If you have ever been involved in politics in Rhode Island, \nchances are you have been confronted by Charlie Bakst's red suspenders, \nunkempt hair, and ever-present tape recorder, and chances are that \nafterwards, you found something in what he wrote to be annoyed about. \nBut in the end, that is the way we in politics are supposed to feel.\n  As the saying goes: If a politician doesn't feel a little twinge of \nanxiety when he hears that newspaper thump on the front porch in the \nmorning, the paper is not doing its job.\n  Charlie always did his job. Journalism is in Charlie's blood. At \nsummer camp in Hampstead, NH, in the 1950s, he announced baseball \nscores at the camp's daily flags ceremonies. ``In retrospect,'' he \nwrote, ``an early dangerous sign of: Journalist Ahead.''\n  At Brown, he became editor in chief of the Brown Daily Herald. He \nwent on to earn his masters from the Columbia Graduate School of \nJournalism and later returned to Rhode Island to join the Providence \nJournal, eventually becoming statehouse bureau chief and political \ncolumnist. Politics, too, was a lifelong passion.\n  In another formative summer camp experience, he listened to radio \nbroadcasts of the 1956 Democratic Convention. I will confess that I was \nprobably not 1 year old then and not listening very closely. At the \ntime, then-Senator John F. Kennedy narrowly missed winning his party's \nVice Presidential nomination.\n  ``Believe it or not, that helped hook me on politics,'' Charlie wrote \ndecades later.\n  Well, it is not that difficult to believe. Charlie's writing betrays \na sense of wonder at the pageantry of politics and a fierce belief in \ngovernment's obligation to the people that it serves. Charlie told it \nlike he saw it, and when he saw a public servant abusing the public \ntrust, he said so.\n  ``I must say I've never lacked for copy,'' Charlie told the New York \nTimes in 2001. His columns have ripped into public figures for \ncorruption, dishonesty, and for incompetence.\n  In a column written as New Orleans staggered in the violent wake of \nHurricane Katrina, his outrage is visceral:\n\n       America has become a laughingstock. To think that people \n     could suffer here for days on rooftops or terraces or in a \n     sports arena or convention center without rudimentary help \n     like food or water, amid lawlessness and stench, surrounded \n     by death.\n\n  He ended with an invocation of Jimmy Carter:\n\n       Wouldn't it be nice to have a government as good and decent \n     as the American people?\n\n  This is Charlie Bakst's dream for America and his dream for our Ocean \nState, and his columns have always prodded us toward that dream.\n  He is particularly outspoken when he sees injustice and oppression. \nHe sought out leaders in the civil rights movement, interviewing \nRepresentative John Lewis and Cesar Chavez, among others.\n  He found unsung Rhode Island heroes, who worked on behalf of the \nhomeless or the poor or the disadvantaged, and told their stories. He \nshowed special courage in his unwavering advocacy for the rights of \ngays and lesbians, particularly the long struggle for equal marriage, \neven when some readers took vocal offense.\n  Charlie is also obsessed with baseball and with his beloved Red Sox \nin particular. The team was a family affair in the Bakst household. \nCharlie writes of many trips to Fenway Park with his late father Lester \nand his brother Arthur.\n  His first game at Fenway--at age 8--happened to be on April 30, 1952, \nthe last game Ted Williams played before he shipped out to Korea.\n  Ted Williams was a particular hero, and years after that first game, \nCharlie's colleagues at the Journal gave him, as a 50th birthday gift, \na lifetime membership to the Ted Williams Museum in St. Petersburg, FL. \nCharlie visited the museum and immediately collared his tour guide to \nsuggest corrections to the exhibit.\n  Charlie followed baseball all over the country, and maintained a love \naffair with food, from buffet table fare at local fundraisers to \nhistoric restaurants such as Angelo's, where his personal bottle of \nolive oil, stashed in the kitchen, has ``BAKST'' written across the top \nin black ink.\n  These interests--baseball and food--came together in columns \ndisclosing that at Safeco Field, home of the Seattle Mariners, you can \neat everything from sushi and pad thai to chowder and deep-fried \nmushrooms, not to mention a half-pound Home Run Dog just outside the \nballpark.\n  At Petco Park, home of the San Diego Padres, Charlie reported on \nshrimp avocado salad, barbequed ribs, fish tacos, garlic fries, veggie \ndogs, Oreo cookie cheesecake, and cappuccino.\n  I was glad when Charlie was able to stop by one of my regular \ncommunity dinners in East Providence last year. Our M cookies made it \ninto his Sunday column.\n  Finally, we have seen Charlie's deep and abiding love for his family: \nhis wife Elizabeth, and his daughters Maggie, Diane, and their \nfamilies. I hope in his retirement he will get to see more of them, and \nto spend more time with Diane and her family in Italy, as he once wrote \nhe would like to do.\n  But no matter what he chooses to do next, I hope Rhode Island will \nfind a way not to lose Charlie's unique voice, his rich memory, after, \nI believe, 36 years of journalism in Rhode Island, and the impassioned \ncommitment that he brought to his profession.\n  Of his friend, WJAR investigative reporter Jim Taricani, Charlie once \nwrote this:\n\n       [B]eing a journalist is more than a job. It is a burden, a \n     pleasure, and an honor.\n\n  Well, Charlie, working with you for the past 20 years has been a \nburden, a pleasure, and an honor. I look forward to talking with you \nfor many years to come, and I wish you and Mark and Scott well in your \nretirement.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n\n[[Page S8465]]\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following my \nremarks, the Senator from North Dakota, Mr. Dorgan, be given time to \nspeak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n\n                   Fighting for Middle-Class Families\n\n  Mr. President, last week, our Nation celebrated Labor Day for the \n114th year. We have come a long way since 1894.\n  On my lapel, I wear a pendent that is a depiction of a canary in a \nbird cage. Some 100 years ago, around the time Labor Day began, mine \nworkers used to take a canary down into the mines. If the canary died \nfrom toxic gas or a lack of oxygen, the mine worker knew he had to \nimmediately get out of the mine. He had no union in those days strong \nenough to protect him and no government in those days that cared enough \nto protect him.\n  In those days, a child born around that time in our country--100 or \nso years ago--had a life expectancy of 46, 47, 48 years. A child born \ntoday in our great country has a life expectancy about three decades \nlonger than that. Much of that is not just high-tech medicine and \nchemotherapy and heart transplants, that kind of thing; most of the \nincreased life expectancy in this country is about Medicare and \nMedicaid and Social Security and workers' compensation, protections for \nworkers, a prohibition on child labor, safe drinking laws, clean air \nand pure food and drug laws--that kind of progress that has been made \nin this country that helps people live longer, happier, healthier \nlives.\n  Thanks to the workers' rights movement, employees today, especially, \nenjoy better wages, better working conditions, better protections \nagainst discrimination.\n  But as I travel around my State--I have held almost 120 community \nroundtables, inviting a cross section of 15, 20, 25 people, to listen \nto their concerns and to tell me of their dreams, and what we can do in \nmy office, and to help them locally in their communities--it is clear \nour Nation's recent economic policies have not adequately benefited \nworkers.\n  The American dream--the promise that if you work hard and play by the \nrules, your economic future will be bright--should be the rule, but too \noften it is the exception.\n  As I travel the State, I hear about widespread economic anxiety and a \nbetrayed middle class. I hear from Ohioans worried about record high \ngas prices and food prices. I hear from people from Galion to \nGallipolis worried about good-paying jobs continuing to move overseas. \nI hear people from Ashtabula to Lima worried about health insurance \nthat costs more and covers less.\n  I hear from food bank administrators from Hocking County and from \nLucas County struggling to keep up with demand, like Mike from the \nWarren County United Way, who estimates that some 90 percent of local \nfood bank patrons are working people, many holding more than one job.\n  I hear from Ohioans who have, without complaint, dedicated their \nlives to hard work, only to see their financial security pulled out \nfrom under them, like Richard Wyers of Lorain in northern Ohio, a \nsteelworker whose pension was slashed because his now-bankrupt employer \nhad simply not set enough money aside for payouts to that pension.\n  The Government agency administering the defunct firm's assets has \ntold Richard he cannot even keep the money he has already received. In \nall, he owes more than $50,000. It is not a mistake he made but a \nmistake they made. Unfortunately, Richard is not alone. Nearly 2,500 \nformer employees of the same bankrupt steel company have been notified \nby the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation that they have received \noverpayments this year.\n  In other parts of the State, workers are facing more bad news. Bruce \nof Wilmington has worked for ABX--the air cargo provider for DHL--for \n24 years. He is married with five children, two of whom are in college. \nSo you can imagine Bruce's anger when, earlier this year, DHL announced \nit will pull its business from ABX and that more than 8,000 workers at \nBruce's Wilmington Air Park will lose their jobs. Bruce is not looking \nfor a Government handout. He wants to work so he can support his family \nand send his kids to college.\n  In Norwalk last week, 20 miles from where I grew up, in Mansfield, \n500 employees were sent home from their jobs at Norwalk Furniture when \nexecutives had to halt operations. That is 500 more people who want to \nwork but can't.\n  In Tiffin, more than 100 workers are looking for jobs after the \nAmerican Standard plant there--a local institution for almost 125 \nyears--closed its doors in December.\n  In Van Wert, auto workers such as Sarah Sargent have seen their lives \nturned upside down since management locked them out of their plant \nearlier this year. The reason for the lockout: Sarah and her 330 \ncoworkers simply would not accept a substantial wage cut and a benefits \nfreeze, so the company is contemplating a move to Mexico.\n\n  General Motors is closing its plant in Moraine, a decision that will \ncost 1,200 Ohioans their livelihoods.\n  This string of bad news in Ohio can be blamed in part on our current \nrecession. But that misses the larger point. For the last 7 years, the \nlabor force has worked harder than ever, leading to huge gains in \nproductivity. Yet CEO salaries and bonuses, as we know, went through \nthe roof, middle-class Americans' wages stagnated, and more families \nslipped below the poverty line.\n  While China manipulated its currency and ignored labor and \nenvironmental standards, corporations took the bait and abandoned \nAmerican communities. And while hedge fund managers irresponsibly \nleveraged real estate holdings, millions of Americans lost their homes \nto foreclosure. In other words, while Wall Street enjoyed an inflated \nstock market and a so-called economic expansion, most Americans \nactually became worse off.\n  Despite these struggles wrought by 7 years of wrongheaded economic \npolicies, American workers are standing strong and fighting for a \nbetter future. At my roundtables in Ohio, I still hear the hope and the \ndetermination that defines my State and defines this great Nation. I \nhear from community leaders and entrepreneurs with exciting plans for \nthe future, such as George Ward of Kirtland, in northeast Ohio, the \npresident of his local firefighters' union and a small business owner. \nGeorge's grandfather was a coal miner and his father was a United Auto \nworker. It is this working class background that has motivated him to \nfight for expanded health care access--not just for his fellow \nfirefighters but for his employees and their families.\n  He is, in his own words, ``trying to live the American Dream,'' \n``trying to make a difference'' in his community.\n  I hear from loyal workers who take pride in their work and are valued \nby their employers, such as Richard Ade, a security guard in Cleveland, \nwho, after more than 5 years of stagnant wages, worked with his \nemployer and outside groups to ensure that he and his coworkers got the \nraises they deserved--which, ultimately, they did. Or there is the \nstory I heard about four long-serving employees of Miba Bearings in \nMcConnelsville. These four employees have been with the company for 55 \nyears. They have worked everywhere in the plant: from the production \nline, to final inspection, to shipping. When I asked if they were still \nproductive, the company's human capital manager answered with obvious \npride: ``All of our employees are productive.''\n  We need a government that similarly values loyalty and work ethic. \nFor too long, those in power have ignored hard-working Americans, have \nignored the needs and dreams of the middle class, and have instead \ncatered to the wealthiest Americans, and this is in a country where \nalways in the past we rewarded work.\n  But it does not have to be that way. In Ohio, Governor Ted \nStrickland--elected 2 short years ago--already is doing great work to \nattract new business, to improve educational opportunities, and to \nrevitalize the economy.\n\n[[Page S8466]]\n\n  Here in Washington we can adopt measures right now--in honor of Labor \nDay--that would make a difference in working people's lives, like \nextending unemployment insurance. If Congress does not act before early \nOctober, 800,000 unemployed Americans will stop getting their much-\nneeded checks, including 330,000 from high unemployment States such as \nOhio. We must expand insurance for those vulnerable citizens.\n  We should make sick leave a right of employment, not a privilege. \nEmployees should not have to choose between attending to their health \nand losing their job. We should pass the Employee Free Choice Act, \nwhich would allow more workers to bargain collectively. We know that \nmeans higher wages, better benefits, a stronger middle class, a more \nprosperous America.\n  We should provide tax credits for alternative energy investment, \nwhich would help wean us off foreign oil and create new green collar \njobs. In my State, the Governor and I talk about making Ohio the \n``Silicon Valley'' of alternative energy. We can do that with some help \nfrom the Federal Government. We can do what we need to do in our State.\n  Simply put, we need to celebrate Labor Day by turning our attention \nto revamping our economic policies and changing the direction of this \ncountry. The best way we can honor our Nation's workers is to set our \nNation on that new path--a path that fights for middle-class families \neverywhere and strengthens our country.\n  Mr. President, I yield back.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, we are on the Defense authorization bill, \nso I wanted to make a couple of comments, not about an amendment, but \nabout two issues that I hope those at the Pentagon will take note of. \nSometimes things don't change very quickly and sometimes they don't \nchange at all with respect to the way things are done at the Pentagon.\n  When I came to Congress, I joined a military reform caucus to try to \nreform the way things are done at the Pentagon, but some folks there \nstill believe there is an inexhaustible amount of money in pursuit of \ntheir desires. An example of that is the unmanned aerial vehicles, or \nUAVs--airplanes without pilots. It is a growing part of a number of \nservices. But what is happening in both the Army and the Air Force is \nthat both services are building and buying unmanned aerial vehicles in \nwhat I think are duplicative programs. One calls their airplane the \nPredator. The other calls it the Warrior. The folks over at the \nPentagon can't determine who should be the executive agency that \noversees the unmanned aerial vehicles. So you have two services doing \nessentially the same thing.\n  Who wants to fly at 12,000 or 20,000 feet above the battlefield with \nan unmanned aerial vehicle? Well, the Air Force does, but the Army \nwould like to as well. So one builds a plane called the Predator and \none builds a plane called the Warrior. They both have missions that \nappear to me to be duplicative. You have duplicate spending on research \nand development, duplicate spending on the airplanes themselves, \nduplicate spending on the missions inside the Pentagon. Who pays the \ncost? The American taxpayer. This is not new, but the competition \ninside the Pentagon shouldn't cause the American taxpayer to have to \npay for inefficiency and duplication.\n  We have had discussions about this at hearings. It appears nothing is \nhappening to describe what ought to happen. In this case it ought to be \nthe Air Force who has the executive agency for UAVs. Former chief of \nthe Air Force, Buzz Moseley, who I think was an extraordinary Air Force \nchief of staff, tried to resolve this and could not because he ran into \nthe competition inside the Pentagon on this issue. My hope is the \nAmerican taxpayer will not have to continue to pay for duplication of \neffort inside the Pentagon.\n  We all support this mission because it greatly helps our soldiers, \nbut I don't support the kind of spending that unnecessarily duplicates \nefforts between the services. That certainly has been the case with \nrespect to unmanned aerial vehicles.\n  I understand the Army wants to have--and should have--unmanned aerial \nvehicles above the battlefield at 1,000 feet to 2,000 feet. But if they \nare flying unmanned aerial vehicles at 12,000 and 20,000 feet with \nsensors, it seems to me that this is an Air Force mission. Yet we now \nhave two branches of the service duplicating the effort and the \nAmerican taxpayer pays the bill. I hope they will get this straight at \nthe Pentagon so that we begin to avoid some of these duplicative costs.\n  One other issue I might mention is the issue of privatizing housing \non our military bases. This started in the Clinton administration and \ncontinues through the Bush administration. The proposition is to take \nhousing inside a military base that already exists and turn it over to \na private contractor and say to the private contractor: We will give \nyou this free of charge. You can own all of this housing. You sign a \ncontract with us saying that you will maintain these houses for 50 \nyears. Then we will pay soldiers a monthly housing allowance, they in \nturn will pay that to the private contractor, and everybody is happy.\n  The question is: What does this cost the American taxpayer? The \nmilitary says: Well, it gets housing built more quickly because they \nwill not only turn over existing housing stock free of charge to a \ncontractor, but they will have the contractor build new housing and \nthen fund it through the monthly housing allowances that soldiers hand \nover to the independent contractor.\n  It is interesting to me that we now have some foreign companies that \nown military housing on American military bases, and they get it by \nsigning a contract saying we promise to maintain this housing for 50 \nyears. Two of North Dakota's bases are now in a contract that \npresumably may get done next year.\n  I have raised a lot of questions about it because the way the \nPentagon has calculated this, they say it is better for the Pentagon. \nWhat about the taxpayer? Is it better for the American taxpayer? How is \nit that we decide to turn over housing stock--much of which is almost \nbrand-new--free of charge with a contract to a private company in \nexchange for a signature that they will maintain it for the next 50 \nyears? It seems to me as though there are a lot of questions that have \nbeen unanswered, going back to the Clinton administration and through \nthe Bush administration, that the American taxpayers ought to have \nanswered. There ought to be a fundamental review of what is the total \ncost here, including depreciation taken by the private contractor and \nothers. What is the total cost of this privatization of housing on our \nmilitary bases? What is the total cost to the taxpayer?\n  I wanted to mention that in the context of the Defense authorization \nbill, because I think these are a couple of things that ought to be \nconsidered.\n\n\n                              The Economy\n\n  Mr. President, the presentation the Presiding Officer just gave on \nthe floor of the Senate reminded me that--I believe it was yesterday, \nor perhaps the day before--when it was announced that our trade deficit \nfor the month was, I think, $62 billion, and nearly $25 billion of that \nwas with the country of China. My colleague who just spoke is from \nOhio. I was thinking about the continued growth of exports from China \ninto our country, building up a very large trade deficit that we have \nwith the rest of the world and especially with China. The State of Ohio \nhas been especially hard hit. That is where they used to make Huffy \nbicycles and don't anymore because all of those Huffy bicycles are now \nmade in China. All the Ohio workers were fired because they made $11 an \nhour plus benefits and that is way too much money, the company thought, \nto pay people working in a factory to make bicycles. So they all got \nfired. These bicycles are now made in China by people who work 12 hours \na day, 7 days a week, for 30 cents, 40 cents an hour. By the way, I \nhave described many times for my colleagues the last day of work with \nthose Ohio workers after they were fired. On their last day of work \nthey put a pair of shoes in the parking space where their car used to \nsit. So as they drove away, all that was left was a pair of shoes, and \nit was their plaintive way to say to that company: You can move our \njobs to China, but you are not going to fill our shoes.\n  Many workers across this country are discovering the same fate. I \nhave described--I won't today--but Fig Newton cookies. Apparently it \ncosts too much to have people shovel fig paste in\n\n[[Page S8467]]\n\nNew Jersey, so now when you buy them, you are buying Mexican food \nbecause it is made in Monterey, Mexico. Why? You can hire people for a \nwhole lot less money in Mexico than you have to pay for workers in New \nJersey. The list goes on and on and on. The unbelievable part of this \nis we actually, as a country--and this Congress, yes, provided a tax \nbreak to a company that says: I am going to fire my American workers \nand move the jobs overseas.\n\n  I have tried, I believe, four times on the floor of the Senate to \noffer amendments and get votes on amendments that would shut down the \ntax break for shipping jobs overseas. On each occasion, we have lost \nthat vote. It is unbelievable to me. I mean, it is not as if I have \ncolleagues who will stand up and say: Count me in for wanting to ship \nAmerican jobs overseas, but that is exactly their position when they \nvote to continue tax incentives for companies who fire their American \nworkers and go in search of 10-cent-an-hour labor. And yes, that \nexists. Yes, it exists, that workers in Ohio and elsewhere are told: If \nyou can't compete with 12-year-olds who work 12 hours a day and get 12 \ncents an hour, tough luck, you are out of a job.\n  This country has not yet come to grips with the question of whether \nthat is what we spent 100 years creating a competitive, international \nenvironment to compete with. Does that make sense, that we should ask \nAmerican workers to compete with that standard? I don't think so. But I \nwas reminded of it by my colleague from Ohio discussing what is \nhappening.\n  Just this week, again, we see the unbelievable trade deficit for one \nsingle month, over $60 billion again, and that is money that has to be \nrepaid. That is money that has to be repaid from our country and our \ntaxpayers to a foreign government. It is one part of a whole series of \nthings that reflect a very urgent situation for this economy.\n  You wake up this morning and you see another major investment bank is \ngoing to be sold. The prices for its stock have collapsed. You wake up \nlast weekend and you hear the Treasury Secretary is preparing to take \nover, effectively, Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. A couple of weeks ago, \nBear Stearns goes belly up. The largest mortgage banks go belly up. We \nsee the largest trade deficits in history, the largest budget deficits \nin history, and a fiscal policy that is completely off the rail. We \nhave a Presidential campaign, and we wake up every single day and we \nsee these unbelievable attacks: Lipstick on a pig. Who are you \noffending? It is unbelievable to me.\n  Ours is a country that I think is being threatened to lose its \ndominance in the world on critical issues, including trade, fiscal \npolicy, energy, and a whole series of issues. Yet, somehow, if you want \nto speak seriously about policy, you get interrupted by a bunch of \nshysters who have decided that they want to hijack the political system \nto talk about irrelevancies. It is unbelievable to me.\n  I came from a forum that we are holding on energy. Energy is a very \nimportant issue, and it appears to me the tipping point was finally $4 \na gallon for a gallon of gasoline. It ran up double in a year, from \nJuly to July. The price of oil and gas doubled in a year. There is no \nvisible way for anyone to take a look at the numbers on supply and \ndemand and say: Oh, that was justified. We understand why the price \ndoubled in a year. That evidence doesn't exist, by the way. There is no \none who can come to the floor of the Senate and say: Well, I know why \nthe price of oil doubled in a year and the price of gasoline doubled in \na year; because nothing happened in that year with respect to supply \nand demand that justified it.\n  What I think happened is what has happened in so many years of our \nGovernment. Regulators who are brain dead, flat out asleep like Rip Van \nWinkle, while everything is happening around them, decided we are not \ngoing to watch, so speculators took over the oil market and drove it \nstraight up. Recently it has come back down because some of that same \nspeculative money, just like a hurricane, came right back out of it.\n  It is not only in this area. It is in the subprime mortgage area. \nRegulators--again, completely brain dead--and I am sure they watched \ntelevision in the morning, perhaps while they ate some Grape Nuts at \nthe kitchen table, and they saw some advertisements by the mortgage \nbankers and others that said: Hey, have you been bankrupt? Do you have \nbad credit? You can't pay your bills? Come to us, we have a mortgage \nfor you. We have all seen those ads over and over and over again. Guess \nwhat. Those ads were a reflection of what was going on in an industry, \nright under the noses of regulators who didn't seem to care, in which \nthey built an unbelievable system of bad mortgages and paired them with \nsome decent mortgages, slicing them up into securities. It is like when \nthey used to pack sawdust into sausage and then sliced and diced them, \nand then, by the way, because they had this carnival going on, they \nsecuritize all of these mortgages, move them up the line into hedge \nfunds all over the world, and then somebody decided one day: You know \nwhat? These are bad mortgages. We don't even know who has them. We \ndon't know where they are in these securities.\n  Why were they bad mortgages? Well, because regulators didn't seem to \ncare and there were advertised mortgages that said: If you have bad \ncredit, come to us. By the way, here is the mortgage we will give you. \nWe will give you a mortgage where you don't have to pay any principal \nfor a long time; just pay interest only. You may not want that. We will \ngive you a better mortgage than that. We will give you a mortgage where \nyou don't have to pay any principal and you don't have to pay all of \nthe interest. You can put the principal and some of the interest on the \nback side of your loan. In fact, if that doesn't satisfy you, to get a \nmortgage from us at a teaser rate where you don't have to pay any \nprincipal and you don't have to pay all of the interest, we have even a \nbetter deal for you. You can get what we call a no documentation loan. \nWe won't require that you document income. Or, you can get a partial \ndoc--no doc, partial doc--no interest, no principal. In fact, one \ncompany said: You know what? You don't have to pay any principal or any \ninterest. We will make the first 12 payments for you.\n  Now, is it surprising that an industry that was built on a foundation \nof greed, by brokers making big fees, putting mortgages in the hands of \npeople with teaser rates who could not possibly afford to make the \npayments 3 years later when the interest rates were reset--is it \nsurprising that the tent collapsed when mortgages began to reset and \npeople couldn't possibly afford to make the payments? We have people \nwalking around here scratching their head in this town wondering what \non Earth happened. Where were the smartest guys in the room on Wall \nStreet? Where were the smartest guys in the room who were securitizing \nthese securities and sending them up the road so everybody could make \nmoney on the way, understanding that even as they locked in these \nmortgages with no documentation, no principal payments, perhaps no \ninterest payments, or at least only partial interest payments, the \nlittle key on the bottom of the contract was: Prepayment penalties. \nSign this line and you can't get out of it. Then, when the interest \nrates reset to triple or quadruple what they were and you can't make \nthe payment, we are sorry, you can't get out of it.\n  That is what allowed the big shots to price these mortgages with \nrespect to their expectation of future income in the way they did. But \nis it a surprise that this whole thing collapsed? That is just one more \nexample, and it has happened in energy with speculation and in \nvirtually every area with regulators who decided they have no interest \nin regulating. Now we bear the cost of an economy that almost seems, to \nsome, in free fall.\n  We have massive problems with a trade policy that doesn't work. It \ncontinues to ship jobs overseas and to load the American people with \nmassive quantities of debt that must be repaid. We have a fiscal policy \nthat the President says is only about $400 billion, $450 billion \nofftrack. But, of course, that is not true. He knows that.\n  The question is, How much do you have to borrow in the coming fiscal \nyear? That is closer to $700 billion. So you have a total of over 10 \npercent of the country's GDP that represents red ink for this year \nalone, trade and fiscal policy debt. We can add to that the massive \nproblem in energy. I will talk about that for a moment.\n\n[[Page S8468]]\n\n  I have talked about speculation and the role of the speculators and \nof the regulators who didn't want to watch. Now we are having summit \nmeetings and substantial angst about what we do to put this back on \ntrack. My interest is in doing a lot of everything. In my judgment, we \nshould drill, and drill more. I have had a bill introduced for a year \nand a half that opens the eastern gulf to drilling. In fact, all the \ngangs and the folks who are talking about these things on the Senate \nfloor don't want to open that. As you can see on this chart, this is \nwater off of Cuba that will be leased. There are 500,000 barrels of oil \na day in this water off Cuba that is being leased. The Canadians are \nleasing, Spain is leasing, and we cannot lease because our oil \ncompanies cannot do anything in this area because of the embargo \nagainst Cuba.\n  That is absolutely absurd. We ought to drill. We ought to conserve. \nWe ought to take everything we use every day--appliances and lights--\nand we ought to make them all efficient. We are moving quickly in that \narea.\n  Finally, we have to move dramatically in the area of renewable \nenergy. Every 15 years, it ought not be a surprise that we huff and \npuff and thumb our suspenders and bloviate about what we are going to \ndo next, about where we are going to drill next. How about something \nthat is game changing? How about we change it so in 15 years from now \nwe are not saying the same things and that we are moving toward \nhydrogen fuel cell vehicles? Seventy percent of the oil we use is in \nour vehicles. It is a huge part of our consumption of oil.\n  To back up just a moment, we suck 85 million barrels a day out of \nthis planet, and one-fourth of it is used in the United States. We have \nan appetite for one-fourth of the oil produced every day. Sixty-five \npercent of the oil comes from off of our shores, from Saudi Arabia, \nKuwait, Venezuela, Iraq, and elsewhere. The fact is, we have to find a \nway to be less dependent upon foreign oil. We are always going to use \noil and coal. We have to use it differently, in my judgment.\n  But the question for us is, what do we do that is truly game \nchanging? How about hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, and before that \nperhaps electric drive vehicles. Hydrogen is everywhere. You can take \nenergy from the wind and produce electricity and use electricity in the \nprocess of electrolysis and generate hydrogen from water and use \nhydrogen for vehicle fuel. You will get twice the effective power to \nwheel and put water vapor out of the tailpipe. Wouldn't that be \nwonderful?\n  We are not going to have game-changing strategies if every 15 years \nthe next effort on energy is to figure out where we drill next. Let's \ndrill next, but let's do something that makes us less dependent on the \nneed for this oil, particularly oil coming from outside of our country.\n  It is, I expect, pretty depressing for the American people who have \nthe miracle in our Constitution of every second year, every even-\nnumbered year, being able to grab the American steering wheel and \ndecide which way to nudge America.\n  All the power in this country is in the power of one--one person \ncasting one vote on one day. It must be pretty disappointing to them to \ntake a look at the quality of the debate in our political system at a \ntime when the economy of this country is at risk, when there is so much \nto do and an urgent need to make strong, good decisions, and see the \nirrelevancy come out every single morning, particularly from one \ncampaign. This country deserves much better.\n  I hope between now and this election we will begin to see the attack \ndogs that we saw at work in 2000 and 2004, which defined a new low in \nAmerican politics. In 2004, one of our colleagues who earned three \nPurple Hearts in Vietnam, went to Vietnam and served his country, was \ndefined by the attack dogs as someone who was less than patriotic. That \nwas unbelievable. But that same effort is at work in this campaign. \nThis country deserves a political system and campaigns that give them \nanswers. Where would you take America? Where would you want to lead \nthis country?\n  I must say we only have less than 2 months remaining, and the long-\nterm future of this country depends on us making good, right decisions \nabout energy, fiscal policy, health care, and education, and about so \nmany different issues, including trade policy, which is the discussion \nI started with.\n  Mr. President, I started by speaking of Ohio and trade policy because \nmy colleague, Senator Brown from Ohio, has written a book about trade, \nand we talked a great bit about it. It is but one of a series of very \nserious challenges that he, I, and others should expect will be \ndiscussed in some detail in this campaign. So I hope in the next 60 \ndays we will begin to see some of that.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I ask the Chair what is the business of the \nSenate?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senate is considering S. 3001.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I introduced an amendment earlier today to \nS. 3001. I would like to take some time to explain this amendment to \nthe Senate. I ask unanimous consent to speak for 10 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered. The Senator may proceed.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, we are in an odd situation in the business \nof Government at the moment in that the international authority for the \nUnited States to be operating in Iraq will expire at the end of this \nyear. The U.N. mandate, through the U.N. Security Council, expires at \nthat time.\n  Since last November, the administration has been negotiating what \nthey call the Strategic Framework Agreement that is intended to replace \nthe international authority of the U.N. mandate. There have been two \nquestions that have come up with respect to what the administration is \ndoing. The first is the timeline.\n  There are indications from Iraq that the Iraqi Government negotiators \nhave serious questions that weren't anticipated before. But the larger \nquestion is, what entity of the Federal Government has the authority to \nenter the United States into a long-term relationship with another \ngovernment?\n  These are serious issues. I submit the conditions under which we will \ncontinue to operate in Iraq militarily, diplomatically, economically, \nand even culturally are not the sole business of any administration. We \nhave questions about the legal justification under domestic and \ninternational law for the United States to operate militarily--and \nquasi-militarily, by the way--given the hundreds of thousands of \nindependent contractors that are now essentially performing military \nfunctions in that country. There are questions about the process by \nwhich the U.S. Government decides upon and enters into long-term \nrelations with another nation--any nation. In that regard, we have \nserious questions here about the very workings of our constitutional \nsystem of Government.\n\n  This administration has claimed repeatedly, since last November, that \nit has the right to negotiate and enter into an agreement that will set \nthe future course of our relations with Iraq without the agreement or \neven the ratification of the U.S. Congress. The administration claims \nthat the justification for this authority is the 2002 congressional \nauthorization for the use of force in Iraq and, as a fallback position, \nthe President's inherent authority, from the perspective of this \nadministration, as Commander in Chief.\n  Both of these justifications are patently wrong. The 2002 \ncongressional authorization to use force in Iraq has nothing to do with \nnegotiation with a government, which replaced the Saddam Hussein \ngovernment, as to the future relations culturally, economically, \ndiplomatically, and militarily between our two countries. On the other \nhand, we are now faced with the reality that the U.N. mandate will \nexpire at the end of this year, and that expiration will terminate the \nauthority under international law for the United States to be operating \nin Iraq at a time when we have hundreds of thousands of Americans on \nthe ground in that country.\n  I and other colleagues have been warning of this serious disconnect \nfor\n\n[[Page S8469]]\n\n10 months. Many of us were trying to say last November that the \nintention of this administration was to proceed purely with an \nexecutive agreement to drag this out until the Congress was going to go \nout of session, as we are about to do, and then to present essentially \na fait accompli in the sense that with the expiration of the \ninternational mandate from the United Nations at the end of the year, \nsomething would have to be done, and that something would be an \nexecutive agreement that, to this point, Congress has not even been \nallowed to examine.\n  We have not been able to see one word of this agreement. We tried to \nenergize the Congress. We have met with all of the appropriate \nadministration officials. There have been hearings. There have been \nassurances from the administration that they will consult at the \nappropriate time. We have not seen anything. So we are faced with this \nsituation that is something of a constitutional coup d'etat by this \nadministration. At risk is a further expansion of the powers of the \nPresidency, the result of which will be to affirm, in many minds, that \nthe President--any President--no longer needs the approval of Congress \nto enter into long-term relations with another country, in effect, \ncommitting us to obligations that involve our national security, our \neconomic well-being, our diplomatic posture around the world, without \nthe direct involvement of the U.S. Congress.\n  That is not what the Constitution intended. It is not in the best \ninterest of our country. This amendment, which I filed today, is \ndesigned to prevent this sort of imbalance from occurring and, at the \nsame time, it recognizes the realities of the timelines that are now \ninvolved with respect to the loss of international authority for our \npresence in Iraq at the end of this year.\n  This amendment is a sense of the Congress. On the one hand, it is a \nsense of the Congress that we work with the United Nations to extend \nthe U.N. mandate up to an additional year, giving us some additional \ninternational authority for being in Iraq, taking away the pressure of \nthis timeline that could be used to justify an agreement that the \nCongress hasn't had the ability to examine, but also saying that an \nextension of the U.N. mandate would end at such time as a Strategic \nFramework Agreement and a Status of Forces Agreement between the United \nStates and Iraq are mutually agreed upon.\n\n  The amendment also makes the point that the Strategic Framework \nAgreement now being negotiated between the United States and Iraq poses \nsignificant, long-term national security implications for this country. \nThat would be the sense of the Congress. We need to be saying that; the \nIraqis need to hear it.\n  The amendment also puts Congress and the administration on record to \nthe reality that the Bush administration has fully agreed to consult \nwith the Congress regarding all the details of the Strategic Framework \nAgreement and the Status of Forces Agreement and that there would be \ncopies of the full text of these agreements provided to the chairman \nand ranking minority members of the appropriate committees in the House \nand the Senate prior to the entry into either of those agreements.\n  Importantly, it also says any Strategic Framework Agreement that has \nbeen mutually agreed upon by the negotiators from our executive branch \nand Iraqi Government officials will cease to have effect unless it is \napproved by the Congress within 180 days of the entry into force of \nthat agreement.\n  On the one hand, this agreement recognizes the realities of where we \nare in terms of timelines, but on the other, it protects the \nconstitutional processes by which we are entering into long-term \nrelationships with other countries, whether it is Iraq or Cameroon or \nBurundi or pick a country. We need to preserve this process. It does it \nin a way which will not disrupt our operations in Iraq.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me on this amendment and protect the \nprerogatives of the Congress under the Constitution of the United \nStates.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is good that we are debating the Defense \nauthorization bill. It is appropriate we are debating this bill at a \ntime when certainly America's security is at risk.\n  As I indicated, we are debating the Defense authorization bill, which \nensures America's military capabilities are strong and focused on the \nmajor threats to our great country.\n  We live in a dangerous and unpredictable world. It is a world where \nNorth Korea's leader has fallen ill. This illness could put a nuclear-\narmed regime at risk of implosion because there is no successor named \nor thought of, to our knowledge, in North Korea.\n  We live in a world where Latin American regimes throw out U.S. \nAmbassadors without notice, where an unchecked Russia can undermine \nyoung democracies from West to East.\n  I was recently in Bolivia. I had not too long ago been in Georgia. I \nmet with part of their Government today a few feet from this Chamber. \nSo we have to be concerned about an unchecked Russia.\n  Our dangerous world calls for leaders with sound judgment, not those \nwith temperament prone to recklessness.\n  As we debate the Defense bill this week, we must consider the most \nimportant national security question facing the Nation today: Will we \nstick with the same failed, out-of-touch foreign policy of George Bush, \nDick Cheney, and John McCain, which military experts and historians \ncall the worst foreign policy in our Nation's history or will we change \ncourse to a more tough, responsible foreign policy that will make us \nmore secure?\n  The choice could not be more important, but the answer could not be \nclearer. Senator Obama and Senate Democrats stand for responsible \nchange. We believe we must end the war in Iraq and bring the war on \nterror to where the terrorists actually live and where they plot. We \nknow our focus must return to Osama bin Laden and his al-Qaida network \nin Afghanistan and Pakistan and wherever they might be.\n  This approach stands on the right side of the American people and the \nright side of history. According to recent press reports, even the Bush \nadministration has begun to align its actions with this policy.\n  Take Pakistan, for example. For years, Senator Obama and Senate \nDemocrats have been calling on the Bush administration to hunt down \nOsama bin Laden and the al-Qaida network, wherever they may be located. \nAs it became clear that al-Qaida had made Pakistan the central focus of \nits operation, Democrats called on the President to make Pakistan a \ncentral focus of our war to defeat al-Qaida.\n  Here is what Senator Obama said last year:\n\n       . . . Let me be clear. There are terrorists holed up in \n     those mountains who murdered 3,000 Americans. They are \n     plotting to strike again. . . .If we have actionable \n     intelligence about high-value terrorist targets and [the \n     Pakistani leadership] won't act, we will. I will not hesitate \n     to use military force to take out terrorists who pose a \n     direct threat to America.\n\n  While Senator Obama sounded the alarm about the al-Qaida threat in \nPakistan and called for a forceful and comprehensive strategy to fight \nthis threat, George Bush and John McCain chose, stunningly, to ignore \nit. The President kept the bulk of our ground troops and our special \noperations forces and our intelligence assets tied down in Iraq in a \nwar that had nothing to do with Osama bin Laden and the terrorists who \nattacked.\n  Republicans, led by John McCain, attacked Obama's approach to \nforcefully go after al-Qaida in Pakistan. Senator McCain even had the \nbad judgment on the campaign trail this past February to call the Obama \napproach naive.\n  Here we stand a year later. The al-Qaida threat in Pakistan has grown \nfar more dangerous. The need for tough action, as Senator Obama called \nfor last year, is even more urgent. Barack Obama was right; George \nBush, Dick Cheney, and John McCain were wrong.\n  Then, yesterday, the newspapers reported that senior Bush \nadministration officials had begun doing what Obama\n\n[[Page S8470]]\n\ncalled for a long time ago: go after al-Qaida safe havens in Pakistan, \nreportedly including military operations against terrorist camps. That \nis precisely the Obama approach McCain called naive. But news reports \nindicate we are already starting to see results.\n  Given the known history of Bush-McCain foreign policy mistakes that \nwe have all suffered through for the past 8 years, I have concerns and \nquestions about the Bush administration's actions. It is one thing to \ntake Obama's playbook, but it is another thing to call the right plays.\n\n  I think we should all ask tough questions and demand the White House \nexplain their Pakistan strategy in greater detail to give us confidence \nthat they will get the job done right.\n  The Bush administration's adoption of the Obama plan came months too \nlate but, nevertheless, better late than never. The shift is not just \nlimited to Pakistan. Across the globe, the Bush administration is \nquietly acknowledging that Senator Obama's vision has been right all \nalong.\n  On Afghanistan, where for years Senator Obama and Senate Democrats \nhave been demanding more resources and a new strategy, things are \nchanging. Senator McCain, on the other hand, said: ``Afghanistan is not \nin trouble because of our diversion to Iraq.''\n  Listen to that again. McCain said: ``Afghanistan is not in trouble \nbecause of our diversions to Iraq.''\n  That is a direct quote.\n  After years of resisting, Republicans in recent weeks have been \ninching toward the Obama plan for reinforcing Afghanistan. On Iran, \nwhere Bush and McCain criticized Obama's vision for tough and effective \nface-to-face diplomacy, even as they quietly agreed to face-to-face \ndiplomacy and started sending State Department officials to \nnegotiations with the Iranians. And on Iraq, where Bush has finally \nbegun to slowly inch toward the Obama plan for holding the Iraqis more \naccountable by putting in place a timeline for change in the military \nmission and the redeployment of our troops. But, of course, not John \nMcCain.\n  Our country deserves more than token shifts and lipservice to change. \nIt will take decisive leadership to reverse 8 long years of tragic \nforeign policy mistakes. That is exactly what Senator Obama and Senate \nDemocrats offer: real responsible change.\n  Senator McCain and his supporters are dead set against changing the \nBush administration's failed policies. They have no plan for ending \nconflict, no plan for securing our country, no plan for bringing our \ntroops home.\n  Republicans talk a lot about experience. But when you are the author, \narchitect, and enabler of 8 years of devastating foreign policy \nmistakes, that is not experience; it is very bad judgment.\n  In the coming days, as we wrap up debate on the Defense authorization \nbill, Senators on both sides of the aisle will have ample opportunity \nto make their positions known on these critical national security \nissues that will chart our course in the world for years to come.\n  It will also give the American people the opportunity to see who \nstands with failed policies of the past and who is ready to lead us to \nthe change we need.\n  Senator Levin and Senator Warner announced yesterday that today they \nwould be happy to listen to what anyone had to say about amendments \nthey wish to offer on this bill. The same applies to Monday. We need to \nmove beyond where we are. There are some who want us to get virtually \nnothing done on this Defense authorization bill.\n  There are so many reasons why it is important we get this bill done. \nIt would be the first time in five decades that this body has not \npassed a Defense authorization bill. This bill is loaded with \nprovisions that are good for the security of our Nation, good for the \nmaintenance of a military that is strong and vibrant, and make our \ntroops happier--a 3.9-percent pay raise, among other items, they \ndeserve and they need.\n  I have informed the two managers of the bill I think it is \nappropriate at this time that we file a cloture motion in an effort to \nbring this matter to a conclusion. We are going to have a vote on \ncloture on this most important bill sometime on Tuesday. I am going to \nwork with the managers of the bill and Senator McConnell to find out \nwhat their wishes are. But we must move on. It would be a shame if we \ndo not pass this legislation.\n  Having said all that--and I could a say a lot more--one of the \nreasons we should pass this bill is because of Senator Warner. I am \nsure the State of Virginia has had great legislators over the years. I \ndon't know them all. I have served with a number of them. But I have to \nsay that in my experience in Government, you don't run very often into \nsomebody of the caliber of John Warner. The Commonwealth of Virginia \nhas been so well served by this great American patriot, and he has \ndevoted so much time--I was trying to come up in my mind on a \npercentage basis how much of his time has been spent on the defense \nduties he has.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Thirty years.\n  Mr. REID. But the vast majority of his 30 years in the Senate, Mr. \nPresident, has been spent legislatively on securing the security of our \nNation.\n  There will be other opportunities, I am confident, to express my \nadmiration and respect and affection for John Warner, but I hope people \non his side of the aisle appreciate him as much as we do. He is truly a \nwonderful legislator and human being. We need to get this bill done for \nhim. Every Democrat will vote for cloture on this piece of \nlegislation--there are 51 of us--and we need 9 Republicans to join with \nus so that we can finish this piece of legislation. I hope we can do \nthat. It is the right thing to do, and I think it would be a real slap \nin the face to one of America's great legislators not to complete this \nlegislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am deeply humbled by the comments of the \ndistinguished leader and many other colleagues, but I am optimistic. \nSenator Levin and I--who have spent a good deal of time with Leader \nMcConnell this morning--believe there is a momentum on both sides to \nmove to a conclusion. Senator Levin and I are going to talk to some \nparticulars pretty soon, but I am pleased to say that I think our \nstaffs are going to finish an agreement over this weekend on 60 \namendments, just to give some idea of the magnitude of progress we have \nmade thus far.\n  But I thank the distinguished leader for his personal remarks. We \nhave had a long working relationship. We started together on a \nsubcommittee in the Environment Committee years and years ago--20-some-\nodd years ago. That was the beginning of our long, marvelous \nfriendship.\n  I thank the leader.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I send to the desk a cloture motion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The cloture motion having been presented under \nrule XXII, the Chair directs the clerk to read the motion.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     hereby move to bring to a close debate on S. 3001, the \n     National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2009.\n         Carl Levin, Patrick J.

The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, first, let me thank the leader for his \ngreat support of this bill. I think the leadership on both sides really \nwants this bill to be adopted. We are going to have to move early next \nweek to get it adopted if we are going to make it. We not only have \nother business to do in the Senate which is critical, but we have to \nget it to conference and get it back from conference and get a \nconference report voted on before we recess or adjourn. So we have a \nlot of work ahead of us.\n  But we are here. Senator Warner and I and our staffs are here. We \nhave met with a lot of Senators relative to their amendments. Our goal \nis the following: that on Monday, we enter into a unanimous consent \nagreement setting out what votes on what amendments would be held on \nTuesday, both morning and afternoon. That is our goal.\n\n[[Page S8471]]\n\n  We have spoken with many Senators about their amendments. As Senator \nWarner just indicated, we hope to be able to clear perhaps 50 or 60 \namendments, 15 or 20 of which are already cleared. That is our goal, to \nget our cleared amendments passed and to set up, in a unanimous consent \nproposal for Monday, the way in which we would vote on various \namendments, with time agreements and whether there are 50 votes or 60 \nvotes, and so forth, on Tuesday. That is our goal.\n  I would hope, for the reasons the majority leader just gave, that \nbecause this bill is so critically important to the men and women in \nthe Army and to the security of this Nation--not just the Army but the \nmen and women of our Armed Forces and to the security of this Nation--\nthat we will get this bill passed. The only way we can get it passed is \nif sometime early next week we are able to pass it; otherwise, we \ncannot get the work done in conference and back here to the Senate and \nto the White House.\n  So I thank my good friend from Virginia. I think the comments of the \nmajority leader are comments which should be shared by every single \nMember of this body relative to the capability and the leadership and \nthe patriotism of Senator Warner. It is always a pleasure to work with \nhim. This may be one of our greatest challenges, but we have a long \nhistory of being able to work together on a bipartisan basis to address \nthese kinds of challenges. He has led this committee. We have had many \ngreat members of the committee.\n  Staff is working very hard, and I am optimistic going into the \nweekend that we will be able to get that unanimous consent agreement \nworked out on Monday.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague.\n  We are working on a draft UC for Monday, and I wish to point out that \nthose amendments which have been brought to our attention requiring \nvotes, we are going to try to achieve that prior to the invoking of \ncloture; am I not correct?\n  Mr. LEVIN. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. And we are trying to protect, on both sides, an equal \nnumber of Senators who have come to us and sought that protection.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank Senators DeMint and Coburn for working with us \nlast night on an important issue not only to the underlying question of \nhow this body is going to handle certain desires of individual Senators \nto get funds to their States, but it is the preservation of the \njurisdiction of the authorizing committee, of our authorizing committee \nas well as other authorizing committees in the Senate. So that is \nfundamental to the resolution of that problem, and I think we have made \nprogress there.\n  Mr. LEVIN. We have. There is no more fundamental question to this \ninstitution than the role of our committees and this institution vis-a-\nvis the executive branch and whether we are going to have a robust \npower of the purse or whether that is going to be diminished in any \nway. I think we are making great progress in showing to our colleagues \nthe implications of some of the proposals, and we are going to continue \nto make progress in that regard.\n  Mr. WARNER. Now, Mr. President, I would suggest the Senator should \nnow move to morning business and get off this bill. We are cleared on \nthis side.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/12/senate-section/article/S8471-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8471]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. LEVIN.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I would just concur, if I might, with the \nfine words of Senator Reid. I have not known Senator Warner all that \nlong, but clearly he is what a Senator should be. He is thoughtful, \nintelligent, and respectful of other points of view. While he and I may \nnot agree on every issue, I have appreciated working with him, and I \napplaud him for his service to this country.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my colleague for his remarks.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I did want to say a word or two on the \nDefense authorization bill and to indicate that my staff has been \nworking with the staff of Senators Levin and Warner. I hope we can work \nout an agreement on an important amendment I have authored along with \nSenators Feingold and Whitehouse.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/12/senate-section/article/S8471-2", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8471-S8472]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            DEFENSE SPENDING\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, this country has a $9.7 trillion national \ndebt. In addition, we obviously have enormous unmet infrastructure \nneeds and social needs. Every American who drives on the road or goes \nover a bridge understands that we need to spend billions of dollars \nrebuilding our infrastructure. Forty-six million Americans have no \nhealth insurance. We have the highest rate of childhood poverty in the \nindustrialized world. In other words, we as a nation have enormous \nneeds, and it is incumbent upon the Congress to do everything we can to \ntake a hard look at fraud, waste, and abuse in every agency of the U.S. \nGovernment, including the Defense Department.\n  I know many of my colleagues come down here and take a hard look at \nthis issue. They take a hard look at that issue, but for some reason or \nanother, looking at the Defense Department seems to be off their radar \nscreen, and I think that is wrong. I think that is especially wrong \ngiven the fact that the budget we are looking at right now for the \nDefense Department is over $500 billion, excluding the money we spent \nin Iraq and Afghanistan, which is more than half of the discretionary \nbudget of our country. So it seems to me that with regard to any of the \nagencies out there, we should be very active in taking a hard look at \nthe waste, fraud, and abuse that takes place within the Defense \nauthorization bill.\n  The amendment I am offering with Senators Feingold and Whitehouse is \npretty simple and straightforward. Today, more than half of the spare \nparts in the Air Force warehouses--over $18 billion--are not needed. \nThat is $18 billion in spare parts which are not needed. In fact, if \nyou can believe it, the Air Force has on order $235 million in \ninventory already identified as ready for disposal. They are spending \n$235 million to bring inventory in which is going to go out because \nthey do not need it. That may make sense to somebody, but it certainly \ndoes not make sense to me.\n  The truth is that this type of wasteful practice has gone on year \nafter year, resulting in an enormous waste of taxpayer money, and it \nmust be ended. Our amendment does three things: No. 1, it requires the \nSecretary of Defense to develop a comprehensive plan for improving the \ninventory system. No. 2, it requires the certification to Congress that \nthe Army, Navy, Air Force, and Defense Logistics Agency have reduced \ntheir secondary inventory. No. 3, it fences off $100 million in \ninventory purchases until the Secretary of Defense makes required \ncertifications.\n  Mr. President, I would remind the Members of the Senate of one of the \nmost significant speeches ever given by a President of the United \nStates, and that President was Dwight David Eisenhower, who, as all \nAmericans should know, was a five-star general and the military \ncommander of Europe during World War II. He was, in fact, one of the \ngreat heroes in the defeat of nazism. Eisenhower, who became President \nin 1952--though it is not widely known--was extremely vocal in taking \non not only Democrats--he was a Republican--but Republicans as well in \nsaying that every nickel we spent on excess and wasteful military \nspending--something which he knew something about as a former five-star \ngeneral--was simply taking money away from the needs of the American \npeople.\n  A few days before he left office in 1961, President Eisenhower gave \none of the most prophetic speeches ever made from the White House, and \nhere is what Eisenhower said:\n\n       In the councils of Government, we must guard against the \n     acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or \n     unsought, by the military-industrial complex. The potential \n     for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will \n     persist.\n\n  This is what Eisenhower said before he left office in 1961. He was \ntalking then about the military industrial\n\n[[Page S8472]]\n\ncomplex. Well, let me tell you something. If he was worried about the \nmilitary industrial complex and the influence they have in distorting \nnational priorities in this country in 1961, I can only imagine what he \nwould think about the power of the military industrial complex today.\n  So, Mr. President, clearly we want to have a very strong defense, \nclearly we want to make sure our soldiers have all of the equipment \nthey need, but we have to take a hard look at the Defense Department, \nas we do at every other agency of Government, and I would hope very \nmuch that the amendment Senators Feingold, Whitehouse, and I have \noffered will, in fact, be accepted.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/12/senate-section/article/S8472-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8472]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO HONOR FLIGHT\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to \nrecognize the fourth Honor Flight from Kentucky that took place this \nweek. Honor Flight is a nonprofit organization which transports \nsurviving World War II veterans from around the country to see their \nmemorial free of charge. I have been privileged to have participated in \nprevious flights from Kentucky, and I very much regret that my schedule \nprevented me from attending this one. I hope to have the opportunity to \nmeet again soon with the inspiring veterans from my home state on \nfuture Honor Flight trips.\n  On Wednesday, Honor Flight's Bluegrass Chapter arrived in Washington \nwith 38 World War II veterans from the Commonwealth to see the memorial \nwhich they inspired. These brave Americans also paid tribute to one of \ntheir fellow Kentuckians who gave his last full measure of devotion in \nMarch 1945. 2LT Howard Clifton Enoch, Jr., of Marion, Kentucky, paid \nthe ultimate sacrifice while engaging with enemy aircraft over Germany.\n  Earlier this year, the Department of Defense honored its promise to \naccount for every one of its men and women, and, more than 60 years \nlater, the remains of Second Lieutenant Enoch were repatriated. He will \nfind his final resting place among other American heroes at Arlington \nNational Cemetery later this month. The son of Lieutenant Enoch, Mr. \nHoward Enoch III, traveled with the veterans from Kentucky to honor his \nfather, who he never knew. I would like to convey my deepest \nappreciation to Mr. Enoch for his father's service and to his family \nfor their sacrifice.\n  I also wish to express my tremendous gratitude to the 38 Kentucky \nveterans who were here on Wednesday for having served to protect our \ngreat Nation's principles from the enemies of freedom. The inscription \non the western corner of their monument--a quote by President Harry S \nTruman--perhaps best puts into words those sentiments:\n\n       Our debt to the heroic men and valiant women in the service \n     of our country can never be repaid. They have earned our \n     undying gratitude. America will never forget their sacrifice.\n\n  Indeed, our Nation will never forget their bravery or their sacrifice \nas it lives on today in the men and women of our armed services who \ndisplay the same honor and continue to defend the same principles.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the names of the 38 World War II \nveterans from the Commonwealth be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                              In Memory of\n\n       Howard Clifton Enoch, Jr.\n\n                         World War II Veterans\n\n       George Arflack; William Atkinson; Harold Ausmus; Ruben \n     Avila; Fredrick Balke; John Beyer; Hubert Wessel; Lorell \n     Roberts; James Smith; Harlan Barton; Raymond Bloemer, Sr.; \n     John Blossom; Fred Bryan; Phillip Chapelle; Eugene Thurman; \n     John Bruggensmith; Leslie Cohen; Clarence Crawford; James \n     ``Art'' Cutliff.\n       Wayne Tabor; Herman Sasse; Charles Devers; Henry ``Don'' \n     Donaldson; Matthew Flanagan; Robert Carrico; Robert Hall; \n     Edward Jackey; Clyde Logsdon; Leonard O'Dell; Edward Oechsli; \n     Bernard O'Hare; John O'Keefe; Blond Puckett; Leslie ``Dan'' \n     Stickler; Charles Tribble; Ernest Spencer; Harold Phillips; \n     Joseph Riney.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/12/senate-section/article/S8472-2", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8472-S8474]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      BUDGET SCOREKEEPING REPORTS\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise to submit to the Senate the second \nset of budget scorekeeping reports for the 2009 budget resolution. The \nreports, which cover fiscal years 2008 and 2009, were prepared by the \nCongressional Budget Office pursuant to section 308(b) and in aid of \nsection 311 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, as amended.\n  The reports show the effects of congressional action through \nSeptember 8, 2008, and include legislation that was enacted since I \nfiled my last reports in July. The new legislation includes: Public Law \n110-275, the Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act of \n2008; Public Law 110-287, a joint resolution approving the renewal of \nimport restrictions contained in the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act \nof 2003; Public Law 110-289, the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of \n2008; and Public Law 110-315, the Higher Education Opportunity Act. The \nestimates of budget authority, outlays, and revenues are consistent \nwith the technical and economic assumptions of S. Con. Res. 70, the \n2009 budget resolution.\n  For 2008, the estimates show that current level spending is below the \nbudget resolution by $5.2 billion for budget authority and $2.4 billion \nfor outlays while current level revenues are above the budget \nresolution by $3 billion. For 2009, the estimates show that current \nlevel spending is below the budget resolution by $958 billion for \nbudget authority and $591.1 billion for outlays while current level \nrevenues are above the budget resolution level by $56.7 billion.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letters and accompanying tables from \nCBO be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    U.S. Congress,\n\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 11, 2008.\n     Hon. Kent Conrad,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Budget,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: The enclosed report shows the effects of \n     Congressional action on the fiscal year 2008 budget and is \n     current through September 8, 2008. This report is submitted \n     under section 308(b) and in aid of section 311 of the \n     Congressional Budget Act, as amended.\n       The estimates of budget authority, outlays, and revenues \n     are consistent with the technical and economic assumptions of \n     S. Con. Res. 70, the Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for \n     Fiscal Year 2009, as approved by the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives.\n       Pursuant to section 204(a) of S. Con. Res. 21, provisions \n     designated as emergency requirements are exempt from \n     enforcement of the budget resolution. As a result, the \n     enclosed current level report excludes these amounts (see \n     footnote 2 of Table 2 of the report).\n       Since my last letter, dated July 9, 2008, the Congress has \n     cleared and the President has signed the following acts that \n     affect budget authority, outlays, or revenues for fiscal year \n     2008:\n       Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act of \n     2008 (Public Law 110-275);\n       Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 (Public Law 110-\n     289); and\n       Higher Education Opportunity Act (Public Law 110-315).\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Robert A.

Con. Res. 70, the Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal Year 2009, assumed $108.1 billion in\n  budget authority and $28.9 billion in outlays for overseas deployment and related activities. The Supplemental\n  Appropriations Act, 2008 (P.L. 110-352) designated funding for these activities as an emergency requirement,\n  pursuant to section 204(a) of S. Con. Res. 21, the Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal Year 2008.\n  Such emergency amounts are exempt from the enforcement of S. Con. Res. 70.

Mayne\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, it is with a heavy heart that I rise \ntoday to honor the life and heroic service of SSG Kenneth W. Mayne. \nStaff Sergeant Mayne, a member of the 4th Infantry Division, was killed \nin a neighborhood outside of Baghdad on September 4, 2008, when a \nroadside bomb struck his vehicle. He was 29 years old.\n   A graduate of Arvada West High School in Colorado, Staff Sergeant \nMayne enlisted in the Army in 1997 at the age of 18. According to his \nmother, Michelle, he immediately took to the discipline and dedication \nto duty that defines the life of an American soldier. He chose to make \nservice to country his career.\n   He was first deployed to Iraq in 2003 with the 101st Airborne, and \nspent a year there in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom.\n  Later, Staff Sergeant Mayne transferred to the 4th Infantry Division \nin Fort Hood, TX, because the division was scheduled to be moved to \nFort Carson, CO, following its deployment to Iraq in March 2008. He \nloved Colorado and wanted to go home to be close to his family. \nFollowing his discharge, he intended to become a history teacher.\n  Those who knew Kenneth described him as brave, as dedicated to his \nmen, and as possessing a great empathy for the children of Iraq. During \nhis patrols in Sadr City, one of the poorest and most volatile \nneighborhoods in the country, Kenneth distributed toys, soccer balls, \nand coloring books to Iraqi children that his mother had sent from \nhome. Concerned about their health, he worked with his men to get fresh \nwater into local schools and to clean up sewage so that children had a \nclean place to play. He believed in the work he was doing because he \ncould see the difference he was making in people's lives.\n  Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote that, ``to share often and much . . . to \nknow even one life has breathed easier because you have lived. This is \nto have succeeded.''\n  For all the Iraqi children who are better off, for all the \nneighborhoods that are safer, for all those whose image of America has \nbeen transformed, Staff Sergeant Mayne has succeeded. Staff Sergeant \nMayne embodied an America that reaches out to those in need, an America \nbrimming with kindness and compassion, an America that ``shares often \nand much.''\n  For all this, and for his tireless service to his country, Sergeant \nMayne has the eternal gratitude of his nation.\n  To Kenneth's mother Michelle, his father, his stepfather Dan, his \nsisters Christina and Jennifer, his brother Danny, and all his friends \nand family, I cannot imagine the sorrow you must be feeling. I hope \nthat, in time, the pain of your loss is assuaged by your pride in \nKenneth's service to his country and by your knowledge that his country \nwill never forget him. We are humbled by his service and his sacrifice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/12/senate-section/article/S8474-2", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8474-S8475]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               TAX POLICY\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, after I spoke about small business tax \nissues yesterday, Senators Sanders and Durbin responded. I would like \nto thank my friends from Vermont and Illinois for engaging in the \nimportant debate of the future of tax policy for our country last \nnight. The upcoming congressional and Presidential elections will have \na big impact on tax issues, so these issues should be debated here in \nthe world's most deliberative body. In response to the comments of my \nfriends from Vermont and Illinois, I would like to raise a few brief \npoints.\n  First, the 2001 and 2003 tax relief bills were not and are not the \n``Bush tax cuts.'' These bills were crafted in a bipartisan manner. In \nfact, one-fourth of the Democratic Caucus voted for the 2001 tax \nrelief.\n  I will be discussing middle income tax relief in a separate speech \nshortly. However, there's no question the legislation criticized by my \ntwo friends improved the progressivity of the Tax Code and cut taxes \nfor middle income\n\n[[Page S8475]]\n\nfamilies. For a single mom with two children and $30,000 of income, the \n2001 and 2003 tax relief has prevented a tax increase of $1,100 per \nyear. Similarly, for a family of four with $50,000 of income, this tax \nrelief has prevented them from facing a $2,300 yearly tax increase.\n  Indeed, both Senator Obama and Senator McCain agree on keeping most \nof the structure of the legislation criticized by my friends from \nVermont and Illinois.\n  Where Senators Obama and McCain disagree is on whether we should keep \nthe tax rates where they are. I would note that Senator Obama recently \nagreed that, because of concerns about the economy, we should leave the \ntop rates where they are, at least for now.\n  I would encourage my friends to review the data I presented \nyesterday. That data clearly illustrates that there are negative \neffects on small business from raising marginal rates by 17 percent to \n33 percent. The data show that the tax increases of Senator Obama's \nplan will take direct aim at small business owners. Senator Obama does \nnow agree that we should defer his tax increases until 2011. Senator \nMcCain thinks the current levels of taxation are appropriate for both \nnow and the future.\n  The bipartisan tax relief of 2001 and 2003, largely supported by \nSenators Obama and McCain, kept revenues at or above historical \naverages for most of the period they were in effect. These policies \nwere put in place during economic shocks, and the economy responded.\n  I would ask my friends why they disagree. Why should we raise taxes \non small business now? I look forward to their response.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/12/senate-section/article/S8475-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8475]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES AMENDMENTS ACT OF 2008\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today to voice my support for S. \n3406, The Americans with Disabilities Amendments Act of 2008. Like the \noriginal ADA, this legislation is the result of extensive bipartisan \neffort; and I would take this opportunity to commend Senators Hatch and \nHarkin for their leadership on this issue. I would also note that this \nlegislation was supported by a wide range of stakeholder groups in the \nemployer and disability communities. These groups participated \nextensively in the development and negotiation of this legislation and \nit can safely be said that without their participation this bill would \nnot be a reality today.\n  S. 3406 was principally crafted as a response to a number of Court \ncases that many observers felt had interpreted the ADA too narrowly, \nand, therefore, denied coverage to individuals that the statute was \noriginally intended to cover. The legislation clarifies the legislative \nintent. It retains the inherently functional definition of disability \nfrom the original ADA; and continues to require that in order for a \nphysical or mental impairment to rise to the level of a covered \ndisability it must substantially limit one or more of an individual's \nmajor life activities.\n  Ensuring that individuals with disabilities are free from \ndiscrimination, and fostering their full inclusion in the workplace and \nin all other aspects of life are singularly important goals and \nresponsibilities. It is also equally important to continually monitor \nour laws, and, as we do today, amend them, to make certain these goals \nand responsibilities are met.\n  Whenever changes are made in existing law, however, we must be \nmindful of the likelihood of increased litigation in the aftermath of \nsuch changes. The drafters of S. 3406 have attempted to be as clear as \npossible in an effort to avoid the type of confusion that could spawn \nsuch excessive litigation. That said, we are not unmindful of the \nconcerns expressed by some smaller businesses in this regard. Those \nbusinesses should recognize that this legislation was intended to \nensure restored coverage for individuals that all of us recognize are \nentitled to the law's protection; and that the legislation was not \nintended to promote litigation or prop up questionable or frivolous \nclaims of coverage. Just as Congress has monitored the original ADA and \nacts today to correct problems with its interpretation, it will \ncontinue to monitor the amended ADA and take action in the event it is \nabused.\n  I would also note that there have been some concerns expressed by \nboth institutions of higher education and boards of professional \ncertification that this bill would somehow change the fundamental \nnature of the service which a covered entity provides or lower the \nstandards for professional certification. As to the latter, it should \nbe expressly noted that nothing in the legislation affects the \nstandards for professional certifications; and, as to the former, the \nlegislation itself does not require that accommodations be extended \nwhere to do so would alter the fundamental nature of the services being \nprovided. These would seem to be fair safeguards against the legitimate \nconcerns expressed by some stakeholders.\n  The legislation that we pass today will hopefully help to aid in the \nfull integration of those with disabilities into all aspects of \nsociety. It is an important piece in the strategy for achieving this \nend, but we must remember it is only a piece and cannot be the only \nstrategy. Despite the existence of the ADA the workforce participation \nlevels for individuals with disabilities have remained unacceptably \nlow. We therefore need to think of approaches beyond the traditional \nenforcement of rights statutes in an effort to achieve the goal of the \nfull participation of all our citizens in the benefits of our society \nand economy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/12/senate-section/article/S8475-2", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8475]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              FEDERAL AND STATE VETERANS HOMES PARTNERSHIP\n\n  Mr. GREGG.

Our Nation has a proud history of \nlooking after its warriors even after the loud sounds of battle have \nbeen pacified.\n  Since 1890, the New Hampshire Veterans Home has served in this fine \ntradition by providing care and comfort for thousands of men and women \nwho have sacrificed so much to preserve our freedom and protect our \ncountry and State. The commitment and outstanding contributions of past \nCommandants, members of the board of managers, staff, and many \nvolunteers to the welfare of New Hampshire veterans is truly \nextraordinary. Today, the New Hampshire Veterans Home continues to \nimprove and uphold its value by assuring access to affordable, \nprofessional, and quality nursing care in a community setting that \ncultivates learning, growth, and optimal quality of life.\n  I look forward to building upon the good relationship between our \nNation's State Veterans Homes and the Federal Government and again join \nin celebrating this milestone of service to our Nation's heroes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/12/senate-section/article/S8475-3", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8475-S8476]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                   TRIBUTE TO MARGARET ``PEGGY'' SIMS\n\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I wish to take this opportunity \nto pay tribute to a longtime public servant who spent her career \nworking hard to improve the quality of elections. Ms. Margaret Sims \nspent her entire career working for both of the agencies under the \njurisdiction of the Rules Committee--the Federal Election Commission \nand the Election Assistance Commission. She passed away earlier this \nmonth after a long battle with cancer.\n  A resident of Burke, VA, Ms. Sims, known to her friends as ``Peggy'', \nwas born in Schenectady, NY, and was a graduate of Wells College. She \nwas an intern in the community services department at the AFL-CIO \nbefore starting her career at the FEC as an investigator. She also \nserved as Director of Compliance and Election Administrative Research \nSpecialist at that agency.\n  Long before the 2000 election and hanging chads, Ms. Sims was working \nhard with our Nation's election administration professionals to provide \nthem with the best information available to help them do their job. \nWhile at the FEC, she assisted in developing voting systems standards \nand in the creation\n\n[[Page S8476]]\n\nof a guide and training tools to accompany the 1993 National Voter \nRegistration Act. She was also part of the first U.S. delegation to the \nTrilateral Conference between Canada, Mexico and the United States held \nin Mexico City in 1994. This conference engaged the three countries in \ndialogue regarding their respective election processes so that each \ncountry might learn from the others.\n  She moved to the newly created U.S. Election Assistance Commission in \n2004, where she assisted in guiding States in appropriate voting \nprocedures and in training them how to report back to that agency. She \nprovided guidance to the new EAC Commissioners and assisted them in \ndeveloping a working knowledge of the election administration process. \nDuring the challenging implementation of the Help America Vote Act, \nhundreds of election officials relied on her assistance in getting the \nlaw right.\n  Because she worked in the field of elections, Ms. Sims was always \nnonpartisan. She proudly said that she would not even let her husband \nput a political bumper sticker on his car. Her emphasis on providing \nassistance in an impartial, unbiased way is a testament to her \ndedication. She did not care about who won or lost, she cared that the \nprocess was always fair.\n  She is survived by her husband and son, Dug and Jay Greevy, as well \nas her mother, two brothers, and a sister.\n  It is important to remember not only the life of Peggy Sims but also \nthe impact of her work. She worked hard every day for civic leadership \nand better government. She rose above partisan labels. We honor her \nmemory by recognizing her commitments to public service and to shaping \nbetter elections for our country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/12/senate-section/article/S8476-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8476]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  CENTRAL DECATUR COMMUNITY EDUCATION\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, in Iowa and across the United \nStates, a new school year has begun. As you know, Iowa public schools \nhave an excellent reputation nationwide, and Iowa students' test scores \nare among the highest in the Nation.\n  I would like to take just a few minutes, today, to salute the \ndedicated teachers, administrators, and school board members in the \nCentral Decatur Community School District, and to report on their \nparticipation in a unique federal partnership to repair and modernize \nschool facilities.\n  This fall marks the 10th year of the Iowa Demonstration Construction \nGrant Program. That is its formal name, but it is better known among \neducators in Iowa as the program of Harkin grants for Iowa public \nschools. Since 1998, I have been fortunate to secure a total of $121 \nmillion for the State government in Iowa, which selects worthy school \ndistricts to receive these grants for a range of renovation and repair \nefforts--everything from updating fire-safety systems to building new \nschools or renovating existing facilities. In many cases, this Federal \nfunding is used to leverage public and/or private local funding, so it \noften has a tremendous multiplier effect in a local school district.\n  The Central Decatur Community School District received two Harkin \ngrants totaling $947,775 which it used to help build additions to two \nschools in Leon. The district built an addition to South Elementary \nwhich serves students in prekindergarten through third grade and also \nbuilt the North Elementary addition to the high school. The school \nboard is to be commended for thinking to the future by incorporating an \nenergy efficient geothermal system at the North Elementary building. \nThese schools are the modern, state-of-the-art facilities that befit \nthe educational ambitions and excellence of this school district. \nIndeed, they are the kind of school facilities that every child \ndeserves.\n  Excellent schools do not just pop up like mushrooms after a rain. \nThey are the product of vision, leadership, persistence, and a \ntremendous amount of collaboration among local officials and concerned \ncitizens. I salute the entire staff, administration, and governance in \nthe Central Decatur Community School District. In particular, I would \nlike to recognize the leadership of the board of education president \nMike Frost, vice president Jack Parsons, Rose Saxton, Mike Stuck and \nIgor Takacs and former board members Nick Morrell, Gary Hayworth, Dave \nSmith, Brent Buckingham and Jim Lafleur. I would also like to recognize \nsuperintendent Tucker Lillis, former superintendent Steve Williams and \nkey supporters of the bond referendum, Jerry Parsons, Gene Binning and \nPeg Erke.\n  As we mark the 10th anniversary of the Harkin school grant program in \nIowa, I am obliged to point out that many thousands of school buildings \nand facilities across the United States are in dire need of renovation \nor replacement. In my State of Iowa alone, according to a recent study, \nsome 79 percent of public schools need to be upgraded or repaired. The \nharsh reality is that the average age of school buildings in the United \nStates is nearly 50 years.\n  Too often, our children visit ultramodern shopping malls and gleaming \nsports arenas on weekends, but during the week go to school in rundown \nor antiquated facilities. This sends exactly the wrong message to our \nyoung people about our priorities. We have got to do better.\n  That is why I am deeply grateful to the professionals and parents in \nthe Central Decatur Community School District. There is no question \nthat a quality public education for every child is a top priority in \nthat community. I salute them, and wish them a very successful new \nschool year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/12/senate-section/article/S8476-2", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8476-S8477]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 CLEAR LAKE COMMUNITY SCHOOL EDUCATION\n\n Mr. HARKIN.

    \n\n[Pages S8480-S8498]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. SPECTER (for himself, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Roberts, Mr. \n        Rockefeller, Mr. Wyden, and Mr. Smith):\n  S. 3484. A bill to provide for a delay in the phaseout of the hospice \nbudget neutrality adjustment factor under title XVIII of the Social \nSecurity Act; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition today to \nintroduce the Medicare Hospice Protection Act, which will place a one-\nyear moratorium on a final rule issued by the Centers for Medicare and \nMedicaid Services, CMS, reducing payments to hospice providers and \nensure Medicare beneficiaries' access to hospice care.\n  More than 1.3 million Americans depend on hospice for high quality \nand compassionate end-of-life care each year. Unfortunately, on August \n1, 2008, CMS issued a final rule to reduce hospice reimbursement rates \nin Medicare. This reduction of the hospice wage index will take $2.3 \nbillion out of hospice care over the next 5 years if this Congress \nallows it to be implemented as scheduled on October 1, 2008.\n  The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, MedPAC, is currently \nexamining the payment system for hospice care. We must allow the MedPAC \nto complete this important review of the hospice Medicare benefit and \nmake payment recommendations, which is expected in 2009. The Hospice \nProtection Act, introduced by myself and Senators Harkin, Wyden, \nRoberts, Rockefeller and Smith, will provide that time with a one-year \nmoratorium on implementation.\n  Hospice is an efficient and cost-effective health care model. Hospice \nprovides individuals at the end of their lives, as well as their \nfamilies, with comfort and compassion when they are needed most. \nHospice care enables a person to retain his or her dignity and maintain \nquality of life during the end of life. An independent Duke University \nstudy in 2007 showed that patients receiving hospice care cost the \nMedicare program about $2,300 less than\n\n[[Page S8481]]\n\nthose who did not, resulting in an annual savings of more than $2 \nbillion.\n  In April 28, 2008, just before the Notice of Proposed Rule Making was \nreleased, a bipartisan group of more than 40 Senators wrote to \nSecretary Leavitt and asked him to stop further action and wait for \nMedPAC recommendations on hospice payment issues. On July 28, 2008, \nbefore the final rule was released, Senators Harkin, Wyden, Roberts and \nI wrote to the White House, to urge them to stop the regulation from \nbeing finalized and to consider the burden that this regulation will \nput on the hospice community.\n  Our repeated requests have been ignored, so we are introducing this \nlegislation to keep CMS from implementing a short-sighted and \nirresponsible cut to end-of-life care. I ask my fellow Senators to join \nme in support of the Hospice Protection Act and to work toward its \nswift passage.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HARKIN (for himself and Mr. Lugar):\n  S. 3485. A bill to require manufacturers to increase the percentage \nof automobiles manufactured for sale within the United States that are \ncapable of operating on higher-level blends of renewable fuels, such as \nethanol and biodiesel, in combination with gasoline or diesel fuel; to \nthe Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, our national energy situation is \ncontinuing to deteriorate. Petroleum and gasoline prices have set all \ntime records, and our oil imports are responsible for an incredibly \nlarge wealth transfer from America to global oil producers. Our most \nimmediate and visible energy challenges are adequate supplies and \nrecord prices for fuels in our transportation sector, but natural gas \nand coal prices also have risen to new plateaus, and these are \nimpacting both electricity prices and manufacturing and delivery costs \nacross our economy and society. We have yet to tackle the problem of \nreducing greenhouse gas emissions, the large majority of which result \nfrom the combustion of fossil fuels. The environmental impacts of \nenergy use, especially from autos and power plants, are still a major \nhealth concern. In short, we need to initiate a major transition of our \nenergy sector, to one that is far more efficient, is much less reliant \non fossil fuels and imported oil, and is utilizing vastly more \ndomestically produced renewable fuels and energy.\n  Americans recognize the magnitude and the urgency of our energy \nchallenges. They rightfully expect us to adopt policies to move this \nenergy transition forward. In particular, we need to reduce dependence \non oil in transportation, and we have broad agreement on two \nfundamental approaches--increasing efficiency of vehicles and \nincreasing use of alternative fuels. However, in expanding the use of \nalternative fuels, we face the challenge of needing both alternative \nfueling stations and vehicles that can use these fuels. The Energy \nIndependence and Security Act of 2007 calls for a brisk expansion of \nthe production and use of biofuels, and it promotes the expansion of \nthe ethanol distribution and sales infrastructure. In parallel, we need \nto rapidly expand the number of dual fuel automobiles, including in \nparticular autos that can be fueled with any blend of gasoline and \nethanol ranging from zero to 85 percent ethanol.\n  Today I am joined by my esteemed colleague, Senator Lugar of Indiana, \nin introducing the Dual fuel Automobile Act of 2008. This bill will \nexpand the number of dual fuel automobiles at a rapid pace while not \nimposing undue production cost challenges or our auto manufacturers. It \ncalls for 50 percent of all light-duty vehicles manufactured for sale \nin the United States to be dual fuel automobiles by 2011. It increases \nthat to 90 percent of all light-duty vehicles manufactured for U.S. \nsales by 2013. These requirements are reasonable because it is known \nthat gasoline vehicles require relatively minor changes in fuel system \ndesigns to be able to use blends of gasoline and ethanol which qualify \nthem for dual fuel designation.\n  This mandate will ensure that the number of dual fuel automobiles in \nour transportation fleet is expanding apace with the expansion of \nethanol production and use in our national fuel supply over the next 15 \nyears and beyond. Taken together, our increasing production of \nbiofuels, our incentives for \ninstallation of alternative fuel infrastructure, light-duty vehicle \nrequirement will provide Americans the option of choosing clean, \ndomestically-produced fuels for their personal transportation needs in \nthe future. This represents a critical component in the transition of \nour energy systems away from fossil and imported fuels toward reliance \non sustainable domestic fuel sources.\n  Today I urge my Senate colleagues to join us in taking action to \nboost the transition to a cleaner, more resilient, and more secure \nenergy economy. I request support for this bill and its rapid \nenactment.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3485\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. ENSURING THE AVAILABILITY OF DUAL FUELED \n                   AUTOMOBILES.\n\n       (a) In General.--Chapter 329 of title 49, United States \n     Code, is amended by inserting after section 32902 the \n     following:\n\n     ``Sec. 32902A. Requirement to manufacture dual fueled \n       automobiles\n\n       ``(a) In General.--For each model year listed in the \n     following table, each manufacturer shall ensure that the \n     percentage of automobiles manufactured by the manufacturer \n     for sale in the United States that are dual fueled \n     automobiles is not less than the percentage set forth for \n     that model year in the following table:\n\n \n               ``Model Year                          Percentage\n \nmodel years 2011 and 2012.................  50 percent\nmodel year 2013 and each subsequent model   90 percent\n year.\n \n\n       ``(b) Exception.--Subsection (a) shall not apply to \n     automobiles that operate only on electricity.''.\n       (b) Clerical Amendment.--The table of sections for chapter \n     329 of title 49, United States Code, is amended by inserting \n     after the item relating to section 32902 the following:\n\n``32902A. Requirement to manufacture dual fueled automobiles.''.\n\n       (c) Rulemaking.--Not later than 1 year after the date of \n     the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Transportation \n     shall prescribe regulations to carry out the amendments made \n     by this Act.\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, A few days ago I returned from a two week \nengagement abroad which included stops at Azerbaijan's oil and natural \ngas rich Caspian Sea coast, through Georgia, Turkey, Romania, Ukraine, \nGermany, and finally to Brussels, Belgium.\n  While my visit was planned well in advance of the conflict between \nGeorgia and Russia, recent events have amplified the importance of \nenergy as a strategic priority in capitals across this region. States \ndependent on Russian gas to fuel their economies and ways of life \nunderstand that turning off the tap may be as effective a weapon as the \ntanks and armies that rolled across Georgia. For example, the Russian \nsuspension of gas supplies to Ukraine 2 years ago spurred significant \ndiscussion of energy security amongst European friends. Yet only modest \nchanges in planning and preparation have occurred. Meanwhile, Russia \nhas aggressively sought to increase its dominance over energy supplies.\n  In the U.S. we are largely dependent on foreign governments for our \ntransportation energy needs, which leaves our own security and \nprosperity in jeopardy. Accordingly, we must attain genuine energy \nsecurity with supplies sufficient enough to grow our economy and \ninsulate us from foreign manipulation. We are fortunate to have the \nmeans to bolster both renewable and conventional energy sources.\n  Realizing this potential will take leadership and vision. Renewable \nenergy offers the greatest hope to wed our energy security needs with \neconomic growth and environmental stewardship. However, one of the \nmajor impediments to expanding renewable energy, such as biofuels, is a \nlack of appropriate infrastructure. Currently our automobile fleet is \nlargely built to run on petroleum based gasoline and up to 10 percent \nethanol blends. This means that even though ethanol makes up a \nrelatively small portion of our fuel source, greater production from \nthe next generation biofuels, such as cellulosic ethanol, will be \nseverely hampered, if not prevented.\n\n[[Page S8482]]\n\n  This is why I join Senator Harkin of Iowa in introducing the Dual \nFuel Automobile Act of 2008. This bill calls for 50 percent of all \nautomobiles manufactured for sale in the U.S. to be dual fuel \nautomobiles by 2011, meaning that the purchaser of the vehicle would \nhave a choice in which fuel they choose to power their vehicle. It \nwould increase to 90 percent of all automobiles manufactured for U.S. \nsales by 2013. Relatively minor and inexpensive changes in fuel system \ndesigns allow blends of gasoline and ethanol to be used dependent on \nthe consumer's choice each time they fill up.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FEINGOLD:\n  S. 3486. A bill to establish the Commission on Measures of Household \nEconomic Security to conduct a study and submit a report containing \nrecommendations to establish and report economic statistics that \nreflect the economic status and well-being of American households; to \nthe Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, our Government agencies collect and \nreport a range of economic information but much of what we see or hear \nis most suited to describing the general state of the country's \neconomy. This information does not reflect what is happening in and \nwhat matters most to our families and the quality of our lives. For \nexample, our national unemployment figures don't tell us that those who \nare employed may not have benefits, or that they are working two or \nthree jobs to earn the income that they report, or that their mortgage \ndebt and college loans are jeopardizing their ability to repay their \ncredit card debt or their medical bills. By knowing and reporting this \nkind of information we can not only more accurately reflect what our \nfamilies are experiencing economically, we can better inform \npolicymakers about what matters most to people and the steps that need \nto be taken to address household economic needs and concerns.\n  To address this need I am introducing the Commission on Measures of \nHousehold Economic Security Act of 2008. The bill would establish a \nbipartisan congressional commission of 8 economic experts to look at \nexisting government economic data and identify the possible need for \nnew information, more accurate methodologies and better ways to report \nthese economic measures to give a more accurate and reliable picture of \nthe economic well being of American households. As part of their \neffort, the Commission will be asked to meet with representative groups \nof the public so that their views are taken into account in the \nCommission's recommendations.\n  In doing this, the Commission will look at such things as the current \ndebt situation of American individuals and households, including \ncategories of debt such as credit card debt, education related loans \nand mortgage payments; the movement Americans between salaried jobs \nwith benefits to single or multiple wage jobs with limited or no \nbenefits with a comparison of income to include the value of benefits \nprograms such as health insurance and retirement plans; the percentage \nof Americans who are covered by both employer-provided and individual \nhealth care plans and the extent of coverage per dollar paid by both \nemployers and employees; the savings rate, including both standard \nsavings plans and pension plans; the disparity in income distribution \nover time and between different demographic and geographic groups; and \nthe breakdown of household expenditures between such categories as \nfood, shelter, medical expenses, debt servicing, and energy.\n  In addition, the Commission will consider the relevance of certain \nnon-market activities, like household production, education, and \nvolunteer services that affect the economic well being of households \nbut are not measured or valued in currently reported economic \nstatistics. As Robert F. Kennedy has famously said, some of our \neconomic indicators measure ``everything in short, except that which \nmakes life worthwhile.'' We need to make an effort to value more than \njust our gross domestic product and sales receipts. We need to better \nmeasure and understand what matters to American households.\n  This effort to improve how we measure what matters in our economy is \nvery much in the Wisconsin tradition of accountable good Government. It \nwas Senator Robert LaFollette, Jr. who, in 1932, introduced a \nresolution requiring the U.S. Government to establish a more \nscientific, specific and accurate set of measures of the health of the \nU.S. economy. From his request, Simon Kuznets, a University of \nPennsylvania economics professor, developed the first set of national \naccounts which form the basis for today's measure of GDP and other \neconomic indicators. Kuznets won the 1971 Nobel Prize in Economics \n``for his empirically founded interpretation of economic growth which \nhas led to new and deepened insight into the economic and social \nstructure and process of development.'' His work was the basis for much \nof the New Deal reform policies. Yet Kuznets specifically acknowledged \nthat his measures were incomplete and did not go far enough to measure \nwhat may really matter. In his 1934 report to the Senate on his \ncompilation of statistics associated with Gross National Product he \nconcluded: ``The welfare of a nation can . . . scarcely be inferred \nfrom a measurement of national income as [so] defined . . . .'' This \nbill is intended to advance these earlier efforts to make our economic \nstatistical measures more reflective of the welfare of our families and \nour nation.\n  The cost of this commission will be fully covered by amounts already \nauthorized and appropriated to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. I urge \nmy colleagues to support my legislation\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID (for Mr. Kennedy (for himself, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Obama, \n        Mr. McCain, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Cochran, and Mrs. Clinton)):\n  S. 3487.

Res. 657\n\n       Whereas celiac disease affects approximately 1 in every 130 \n     people in the United States, for a total of 3,000,000 people;\n       Whereas the majority of people with celiac disease have yet \n     to be diagnosed;\n       Whereas celiac disease is a chronic inflammatory disorder \n     that is classified as both an autoimmune condition and a \n     genetic condition;\n       Whereas celiac disease causes damage to the lining of the \n     small intestine, which results in overall malnutrition;\n       Whereas, when a person with celiac disease consumes foods \n     that contain certain protein fractions, that person suffers a \n     cell-mediated immune response that damages the villi of the \n     small intestine, interfering with the absorption of nutrients \n     in food and the effectiveness of medications;\n       Whereas those problematic protein fractions are found in \n     wheat, barley, rye, and oats, which are used to produce many \n     foods, medications, and vitamins;\n       Whereas, because celiac disease is a genetic disease, there \n     is an increased incidence of celiac disease in families with \n     a known history of celiac disease;\n       Whereas celiac disease is underdiagnosed because the \n     symptoms can be attributed to other conditions and are easily \n     overlooked by doctors and patients;\n       Whereas, as recently as 2000, the average person with \n     celiac disease waited 11 years for a correct diagnosis;\n       Whereas \\1/2\\ of all people with celiac disease do not show \n     symptoms of the disease;\n       Whereas celiac disease is diagnosed by tests that measure \n     the blood for abnormally high levels of the antibodies of \n     immunoglobulin A, anti-tissue transglutaminase, and IgA anti-\n     endomysium antibodies;\n       Whereas celiac disease can be treated only by implementing \n     a diet free of wheat, barley, rye, and oats, often called a \n     ``gluten-free diet'';\n       Whereas a delay in the diagnosis of celiac disease can \n     result in damage to the small intestine, which leads to an \n     increased risk of malnutrition, anemia, lymphoma, \n     adenocarcinoma, osteoporosis, miscarriage, congenital \n     malformation, short stature, and disorders of the skin and \n     other organs;\n       Whereas celiac disease is linked to many autoimmune \n     disorders, including thyroid disease, systemic lupus \n     erythematosus, type 1 diabetes, liver disease, collagen \n     vascular disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and Sjogren's \n     syndrome;\n       Whereas the connection between celiac disease and diet was \n     first established by Dr. Samuel Gee, who wrote, ``if the \n     patient can be cured at all, it must be by means of diet'';\n       Whereas Dr. Samuel Gee was born on September 13, 1839; and\n       Whereas, by designating September 13, 2008, as National \n     Celiac Disease Awareness Day, the Senate can raise awareness \n     of celiac disease in the general public and the medical \n     community: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates September 13, 2008, as ``National Celiac \n     Disease Awareness Day'';\n       (2) recognizes that all people in the United States should \n     become more informed and aware of celiac disease;\n       (3) calls upon the people of the United States to observe \n     the date with appropriate ceremonies and activities; and\n       (4) respectfully requests the Secretary of the Senate to \n     transmit a copy of this resolution to the Celiac Sprue \n     Association, the American Celiac Society, the Celiac Disease \n     Foundation, the Gluten Intolerance Group of North America, \n     and the Oklahoma Celiac Support Group No. 5 of the Celiac \n     Sprue Association.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/12/senate-section/article/S8498-2", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8498]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 658--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT THE \nFORMER CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OF FANNIE MAE SHOULD NOT RECEIVE LAVISH \n                 SEVERANCE PACKAGES AT TAXPAYER EXPENSE\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska submitted the following resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs:\n\n                              S. Res. 658\n\n       Whereas, on September 7, 2008 the Federal National Mortgage \n     Association (Fannie Mae) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage \n     Corporation (Freddie Mac) were placed into conservatorship by \n     the Federal Housing Finance Agency;\n       Whereas the Department of the Treasury has announced that \n     up to $200,000,000,000 of tax dollars will be invested in \n     senior preferred stock of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, with \n     billions more lent to the companies via the Government \n     Sponsored Entity Credit Facility, and invested in mortgage \n     backed securities issued by the companies;\n       Whereas the Federal Housing Finance Agency, as conservator, \n     has all the rights, titles, powers, and privileges of the \n     companies and of any stockholder, officer, or director of the \n     companies, and has been charged with the duty to operate the \n     companies;\n       Whereas media reports indicate that the former chief \n     executive officers of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac may be paid \n     severance packages worth a combined $24,000,000 in pay, \n     bonuses, and benefits;\n       Whereas these chief executive officers presided over Fannie \n     Mae and Freddie Mac in the time that led to a taxpayer-funded \n     rescue and Federal takeover, and should not be rewarded; and\n       Whereas the conservator of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac has a \n     duty both to the stability of the financial markets, and to \n     the best interest of the American taxpayer, whose dollars are \n     being invested in the companies: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the former chief executive officers who presided over \n     the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and \n     the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) \n     during the period that led to a Federal takeover should not \n     be rewarded with lavish severance packages paid for by \n     American taxpayers; and\n       (2) the severance packages of both former chief executive \n     officers should be carefully examined and eliminated or \n     reduced to an appropriate level.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/12/senate-section/article/S8498-3", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8498-S8499]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 5498.
