He \nformerly was the athletic director at UNLV--Jim Weaver, a wonderful \nman. He has done such a great job with that program. The Virginia Tech \nprogram has received such notoriety--positive in recent years because \nof their athletic program. They also have a great academic program.\n  We all pray for the students, faculty members, and the families of \nthe Virginia Tech community and do hope for a speedy recovery of the \nwounded.\n  We pray that America can find the strength, which we will find, to \novercome our grief and outrage as we face yet another tragedy.\n\n[[Page S4460]]\n\n  I think it would be appropriate, Madam President, if the \ndistinguished Republican leader wishes to say something about this \ntragedy, that after he does, I ask for a moment of silence for the \nfaculty, the students, the administration, and everyone in Virginia \nTech--and our country, really.

Madam President, in July of 1944, 11 years before Rosa \nParks became the mother of the civil rights movement, an African-\nAmerican second lieutenant of the U.S. Navy was court-martialed on \ncharges of insubordination for refusing to move to the back of a \nsegregated military bus. Three years later, and 60 years ago yesterday, \nthat second lieutenant was insubordinate to bigotry once again--this \ntime by breaking Major League Baseball's color barrier. His name was \nJackie Robinson.\n  When Dodgers owner Branch Ricky brought Jackie Robinson to the Major \nLeagues, many asked: Why Jackie Robinson? After all, the Negro League \nwas filled with talented players from whom to choose. Many were much \nyounger than Jackie Robinson; some, perhaps, even better athletes. The \nanswer, of course, was integrity, character.\n  Branch Ricky knew that this trailblazing ballplayer would have to be \nboth an athlete and a role model--a role model for African Americans \nand for all Americans--and no one was better suited to that great \nchallenge than Jackie Robinson.\n  When Jackie Robinson crossed the chalk lines at Ebbitt's Field that \nday, he carried the weight of a nation along with him. On one shoulder \nwere the catcalls, obscene gestures, and even threats from fans, \nopposing players, and even some of his own teammates. But on the other \nshoulder were the dreams of Blacks, and all Americans, that our country \ncould one day fulfill its destiny of equality in deeds and not just in \nwords.\n  Jackie's career accomplishments alone would have been enough to earn \nour admiration: Rookie of the Year, 6 All-Star games, Most Valuable \nPlayer Award, and a World Series championship.\n  Yesterday, I was visiting my daughter, and especially my \ngrandchildren, here in the Washington, DC, area. I have three \ngrandchildren here. My 16-year-old grandchild, Mattie, was going to \nhave to give a talk to a group of young people. She said she only \nneeded to talk for a couple of minutes. What could she talk about?\n  I said: Mattie, why don't you talk about Jackie Robinson? Tell them \nwhat a great athlete he was. But he isn't known today because he was a \ngreat athlete and stole home more than any other baseball player and \ndid all the great things athletically; he is famous today because of \nhis integrity. So that is what Mattie spoke to her friends about.\n  Jackie Robinson is now a legend. He taught a generation of African-\nAmerican children that they, too, must be, on occasion, insubordinate \nto injustice whenever they find it, whether on a bus or on a ballfield \nor in a board room. Sixty years later that lesson still rings true, \nfrom Brooklyn to Los Angeles and every town and city in between.\n  America is a better place because of the integrity of Jackie \nRobinson.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The minority leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, when I was a youngster, I became a \nfan of the Brooklyn Dodgers for two reasons. One was because of Jackie \nRobinson. The distinguished majority leader was just referring to his \nhistory-making appearance in a Major League uniform for the first time. \nThe other was for a Louisville teammate of his named Pee Wee Reese. He \nwas the one who made, really, a kind of public display of welcoming \nRobinson amid some of the boos and catcalls he got in the early games \nwhen he first played.\n  Reese went over and put his hand on Jackie Robinson's shoulder. Since \nhe was from the South, I think it was an indication that Robinson was \ncertainly going to be accepted by his teammates and by the rest of the \nleague shortly thereafter and certainly ought to be accepted by the \nfans as well.\n  It was a period during which the character of people was being \nmeasured; the character of Jackie Robinson in being willing to take on \nthis challenge and tear down this barrier for the first time in \nAmerican history, and the character of those with whom he was going to \nbe playing. Would they accept him or would they not?\n  It was a great Kentuckian, Pee Wee Reese, who made it clear that \nJackie Robinson was going to be accepted. It was the beginning of a \ngreat thing that our country did and, of course, was a breakthrough for \nmany of the subsequent developments that occurred over the years in \nimproving race relations in our country. We are proud to honor the \nmemory of Jackie Robinson.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/16/senate-section/article/S4460-4", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4460-S4461]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                      Specialist Michael R. Hayes\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, our Nation owes a debt of gratitude \nto the brave men and women who fight to preserve it, a debt so great \nthat a tribute befitting their sacrifice may well lie beyond our power \nto express it. Nevertheless, I ask the Senate to pause today in loving \nmemory of SPC Michael R. Hayes of Morgantown, KY. He was 29 years old.\n  Specialist Hayes of the Kentucky National Guard died in support of \nOperation Iraqi Freedom on June 14, 2005, when a rocket-propelled \ngrenade struck his humvee while he was securing a roadside bomb site in \nBaghdad.\n  Earlier that year, he had served valiantly in a brutal 30-minute \nfirefight in which 10 guardsmen fought off dozens of Iraqi attackers, \nkilling 26 anti-American fighters.\n  For his actions as a guardsman, Specialist Hayes earned several \nmedals and awards, including the Bronze Star and the Purple Heart.\n  It is certainly sad but perhaps fitting that Mike would be taken from \nus while helping his fellow soldiers. Helping others was one of the \ndefining features of Michael Hayes' life.\n  When Mike wasn't yet 5 years old, he was joined by his little \nbrother, Jamie. Soon after returning home from the hospital, his \nmother, Barkley Hayes, heard newborn Jamie crying in his crib.\n  Before she could get to him, however, Mike met her in the hallway, \nJamie in his arms, saying, ``Mommy, help him to stop crying!''\n  Mike continued to look after Jamie and younger sister Melissa when \nall three served in the Guard's 617th Military Police Company and were \nstationed in Iraq at the same time. His loving relationship with his \nfamily was something Mike cherished.\n  Mike was also part of another family, his soccer family. David \nHocker, a friend that Mike was close to, described Mike's love for the \ngame succinctly: ``I have never in my life met anyone who loved soccer \nmore than that man.''\n  Mike was a member of the inaugural soccer team during his sophomore \nyear at Greenwood High School in Bowling Green, KY, where he was born \nand raised. A leader on and off the field, he helped solidify the \nfledgling program.\n  He wasn't a bad player, either. Mike earned All-Region and Player of \nthe Year honors at Greenwood, and to this day remains the first and \nonly member of the school's Athletics Hall of Fame.\n  According to his coach, Todd Tolbert, Mike was the kind of player \nthat made a coach's job easier. Coach Tolbert wanted his other players \nto watch and emulate his dedication, effort and sportsmanship. In the \nwords of Coach Tolbert, Mike ``reached as far as he could reach, and \ngot there. ``\n  His determination and leadership, Coach Tolbert recalls, helped \nestablish Greenwood soccer's reputation among\n\n[[Page S4461]]\n\nthe students and throughout the region.\n  After graduation, Mike stayed with the soccer program as an assistant \ncoach. Not only did he serve as a role model for the younger players, \nhe also gained valuable coaching experience that could help him reach \nhis goal of becoming a college soccer coach.\n  Mike did all of that on top of attending Western Kentucky University \nand graduating with a degree from the Kentucky Advanced Technology \nInstitute.\n  During this time, Mike learned that nearby Butler County High School \nwas preparing to start a girls' soccer program. Mike jumped at the \nopportunity to become their first ever head coach.\n  The impact that Mike had on the players at Butler County High, and \nthat they had on him, is hard to overstate. One of his players, a young \nlady named Tina Laverack, described him this way:\n  ``He never gave up on any of us,'' she said. ``He thought we all had \npotential in anything. . . I think everyone should have had the chance \nto meet him; they would have loved him.''\n  Mike's friend David Hocker recalled that ``If a girl wanted to work \nextra, he'd come in early or stay late. He spent his own money, buying \nfood for the team or taking them someplace for team building.''\n  Mike's brother Jamie told the Butler County players at Mike's \nfuneral, ``He talked about you guys in his down time more than you guys \nwill ever know.''\n  Mike's commitment to his players knew no bounds. On what would be his \nlast trip home, he spent 12 of his 15 days playing soccer with them.\n  And Mike's influence in his players' lives extended far beyond the \nsoccer field. On more than one occasion, he intervened to help a player \nbe removed from a troubled home or beat an addiction problem.\n  The night before leaving for Iraq, Mike sat down with his players, \naddressing them as his ``ladies,'' like always. He told them he was \ngoing to Iraq because he wanted his players to be able to walk out onto \nthe soccer field and not be afraid.\n  Specialist Hayes joined the Guard in 2002 and completed more than 135 \nmissions, including over 30 actions with the enemy, during his service. \nMG Donald Storm, Kentucky's adjutant general, said he ``epitomized what \nit means to be a citizen-soldier.''\n  CPT Todd Lindner, commander of the 617th Military Police Company, \ncalled Specialist Hayes ``the consummate soldier, always in the right \nplace doing the right thing.''\n  When the battles were over, Mike enjoyed playing soccer and baseball \nwith Iraqi children during his down time. He would bring them Cokes, \nchips and candy. It has even been suggested that with time, he might \nhave started a soccer program for Iraqi children.\n  Soon before he left Kentucky for Iraq for the last time, a friend \nasked Mike in confidence if he thought we really ought to be involved \nover there. Mike told his friend of the women he saw wearing colorful \nclothes and no veil, smiling as they walked down the street.\n  He recounted watching young children running to school with pencils \nand paper and big smiles. ``Yes,'' he told his friend unequivocally. \n``We're doing good there.''\n  Although Specialist Hayes can no longer be with us, or his beloved \nfamily, he is loved and remembered by his mother Barkley, his brother \nJamie, his sister Melissa Stewart, his nieces Charlotte Stewart and \nJocelyn Hayes, and other beloved family members.\n  I want to thank his mother Barkley for sharing her memories of \nMichael with us, and for traveling to the Capitol to meet with me \ntoday.\n  Specialist Hayes struck everyone he met with his selflessness, \ndedication, and devotion to helping others.\n  Although he is gone, the example he set for others won't be \nforgotten. Not by his family. Not by his fellow soldiers. And not by \nthe young children he taught to play his favorite game, whether in the \nrural bluegrass of Kentucky or the desert sands of Iraq.\n  I ask my colleagues to keep the family of SPC Michael R. Hayes in \ntheir thoughts and prayers. I know they will be in mine.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/16/senate-section/article/S4461-1", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4461]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Oregon. I walked \nin on the tail end of his remarks, but he\n\n[[Page S4462]]\n\nand I are going to be on a consistent theme today, and that is, the \nimportance of tax reform. I look forward to reviewing his proposal \nbecause we are all on the same side.\n  The current IRS Code is broken. We, the Congress, need to fix it.\n  This last weekend, I was at a small business in Dallas, TX, called \nthe Manda Machine Company. This small employer employs about 20 people \nin the Dallas area. We talked about the burdens on small businesses \nthat make it harder for them to create jobs. In particular, we talked \nabout the IRS Code and the importance to make it fairer, simpler, and \nflatter.\n  Common sense also tells us we need to make the IRS Code a whole lot \nmore transparent; in other words, ``readily understood,'' ``clear,'' \n``easily detected'' or ``perfectly evident,'' which is the dictionary \ndefinition of ``transparent.'' But according to that definition, it is \nclear the IRS Code fails the transparency test.\n  Now, I believe we ought to continue to let in a little bit more \nsunshine in how the Government operates and how the people's money is \nbeing spent. I think we also need to add a little bit of sunshine to \nhow the Federal Government taxes the American people. The Federal \nGovernment should not be playing a game of ``gotcha'' with the owners \nof the American Government; and that is, we the people.\n  For example, the vast majority of Americans now require professional \nassistance to help fill out tax documents. Why it is the Code is so \ncomplex is simply beyond me. Even taxpayers who want to try to figure \nout how to do the right thing have a hard time doing it on their own \nand require the assistance of lawyers and accountants to try to figure \nout how to comply with the law. Six out of every 10 taxpayers in \nAmerica today require the help of an outside expert to figure out how \nto do their duty when it comes to paying taxes.\n  Families and entrepreneurs alike spend billions of dollars and \nthousands of hours trying to figure out how to comply with the IRS \nCode. In fact, it is estimated taxpayers in America will spend 6 \nbillion hours complying with the IRS Code at an estimated compliance \ncost of $265 billion. This has more than doubled in just over the past \n10 years, and estimates are it will continue to increase at a faster \nrate in the future. This is a statistic that is staggering.\n  The number of pages in the Federal tax rules has exploded by more \nthan 50 percent in the last decade alone. In fact, since the last major \nreform effort in 1986, there have been more than 14,000 changes to the \nIRS Code. The Federal Government and Congress in particular should not \nbe in the business of picking winners and losers when it comes to \ntaxpayers in this country. But that is what an exceedingly complex IRS \nCode does. It provides exemptions, credits to a variety of different \ntaxpayers under a variety of different circumstances, picking winners \nand losers in the process. That is not what the IRS Code should be \ndoing.\n  Changes, we all know, are long overdue. There can be no doubt the IRS \nCode and accompanying forms are burdensome, onerous, and unduly \ncomplicated. The complicated system comes at a cost. Every year, the \nNational Taxpayer Advocate highlights this complexity in one way or \nanother as one of the top 10 problems that taxpayers face when trying \nto figure out how to comply with the law.\n  The IRS Code, as I indicated a moment ago, is full of special \ninterest loopholes. With every year that passes, American taxpayers \nspend more and more time to try to figure out how to comply with these \nburdensome provisions. Taxpayers will also work longer this year to pay \nfor the government--a total of 120 days of their income will be used to \nfund the government. In other words, Tax Freedom Day will not come \nuntil the end of April. That means for the first 120 days of the year \nwe all work for Uncle Sam, and then we get to the fruits of our labor \nthereafter, where we get to keep it, use it on our families, or save \nit, however we may see fit.\n  But this year, taxpayers will work longer to pay for Government than \nthey will work to provide for food, housing, and clothing combined, \nwhich is 105 days, for those three essentials of life--food, housing, \nand clothing.\n  Taxpayers will work longer to pay their Federal taxes--79 days--than \nthey will work to pay for housing, which is roughly 62 days. For health \nand medical care, the estimate is, it takes 52 days to work to provide \nfor those essentials. Transportation is 30 days, and clothing is 13 \ndays.\n  Whatever our tax system, be it a flat tax, sales tax, or income tax, \nit ought to be based on three fundamental ideas: simplicity, fairness, \nand transparency. I think these simple ideas should be our guide in \nreforming and simplifying our tax laws.\n  While comprehensive tax reform may not be right around the corner, \nthe last thing we should do is to raise taxes on families and \nentrepreneurs and let the tax relief Congress passed in 2001 and 2003 \nexpire. So until we come to the time that we can actually simplify and \nmake the IRS Code fairer, the last thing we ought to do is raise taxes \non the American people.\n  But the truth is that is what the new majority in Congress, elected \nlast November, decided to do a month ago. The Senate passed a 5-year \nbudget, with Democrats carrying the day, that effectively raises taxes, \nover the next 5 years, by over $700 billion. Unfortunately, this is the \nkind of tax increase that is the most odious and the most regrettable \nbecause it will not even require Members of Congress to come on the \nfloor and vote for the tax increase so they can then be held \naccountable at the polls.\n  Instead, what Democrats have chosen to do is to have silent tax \nincreases so that when the tax relief that was passed in 2001 and 2003 \nexpires, we will see taxes go up higher than they ever have before at \none time in our Nation's history.\n  I guess it is not good enough that those who are in the top 40 \npercent pay 99.1 percent of all income taxes, and that in 2004, the top \n10 percent paid 70.8 percent of all income tax--an increase from their \nshare of 48.1 percent in 1979.\n  Instead, Democrats in Congress want to see everybody end up paying \nmore. If this trend continues--in a perverse way, the only way \nDemocrats will be able to pay for their plans to grow the Federal \nGovernment is for the rich to grow richer.\n  Instead of raising taxes, we should make the President's tax relief \npassed by a majority of Congress a permanent part of the IRS Code. If \nCongress fails to make the tax relief permanent that has been the \ndriving force in the economy, helping to create 7.9 million new jobs \nsince August 2003--if Congress fails to make this tax relief permanent, \na family of 4 making $65,000 a year would see their tax bill increase \nby 58 percent. Small businesses that file as individuals would see \ntheir taxes increase by 13 percent. Things such as the $1,000 child \ntax, relief from the marriage tax penalty, and the new low 10-percent \ntax bracket put money back into the pockets of working parents, while \nsmall business expensing and dividend and capital gains tax relief have \nhelped America's entrepreneurs expand their businesses and create jobs.\n\n  Then there is perhaps the ugliest tax of all, which is the death tax. \nThis is double taxation, because we all know we pay taxes on income as \nearned. But the death tax, set to rear its ugly head in 2011, will hit \nfamily businesses, farmers, and ranchers alike, forcing many to sell \ntheir farm to pay the IRS. Death should not be a taxable event.\n  The numbers speak for themselves in terms of the progrowth, low-tax \npolicies: 21 consecutive quarters of growth, unemployment at historic \nlows--4.4 percent--and 7.9 million new jobs over the past 3\\1/2\\ years.\n  We should remember the words of former Chief Justice John Marshall, \nwho said:\n\n       The power to tax is the power to destroy.\n\n  The last thing we should do is to destroy this great economy, which \nis literally the goose that has laid all of the golden eggs.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

Mr. President, today I pay tribute to Betty Burger, a \nremarkable public servant and extraordinarily devoted congressional \nstaffer. Betty died on Saturday at the age of 87. Betty was my chief \ncaseworker and my oldest and longest serving staff person. She was \nstill on the payroll as of Saturday.\n  Although I am deeply saddened by her departure, it brings me comfort \nto know this devoted mother, grandmother, and great-grandmother slipped \npeacefully into the hands of her Maker.\n  It is fitting that Betty's loved ones kept vigil at her bedside. For \nnearly 40 years, Betty Burger kept vigil for the people of Iowa. She \nstarted on Capitol Hill working for Iowa Representative Fred Schwengel. \nAfter Congressman Schwengel left office, she worked for an Illinois \nCongressman by the name of Hanrahan for 2 years. Then she wanted to \nwork for an Iowa Congressman again, and she joined my staff on my first \nday on the job in Washington after I was elected to the House of \nRepresentatives in 1974. Since then, for the last 32 years, Betty has \nworked as a congressional staffer for the people of Iowa.\n  If Congress needed any rationale for eliminating mandatory retirement \nage in 1986, Betty Burger is that example. As my chief caseworker, \nBetty earned a lifetime of experience on the job mastering the ins and \nouts of the Federal bureaucracy. Her countless contacts within Federal \nagencies put a face on the so-called faceless bureaucracy. No one knew \nhow to cut through redtape more swiftly and surely. Betty was a \nmasterful detective the way she tracked down disability claims and \nbenefit errors at the Social Security Administration. She decoded the \nmaze of paperwork at the Veterans Affairs Department, and navigated \nByzantine immigration rules for constituents struggling with \ncitizenship, employment status, and deportation issues. Betty Burger \nknew how to cut to the chase at the State Department for Iowans who \nwere traveling, working, or studying abroad.\n  Most of Iowa's 2.9 million residents didn't know Betty Burger \npersonally, but I want them to understand how this dedicated public \nservant made a difference for Iowans. Betty did her job for them with \nremarkable efficiency, tenacity, and integrity. I heard firsthand \ngratitude about Betty's work from individual Iowans nearly every time I \nwent home and held town meetings. Betty also touched the lives of \nIowans and their families through her work to nominate outstanding \nyoung people to our Nation's service academies. She would always talk \nabout what a great group we had this year. Let me tell my colleagues \nsomething about Betty. We always had a great group of academy nominees \nas far as Betty was concerned. These young high school kids and their \nparents had several conversations with Betty as they maneuvered through \nthe nomination process. They were an inspiration to her and she knew \nwith good young people in her academies, such as the ones she helped \nnominate, our country from a national security standpoint would be left \nin good hands.\n  In my office, Betty served as a role model for young staffers and \nseasoned colleagues alike. Her work ethic taught others to keep one's \nnose to the grindstone. Her professional attire taught others \nappearances do make a positive impression in the workplace. Her sharp-\nwitted humor elicited laughter and taught us we could count on Betty to \nput a smile on everybody's face. Her uncanny grasp of cultural trends \nand current events taught others how to embrace aging and use one's \nwork and life experiences for the greater good.\n  I can't talk about Betty without making it clear she was a fiercely \nloyal and proud Republican. She modeled compassionate conservatism each \nand every day she helped an Iowan. Day in and day out, Betty untangled \na knot at a Federal agency for those who may have felt at the end of \ntheir rope trying to get an answer.\n  I often tell Iowans that representative government is a two-way \nstreet. Well, Betty Burger lived and breathed the spirit of \nrepresentative government. She was the capable, no-nonsense person on \nthe other end of the phone who brought thousands upon thousands of \nIowans hope and peace of mind. She paved the street between Iowans and \nthe Federal agencies from which they required service.\n  As her boss, I owe Betty a debt of gratitude for her tireless \ncommitment, unwavering loyalty to this country, to the people of Iowa, \nand to me. As Iowa's senior Senator, I place a premium on constituent \nservice. Betty understood this as well as anyone and exceeded my \nexpectations.\n  As her friend, Barbara and I extend our heartfelt sympathies to \nBetty's family and the loved ones she leaves behind. As they remember \ntheir beloved mother, grandmother, sister, aunt, friend, and neighbor, \nplease know we will dearly miss this classy and spirited Iowan who \nbecame part of our family during her honorable tenure--a lifetime--on \nCapitol Hill.\n  In the last four decades, many Iowans have felt touched by a guardian \nangel when Betty worked her magic on their behalf. May God's blessings \ncontinue to shine upon this guardian angel from Fairfield, IA, as she \nrests in peace alongside her husband John.\n  If I could give some advice to my colleagues, I last saw Betty in \nearly January. If we hadn't been in session in early January of this \nyear, probably the last time I would have seen her would have been \nbefore Christmas.\n  Betty got sick about that time and was going to the doctor. We were \nkeeping in touch with her by phone but always waiting for her to get \nbetter and come back to work. Then, all of a sudden, she got very weak. \nWe actually thought she would come back to work, but she got weak and \nthen suddenly died.\n  My advice to colleagues would be this: I didn't get to see her since \nthat last time she was in my office in January. Don't make the mistake \nI did. I should have been there by her bedside sometime during the \nperiod of her last week in hospice. I am sorry I wasn't. To my \ncolleagues, take a lesson from me: When people are sick, see them. They \nmay not come back to the office as you expect.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of S. 372, which the clerk will report.\n\n       A bill (S. 372) to authorize appropriations for fiscal year \n     2007 for the intelligence and intelligence-related activities \n     of the United States Government, the Intelligence Community \n     Management Account, and the Central Intelligence Agency \n     Retirement and Disability System, and for other purposes.\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, first, let me express my \ndisappointment that we are here under these circumstances. This is not \nthe way we should be handling this important national security \nlegislation.\n  The fiscal year 2007 Intelligence authorization bill should have been \nconsidered by the Senate, in fact, 7 months ago when it was reported \nunanimously by the Intelligence Committee. That is usually the way \nthings are meant to work. For reasons that are still not clear to me, \nit was never brought before the Senate.\n  Because of the importance of this legislation, Vice Chairman Bond and \nI made the Intelligence bill the first order of business this January \nwhen the new Congress convened. We hoped the Senate could act swiftly \non the bill so we could move to the conference with the House, but an \nanonymous hold on the other side prevented us from bringing up the bill \nand passing it by unanimous consent. Again, I am not\n\n[[Page S4464]]\n\nclear what the reason for that might have been, but it was discouraging \nto us and, in any event, it precluded our taking any action whatsoever.\n  Fortunately, Senator Reid understands how important this legislation \nis. So last week he attempted to call up the bill. But even that simple \nmotion to proceed to the bill was blocked, forcing the Senate to invoke \ncloture by a vote of 94 in favor and 3 against.\n  The Senate, after 7 months of delay, is finally considering the \nlegislation that sets the policy framework for the Nation's \nintelligence efforts, but because of the inordinate number of obstacles \nput in the path of the bill to date, the majority leader has been \nforced to file a motion to invoke cloture on this legislation. I agree \nwith him that this is the only way to force the Senate to finally do \nits job and pass this very important bill. It is unfortunate, but it \nhas to happen. This is national security legislation.\n  I strongly encourage all of my colleagues to support cloture so that \nwe can move this bill forward to a conference with the House. I know I \nam joined by my colleague, the vice chairman. I understand that some, \nboth in the Senate and in the administration, have expressed concern \nwith a number of the provisions of the bill. The Office of Management \nand Budget issued a Statement of Administration Policy last Thursday \nincluding a veto threat, and unfortunately that statement ignored \nseveral important developments and several changes Vice Chairman Bond \nand I have proposed in a managers' amendment, which I am going to talk \nabout briefly.\n  The administration complains about the magnitude of the fences and \nother restrictions contained in the classified annex to the bill. They \nignore the fact that the classified annex was drafted last September \nwith a view to having it in full effect for the full fiscal year. Vice \nChairman Bond and I decided in January that the best approach to \nachieve swift passage was to simply bring up and pass the bill as it \nhad been reported unanimously last year.\n  We have always known that many of these provisions have become \noutdated or have been overtaken by events. Of course, they will be \nadjusted, or perhaps dropped, when we go to conference. We have no \nintention of fencing 50 percent of a program with only 4 or 5 months \nleft in this year. Please give us some credit.\n  Perhaps the more important omission in the OMB statement is the \neffort that Vice Chairman Bond and I have made to address, through a \nmanagers' amendment, many of the administration's specific concerns \nwith those legislative provisions. I will run through these provisions \nquickly.\n  As reported by the committee, the bill requires two actions related \nto the public disclosure of intelligence budgets. First, it requires \nthe public release of an overall budget request authorization and \nappropriation, the so-called top line, one number for all intelligence \nspending.\n  The second action is a study and report by the Director of National \nIntelligence on whether the top line for each intelligence community \nelement; that is, the CIA, NSA, et cetera, can always be declassified \nwithout harming national security. This was a recommendation, in fact, \nof the 9/11 Commission.\n  The managers' amendment; that is, the amendment by Senator Bond and \nmyself, struck that requirement for a study and a report on the agency-\nlevel declassification. The study and report alarmed some who believed \nthat declassification itself would cause no harm but worry that it \ncould lead to a ``slippery slope'' of revealing too much information.\n  The managers' amendment returns the bill language to the specific \nstated objective; that is, the declassification of the overall national \nintelligence budget. This is something the Senate has voted for twice \nin the last 2\\1/2\\ years, including last month when it passed S. 4.\n  This concurrent version of the authorization bill includes another \nprovision that has passed the Senate twice but which concerns the \nadministration and some of our colleagues. That provision in section \n108 provides additional authority for congressional committees, \nincluding the Intelligence Committees of both the House and Senate, to \nobtain intelligence documents and information.\n  The managers' amendment modifies section 108 in three ways. First, it \ndoubles the amount of time the administration will have to respond to \nthese priority requests from 15 to 30 days.\n  Second, section 108 currently applies to requests from any \ncommittee--any committee--that has jurisdiction over any part of \nintelligence, not just the Intelligence Committees of full jurisdiction \nin the House and Senate. This amendment will limit the provision to \nrequests from the Intelligence Committees.\n  Third, it would make clear the Intelligence Committee could specify a \ngreater number of days than 30 for intelligence community responses. We \nare not unreasonable people, and if more time is needed, we would, \nobviously, want to be helpful.\n  Let me be clear to my colleagues on other committees with \njurisdiction that touches on intelligence matters, because some of them \nare sensitive about this issue. These changes will in no way limit \ntheir ability to ask for and receive intelligence-related information. \nIn fact, any Senator can ask for such information.\n  The amendment sets up an expedited procedure available to the \nIntelligence Committees, but it does not change existing relations or \nprocedures for obtaining such information for other committees. That \nshould be of comfort. If another committee were to encounter difficulty \nin obtaining intelligence information, they could easily ask the \nintelligence community to request the information under this expedited \nprocedure. It sounds wordy; in fact, it is very easy. I think this is a \nsensible modification to alleviate the concern that the Intelligence \nCommittee would be overwhelmed with requests requiring short turnaround \ntimes. Vice Chairman Bond and I are sensitive to that concern and \nmodified the matter.\n  A second provision of the bill dealing with the provision of \ninformation to Congress is section 304. That section tightens up the \nrequirement for the President to fully inform the Intelligence \nCommittees about intelligence activities, including covert actions. \nSection 304, as reported, requires if the President does not inform all \nmembers of the committee about intelligence activity, the DNI must \nprovide all members with a summary with sufficient information to \npermit members to assess the legality, benefits, cost, and advisability \nof these activities. This is on a case-by-case basis.\n  There was a discussion of this provision during our markup, and the \nadministration has objected that this requirement is too detailed. The \nmanagers' amendment seeks to resolve that objection by providing \ninstead that the DNI submit a classified notice with ``a description \nthat provides the main features of the intelligence activities.'' This \nstandard is sufficiently broad to allow the notification of members, \nbut at the same time protects sensitive sources and methods or ongoing \noperations.\n  Section 310 of this bill, as reported, would establish a pilot \nprogram on access by the intelligence community to information \nprotected by the Privacy Act. This provision was controversial and \nseveral members expressed reservations. We subsequently learned the \nadministration is no longer seeking this authority, so the managers' \namendment strikes section 310 from the bill.\n  Finally, the managers' amendment modifies one of the reporting \nrequirements included in the bill. Section 314 requires a classified \nreport from the Director of National Intelligence about clandestine \nprisons. One part of that provision called for reporting on the \nlocation of any clandestine detention facility. Vice Chairman Bond and \nI agreed this particular information was of such sensitivity it should \nnot be included in this report. The managers' amendment strikes that \none requirement.\n  Mr. President, might I ask before calling up the managers' amendment, \ndoes the distinguished vice chairman wish to speak?\n  Mr. President, will the vice chairman have adequate time to speak?\n  Mr. Bond. Mr. President, if the chairman wishes to offer the \namendment, I will be happy for him to do that. I will talk as long or \nshort as I have the opportunity.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no time limit on the bill at this \npoint.\n\n[[Page S4465]]\n\n                           Amendment No. 843\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I offer the managers' amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from West Virginia [Mr. Rockefeller], for \n     himself and Mr. Bond, proposes an amendment numbered 843.\n\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I am very pleased to join my distinguished \ncolleague, the chairman of the Intelligence Committee, Senator \nRockefeller, in not only bringing before this body the Intelligence \nauthorization bill, S. 372, but also offering the managers' amendment. \nThis is an important first step for the Senate to return to and enhance \nits responsibilities of coordinating oversight and conducting \naggressive oversight of intelligence activities and programs.\n  The committee has not been able to pass an authorization bill in the \nlast 2 years, which means the work that has gone on in the committee \ncannot be reflected in guidance to the committee or in carrying out our \noversight responsibilities.\n  Some Members may recall, others have been informed, that 30 years ago \nthe Senate Select Committee on Intelligence was formed to address a \nserious problem. There had been a complete lack of congressional \noversight of U.S. intelligence operations. Then when we reviewed the \nattacks of September 11, the findings of our committee and the findings \nof the 9/11 Commission confirmed that congressional oversight of \nintelligence was not what it should be.\n  We firmly believe that enacting S. 372 will move us a long way in \nrestoring the Senate's legitimate role in oversight of U.S. \nintelligence. I believe we must be in a position where we can assure \nour colleagues and the people of the United States that the \nintelligence activities necessarily conducted in secret do comply with \nthe Constitution, the treaties and the laws of the United States and \nother mandates and limitations placed on the exercise of that secret \npower.\n  Make no mistake about it, intelligence in this global war on terror, \nwhich has been declared on us by al-Qaida and other Islamic groups, is \none that can only be countered with effective intelligence. \nIntelligence is the most important weapon we have in keeping our \nhomeland safe and protecting U.S. interests and citizens abroad. We \nneed to make sure it is done properly. We need to make sure it is done \neffectively.\n  Having studied the intelligence community and having gone through \nexhaustive reviews over the last 4 years of shortcomings pointed out in \nthe intelligence community operations, we believe we can work with the \nintelligence community and provide necessary legislative support to \nensure that the intelligence activities not only are staying within the \nroad lines--staying on the road in the path--but also being carried out \neffectively. That is why we feel it is tremendously important we pass \nthis legislation.\n  The chairman has pointed out there are concerns that have been voiced \nby the administration about this bill. To be candid, there are some \nprovisions in the bill I do not favor or at least question. I hope in \nthe amendment process and in the House-Senate conference we can develop \na good bill that will be signed into law. But it is important to \nremember--and my colleagues who have expressed concerns particularly \nabout the administration's objections should know--that what has been \noutlined by the chairman in the managers' amendment begins to deal with \nthe major questions they have. The chairman and I have agreed it makes \nsense, for example, to declassify the top line number of the \nintelligence budget.\n  I have talked with leaders in the intelligence community and I said: \nDoes that cause you any problems? They said: No. It is only when you \nget below that. Were you to go down the slippery slope of disclosing \namounts going into particular units or particular programs of the \nintelligence community, you give away vital secrets.\n  This body has twice gone on record and was stated by the chairman and \nthe 9/11 Commission has recommended disclosing the overall number so \nthat the people of America will know whether we are continuing to \nsupport the intelligence community adequately, whether we are \nsupporting it with the kinds of resources needed.\n  In our managers' amendment, we took out a study that would purport to \nlook at the possibility of declassifying further details, other than \nthe top line. We both agreed that should be out. The administration \nalso was concerned about identifying certain sites, and we agreed, and \nin our managers' amendment we will take out any reference or any \nrequirement of identifying those certain sites. The administration also \nwas concerned about the number of people, the manner of informing \nmembers of the committee about certain activities that were highly \nclassified. We are working to remedy that. The administration also had \nconcerns about getting reports filed, the potential for a large number \nof requests being dumped on the intelligence community, and we have \ndealt with that.\n\n  So there are other items the administration has concerns about, and \nwe may be able to address some of those here. We may be able to address \nsome of those when we get to conference, if they still are not properly \nsolved. But I would say one thing. The administration, like every \nadministration, sometimes feels that congressional oversight goes \nfurther than they would like. Well, our job is to conduct oversight, \nand we do so with an aim of improving intelligence, the products that \ncome out, and also ensuring that procedures are properly contained \nwithin the rules of the road, and we will continue to seek those \nlegislative oversight tools.\n  We are going to accommodate the reasonable concerns of the Executive \nin every instance that we can because we want to make sure we don't, \neither by overt or inadvertent action, compromise intelligence sources, \nintelligence methods, or other essential intelligence programs that are \nnecessary for the safety of our homeland and the safety of our troops \nin the field.\n  In addition to the measures contained in the managers' amendment, I \nhave filed nine amendments, some of which overlap with the managers' \namendment that we can discuss on the Senate floor. Some of these may be \nnecessary to ameliorate and alleviate the administration's concerns. We \nwere disadvantaged in filing this managers' amendment because the time \nthat we had to do it was the time when most Members were out of \nWashington, DC, in their home State, which has led to some confusion.\n  I hope everybody who had a first-degree amendment that they wanted \nfiled was able to file it by 2:30. We hope we will be able to deal with \nthose amendments, and also we look forward to a good, robust debate on \nthe floor of the Senate.\n  I hope we will have ready a description, at least for our side, of \nthe provisions in the managers' amendment. Most of the concerns I have \nheard about this bill are concerns that should be alleviated by the \nmanagers' amendment, so I would ask all of my colleagues to read \ncarefully the provisions in the managers' amendment to ensure that we \nhave resolved those concerns.\n  In addition, Senator Rockefeller and I are always willing to discuss \nwith colleagues, in this unclassified setting, the unclassified \nportions and our reasoning for it. Our invitation to Members still \nstands; that if Members want to be briefed on classified portions of \nthe intelligence bill or on matters that cannot be discussed on the \nSenate floor, we stand ready with our staffs to have briefings set up \nin the intelligence facilities to fill them in on questions that they \nmay legitimately have.\n  We will look forward to conducting the debate in the time ahead.\n  I thank the Chair, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Moving America Forward\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, my distinguished counterpart, the Senator \nfrom\n\n[[Page S4466]]\n\nKentucky, Senator McConnell, held a press conference at 2:30, talking \nabout what the Senate has not accomplished this year. I, of course, am \nvery disappointed in that because I thought we had done a lot. I \nbelieve we have produced.\n  The minority talk a lot about their desire to see this Congress pass \nmeaningful legislation. They talk a lot about supporting our troops. We \nhave heard a lot from them about the need to defeat terrorists and make \nthe country more secure. Their actions do not match their rhetoric. In \nfar too many instances, our Republican colleagues say one thing and do \nanother.\n  Last week, the 110th Congress reached its 100th day. In that time, \nthe Senate has passed a series of bills that would move our country \nforward. With bipartisan support, we passed the toughest lobbying \nethics reform legislation in the entire history of our country. With \nbipartisan support, we voted to give working Americans a much deserved \nand long overdue raise in the minimum wage. With bipartisan support, we \npassed a continuing resolution that enacted tough spending limits and \neliminated earmarks for this year. With bipartisan support, we passed \nevery single recommendation of the 9/11 Commission, after it languished \nin the Republican-controlled Congress for 2\\1/2\\ years. With bipartisan \nsupport, we passed a responsible, balanced, pay-as-you-go budget that \nreduces taxes for working Americans and invests more in education, \nveterans, and health care. With bipartisan support, we passed \nlegislation that would fully fund our troops while forcing the \nPresident to change course in Iraq. And, last week, with bipartisan \nsupport, once again, we passed legislation to open the promise of stem \ncell research in a responsible and ethical way.\n  The American people want Congress to put petty bickering aside. This \nis exactly what I believe this Congress has done. It has not been easy. \nMy Republican colleagues have, time and time again, allowed a small \nminority in their caucus to block progress that the American people, \nand a bipartisan majority of the Senate, demand. On every piece of \nlegislation I mentioned, we have had to file cloture.\n  Sadly, on the most important issue facing our country, national \nsecurity, this has been especially apparent. The minority forced us to \ncome up with 60 votes to pass the 9/11 Commission recommendations. They \nrequired the same for the Iraq supplemental bill.\n  Now it appears this same group of Republicans will attempt to block \npassage of the Intelligence Authorization bill, the bill they wrote \nwhen they were in the majority but failed to pass for 2 years. As \neveryone knows, the Intelligence Authorization bill funds the operation \nof 16 agencies of the U.S. intelligence community, including the CIA, \nthe FBI, the National Security Agency, the Defense Department, and all \nthe critical work they do in fighting the war on terror. We are so \nfortunate that we have bipartisan cooperation of the management of the \nIntelligence Committee. Senator Rockefeller and Senator Bond have \nworked closely together. They want this legislation to move forward.\n  This should not be a partisan issue. We had to vote to get 60 votes \nto proceed to the legislation. I said at that time, if you want to \noffer amendments while we are in the 30 hours postcloture time, do it. \nNow I am told the ability for us to get on the bill is going to be \nthwarted by not allowing us to have 60 votes.\n  I was upstairs this afternoon in room 407, getting a briefing on \nissues that are important to our country. It is so important that we \nmove forward on this legislation and support our people who are making \nAmerica safe and secure and protecting our interests all around the \nworld. Sixteen agencies, I repeat, of the U.S. intelligence community \nwant this legislation passed.\n  We are in a battle around the world on terrorism. Shouldn't our \nintelligence community be able to move forward with this legislation? I \nrepeat: It was written by the Republicans. Why would they not let us go \nforward on this legislation? Is it because--I don't know. Is it because \nVice President Cheney thinks he is going to lose a little of his power \ndirecting everything covert that goes on in the intelligence community? \nIs he the one stopping this? Why? Why can't we pass legislation that \nwas written by the Republicans to improve our intelligence operations?\n  This legislation includes essential initiatives that would improve \nour efforts to fight terrorism and control weapons of mass destruction, \nenhance our intelligence collection capabilities, and strengthen \nintelligence oversight. Does anybody dispute that? For 27 years, since \nwe first started doing an Intelligence bill, we passed it every year. \nBut not the last 2 years. Blocking passage of the bill leaves Congress \nsilent on these important matters, dealing with terrorism, weapons of \nmass destruction, intelligence collection capabilities, and \nintelligence oversight. It is so important to pass this bill. This is \nnot a partisan issue. I don't think there are political points to be \nscored on either side.\n  I hope my friends on the other side of the aisle will let this \nlegislation go forward. We have a managers' amendment that Senator \nRockefeller and Senator Bond worked on that would be accepted. I cannot \nimagine why we would be stopped on an Intelligence authorization. I \nhave been told that the word is out, the Republicans are not going to \nsupport cloture on this most important bill.\n\n  My friend, the distinguished Republican leader, pointed out this \nafternoon that we filed cloture a number of times this year. We surely \nhave. We surely have, because there has been a minority of people on \nthe other side who forced us to do this. The bills we passed have been \nbipartisan: Ethics/lobbying reform got a big bipartisan vote; minimum \nwage, big bipartisan vote; the continuing resolution, a big bipartisan \nvote--we had to do that to fund the Government--the 9/11 Commission \nrecommendations, big bipartisan vote; stem cell, big bipartisan vote; \nthe supplemental, a bipartisan vote. Sure, we have had to file cloture \nbecause there has been a minority of Senators on the other side who \nforced us to do that on these bipartisan bills.\n  My friend, the minority leader, is right, we have filed cloture a \nnumber of times. The fact is, his side forced us to do so rather than \nlet us proceed directly to these bills--and this bill. We have been \nforced to jump through a number of procedural hoops designed to block \nlegislation that enjoyed bipartisan support.\n  I will continue to do that. I understand the rights of just a few \nSenators and if a few Senators want to stop us from moving forward, \nthat is fine. But to think that we couldn't get 10 Republicans to \nsupport us on a motion to invoke cloture on an Intelligence \nauthorization bill? That is beyond my ability to comprehend, why the \nRepublicans would stop us from moving forward on an Intelligence \nauthorization bill. I have said they can offer amendments to the bill. \nEven though I thought it was absolutely wrong that we had to vote \ncloture on the motion to proceed, I said, during the 30 hours, if you \nwant to offer amendments, go ahead and do so. ``No.''\n  This is not ethics reform, it is not minimum wage, it is not stem \ncell research, it is not the continuing resolution--it is the ability \nof our intelligence agencies to do their work: the CIA, FBI, NSA, \nDefense Department. I urge the minority to not stop this bill from \ngoing forward. The vote is at 5:30. But that is what I am told is going \nto happen. Their actions, if in fact they follow through on this, are \nnot in the best interests of the American people. Anyone who has been \ntold that they are being stymied from offering amendments is not being \ntold the truth.\n  We will continue to work in a bipartisan manner to move our country \nforward. The bills that passed this body so far this year have been \nbipartisan, with overwhelming support, and, yes, we did have to file \ncloture because a small number of people held us up from moving on this \nmost important piece of legislation.\n  I hope there will be people who will move away from this madding \ncrowd who will not allow us to help these agencies do their work.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). The Senator from Virginia.\n\n\n                         Virginia Tech Massacre\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am joined on the floor by my \ndistinguished colleague, Senator Webb. We wish to address the Senate, \nindeed speak with all America, for we Virginians have\n\n[[Page S4467]]\n\nsuffered today one of the most grievous incidents ever to occur in our \nState or, indeed, in America.\n  I speak to the tragic loss of life and tragic injury of so many \nstudents and faculty at the distinguished and venerable institution of \nVirginia Tech in Blacksburg, VA.\n  All America joins to mourn these young people whose lives of promise \nhave been cut so short, and those injured as they, hopefully and \nprayerfully, recover from their wounds. I must say, I have been \nprivileged to serve in this institution for many years. I served in \nmany other posts of public service in my lifetime. This tragedy, this \ntragedy is an incomprehensible situation, an incomprehensible, \nsenseless act of violence.\n  In time, be it days or weeks, Americans will learn more about the \ncircumstances of today in Blacksburg, VA. For now, however, and forever \nafter, our hearts and our prayers are with the victims, their families, \nand the other students and faculty at Virginia Tech and, indeed, their \nfamilies.\n  Virginians are proud of this historic university. I have known it all \nmy lifetime and how it has served our State and Nation for nearly a \ncentury and a half as an exemplary institution of learning, one that \nhas contributed many fine young men and women to the Armed Forces of \nour United States.\n  For the moment, I simply close by saying that the historic and proud \ntradition of Virginia Tech will carry on. Our State embraces them as \ndoes all America. We will work with them to make sure they can carry \non.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia, Mr. Webb, is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I would like to thank the senior Senator \nfrom Virginia for having taken the initiative to bring this matter \nbriefly to the floor today as we consider other issues.\n  As we have learned more facts about this incident during the time \nthat I was presiding over the Senate, I am sure that over the next day \nor so we are going to learn a lot more that will help us understand, \nperhaps, how this incredibly tragic incident occurred.\n  We will have time to reach out to the grieving families and hopefully \nbegin to heal ourselves and to again regain the confidence and the \nrespect of the people who go to that institution. But I thank the \nsenior Senator for bringing this matter to the floor. I want to \nassociate myself fully with his comments. There is very little I can \nadd in terms of describing the depth of our feelings and our regret \nover the fact that this incident has occurred.\n  It is an incredible human tragedy. As I said, there will be, I am \nsure, many stories over the coming days about how it occurred and the \nimplications of it. But it is very fitting for us to pause for a few \nmoments as we consider all of these other issues that are on the table, \nsome of them which obviously divide us by party, but certainly on an \nissue such as this we are all together in extending our compassion and \nour regrets to the families of those who are involved.\n  This is a great institution. The lives that were lost today were of \nthose people who had in their early days demonstrated an enormous \namount of promise, and we again express our regrets to the families and \nour determination that we will help the people of the community around \nVirginia Tech regain the sense of purpose and vitality once we reach \nmore understanding of what happened.\n  Again, I thank the senior Senator and I thank you, Mr. President, for \nallowing us to stop for a few moments in business today to mention this \nincident.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia, Mr. Warner, is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague. We do recognize, \nboth of us, our gratitude to the bipartisan leadership of this \ninstitution in opening today's session with a prayer and a moment of \nsilence to honor the victims; not only the victims involved but those \nat this great university and throughout the State.\n  I also thank our Governor. Our Governor is en route quickly returning \nfrom a trip to Japan. He has been in contact and received a call from \nthe President of the United States, George Bush. We have talked with \nhis chief of staff throughout the day and have waited until this time, \nuntil such facts have been gathered, the few that are known about this \ntragedy, before addressing the Senate.\n  I thank the Chair. I thank my colleagues.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, before the two Senators from the \nCommonwealth of Virginia leave the floor, let me express to them our \nsympathy and sorrow over the tremendous tragedy suffered in their State \ntoday.\n  A member of my staff has a son who attends this fine institution. \nFortunately, she has learned that he is fine, but you can imagine her \nanxiety as she was waiting to hear from her son and had the television \non hearing the reports.\n  I say to both of the Senators from Virginia that our hearts go out to \nthem, to the members of this fine institution in Virginia, and to those \nwho are affected by this terrible violence.\n  Before I turned to the issue that has brought me to the Senate floor, \nI just want to extend my condolences on behalf of the people of Maine \nto the people of Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia, Mr. Warner, is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague and dear friend from \nMaine. I thank other colleagues who have spoken to me and to my \ndistinguished colleague, Senator Webb. We thank the Senate for its \ncompassion in this matter. Each Senator feels deeply that it could have \nhappened, I suppose, this sort of tragic situation, in any State in the \nUnion. So we are all sharing this tragic moment in the life of America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, can the Chair inform me of whether there \nis an amendment pending at the current time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Only the managers' substitute.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 847 to Amendment No. 843\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 847, which is \npending at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maine [Ms. Collins], for herself, Mr. \n     Lieberman, Mr. Carper, Mr. Coleman, and Mr. Akaka, proposes \n     an amendment numbered 847 to amendment No. 843.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To reaffirm the constitutional and statutory protections \n         accorded sealed domestic mail, and for other purposes)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ___. SENSE OF CONGRESS RELATING TO CONSTITUTIONAL AND \n                   STATUTORY PROTECTIONS ACCORDED SEALED DOMESTIC \n                   MAIL.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) all Americans depend on the United States Postal \n     Service to transact business and communicate with friends and \n     family;\n       (2) postal customers have a constitutional right to expect \n     that their sealed domestic mail will be protected against \n     unreasonable searches;\n       (3) the circumstances and procedures under which the \n     Government may search sealed mail are well defined, including \n     provisions under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of \n     1978 (50 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.), and generally require prior \n     judicial approval;\n       (4) the United States Postal Inspection Service has the \n     authority to open and search a sealed envelope or package \n     when there is immediate threat to life or limb or an \n     immediate and substantial danger to property;\n       (5) the United States Postal Service affirmed January 4, \n     2007, that the enactment of the Postal Accountability and \n     Enhancement Act (Public Law 109-435) does not grant Federal \n     law enforcement officials any new authority to open domestic \n     mail;\n       (6) questions have been raised about these basic privacy \n     protections following issuance of the President's signing \n     statement on the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act \n     (Public Law 109-435); and\n       (7) the Senate rejects any interpretation of the \n     President's signing statement on the Postal Accountability \n     and Enhancement Act (Public Law 109-435) that in any way \n     diminishes the privacy protections accorded sealed\n\n[[Page S4468]]\n\n     domestic mail under the Constitution and Federal laws and \n     regulations.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     Congress reaffirms the constitutional and statutory \n     protections accorded sealed domestic mail.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am calling up this amendment on behalf \nof myself, Senator Lieberman, Senator Carper, Senator Coleman, and \nSenator Akaka.\n  Our bipartisan amendment reaffirms the fundamental constitutional and \nstatutory protections accorded to sealed domestic mail, even as we make \nprovisions for sustaining our vital intelligence-gathering activity in \nthe interests of advancing the goals of protecting our homeland from \nattack.\n  I am very pleased to have the distinguished chairman of the Senate \nHomeland Security Committee, Senator Lieberman, as a cosponsor, as well \nas Senator Carper of Delaware, who was the coauthor with me of the \npostal reform legislation that passed and was signed into law last \nyear.\n  Senator Coleman and Senator Akaka have also been very active on \npostal issues. I have also had the opportunity to talk with the \ndistinguished chairman and the ranking member of the Intelligence \nCommittee about this proposal.\n  For those who may not have followed this issue, let me first provide \nsome brief background. On December 20, President Bush signed into law \nthe Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act that Senator Carper and I \nintroduced last year. This new law makes the most sweeping changes in \nthe Postal Service in more than 30 years.\n  The act will help the Postal Service meet the challenges of the 21st \ncentury, establish a new rate-setting system, help ensure a stronger \nfinancial future for the Postal Service, provide more stability and \npredictability in rates, and protect the basic features of universal \nservice.\n  One of the act's many provisions provides continued authority for the \nPostal Service to establish a class of mail sealed against inspection.\n  Now, let me make very clear, this is not new authority. This is a \ncontinuation of authority that the Postal Service already has.\n  Regrettably, on the day that he signed the Postal Reform Act into \nlaw, the President also issued a signing statement which has created \nsome confusion about the continued protection of sealed domestic mail. \nHe construed that particular provision in our bill to permit ``searches \nin exigent circumstances, such as to protect life and safety.''\n  Now, since that time, the President's spokesman has made very clear \nthat the President's signing statement was not intended in any way to \nchange the scope of the current law. But the statement caused confusion \nand concern about the President's commitment to abide by the basic \nprivacy protections afforded sealed domestic mail. For some, it raised \nthe specter of the Government unlawfully monitoring our mail in the \nname of national security.\n  Given this unfortunate and inaccurate perception, I wish to be very \nclear, as the author of the postal reform legislation; nothing in the \nPostal Reform Act nor in the President's signing statement in any way \nalters the privacy and civil liberty protections provided to a person \nwho sends or receives sealed mail.\n  In fact, the President's signing statement appears to do nothing more \nthan restate current law. By issuing the signing statement, however, \nthe President, unfortunately, generated questions about the \nadministration's intent.\n\n  I am confident the administration does not intend to interpret the \nlaw differently or change the constitutional or statutory protections. \nBut, unfortunately, this is the case, again, of where the President \nstepped forward and issued a signing statement, upon signing this bill \ninto law, that has created concern and confusion where none existed \nbefore. I think it is unfortunate the President did so.\n  Under current law, mail sealed against inspection is entitled to \nconstitutional protection against unreasonable searches. With only \nlimited exceptions, the Government needs a court warrant before it can \nsearch sealed mail. This is true whether the search is conducted to \ngather evidence under our Criminal Code or to collect foreign \nintelligence information under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance \nAct of 1978, perhaps better known as the FISA Act.\n  Exceptions to the warrant requirements of the fourth amendment are \nlimited. When there is an immediate danger to life or limb or an \nimmediate and substantial danger to property, then the Postal Service \ncan search a domestic sealed letter or package without a warrant. Let \nme give you examples of what we are talking about. What we are talking \nabout when we are talking about immediate threats could include wires \nprotruding from a package that gives one the reasonable belief there \nmay be a bomb inside. Another example might be odors or stains that \nindicate the presence of a hazardous material.\n  Americans depend upon the U.S. Postal Service to transact business \nand to communicate with friends and family. If there is any doubt in \nthe public's mind that the Federal Government is not protecting the \nconstitutional privacy accorded their mail, if there is a suspicion \nthat the Government is unlawfully opening mail, then our people's \nconfidence in the sanctity of our mail system and even in our \nGovernment itself will be undermined.\n  That is why I have joined my colleagues in offering this amendment \ntoday. It makes clear to all law-abiding Americans that the Federal \nGovernment will not invade their privacy by reading their sealed mail, \nabsent a court order or exigent circumstances. Any contrary \ninterpretation of the Postal Reform Act is just plain wrong. I think it \nis important that the Senate go on record affirming this basic \nconstitutional privacy--statutory privacy, as well--that Americans have \nalways counted on.\n  Our amendment will do nothing to weaken the vital protections we have \ncreated against terrorist attacks, but it will remove any doubt that \nour fundamental protections of privacy rights have in some way been \nweakened by the signing statement that, unfortunately, the President \nchose to issue.\n  So I urge my colleagues to remove any doubt, to make it clear that \nthe new law, on which we worked so hard for 3 years and which was \nsigned into law last December, does not change this in any way.\n  Again, I thank the chairman of the Intelligence Committee and the \nranking member for their willingness to discuss this issue.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, first, I see the distinguished chairman of \nthe committee and the vice chairman of the committee on the floor. I \ncommend both of them for their excellent work on this legislation. I \nparticularly wish to commend Chairman Rockefeller and Vice Chairman \nBond for the bipartisan approach the two of them have brought to \ntackling these important issues in this session of the Senate.\n  It is extremely important that intelligence is conducted in a \nbipartisan fashion and the chairman and vice chairman have set a model \nin terms of approaching these issues in that fashion.\n  In the 1970s, Members of Congress realized there was not nearly \nenough oversight of our Nation's spy agencies, and this lack of \noversight led to a number of serious abuses. In response to the abuses, \nthe Senate created the Select Committee on Intelligence, on which I am \nproud to serve. Each year, for 29 straight years, our committee has \nproduced an intelligence authorization bill, and this annual \nlegislation has given Congress a means by which to exercise oversight \nof the classified intelligence budget and provide guidance to the \nCentral Intelligence Agency, National Security Agency, and various \nother important intelligence agencies.\n  In 2005 and 2006, regrettably, the Congress failed to pass the \nIntelligence authorization legislation. In my view, this is \ninexcusable. At a time when\n\n[[Page S4469]]\n\nAmericans were questioning our intelligence agencies' ability to keep \nthem safe, the Congress failed to provide the necessary support. At a \ntime when the intelligence community was undergoing major \nreorganization, Congress failed to provide sufficient guidance. At a \ntime when our allies and our own citizens were raising serious \nquestions about our detention policies, the Congress failed to conduct \noversight. At a time when Americans were opening their morning papers \nand reading about the aggressive new forms of Government surveillance, \nsuch as the President's warrantless wiretapping program, the Congress \nfailed to demand accountability.\n  The committee did report Intelligence authorization bills for fiscal \nyears 2006 and 2007, but they were blocked repeatedly by anonymous \nholds. Regrettably, the previous leadership failed to make passing this \nlegislation a top priority. The new leadership of the Senate has \ndecided that ensuring national security and protecting Americans' \nrights and values is a major concern and, as a result, we are now \ndealing with this year's Intelligence Authorization Act, and it comes, \nin my view, to a great extent because of the cooperation of Chairman \nRockefeller and Vice Chairman Bond, who has also assisted me in a \nnumber of critical areas throughout this session of the Senate, for \nwhich I am very appreciative.\n  This legislation contains a number of important provisions which I am \nproud to have worked on with my colleagues on the committee. It \nclarifies many of the authorities of the Director of National \nIntelligence, establishes a new national space intelligence center, and \ncreates a strong independent inspector general for the intelligence \ncommunity. It strengthens congressional oversight by clarifying the \nPresident's responsibility to keep the Congress informed of all \nintelligence activities. In addition, it contains three amendments that \nI offered and that I believe are going to improve the functioning of \nour intelligence agencies.\n  The first of these amendments would make public the total amount of \nthe national intelligence budget. In my view, it is ridiculous to \nsuggest that Osama bin Laden is going to gain some sort of advantage \nfrom knowing that the national intelligence budget is one specific \nnumber or another. But declassifying this number would increase, in my \nview, transparency and public accountability. It would increase public \naccountability without sacrificing the national security needs of this \ncountry and also permit a more informed debate about funding for \ndefense and national security.\n  The second of these amendments which I offered with the distinguished \nchairman of the committee, Senator Rockefeller, would increase \nresources to support the Committee on Foreign Investments in the United \nStates. After investigating the proposed takeover of the management of \nseveral United States ports by Dubai Ports World, I became convinced \nthat the process for approving these foreign purchases did not include \nsufficient due diligence. There ought to be more room in this process \nfor input from the intelligence community, and these additional \nresources that have come about as a result of this amendment I \ndeveloped with Chairman Rockefeller would support that.\n  The last of these amendments would maximize the criminal penalty for \nknowingly and intentionally disclosing the identity of a covert agent. \nLike many Americans, I was shocked and disappointed to learn that \nmembers of the administration exposed the identity of an undercover CIA \nofficer for partisan political purposes. Undercover officers perform a \nvital and demanding service for the Nation, and the very nature of \ntheir work prevents them from receiving public praise or recognition. \nDeliberately exposing an undercover officer for any reason, in my view, \nis unacceptable, and to do it for a political purpose is simply \nreprehensible. This provision will send a message to men and women of \nthe CIA and other human intelligence services that the Congress values \nthem and their work and takes any threat to them or to their identity \nvery seriously.\n  I also note that the version of this legislation that was reported by \nthe Intelligence Committee also creates a new exemption to the Privacy \nAct. In the additional views to the committee report, Senator Feingold \nand I expressed our view that the impact of this provision had not been \nconsidered carefully enough. I am pleased the managers' amendment \nprepared by Chairman Rockefeller and Vice Chairman Bond removes this \nprovision and, in my view, that is going to make our conference with \nthe House of Representatives easier.\n  In sum, I am pleased with the work--the bipartisan work--our \ncommittee put into this legislation, and I hope the Senate will support \ncloture this afternoon. This is extremely important legislation. It \nought to be passed on a bipartisan basis. It should not be subject to a \nfilibuster. Congress has surrendered its national security \nresponsibilities for too long and too often, and it is time for the \nCongress to stand up and do its job.\n  Chairman Rockefeller and Senator Bond have made it possible for the \nSenate Intelligence Committee to bring this legislation before the \nSenate. I am very hopeful this legislation will move forward today and \nthat the Senate will support cloture.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Oregon for his kind \ncomments. As I said earlier today, we are most grateful to the \nleadership for having brought up S. 372. This is a very important and \nnecessary first step for the Senate to return to its responsibility of \nconducting oversight of U.S. intelligence activities and programs. \nEnacting S. 372 into law will help restore the Senate's legitimate role \nin oversight of U.S. intelligence.\n  As I said, the administration has voiced some concerns about \nprovisions in the bill, and the chairman and I have made a good-faith \nattempt to address those concerns. We have a managers' amendment, plus \nseveral other amendments on which the chairman and I agree that we \nthink are legitimate and measured modifications that don't change the \nbasic purpose of our provisions but meet some of their objections.\n  As I said before, there are provisions in the bill that we do believe \nneed such changes. Should any Member, however, feel we have not gone \nfar enough, we invite them to come to the floor and join in the debate.\n  Is S. 372 perfect? I have never seen a piece of legislation that was \nand don't expect to see one. That being said, we should all remember \nthat the perfect is the enemy of the good. There is no such thing as \nperfect legislation. We can today, however, begin the process of \nimproving our oversight with a good piece of legislation.\n  Again, will the administration agree with everything in the bill? No. \nOn the other hand, I do not remember many times in my political career \nwhen any executive branch has invited the legislative branch, \nCongress--or a State legislature with which I am also familiar--to \nconduct rigorous oversight of its actions and policies.\n  Unfortunately for executive branch officials, that is our \nconstitutional role as laid down by the Founding Fathers. It does not \nmean we will refuse to accommodate the executive branch's legitimate \nconcerns. After all, the President does have the power to veto any \nlegislation that he feels unduly intrudes upon his authority.\n  In an effort to ensure the administration's concerns are addressed, I \nhave filed an additional nine amendments to S. 372, some of which \noverlap with the managers' amendment the chairman and I have presented. \nI believe the chairman and I are in agreement on almost all of these \namendments, if not all of them. Through that process, I think we can \nalleviate the concerns the administration has with the bill.\n  I am concerned, however, that the process by which we had to draft \nthe managers' amendment, combined with the fact that the preparation \nhad to be undertaken largely when Members were in their home State, has \nled to some confusion among our colleagues. That is why we are handing \nout a one-page summary that I hope all Members will review so they \nunderstand how this measure has been changed. We will be happy to talk \nwith them privately or discuss it with them on the floor, and our \nstaffs are available to work with their staffs if they have any other \nconcerns.\n\n[[Page S4470]]\n\n  I also want to make it clear to all of my colleagues that I support \nfull and open debate on S. 372 and the timely consideration of all \ngermane amendments. We ask that the amendments be germane. We would \nhave great difficulty in conferencing this bill on nongermane \namendments and the possibility that they would be accepted in the final \nreport I would say is doubtful. If confusion over the amendment filing \nprocess has prevented any Senator from getting a germane amendment \nconsidered, I will certainly work with that Member to see if we could \nget the amendment brought to the floor for consideration.\n\n  Again, I thank my chairman who has worked in a very cooperative \nmanner. We are seeking to achieve a good bipartisan consensus on how we \nin this body exercise our very important constitutional role of \nproviding oversight for a critically important factor in our \nresponsibility, and that is oversight and legislation with respect to \nthe national intelligence program and the intelligence community which \nadministers it.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Stabenow). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, in essence, what I will do is \nrepeat what my valued and distinguished vice chairman said. It is a \nfact of life. The vice chairman and I have both been Governors. It is a \nfact of life that Governors don't like to have oversight. They don't \nget it. The legislatures don't get it. They get it by the people every \n4 years.\n  It is a little different here. The President sends legislation. We \nlook at it. It gets passed or not. But the country is so huge, and \nthere are innumerable problems, none of which are more important than \nthe national security. It is incredibly important not just to take the \nPresident's decision and assume that it is right. Maybe that works at \nthe State level, but it doesn't work here.\n  We have an absolutely sacred obligation--and in this case a life-and-\ndeath obligation--to review, to do oversight, to ask questions, to call \npeople in and to have closed hearings. We have endless numbers of \nclosed hearings which are attended by members of the committee. \nSuddenly, this committee has come together, it is alive, and this sense \nof oversight is felt and appreciated by the intelligence community.\n  This single sheet of paper which every single Member will get when \nthey come to the Chamber shows how Vice Chairman Bond and I, working \ntogether as we always do, made five major amendments to try to \naccommodate the administration with respect to the managers' amendment, \nwhich is the pending amendment. We worked those through very carefully, \nwe agreed upon them, and they are now before us.\n  Then there is a separate list of five more individual amendments \nwhere we try to be responsible and responsive. That is all we can do.\n  The great sadness to this Senator over the past several years has \nbeen the inability of the Intelligence Committee to do oversight. That \nis our obligation. We need to know what is happening. There are certain \nareas which become so sensitive that it may be that only the vice \nchairman and I can be informed. People grumble about that, and so be \nit. That is national security protection. But we have to know what is \ngoing on, and that is the purpose of this legislation.\n  It has been a long time coming. The majority leader has spoken to \nthat point. I recommend to my colleagues who come to the Chamber to \nvote that they take a look at this paper.\n  We have worked to try to accommodate the administration's objections. \nI am sure we have not accommodated all of them, but we have addressed \nsome important ones without in any way interfering with our ability to \ndo proper oversight.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, will the Senator yield to me, without \nlosing his right to the floor, to make an announcement of some \nimportance?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Yes.\n\n\n              Postponement of Judiciary Committee Hearing\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I just arrived back in Washington about \nan hour ago. I was on a flight for a number of hours and heard the \nhorrific news of the tragedy at Virginia Tech. We had scheduled \ntomorrow morning before the Senate Judiciary Committee a hearing with \nAttorney General Gonzales. I have discussed this with the ranking \nmember of the Senate Judiciary Committee, my friend Senator Arlen \nSpecter of Pennsylvania, and I called the Attorney General and spoke to \nhim. All three of us agree--and they agree with my proposal--that we \nwill postpone that hearing.\n  The hearing with the Attorney General will not be held tomorrow. We \nwill postpone it until Thursday. The exact time we are working out. The \nAttorney General certainly was agreeable to that. I am sure he would \nwant to be dealing with the matters of the shooting. Both Senator \nSpecter and I felt this is a matter where our whole Nation is going to \nbe grieving tomorrow and many individual Members in both bodies will be \njoining in that grieving and that concern for the families, for the \nvictims of this horrible, horrible tragedy.\n  So the Judiciary Committee, I have decided, will not hold its \nhearing. It will be held Thursday.\n  I thank my friend from West Virginia for yielding to me so I could \nmake that announcement.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, I thank the Senator and yield to \nthe Senator from Massachusetts such time as he may require.\n\n\n             EXPRESSION OF SORROW FOR VIRGINIA TECH TRAGEDY\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, with a heavy heart, I rise to express \nmy tremendous sorrow for the growing number of victims impacted by a \nterrible tragedy on a Virginia college campus today.\n  My deepest condolences and prayers go out to the students, faculty \nand their families at the Virginia Tech campus who have been affected \nby this horrific crime, especially those who lost loved ones.\n  The Nation is stunned by the loss of so many young lives. The tragedy \nis felt all the more because these were young people--children in the \nprime of their lives, with so much to offer--and who gave so much to \ntheir families-- and now they are gone. They were sons and daughters, \nbrothers and sisters, friends and neighbors. They were a part of all of \nus--and we will feel their loss. There will be time to debate the steps \nneeded to avert such tragedies. But today our thoughts and prayers go \nto their families.\n  Today, the world weeps for the victims at Virginia Tech. Our thoughts \nand prayers are with you.\n  I thank the good Senator from West Virginia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/16/senate-section/article/S4470-1", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4470-S4471]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       COURT SECURITY IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2007--MOTION TO PROCEED\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  Mr. REID.

Madam President, I rise to oppose cloture on the \nIntelligence authorization. There are plenty of things wrong with this \nbill, but our primary objection, once again, is the way it is being \nhandled on the floor.\n  The Democratic majority has filed 21 cloture motions so far this \nsession. At this rate, we will have 160 cloture motions by the end of \nthe 110th Congress. This would shatter the old record of 82 back in \n1995 and 1996.\n  The purpose of filing cloture early is to end debate and accelerate \nthe passage of a measure, but abusing this privilege has the opposite \neffect. If the minority is shut out of the debate, it will block \nparticipation until their Members are respected and their voices are \ngiven an opportunity to be heard. We have seen this happen again and \nagain over the last 3\\1/2\\ months as the majority has repeatedly \nstruggled and failed to move legislation.\n  Republicans take no joy in this, but we will continue to defend our \nright to be heard. The Senate, as we have learned over the years, is \nnot the House. Contrast this torpid pace of legislation in this \nCongress with the first 3\\1/2\\ months of the last one, when Republicans \npassed some of the most far-reaching civil justice reforms in decades. \nRepublicans knew that the price of passing laws was to work with the \nminority, to have an open debate, and to vote on amendments the other \nside had to offer.\n  On bankruptcy reform, for example, we allowed 30 votes, including \nfinal passage. On this date, in the first session of the 109th \nCongress, Republicans had filed only four cloture motions. Looking back \nto the previous Congress on this date, we had only filed four cloture \nmotions. We have had 21 filed by the new majority.\n  On this date in the first session of the 108th Congress, we had filed \n5 cloture motions, as compared to 21 at this point with the new \nmajority. On this date in the first session of the 107th Congress, we \nhad only filed one cloture motion.\n  I think the message is pretty clear. I started this session by \nexpressing the hope that we would do big and important things for the \ncountry. The realities of divided Government and the rules of the \nSenate make that supremely possible, and I thought the bipartisan \nmeeting we had that first week in the Old Senate Chamber was a sign of \ngood things to come. I still have that hope, and I see a real \nopportunity opening with the early steps the majority leader has taken \non immigration reform. We are going to that the last 2 weeks before the \nMemorial Day recess. I think that is a good thing. I commend him for \nit.\n  It is my hope that this trend of limited debate and limited \namendments--which, of course, leads to the limitation of minority \nrights--will soon come to an end. Madam President, 3\\1/2\\ months is not \nthat long a time. We can still correct course and accomplish very \nimportant things for our country.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order and pursuant to rule \nXXII, the clerk will report the motion to invoke cloture.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     hereby move to bring to a close debate on Calendar No. 20, S. \n     372, the Intelligence Authorization bill of 2007.\n         Harry Reid, Chuck Schumer, Russell D.

Benjamin Nelson, S. \n           Whitehouse, Byron L. Dorgan, Blanche L. Lincoln, Ron \n           Wyden.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. By unanimous consent, the mandatory quorum \ncall has been waived. The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate \nthat debate on S. 372, a bill to authorize appropriations for fiscal \nyear 2007 for the intelligence and intelligence-related activities of \nthe United States Government, the Intelligence Community Management \nAccount, and the Central Intelligence Agency Retirement and Disability \nSystem, and for other purposes, shall be brought to a close?\n  The yeas and nays are mandatory under the rule. The clerk will call \nthe roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Delaware (Mr. Biden), \nthe Senator from Connecticut (Mr. Dodd), the Senator from Iowa (Mr. \nHarkin), the Senator from South Dakota (Mr. Johnson), the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kerry), the Senator from Louisiana (Ms. Landrieu), \nthe Senator from New Jersey (Mr. Lautenberg), the Senator from Florida \n(Mr. Nelson), and the Senator from Illinois (Mr. Obama), are \nnecessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from Iowa \n(Mr. Harkin) and the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kerry) would each \nvote ``yea.''\n  LOTT. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator from \nKansas (Mr. Brownback), the Senator from Mississippi (Mr. Cochran), the \nSenator from Wyoming (Mr. Craig), the Senator from South Carolina (Mr. \nDeMint), the Senator from Nevada (Mr. Ensign), the Senator from South \nCarolina (Mr. Graham), the Senator from New Hampshire (Mr. Gregg), the \nSenator from Florida (Mr. Martinez), the Senator from Arizona (Mr. \nMcCain), and the Senator from Kansas (Mr. Roberts).\n  Further, if present and voting, the Senator from South Carolina (Mr. \nDeMint) would have voted ``nay.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 41, nays 40, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 130 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--41\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Brown\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Cardin\n     Carper\n     Casey\n     Clinton\n     Conrad\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Inouye\n     Kennedy\n     Klobuchar\n     Kohl\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     McCaskill\n     Menendez\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Rockefeller\n     Salazar\n     Sanders\n     Schumer\n     Stabenow\n     Tester\n     Webb\n     Whitehouse\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--40\n\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Bunning\n     Burr\n     Chambliss\n     Coburn\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Corker\n     Cornyn\n     Crapo\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Enzi\n     Grassley\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Isakson\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Reid\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n\n[[Page S4472]]\n\n\n     Sununu\n     Thomas\n     Thune\n     Vitter\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n\n                             NOT VOTING--19\n\n     Biden\n     Brownback\n     Cochran\n     Craig\n     DeMint\n     Dodd\n     Ensign\n     Graham\n     Gregg\n     Harkin\n     Johnson\n     Kerry\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Martinez\n     McCain\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Obama\n     Roberts\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On this vote, the yeas are 41, the nays are \n40. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn not having voted \nin the affirmative, the motion is rejected.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion is entered.\n  The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, I have to declare myself absolutely \na series of things: furious, double-crossed, misled, minimized--in \nterms of my role as a Senator and as chairman of the Intelligence \nCommittee--shocked by the arrogance of the technique that was used \nbetween the White House and the minority leader to say to Republicans, \nafter weeks in which Vice Chairman Bond and I worked out a compromise \non a managers' amendment on which we worked in good faith--I dropped \nthings he did not like, he dropped things I did not like--but it was a \ngenuine effort.\n  Vice Chairman Bond, whom I respect greatly, stood here praising the \nmanagers' amendment. Then the word came down from the White House--not \nfrom Vice Chairman Bond but from the White House--through the minority \nleader, that this vote was to be a test of Republican Party loyalty and \nthat therefore all Republicans were instructed to vote against it.\n  In all of my years in the Senate, and certainly all of my years on \nthe Intelligence Committee, I have never seen something so repugnant, \nputting politics over national security. That is the bottom line. \nPolitics was put over national security.\n  An order came down: This is a test of Republican Party loyalty. When \nit comes to that, by golly, you put politics over national security.\n  Thirty-one people, at least, died at Virginia Tech University this \nafternoon. All of my kids went to camp there. I know a number of \nstudents down there. I called to find out that they were OK, and there \nwas grief everywhere. Republicans were standing up, Democrats were \nstanding up expressing they were horrified.\n  I was just trying to figure out how many intelligence agents, how \nmany soldiers--because of inadequate intelligence or because of some \nslip-up or something we had not done, something which we were prepared \nto correct or did correct in the managers' amendment--died, and I \nsuspect the number was essentially greater than 31.\n  Now, my heart goes out to those 31. I know some of them who were \nspared. I was in despair until I knew they were OK.\n  But this act of cynicism, this act for the third year in a row, \nblocking intelligence legislation is beyond me. We all understand \nnothing can happen in military action without intelligence leading the \nway in; to scout out the territory, to get the feeling, to get through \nlanguage skills, et cetera, to get the feeling of what is going on so \nwe know what we are getting into.\n  I will not get into the importance of intelligence for Iraq or \nAfghanistan, but this is a real crusher. I am not shocked or \ndiscouraged with the intelligence. I am more fired up than ever on \nintelligence. I am shocked because something like this happens in the \nUnited States Senate for any reason at any time. I have been in this \nbody for 24 years.\n  I have been in this body for 24 years, and on one occasion a majority \nleader called me at home--I happened to be shaving, and it was not a \nconvenient phone call--and asked me to vote against a particular piece \nof legislation, which I was going to vote against in any event. That \nhas never happened since then. Not once have I been instructed by my \nparty or by my minority or majority leader to vote a certain way.\n  Yet when it comes to national security, to funding intelligence \nagencies, where we change the authorities, where we spent weeks in \ntrying to work out hard problems, and did so in the managers' \namendment, with more amendments to come, which we would have agreed to, \nto alleviate the White House's concern--the White House decided they do \nnot like oversight. Well, I understand that. When I was a Governor, I \ndid not like oversight. Nobody likes oversight, but it is our \nconstitutional responsibility. We do not have that choice. We have that \nduty.\n  One of the great things about the Intelligence Committee is it has \ncome together in recent months to accept this responsibility and to \nreach out and take hold of it with a vigor and a lust that makes us \nwant to do more--but not to overdo but to do. Then along comes this \nvote.\n  It certainly is the most disappointing day, the most disappointing \nvote, the most disappointing sign of where we are in this country--the \nmost disappointing sense of the relationship between the executive \nbranch and the legislative branch--the failure of the realization we \nexist for a reason, that we work hard, getting ready for this vote \nbecause we had a chance to do it. Then comes down the instruction: No. \nPolitics trumps national security. Prove you are a loyal Republican. \nVote no.\n  It is not a good day in the Senate.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I was fortunate enough to serve on the \nIntelligence Committee for 4 years and served with the Senator from \nWest Virginia, as well as the Senator from Missouri. It is one of the \ntoughest assignments in the Senate. It is time consuming. It is \ndemanding. It takes a long time to even understand the nature of our \nintelligence community and the valuable work they do.\n  I salute all members of the Intelligence Committee on both sides of \nthe aisle for sticking with it. They do not get a lot of public \nattention because these hearings and deliberations are behind closed \ndoors. This is classified information. It is critically important for \nthe security of the United States of America that this Intelligence \nCommittee work and work closely with the intelligence agencies.\n  I want to say a word on behalf of the chairman of this Intelligence \nCommittee on the Senate side, Senator Rockefeller. I cannot think of a \nperson who has put in more time--certainly on our side of the aisle but \nin the Senate--dedicated to doing this job right. It must be next to \nimpossible to keep up with everything else he has to do, but he has \ndedicated himself to this. I know how much this bill means to him.\n  This reauthorization bill for the intelligence agencies is critically \nimportant to him personally, but, more importantly, it really means so \nmuch for our Nation. If our intelligence does not get it right, we are \nmore vulnerable. If we are more vulnerable, it means that not just \npeople living in Springfield, IL, but our troops in the field are more \nvulnerable. So he has worked overtime to bring this intelligence \nauthorization bill to the floor in a spirit of bipartisanship, as he \ndescribed.\n  This amendment, which was just stopped by this procedural motion, is \na bipartisan amendment. It is from both the chairman of the committee, \nSenator Rockefeller, and the vice chairman of the committee, Senator \nBond--Democrat and Republican. I believe him when he says he has worked \nin a spirit of compromise to try to find a reasonable position.\n  Now, when we offer this amendment, this substitute amendment, to the \nSenate, and say, if you have something you want to offer to improve \nit--Senator Reid said that earlier--I cannot think of a fairer way to \napproach an issue, which should not be political at all.\n  One amendment was offered. It is my understanding only one amendment \nwas offered. It looked like we were finally going to get this \nreauthorization of intelligence agencies that are so important for our \nsecurity. Along comes this procedural vote, which should have been a \ntoss-away vote. It ends up virtually stopping the debate on this \ncritical bill. Why? I cannot understand it.\n  We have said: Offer your amendments, and only one amendment was \noffered. Senator Rockefeller has worked with the Republican side of the \naisle for a bipartisan approach. You have given; the other side has \ngiven. It\n\n[[Page S4473]]\n\nwas a good spirit of compromise, cooperation. That is what people want. \nCertainly, when it comes to the security of our Nation, you do not \nexpect us to come in as Democrats and Republicans. We have a lot more \nresponsibility.\n  So what happened now? When we tried to bring this to a point where it \ncould pass, where the amendments would be limited to the most germane \namendments that really get to the heart of the issue, the other side of \nthe aisle, voted no, and now we are stuck.\n  They knew what they were doing. They were trying to kill this bill. \nBut why would they want to stop this bill? This is a good bipartisan \nbill essential for the security of America that had been arrived at in \na bipartisan manner, and they stopped it. I do not understand that.\n  I salute Senator Rockefeller for his leadership. I understand his \nfrustration. Certainly, the people who depend on us in the Senate, in a \nbipartisan fashion, to keep America safe were let down by this vote \nwhere the overwhelming majority of Republican Senators voted no.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders). The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I came here earlier today anticipating there \nwould be Republicans who would rise above the partisan clamor. I \nlooked, as the vote was being cast: no, no, no, at the people I thought \ncould do this.\n  Sixteen agencies are all responsible for gathering intelligence \ninformation for our country.\n  Mr. President, let's call it the way it is. Vice President Cheney \nruns the intelligence operations of this administration. He has for 6 \nyears. It apparently is not going to stop. We could not even improve \nthe intelligence-gathering operations for the 16 agencies because it \nmay interfere with the Vice President.\n  Mr. President, even the vice chairman of the committee voted against \nmoving forward. I heard his conversation with the chairman, why he was \ndoing this--because he had been asked to do it. We have had experiences \nin the past with the way the Republicans--everybody, hear that--have \nhandled the intelligence-gathering information for our Nation. The \nSenate had to be closed using rule XXII to get some minimal information \nhow the evidence was manipulated to take us to war in Iraq, and we got \nsome of that information.\n\n  There has been a change in the leadership of the Senate. I was \nhopeful it would be better, and it has been for 3 months. There has \nbeen cooperation between the two Senators, the chairman and vice \nchairman. We are not dealing with--we have had to invoke cloture on \neverything we have done here because, as I said earlier today, I \nthought a minority of Republican Senators was standing in the way of \nour doing what we have done--minimum wage, stem cell, all that stuff.\n  But here we are dealing with our spies. That is what they are. We \nknow from the situation where there has been an indictment and \nconviction that the White House was involved in that up to their neck \nwith the ``Scooter'' Libby matter. Karl Rove appeared before the grand \njury on three or four or five occasions trying to extricate himself. \nThe President said anyone who had anything to do with leaking \ninformation would be dumped from the administration quickly. Of course, \nthat has not happened. I guess there is nothing in the minds of Karl \nRove and his minions that is not politics--even the spy operations of \nthis country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, there have been some insinuations which have \nbeen thrown around on the other side. Let me be clear. This was not a \ncloture vote on the managers' amendment. This was a cloture vote on the \nbill. Many Republican Senators had asked to have an opportunity to \noffer amendments. Some 35 amendments have been submitted. The time for \nsubmitting the amendments shut off at 2:30 today, and we have at least \n10 or so Senators who could not get back here.\n  Now, this bill is a good bill. But we have no reason, before we even \nstart work on the bill, to invoke cloture to shut off amendments. \nNobody from the White House told us to do that. We have Republican \nSenators who wanted to have an opportunity to offer amendments and \nvote. This is a critically important bill for the intelligence \ncommunity, and I believe we need to work on it at least a couple of \ndays. Is that too much to ask, that we work on it a couple of days?\n  I know the leader has entered a motion to reconsider. And if there is \nany sense--if there is any sense--that there is dilatory action, if \nthere is any sense that we are not moving quickly on this bill in very \nshort order, I would join with him and urge my Republican colleagues to \ndo so to move this bill forward. This bill is one that has to pass if \nwe are to get our legitimate congressional oversight.\n  I am not going to get into the arguments between the leaders on how \nmany times we have invoked cloture. But on this one--this one--I gladly \nurged everybody to vote for cloture to proceed to the bill. There may \nbe some in the executive branch who did not want us to. There may be a \nlot of provisions in the bill on oversight that the executive branch \ndoes not want. I believe we have a responsibility--a responsibility--to \nconsider this carefully.\n  Reference has been made to a number of things that were inaccurate. \nThere was a reference made to having to shut down the Senate to get a \nprocess moving in one of the second-phase investigations. The staff \nwork had essentially been completed. The staff, under bipartisan \nleadership, had worked on getting that done. Shutting down the Senate \nwas a great show, but it did nothing to move forward that particular \nphase of the investigation.\n  Now, I want to see this committee--and I hope this body--operate on a \nbipartisan basis. But I was very disappointed when I saw that cloture \nhad been filed before we even started the process of amendments. \nCloture is necessary when you see there is a filibuster or you see \nthere are nongermane amendments. some of the amendments are nongermane \nand I will ask that they be withdrawn or I will join in a tabling \nmotion, but I think this subject, which has not been debated on the \nfloor sufficiently in recent years, should be open to a thorough \ndebate. We don't want to take up a lot of time. We need to get this \nbill to the House and work with them to get a good Intelligence \nauthorization bill through.\n\n  The insinuation that we got an order from the White House is \nabsolutely without basis. They are working with us in a cooperative \nway, and I hope to move forward on this bill, which is now open for \namendment and debate. I look forward to the opportunity to proceed with \nthat debate and votes on the bill.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have the greatest respect for the senior \nSenator from Missouri, but his facts are all messed up. We tried to \nbring this bill to the floor for a full debate. In the Senate, as \neveryone knows, you have to move to proceed to the bill. We did that. \nThey objected. We had to file cloture on even being able to proceed to \nthe bill. They initially said: We are not going to give you cloture. \nThen they gave us cloture. The purpose of that was to stall for time. \nThey voted to proceed. I said immediately: Why waste the 30 hours? The \nrule in the Senate is you have 30 hours after you complete the cloture. \nI said: Offer amendments during this period of time. Don't waste the \ntime. We could have done that last week. I told everybody. All the \nstaff knew that: But no, nothing. I indicated we would be happy to do \nrelevant amendments on this bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent now that there be four relevant amendments in \norder for each side and that when they are disposed of, the Senate move \nto final passage of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I apologize.\n  Mr. REID. I will repeat the request. I ask unanimous consent that \nthere be four relevant amendments in order for each side and that when \nthey are disposed of, the Senate vote on final passage.\n  Mr. BOND. Reserving the right to object, we have 35 amendments. There \nare 10 amendments which I believe have the support of the chairman and \nthe vice chairman. I will be happy to work tomorrow with the leaders, \nwith the chairman, to develop a list of amendments and get a time \nagreement. But\n\n[[Page S4474]]\n\nthe whole purpose was to move this bill forward and find out what \namendments are coming from both sides. I don't know about amendments \nfrom people who are not here.\n  I object to that proceeding.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, let me say, it is a funny way of wanting to \nmove forward on this bill by stopping cloture twice during the last 30 \nhours. I repeat, I said anybody who wanted to could offer amendments. \nWe sat for 2 days doing nothing, for 30 hours doing nothing.\n  I hope the distinguished Senator from Missouri and my friend, my dear \nfriend for life, the junior Senator from West Virginia, can work \nsomething out. That is why I moved to reconsider. I hope that on this \nvery important piece of legislation, we are able to move forward. This \nhas nothing to do with partisan politics. This is the security of our \nNation and much of the world.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, as I indicated earlier, I want to see this \nbill move forward. It is open for amendment and debate. I will work \nwith the chairman, with the leaders on both sides to come to a short \ntime agreement with amendments to be considered. If that cannot be \naccepted, if we have any indication that this bill is going to be drawn \nout, then I will work with the leadership to get us to a position to \nvote on the bill. I remain committed to seeing this bill go forward, \nbut I believe we have the need for at least a day's debate. The \nobjection to proceeding on the bill was withdrawn. There could have \nbeen debate on Friday, but we weren't in. Now we are back in session, \nand I hope both sides can come forward and offer their amendments and \noffer their debates, and have votes and move this bill to final passage \nand send it to conference.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. We weren't in session because there was no activity on this \nbill. No one was offering amendments. I would go one step further than \nthe distinguished Senator from Missouri suggested. The amendments have \nbeen filed. Why don't we do the relevant amendments? I don't know how \nmany there are. Let's do the ones that are in keeping with the rules of \nthe Senate, go ahead and handle those, starting in the morning.\n  That is all I have, Mr. President.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the role.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/16/senate-section/article/S4474-1", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4474]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER.

Mr. President, I rise today with a heavy heart and deep \nsense of gratitude to honor the life of a brave young man from Kokomo. \nNeil Simmons, 20 years old, was killed on April 8 while deployed in \nBaghdad, when his convoy encountered an improvised explosive device and \ninsurgent fire. He had been in Iraq for less than 2 weeks. With his \nentire life before him, Neil risked everything to fight for the values \nAmericans hold close to our hearts, in a land halfway around the world.\n  Neil attended Kokomo's Northwestern High School and followed the \nexample set by his father and uncle by enlisting in the Army a few \nmonths before graduating in 2005. He enjoyed the structure of the \nmilitary and felt a sense of duty to serve his community and country. \nHis father described Neil as ``an avid outdoorsman who was happy and \nalways had plenty of friends.''\n  Neil was killed while serving his country in Operation Iraqi Freedom. \nHe was a member of the 2nd Battalion, 69th Armor Regiment, 3rd Brigade \nCombat Team, 3rd Infantry Division, in Fort Benning, GA. Neil's father \nreflected on his son's death, asking, ``What's the odds of, among \n160,000 troops your only child is there one week and gets killed?'' \nPrivate First Class Simmons leaves behind his father David and uncle \nJim Simmons.\n  Today, I join Neil's family and friends in mourning his death. While \nwe struggle to bear our sorrow over this loss, we can also take pride \nin the example he set, bravely fighting to make the world a safer \nplace. It is his courage and strength of character that people will \nremember when they think of Neil, a memory that will burn brightly \nduring these continuing days of conflict and grief.\n  Neil was known for his dedication to his family and his love of \ncountry. Today and always, Neil will be remembered by family members, \nfriends, and fellow Hoosiers as a true American hero, and we honor the \nsacrifice he made while dutifully serving his country.\n  As I search for words to do justice in honoring Neil's sacrifice, I \nam reminded of President Lincoln's remarks as he addressed the families \nof the fallen soldiers in Gettysburg: ``We cannot dedicate, we cannot \nconsecrate, we cannot hallow this ground. The brave men, living and \ndead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power \nto add or detract. The world will little note nor long remember what we \nsay here, but it can never forget what they did here.'' This statement \nis just as true today as it was nearly 150 years ago, as I am certain \nthat the impact of Neil's actions will live on far longer that any \nrecord of these words.\n  It is my sad duty to enter the name of David Neil Simmons in the \nofficial Record of the U.S. Senate for his service to this country and \nfor his profound commitment to freedom, democracy and peace. When I \nthink about this just cause in which we are engaged and the unfortunate \npain that comes with the loss of our heroes, I hope that families like \nNeil's can find comfort in the words of the prophet Isaiah who said, \n``He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord God will wipe away \ntears from off all faces.''\n  May God grant strength and peace to those who mourn, and may God be \nwith all of you, as I know He is with Neil.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/16/senate-section/article/S4474-3", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4474-S4475]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ARMENIAN GENOCIDE\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I take this opportunity today to solemnly \ncommemorate the 92nd Anniversary of the Armenian genocide.\n  The Armenian genocide was the first genocide of the 20th century. \nFrom 1915 until 1923, 1.5 million Armenians were brutally killed by the \nOttoman Turks in a systematic effort to eradicate the Armenian people. \nThere were unbearable acts of torture; men were separated from their \nfamilies and murdered; women and children were put on a forced march \nacross the Syrian desert without food or water.\n  Henry Morgenthau, the U.S. Ambassador to the Ottoman Empire from 1913 \nto 1916, recalled:\n\n       When the Turkish authorities gave the orders for these \n     deportations, they were merely giving the death warrant to a \n     whole race; they understood this well, and, in their \n     conversations with me, they made no particular attempt to \n     conceal the fact . . . I am confident that the whole history \n     of the human race contains no such horrible episode as this. \n     The great massacres and persecutions of the past seem almost \n     insignificant when compared to the sufferings of the Armenian \n     race in 1915.\n\n  However, we were to witness other such horrible genocides later, \nincluding the Holocaust and the genocide in Darfur, which is happening \ntoday.\n  As with later genocides, some have tried to deny that the Armenian \ngenocide happened. Shamefully, the Government of Turkey still refuses \nto admit that genocide occurred.\n  In order for democracy and human rights to flourish, we must not \nsupport efforts to rewrite and deny history. In the United States, we \nstrive to make human rights a fundamental component of our democracy. \nIt is long overdue for our nation to demand that the truth be told. We \nmust recognize the Armenian genocide in the name of democracy, fairness \nand human rights.\n  At the beginning of the 21st century, as genocide is waged in Darfur, \nit is\n\n[[Page S4475]]\n\neven more critical to recognize the first genocide of the 20th Century. \nWe must send a message that genocide and genocide denial will never be \ntolerated.\n  To that end, I am proud to be an original cosponsor of Senator \nRichard Durbin's S. Res. 106, calling on the President to accurately \ncharacterize the Armenian Genocide in his annual message around April \n24 and to ensure that the foreign policy of the United States reflects \nappropriate understanding and sensitivity concerning issues related to \nhuman rights, ethnic cleansing, and genocide documented in the United \nStates record relating to the Armenian genocide.\n  It is important that we recognize the Armenian genocide while its \nsurvivors are still with us to tell their stories. We must recognize \nthe genocide for the survivors. We must recognize the genocide because \nit is the right thing to do. We must recognize the Armenian genocide to \nhelp shed light on the darkness and move toward a more humane world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/16/senate-section/article/S4475-1", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4475]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n Mr. NELSON of Florida.

HARMON, M.D.\n\n Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, today I ask the Senate to join me \nin recognizing Dr. Gerald E. Harmon, MD, on the occasion of his \nretirement from the South Carolina Air National Guard, SCANG. A native \nSouth Carolinian, ``Gamecock Doc'' joined the military in 1973 as a \ncommissioned officer in the U.S. Air Force, USAF after graduating from \nthe University of South Carolina USC. He began studying medicine at the \nMedical University of South Carolina through the Air Force Health \nProfessions Scholarship Program achieving his M.D. in 1976.\n  Dr. Harmon completed his family practice residency at Eglin AFB in \nFlorida. After fulfilling several USAF flight surgeon assignments in \nTexas and South Carolina, he transferred to the SCANG to serve as the \ncommander of the 169th Tactical Clinic at McEntire Joint National Guard \nBase. Under his leadership, his unit was twice awarded the SCANG \nOutstanding Unit award and received ``Excellent'' evaluations by the \nUSAF Inspection Agency.\n  In 1992, President George H. W. Bush recognized Dr. Harmon for his \nmedical humanitarian work in Africa, and both in 1998 and 2003 the \nSouth Carolina General Assembly recognized him as the Doctor of the Day \nfor his unselfish duty and devotion to the medical profession. Dr. \nHarmon was also a recipient of the American Heart Association Research \nGrant at the USC School of Medicine and was recognized as the Air \nNational Guard's 1993 National Physician of the Year.\n  Over the last 7 years, Dr. Harmon served as the Air National Guard \nAssistant Surgeon General for the USAF providing critical advice and \ninformation on Air National Guard medical activities to the United \nStates' Surgeon General. Part of his responsibilities included \ncoordinating medical policies, plans, and programs for the Air National \nGuard. Dr. Harmon is the first South Carolinian to serve as the Air \nNational Guard Assistant Surgeon General.\n  Dr. Harmon is currently a family practitioner the Waccamaw Medical \nCenter on Pawleys Island, where he and his wife of 35 years reside. He \nis also President-elect of the South Carolina Medical Association \nhaving served on its board directors for many years.\n  A true patriot and a fine American, Dr. Harmon formally retired as a \nmajor general with over 700 flying hours on February 16, 2007. His \nmilitary career will forever be marked by his extraordinary vision, \nsacrifice, and community spirit. I wish Dr. Harmon the very best in his \nretirement and ask that the Senate join me in thanking him for his \nservice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/16/senate-section/article/S4475-3", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4475]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/16/senate-section/article/S4475-4", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4475]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/16/senate-section/article/S4475-5", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4475]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:04 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that pursuant to 22 \nU.S.C. 2761 and the order of the House of January 4, 2007, the Speaker \nappoints the following Member of the House of Representatives to the \nBritish-American Interparliamentary Group: Mr. Chandler of Kentucky, \nChairman.\n  The message also announced that pursuant to 22 U.S.C. 276d, and the \norder of the House of January 4, 2007, the Speaker appoints the \nfollowing Members of the House of Representatives to the Canada-United \nStates Interparliamentary Group: Mr. Oberstar of Minnesota, Chairman, \nMr. Smith of Washington, Vice Chairman, Ms. Slaughter of New York, Mr. \nStupak of Michigan, Ms. Kilpatrick of Michigan, Mr. Hodes of New \nHampshire, Mr. Welch of Vermont.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/16/senate-section/article/S4475-6", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4475-S4476]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, and were referred as \nindicated:\n\n       EC-1469.

A concurrent resolution adopted by the Senate of \n     the Legislature of the State of Kansas urging Congress to \n     allow interstate marketing of state inspected meat; to the \n     Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n                 Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 1604\n\n       Whereas, the Federal Wholesale Meat Act of 1967 allows \n     states to have state meat inspection programs which are \n     required to meet or exceed federal inspection standards of \n     the United States Department of Agriculture for \n     wholesomeness, cleanliness and food safety; and\n       Whereas, Kansas is in the majority of states which have \n     elected to operate equivalent meat inspection programs \n     allowing state-licensed and state-inspected meat processing \n     facilities to engage in intrastate commerce. Other states are \n     pursuing implementation of state inspection of their meat \n     processing facilities; and\n       Whereas, State meat inspection programs are flexible and \n     can efficiently and safely adapt their activities to small, \n     local meat processors that cannot be duplicated by the \n     federal inspection program because of its size and \n     complexity; and\n       Whereas, State-inspected meat and poultry products are \n     currently barred from interstate commerce under federal law, \n     including neighboring local markets in other states, despite \n     current meat safety and quality assurances, affecting long-\n     range rural development and economic growth strategies within \n     the meat processing industry; and\n       Whereas, such limitation on marketing of state inspected \n     meat inhibits economic development and value-added \n     agricultural activities in this nation's agricultural sector; \n     and\n       Whereas, current policy of the National Association of \n     State Departments or Agriculture supports the interstate \n     shipment of state-inspected meat products: Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved by the Senate of the State of Kansas, the House of \n     Representatives concurring therein, That we urge the United \n     States Congress to enact revisions to the Federal Meat \n     Inspection Act and the Poultry Products Inspection Act to \n     allow the interstate shipment and marketing of meat products \n     by state inspected meat processing facilities; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That the Secretary of State be directed to send \n     an enrolled copy of this resolution to the President of the \n     United States, the President of the United States Senate, the \n     Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, the \n     Secretary of the United States Department of Agriculture and \n     each member of the Kansas Congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-57. A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the Legislature of the State of Michigan \n     memorializing Congress to invest in Head Start and Quality \n     Child Care; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \n     Pensions.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 40\n\n       Whereas, Head Start and high-quality child care prepare \n     children for school and life success by narrowing the \n     educational achievement gap between lower- and upper-income \n     kids, increasing high school graduation rates, and reducing \n     crime.\n       Whereas, studies show that at-risk children who attend Head \n     Start and high-quality child care are better prepared for \n     school. For example, Head Start narrows the literacy skills \n     gap by nearly half between children in poverty and all \n     children. The research is clear that quality early childhood \n     education programs work to prevent crime. In Ypsilanti, \n     Michigan, three- and four-year-olds from low-income families \n     who were randomly assigned to a group that did not receive \n     preschool preparation were five times more likely to have \n     become chronic lawbreakers by age 27 than those who were \n     assigned to the High/Scope Educational Research Foundation's \n     Perry Preschool program; and\n\n[[Page S4477]]\n\n       Whereas, currently, only about half of eligible low-income \n     children can attend Head Start due to state and federal \n     funding limitations, and even fewer infants and toddlers. \n     Less than five percent of eligible children three years old \n     and younger are able to participate in Early Head Start. \n     Moreover, only one in seven eligible children in working, \n     low-income families receives help paying for quality child \n     care through the Child Care and Development Block Grant. The \n     combination of state and federal money for preschool has \n     helped Michigan reach two of three at-risk four-year-olds and \n     one of five at-risk three-year-olds; and\n       Whereas, Real dollar funding levels for Head Start and \n     child care have been cut for the last several years, falling \n     far behind the rising costs that programs face. Instead of \n     reaching more eligible kids with comprehensive health, \n     nutrition, and early education services, Head Start programs \n     have been forced to shorten program hours, cut back staff, \n     reduce parent coaching, and reduce transportation and other \n     services that help families participate: Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved, by the House of Representatives, That we \n     memorialize the Congress of the United States to increase \n     discretionary funding in the federal budget for 2008 by $750 \n     million in additional funding over current levels for Head \n     Start and $720 million in additional funding over current \n     levels for the Child Care and Development Block Grant \n     (CCDBG). This request does not address the unmet need in Head \n     Start and CCDBG, but simply restores services to children to \n     the Fiscal Year 2002 level. This is a crucial first step \n     toward meeting the need to provide quality early childhood \n     education and care for at-risk children. Investing in Head \n     Start and quality child care now will improve education \n     outcomes for our nation's at-risk children and will save \n     lives and money down the road: and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-58.

A bill to amend the Reclamation Projects Authorization and \nAdjustment Act of 1992 to provide for the conjunctive use of surface \nand ground water in Juab County, Utah; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to reinforce the importance of \nwater resource development projects in Juab County, UT, by introducing \nthe Juab County Surface and Ground Water Study and Development Act of \n2007, S. 1110. This legislation would amend the Reclamation Projects \nAuthorization and Adjustment Act of 2005 to include Juab County.\n  Juab County's inclusion in that Act would allow the County to use \nCentral Utah Project funds to complete water resource development \nprojects, thus enabling the County to better utilize their existing \nwater resources. I hope that by passing this legislation, we will \nensure that farmers, ranchers, and other citizens of Juab County will \nhave a reliable water supply and a buffer in times of drought.\n  Under the original plan for the Bonneville Unit of the Central Unit \nProject, several counties in central Utah, including Juab, were to \nreceive supplemental water through an irrigation and drainage delivery \nsystem. Over the years, however, many central Utah Counties have \nelected not to participate in the plan and no longer pay the requisite \ntaxes to the Central Utah Water Conservancy District, the political \ndivision of the State of Utah established to manage Central Utah \nProject activities in Utah.\n  Juab County, on the other hand, remained active in the Central Utah \nWater Conservatory District's efforts and has paid millions in property \ntaxes to the District in hopes of benefitting from its membership. \nCurrently, most of the water allocated to the Bonneville Unit of the \nCentral Utah Project is planned for use in Wasatch, Salt Lake, and Utah \nCounties. This legislation would simply ensure that the citizens of \nJuab County can benefit from the system that they have financially \nsupported for so many years.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1110\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Juab County Surface and \n     Ground Water Study and Development Act of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2. CONJUNCTIVE USE OF SURFACE AND GROUND WATER, CENTRAL \n                   UTAH PROJECT.\n\n       Section 202(a)(2) of the Reclamation Projects Authorization \n     and Adjustment Act of 1992 (Public Law 102-575; 106 Stat. \n     4609) is amended by inserting ``Juab,'' after ``Davis,''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WYDEN:\n  S. 1111. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to make \nthe Federal income tax system simpler, fairer, and more fiscally \nresponsible, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I have come to the floor to talk a bit \nabout taxes. Millions of Americans are scrambling today to file their \ntaxes, trying to pull together their 1040 forms and ``schedule this'' \nand ``form that'' and are plowing through shoe boxes and filing \ncabinets trying to find the receipts they accumulated all through this \nyear.\n  Millions of our citizens have to calculate their taxes twice to find \nout the hard way that they have been ensnared in the alternative \nminimum tax and that they have to pay a much larger burden than they \nhad expected. I believe there is a better way for our country to handle \ntaxes, one where most Americans do not have to fear tax day, do not \nhave to shell out billions of dollars in order to file their taxes, do \nnot have to worry about getting crushed by the alternative minimum tax \nthat years ago, when it was created, was not supposed to clobber \nmiddle-class folks in the Pacific Northwest and across the country.\n  Today I am introducing the Fair Flat Tax Act, along with my colleague \nin the other body, Congressman Rahm Emanuel of Illinois. What we are \ndoing in our fair flat tax legislation is offering the country a \nproposal that offers the administrative simplicity of a flat tax with \nthe sense of fairness and progressivity that our country has always \nwanted in our tax system.\n  The tax reform proposal we have developed is simpler because it is \neasier to understand and use. Our legislation will include a simplified \n1040 form, one page, 30 lines for every individual taxpayer.\n  The folks at Money magazine, the financial publication, took this \none-page 1040 form, and they were able to fill out their taxes in 15 \nminutes.\n  We also make the tax system flatter by collapsing the current system \nof six individual tax brackets down to three brackets of 15, 25 and 35 \npercent. We create a flat corporate rate of 35 percent.\n  The plan is fairer because we do more to make it possible for middle-\nclass folks to get ahead. We are able to give a tax cut to millions of \nmiddle-class families because we eliminate scores and scores of \nspecial-interest tax breaks, close those loopholes, that, in effect, \ndrain the country of revenue and never find their way to helping the \nmiddle class.\n  We make a radical statement about tax law in our legislation. We say \nsomething is out of whack when the cop who is walking the beat in this \ncountry pays a lot higher tax rate than the person who makes all their \nmoney in the stock market. I wish to make it clear: we want everybody \nto get ahead, we want everybody to do well, we never want to penalize \nsuccess. But let's make it possible for all Americans to share the \nAmerican dream and not just the fortunate few.\n  Under the current Federal Tax Code, all income is not treated fairly. \nMy colleague in the other body, Congressman Emanuel, and I would change \nthat. We are not interested in soaking investors. We believe in \nmarkets. We believe in creating wealth. But we want everybody to be \nable to share in that wealth, and under the Fair Flat Tax, they would \nbe able to do it.\n  The Fair Flat Tax adopts the flat tax idea to provide real relief to \nthe middle class through fewer exclusions, exemptions, deductions \ndeferrals, credits and special rates for certain favored businesses, \nvery often, breaks that have been added to the Tax Code because those \npowerful interests have lobbyists that the middle-class folks we \nrepresent do not.\n  We triple the standard deduction for single filers from $5,000 to \n$15,000 and from $10,000 to $30,000 for married couples. As a result, \nthe vast majority of Americans would be better off claiming the \nstandard deduction than having to itemize their deductions, so their \nfiling will be simplified. We do keep the key deductions most used by \nmiddle-income folks across the country. We keep the deduction for \nmortgage interest and charity. We keep the credits for children, for \neducation, and earned income.\n  Nobody would have to calculate their taxes twice under the Fair Flat \nTax Act. Our proposal eliminates the individual alternative minimum tax \nwhich could ensnare as many as 100 million taxpayers by the end of the \ndecade. We eliminate an estimated $20 billion each year in special \nbreaks for special interests.\n  Eliminating those breaks would sustain current benefits for our men \nand women in uniform, our veterans, our elderly, and our disabled, as \nwell as those tax incentives that promote savings and help our families \npay for medical care and for education.\n  I think an especially important feature of the Fair Flat Tax Act is \nit corrects one of the most glaring inequities in the current tax \nsystem; and that is regressive State and local taxes. Under current \nlaw, low- and middle-income taxpayers get hit with a double whammy. \nCompared to wealthier folks, they pay more of their income in State and \nlocal taxes. Poor families pay more than 11 percent and middle-income \nfamilies pay about 10 percent of their\n\n[[Page S4481]]\n\nincome in State and local taxes, while the wealthier pay only about 5 \npercent.\n  Because many low- and middle-income taxpayers do not itemize, they \nget no credit on their Federal form for paying State and local taxes. \nIn fact, two-thirds of the Federal tax deduction for State and local \ntaxes goes to those with incomes above $100,000 a year. Under the Fair \nFlat Tax Act, for the first time, the Federal Code would look at the \nentire picture of one's taxes, at an individual's combined Federal, \nState, and local tax burden, and give a credit to low- and middle-\nincome individuals to correct for regressive State and local taxes.\n  Repealing some individual tax credits, deductions, and exclusions \nfrom income--along with eliminating some of those special interest \nfavors in the corporate Tax Code--enables larger standard deductions \nand broader middle-class tax relief.\n  What this means is that, according to the Congressional Research \nService, under our legislation, the vast majority of taxpayers would \nsee their taxes go down. The Congressional Research Service has advised \nus that on average, middle-class families and individuals with wage and \nsalary incomes up to $150,000 would see tax relief. Let me repeat that. \nWe are talking about on average, tax relief for middle-class families \nand families with wage and salary incomes up to approximately $150,000. \nMiddle-class folks in our country would get a tax break.\n  The legislation also makes concrete progress toward deficit \nreduction. Certainly, there is a long way to go to stop the \nhemorrhaging in the Federal budget, but this legislation makes a decent \nstart by allowing us to start lowering the Federal deficit in 2011. It \nis essentially a revenue-neutral kind of system. But certainly, as we \nlook to the future, this is going to allow us to start lowering the \nFederal deficit.\n  I also point out, by simplifying the Code, there are going to be \nother benefits. For example, we have heard a great deal about the tax \ngap in the Finance and Budget Committees. It is one of the most serious \nproblems our country faces as it relates to finance in America. Upwards \nof $300 billion of money that is owed to our government is not \ncollected. Given the fact we have a system today where people are able \nto flout the rules, change the system, why not go to a simpler system \nthat makes it harder for individuals to cheat and easier for the IRS to \ncatch those who do?\n  If you look at what I have proposed, the Fair Flat Tax Act--a 1040 \nform that is only 30 lines long--it is going to be a lot harder to \ncheat the system under a proposal such as this, and it is going to be a \nlot easier for the IRS to catch those who try to take advantage of \nsomething such as this.\n  I believe the Fair Flat Tax Act can make a significant contribution \nin helping this country collect those taxes that are owed and raise a \nsignificant amount of revenue from a source that does not increase \ntaxes. What we are proposing with our fair flat tax legislation is a \nwin for everybody except those who would try to rip off the system.\n  I am introducing the Fair Flat Tax Act of 2007 today to provide \nAmericans a plan based on common sense principles that can make the Tax \nCode work better. We are going to have a system that is simpler and we \nare going to have a system that is fairer because it closes scores of \nthose special interest loopholes. It gets rid of the despised \nalternative minimum tax, and it gives everybody a chance to get ahead \nin America.\n  It is not about class warfare. It is not about pitting one group \nagainst another. It is about giving everybody the opportunity to be a \nwinner and to get ahead to provide for their family and ensure that \nwhen they are successful, their success can allow them to do well \nfinancially.\n  I do think it is important to make sure those who work for a wage get \nfair treatment. That has not been the case today. I want investors to \ndo well. We all look to the stock market as a major barometer of \neconomic prosperity in our country. But let's make sure everybody has \nan opportunity to get ahead. Something is seriously wrong when somebody \nwho works for a wage gets hit with a lot higher tax rate than somebody \nwho makes their money as an investor.\n  I hope we can go forward in a bipartisan way on the issue of tax \nreform. I am extremely disappointed the Bush administration has not \nchosen to follow up on tax reform. I think it is especially \nunfortunate, given the fact the President had a commission that had a \nnumber of good ideas as it relates to tax reform. I certainly did not \nagree with all of them, but let me talk about one example of how the \nCongress could work with the Bush administration in a bipartisan way.\n  I have shown this fair flat tax form I am proposing for a reason; and \nthat is, because I think it is an ideal way for the administration and \nDemocrats and Republicans to work together. My form is 30 lines long--\n30 lines long--and you can fill it out in under an hour. The \nPresident's commission had a form that is maybe six, seven lines \nlonger--just a handful of additional lines. For purposes of Government \nwork, there is virtually no difference between the simplified form I am \nproposing and what the President's commission has called for. We could \nget Democrats and Republicans together to work on tax reform and come \nup with a simplified form in a matter of days.\n  There is very little difference between what I am proposing and what \ncame out of the President's commission.\n  But what is going to be important is that the President reach out to \nDemocrats and Republicans in the Congress and say: Look, I want to work \nwith you on simplifying the Tax Code. I want to work with you to hold \ndown rates for everybody by closing out some of those special interest \nbreaks. I want to see everybody have an opportunity to get ahead.\n  That certainly is what President Reagan did in 1986, when he worked \nwith another tall fellow who served on the Senate Finance Committee, \nour former colleague Senator Bill Bradley. I went to school on a \nbasketball scholarship. My jump shot is not quite as good as Bill \nBradley's, but I sure know the value of bipartisan teamwork.\n  So today, the day before taxes are owed, I want to renew my offer to \nthe Bush administration to work with them on the issue of tax reform. \nIt is a natural for bipartisan leadership. We have a model; and that \nis, the reform of 1986, where, again, they simplified the system. They \ncleaned out the clutter. They got rid of some of those special interest \nloopholes. They held down rates for everybody. It was good for our \ncountry. We can do that again.\n  The fair flat tax legislation I am introducing today provides an \nopportunity for Democrats and Republicans to come together to fix the \nTax Code in 2007, the way Democrats and Republicans did back in 1986, \nwhen the late President Reagan and Bill Bradley came together and led a \nbipartisan effort.\n  I think it is time to do that again. Most people clean out their \nattic every 20 years or so. We ought to clean the Tax Code every 20 \nyears as well. I think we know how to proceed. The question is whether \nthere is political will. I urge the Bush administration to work with \nDemocrats and Republicans in the Congress because the current tax \nsystem, which has subjected our citizens to so much hassle and \nbureaucracy over the last few months, does not have to be that way. \nThere is an alternative. I have presented one. The President's \ncommission has presented one. Democrats and Republicans working \ntogether can do better.\n  I urge the President to look to the Congress, leaders of both \npolitical parties, to move forward on tax reform in the days ahead.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1111\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to allow for the renegotiation of the payment \nschedule of contracts between the Secretary of the Interior and the \nRedwood Valley County Water District, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Redwood\n\n[[Page S4491]]\n\nValley County Water District Loan Renegotiation Act of 2007. I am \npleased that Senator Boxer is a cosponsor of this bill.\n  This bill seeks to remove roadblocks to the implementation of 1988 \nlegislation that requires the Secretary of the Interior to renegotiate \ndebts owed by the Redwood Valley County Water District to the United \nStates. Enactment of this bill is necessary so that Redwood Valley can \nobtain a reliable water supply.\n  In 1983, the Redwood Valley County Water District completed a project \nwhich supplied water to a rural agricultural community near Ukiah, CA. \nTwo Bureau of Reclamation loans totaling $7.3 million contributed to \nthe financing of this project.\n  Unfortunately, the District was unable to repay these loans. This \noccurred for several reasons: The projected water use in the original \nfeasibility study, developed by the District and reviewed by the \nBureau, was seriously flawed; the District's ability to raise necessary \nrevenues was compromised by a judicially imposed moratorium on new \nhook-ups; and concerns for endangered species reduced the District's \npotential water supply allotment by 33 percent.\n  As a result, in 1988 Congress passed Section 15 of Public Law 100-516 \nwhich indefinitely suspended the District's obligations to repay these \nBureau loans and ordered the Secretary of Interior to renegotiate the \nloans. This loan renegotiation has yet to take place and now the \nDistrict finds that its water supply is highly uncertain.\n  In 2000 in a report on Redwood Valley, the Bureau of Reclamation \nrecognized these changed conditions, and concluded that the District \nneeds a reliable water supply before it can solve its current financial \ndilemma.\n  The District recently identified two potential new projects, either \nof which could prove a reliable water source. No government funds will \nbe sought for these projects. The District intends to rely on private \nfinancing, a strategy that the Bureau of Reclamation is encouraging. \nHowever, before the District can secure private financing for new \nprojects, it must renegotiate the existing loans to provide for their \nrepayment subsequent to the repayment of the new loans.\n  The existing loans are an impediment to the District's attempts to \nupgrade elements of its existing plant. As an example, the District \nunsuccessfully sought private financing to build a 100 kW solar panel \nproject. This project would have enabled the District to cut its energy \ncosts and to qualify for energy rebates.\n  Significantly, this legislation requires the District to repay to the \nUnited States the currently suspended loans once the District's new \nloans have been paid.\n  The only difference between this bill and S. 3189, which I introduced \nlast year, is to clarify that no renegotiations are required to trigger \nthe District's obligations to repay the loans and the Secretary of \nInterior ``shall reschedule the payments due'' once the District has \nsatisfied its additional financial obligations.\n  The proposed water projects will enable the District to generate \nadequate revenues to allow the District to repay both its new private \nloans and its original loans from the United States. By providing a \nworkable and reasonable solution to a longstanding problem, this \nlegislation creates a win-win solution for taxpayers of the United \nStates and the rate payers of the Redwood Valley County Water District.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill and ask unanimous consent \nthat the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1112\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. RENEGOTIATION OF PAYMENT SCHEDULE.\n\n       Section 15 of Public Law 100-516 (102 Stat. 2573) is \n     amended as follows:\n       (1) By amending paragraph (2) of subsection (a) to read as \n     follows:\n       ``(2) If, as of January 1, 2006, the Secretary of the \n     Interior and the Redwood Valley County Water District have \n     not renegotiated the schedule of payment, the District may \n     enter into such additional non-Federal obligations as are \n     necessary to finance procurement of dedicated water rights \n     and improvements necessary to store and convey those rights \n     to provide for the District's water needs. The Secretary \n     shall reschedule the payments due under loans numbered 14-06-\n     200-8423A and 14-06-200-8423A Amendatory and said payments \n     shall commence when such additional obligations have been \n     financially satisfied by the District. The date of the \n     initial payment owed by the District to the United States \n     shall be regarded as the start of the District's repayment \n     period and the time upon which any interest shall first be \n     computed and assessed under section 5 of the Small \n     Reclamation Projects Act of 1956 (43 U.S.C. 422a et seq.).''.\n       (2) By striking subsection (c).\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself and Mr. Specter):\n  S. 1114. A bill to reiterate the exclusivity of the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 as the sole authority to permit \nthe conduct of electronic surveillance, to modernize surveillance \nauthorities, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to re-introduce \nlegislation from the last Congress that would bring all electronic \nsurveillance of terrorists under the color of law and would modernize \nthe rules for conducting such surveillance. I am pleased that Senator \nSpecter, the Ranking Member of the Judiciary Committee, has co-\nsponsored this legislation.\n  We all agree that the President and the Intelligence Community should \nhave all the tools they need to find the terrorists before they have a \nchance to strike us again. This cannot be said too many times in too \nmany ways.\n  We also agree, though, that these intelligence tools can and should \nbe used in a way that protects the constitutional and privacy rights of \nall Americans. That is the balance that this legislation attempts to \nstrike.\n  Nowhere is this more at issue than in electronic surveillance, where \ngovernment officials record the content of Americans' phone and \nelectronic communications. This important means of obtaining critical \ncounterterrorism information is at the same time a significant, \nconstitutionally recognized intrusion into Americans' privacy rights.\n  It is worth reminding ourselves of this. We have recently focused on \nthe use of National Security Letters, through which the FBI \ninappropriately obtained telephone records of at least hundreds of \nAmericans. Electronic surveillance goes far beyond records and collects \nthe actual content--the words spoken over the phone or typed in email.\n  It is also worth reminding ourselves of why this legislation is \nnecessary, as it has been several months before this was the top \nlegislative issue before the Senate.\n  For more than five years since September 11, 2001, the National \nSecurity Agency collected the content of calls from or to United States \npersons--citizens and permanent residents--without a court order as is \nrequired by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (FISA).\n  This surveillance was done without notifying and seeking \nauthorization from the congressional intelligence committees. The \nPresident and Vice President have very closely restricted disclosure of \ninformation about what they call the ``Terrorist Surveillance \nProgram.''\n  Until this surveillance came to light through an article in The New \nYork Times in December 2005, only eight members of Congress were \nbriefed on it. Even after the article came out, the White House refused \nto brief the members of the House and Senate Intelligence Committees \nfor several months.\n  Even now, the Intelligence Committee does not have all the \ninformation it needs to carry out its Constitutional oversight duties.\n  Throughout 2006, the Judiciary Committee debated various bills to \nauthorize or prohibit electronic surveillance outside of FISA. The bill \nthat Senator Specter and I authored last year, which is being re-\nintroduced today, was reported out of Judiciary on a bipartisan vote on \nSeptember 13, 2006. The Senate, however, took no legislative action \nprior to adjournment.\n  Then, on January 17, 2007, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales notified \nthe chairman and ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee that \nthe FISA Court had authorized the Terrorist Surveillance Program. Since \nJanuary, the program has proceeded\n\n[[Page S4492]]\n\nunder Court supervision, as is required by FISA.\n  I was pleased that the Administration submitted the TSP to the FISA \nCourt, and that the Court had found a way to issue an order approving \nthis surveillance. I was pleased, but not surprised.\n  I had maintained throughout the legislative debate last year that it \nwould not take many changes for the TSP to fit under the confines of \nFISA. All it took was the willingness of the Administration to follow \nlegal process.\n  Members may ask, given the recent developments, why legislation is \nnow necessary. There are two reasons.\n  The first is that the Senate should enact this bill is because this \nAdministration has never conceded the point that it cannot conduct \nelectronic surveillance outside of the law. It has put the TSP under \nFISA Court review, but it asserts that it has the right not to do so. \nFuture Administrations, if not enjoined, may take the same view.\n  I disagree with this legal analysis.\n  Secondly, the Director of the National Security Agency, the Director \nof the FBI, and the Attorney General have said on many occasions that \nFISA is outdated and in need of modernization. The current FISA process \nis too bureaucratic, too slow to initiate electronic surveillance from \nthe time a suspected terrorist's phone or email account is identified.\n  This bill addresses those concerns by providing new flexibility and \nadditional resources to speed the FISA process and allow for the more \ntimely collection of valuable intelligence.\n  Allow me to summarize the legislation. The bill: re-iterates that \nFISA is the exclusive means for conducting electronic surveillance for \nintelligence purposes.\n  Specifies that FISA's requirements cannot be written off through \ncontorted interpretations of other statutes. The Administration's \ntortured argument with respect to the Authorization for the 2001 Use of \nMilitary Force (AUMF) notwithstanding, this legislation would specify \nthat FISA's language can only be undone by a specific and direct Act of \nCongress.\n  Requires that Congress, through the Intelligence Committees, be fully \nbriefed on the Terrorist Surveillance Program and any related \nsurveillance programs.\n  Requires the Supreme Court to review, on an expedited basis, the \nconstitutionality of the Terrorist Surveillance Program.\n  Streamlines the current ``emergency procedures'' in FISA. Currently, \nthe Attorney General can authorize surveillance prior to a Court order \nfor 72 hours in an emergency. This legislation would extend the time \nto one week, which should remove any doubt as to whether Court approval \ncan be sought and obtained in time. The bill also allows the Attorney \nGeneral to delegate his authority to initiate electronic surveillance \nin an emergency to specific supervisory officials at the NSA and FBI.\n\n  Authorizes additional personnel to expedite the writing, submission, \nand review of FISA applications. Specifically, additional FISA Court \njudges and staff are authorized, as are additional positions at the \nDepartment of Justice, FBI, and NSA.\n  Extends the existing FISA authority--for 15 days of warrantless \nsurveillance following a declaration of war--to any 30-day period \nfollowing an authorization for the use of military force or a national \nemergency following a terrorist attack.\n  Allows the National Security Agency to take full advantage of its \ncapabilities to collect intelligence on foreign communications.\n  While foreign-to-foreign communications are not covered now by FISA's \nrequirements, the NSA can only conduct surveillance on these calls if \nit can be sure, in advance, that a telephone call of email won't \ntransit the United States or unexpectedly end here. In the age of cell \nphones and the global telecommunications system, this a priori \ncertification is very difficult to make. This legislation therefore \nspecifies that in such inadvertent collection cases, the NSA must \nminimize the data, but that it has not violated the law.\n  Finally, the legislation clarifies that FISA court orders for \nelectronic surveillance must be individualized to a particular target \nthat the government has probable cause to believe is a foreign power or \nan agent of a foreign power.\n  From the briefings I have received as a member of the Intelligence \nCommittee and the hearings held in Judiciary, I am convinced that the \nTerrorist Surveillance Program is an important anti-terrorism tool that \nshould be continued.\n  It is also clear from the January FISA Court ruling that the \nTerrorist Surveillance Program can be conducted within the confines of \nFISA. It is appropriate now for Congress to re-iterate that this is the \nappropriate arrangement.\n  This is by no means an issue that has been overtaken by events. The \nAdministration continues to support a view of plenary authority in \nwhich it can conduct electronic surveillance in violation of FISA. The \nNSA and the FBI continue to labor under a process that was formed 29 \nyears ago, prior to fundamental changes in the telecommunications \nsystem.\n  I urge the Senate to act to ensure that the law is followed and \nprivacy rights upheld, and to provide the Intelligence Community the \ntools it needs to continue to make us safe.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1114\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to promote the efficient use of oil, natural gas, and \nelectricity, reduce oil consumption, and heighten energy efficiency \nstandards for consumer products and industrial equipment, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a comprehensive \nEnergy efficiency bill. I am pleased to have the Ranking Member of the \nEnergy Committee, the senior Senator from New Mexico, as my co-sponsor, \nalong with Senator Dorgan, Senator Lugar, Senator Akaka, Senator \nMurkowski and Senator Craig.\n  Energy efficiency can be viewed as the Nation's largest energy \nresource. Due to actions taken to increase efficiency since the 1973 \noil crisis, we now save more energy each year than we get from any \nsingle energy supply resource, including oil.\n  When the Energy Policy Act of 2005 was signed into law in August of \n2005, it included a strong package of energy efficiency initiatives. \nHowever, just a month later, when hurricanes devastated our Nation's \nprimary oil and gas supply region and many of us recognized that we \nneeded to enact additional and more aggressive efficiency measures.\n  During the last 2 years, gasoline, natural gas, and electricity \nprices have reached all-time high levels. These price increases cost \nAmerican families and businesses over $300 billion dollars each year. \nIn the 2006 elections, voters sent us a clear message that they wanted \nCongress to address high energy prices and also to provide solutions to \nclimate change. Energy efficiency policies can alleviate both of these \nproblems.\n  Our bill includes provisions that will improve efficiency in \nvehicles, buildings, appliances and industrial equipment. The \nlegislation is also intended to motivate States and utilities to \nrecognize energy efficiency as a resource and to remove current \ndisincentives to programs that will benefit utility customers while \nreducing demand for electricity and natural gas.\n  Improving our energy productivity through efficiency has multiple \nbenefits--it lowers the costs of consumers' energy bills; decreases the \nvulnerability of the economy to energy price shocks from natural \ndisasters or problems with foreign sources of supply; provides \nenvironmental benefits such as lower air pollution and reduced \ngreenhouse gas emissions. Moreover, energy efficiency investments help \nbuild local jobs and improve state economies.\n  The bill we are introducing today includes initiatives in six key \nareas: Promoting the development and use of advanced lighting \ntechnologies; Expediting new efficiency standards for appliances and \nindustrial equipment; Promoting high efficiency vehicles, advanced \nbatteries and energy storage; Setting aggressive goals for reducing \ngasoline consumption and improving overall energy productivity in the \nU.S.; Promoting Federal leadership in energy efficiency and renewable \nenergy; and Assisting States, local governments and utilities in energy \nefficiency efforts.\n  In addition to the Energy Efficiency Promotion Act, I want to \nemphasize that other Senate committees are working on complementary \nefficiency initiatives, including the energy efficiency tax provisions \nwe are developing in the Finance Committee and CAFE standards \nlegislation in the Commerce Committee.\n  Finally, for the information on my colleagues, this bill is the 4th \nin a quartet of Energy bills that will be taken up by the Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee in the next few weeks. These bills are: S. \n987, the Biofuels for Energy Security and Transportation Act; S. 731, \nthe National Carbon Dioxide Storage Capacity Assessment Act; and S. 962 \nthe Department of Energy Carbon Capture and Storage R D Act. We are \nworking diligently to meet the Majority Leader's timetable for floor \naction on Energy legislation. I encourage Senators with questions or \nconcerns about any of these bills to let me know so that we can try to \naddress issues in a timely manner.\n  I have included at the end of my statement a preliminary estimate of \nthe energy savings that would result from the implementation of the \nprograms in this bill. I request that this estimate be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection the material was ordered to be printed as \nfollows.\n\n     Energy Saving Estimate for the Energy Efficiency Promotion Act\n\n       Potential savings from the appliance efficiency standards \n     included in Titles I and II: Electricity--At least 50 billion \n     kilowatt hours per year, or enough to power roughly 4.8 \n     million typical U.S. households; Natural gas--170 million \n     therms per year or enough to heat about a quarter million \n     typical U.S. homes; Water--At least 560 million gallons per \n     day, or about 1.3 percent of total daily potable water usage; \n     and Dollars--More than $12 billion in net present benefits \n     for consumers.\n\n  Potential Savings From Federal Government Leadership in Efficiency--\n                                Title V\n\n       The Federal Government consumed 1.1 quadrillion Btus or \n     ``quads'' of energy during Fiscal Year 2005. The Federal \n     energy bill for Fiscal Year 2005 increased by 24 percent \n     compared to Fiscal Year 2004.\n       About 30 percent of the Federal energy use is in standard \n     buildings and about 60 percent is energy used by vehicles and \n     equipment. Although savings can not be estimated at this \n     time--the legislation requires the Federal Government to \n     achieve a 30 percent reduction in energy usage per square \n     foot by 2015 and to reduce its use of gasoline in fleet \n     vehicles by 30 percent in Fiscal Year 2016.\n\n Potential Savings From Electric and Gas Utility Efficiency Programs--\n                                Title VI\n\n       Assuming all State utility regulatory commissions and \n     nonregulated utilities adopt the energy efficiency policies \n     and cost-effective energy efficiency programs recommended in \n     this bill, the estimate cumulative potential energy savings \n     by 2020 would be 7.8 quads and the energy cost savings would \n     be $12 billion.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1115\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, over 18 months ago, the President signed \ninto law the Energy Policy Act of 2005. The enactment of that \ncomprehensive legislation was a watershed event in structuring sound \nEnergy policy for this Nation's future. We did a great deal in that \nenergy bill on energy conservation and improved energy efficiency.\n  EPAct implemented new efficiency standards for 15 large commercial \nand residential appliances that have, in the past, consumed a great \ndeal of energy, such as commercial washers, refrigerators, freezers, \nair-conditioners, and icemakers. In response to that mandate, the \nDepartment of Energy codified 15 new efficiency standards. Because of \nthese new standards alone, we will save 50,000 megawatts of off-peak \nelectricity use by 2020--which is an energy savings equal to more than \neighty 600-megawatt power plants.\n  EPAct also encourages consumers to make their homes more energy \nefficient by giving them a 10-percent personal tax credit for energy \nefficient improvements. Additionally, homebuilders get a business tax \ncredit for the construction of new homes that meet a 30-percent energy \nreduction standard. The law aids businesses in saving energy by \nproviding a deduction for energy-efficient commercial buildings meeting \na 50-percent energy reduction standard. Manufacturers are also assisted \nin building more energy-efficient home products via a manufacturers' \ntax credit for energy-efficient dishwashers, clothes washers, and \nrefrigerators.\n  Still, there is no doubt that much can be done to improve the ways in \nwhich we use energy. That is why I am pleased today to introduce the \nEnergy Efficiency Promotion Act of 2007 with Senator Bingaman. The bill \nwe are introducing is a good starting point--but it is still a work in \nprogress. I expect this bill to evolve over the course of the next \nseveral weeks with important input from those who will be tasked with \nimplementing this policy and those who will be impacted by it. In \nparticular, I am very interested in the Energy Department's views on \nthis bill, and the committee will conduct a hearing next week at which \nthe Department will testify.\n  The Energy Efficiency Promotion Act of 2007 represents over $12 \nbillion in net present benefits for consumers. Potential electricity \nsavings of 50 billion kilowatt hours per year equal enough energy \nsavings to power almost 5 million households. Potential natural gas \nsavings of 170 million therms per year equal enough energy savings to \nheat 250,000 households. And water savings from the legislation amount \nto about 560 million gallons per day.\n  This bill presses for better energy efficiency in the Federal \nGovernment--the appropriate place to start. Title I focuses on the \npromotion of energy-efficient lighting technologies within Federal \nGovernment and requires all general purpose lighting in Federal \nbuildings to be Energy Star rated or designated as efficient by the \nFederal Energy Management Program. Title I also contains a sense of the \nSenate that Federal policies be adopted on efficient lightbulb \nstandards.\n  Title II, which deals with energy efficiency standards, sets forth a \nnumber of consensus standards on such products as residential boilers, \nclothes washers, dishwashers, dehumidifiers, and electric motors. Such \nefficiency standards have the potential to save significant amounts of \nenergy. This title also provides DOE with the authority to expedite \nrulemakings for energy-efficient consensus standards.\n  Title III promotes high efficiency vehicles, advanced batteries, and \nenergy storage. It provides for lightweight materials research and \ndevelopment and loan guarantee the manufacture of fuel-efficient \nvehicle parts, including hybrid and advanced diesel vehicles.\n  Title IV sets forth national energy savings goals in the areas of \ntransportation and the Nation's energy productivity. This title extends \nthe President's goal for gasoline savings and further seeks to improve \nthe Nation's overall energy productivity.\n  Title V calls for increased federal leadership in energy efficiency \nand renewable energy. It directs DOE to reduce petroleum consumption \nand increases the Federal requirement to purchase electricity generated \nby renewable energy. This title also permanently authorizes the Energy \nSavings Performance Contracts Program.\n  Title VI seeks to assist State and local governments with their \nongoing efforts to improve their energy efficiency. It extends the \nauthorization for both the Weatherization Assistance Program and the \nState Energy Conservation Program. This title also establishes energy \nefficiency grant programs for local governments and institutions of \nhigher learning.\n  Again, I think the Energy Efficiency Promotion Act of 2007 we are \nintroducing today is a good starting point for our continued work in \nthe energy efficiency area. I look forward to working with Senator \nBingaman, the administration, and all affected stakeholders as we move \nforward on this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BOND (for himself and Mr. Dodd):\n  S. 1117. A bill to establish a grant program to provide vision care \nto children, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, children endure a lot. They cannot always \ntell us what's wrong. Often they do not know themselves. So it takes a \nspecial person to work with young people and help identify their \nproblems. Every child deserves the opportunity to reach their full \npotential, but it takes more than a book-bag full of pencils, paper, \nbooks and rulers to equip children with the tools necessary to succeed \nin school.\n  The most important tool kids will take to school is their eyes. Good \nvision is critical to learning. 80 percent of what kids learn in their \nearly school years is visual. Unfortunately, we overlook that fact \nsometimes. According to the CDC only one in three children receive any \nform of preventive vision care before entering school. That means many \nkids are in school with an undetected vision problem. One in four \nchildren has a vision problem that can interfere with learning. Some \nchildren are even labeled ``disruptive'' or thought to have a learning \ndisability when the real reason for their difficulty is an undetected \nvision problem.\n  Without any vision care, some of our children will continue to fall \nthrough the cracks. I sympathize with these kids because I suffer from \npermanent vision loss in one eye as a result of undiagnosed Amblyopia \nin childhood. Amblyopia is the number one cause of vision loss in young \nAmericans. If discovered and treated early, vision loss from Amblyopia \ncan be largely prevented. Had I been identified and treated before I \nentered school, I could have avoided a lifetime of vision loss. Parents \nare not always aware that their child may suffer from a vision problem. \nBy educating parents on the importance of vision care and recognizing \nsigns of visual impairment we can help children avoid unnecessary \nvision loss.\n  To ensure that children get the vital vision care that they need to \nsucceed, today Senator Dodd and I are introducing the Vision Care for \nKids Act which will establish a grant program to compliment and \nencourage existing State efforts to improve children's vision care. \nMore specifically, grant funds will be used to: (1) provide \ncomprehensive eye exams to children that have been previously \nidentified as needing such services; (2) provide treatment or services \nnecessary to correct vision problems identified in that eye exam; and \n(3) develop and disseminate educational materials to recognize the \nsigns of visual impairment in children\n\n[[Page S4506]]\n\nfor parents, teachers, and health care practitioners.\n  We need to do this. We must improve vision care for children to \nbetter equip them to succeed in school and in life. The Vision Care for \nKids Act, endorsed by the American Academy of Ophthalmology, American \nOptometric Association, and Vision Council of America, will make a \ndifference in the lives of children across the country.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1117\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Vision Care for Kids Act of \n     2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Millions of children in the United States suffer from \n     vision problems, many of which go undetected. Because \n     children with vision problems can struggle developmentally, \n     resulting in physical, emotional, and social consequences, \n     good vision is essential for proper physical development and \n     educational progress.\n       (2) Vision problems in children range from common \n     conditions such as refractive errors, amblyopia, strabismus, \n     ocular trauma, and infections, to rare but potentially life- \n     or sight-threatening problems such as retinoblastoma, \n     infantile cataracts, congenital glaucoma, and genetic or \n     metabolic diseases of the eye.\n       (3) Since many serious ocular conditions are treatable if \n     identified in the preschool and early school-aged years, \n     early detection provides the best opportunity for effective \n     treatment and can have far-reaching implications for vision.\n       (4) Various identification methods, including vision \n     screening and comprehensive eye examinations required by \n     State laws, can be helpful in identifying children needing \n     services. A child identified as needing services through \n     vision screening should receive a comprehensive eye \n     examination followed by subsequent treatment as needed. Any \n     child identified as needing services should have access to \n     subsequent treatment as needed.\n       (5) There is a need to increase public awareness about the \n     prevalence and devastating consequences of vision disorders \n     in children and to educate the public and health care \n     providers about the warning signs and symptoms of ocular and \n     vision disorders and the benefits of early detection, \n     evaluation, and treatment.\n\n     SEC. 3. GRANTS REGARDING VISION CARE FOR CHILDREN.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Secretary of Health and Human Services \n     (referred to in this section as the ``Secretary''), acting \n     through the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention, may award grants to States on the basis of an \n     established review process for the purpose of complementing \n     existing State efforts for--\n       (1) providing comprehensive eye examinations by a licensed \n     optometrist or ophthalmologist for children who have been \n     previously identified through a vision screening or eye \n     examination by a licensed health care provider or vision \n     screener as needing such services, with priority given to \n     children who are under the age of 9 years;\n       (2) providing treatment or services, subsequent to the \n     examinations described in paragraph (1), necessary to correct \n     vision problems; and\n       (3) developing and disseminating, to parents, teachers, and \n     health care practitioners, educational materials on \n     recognizing signs of visual impairment in children.\n       (b) Criteria and Coordination.--\n       (1) Criteria.--The Secretary, in consultation with \n     appropriate professional and consumer organizations including \n     individuals with knowledge of age appropriate vision \n     services, shall develop criteria--\n       (A) governing the operation of the grant program under \n     subsection (a); and\n       (B) for the collection of data related to vision assessment \n     and the utilization of follow up services.\n       (2) Coordination.--The Secretary shall, as appropriate, \n     coordinate the program under subsection (a) with the program \n     under section 330 of the Public Health Service Act (relating \n     to health centers) (42 U.S.C. 254b), the program under title \n     XIX of the Social Security Act (relating to the Medicaid \n     program) (42 U.S.C. 1396 et seq.), the program under title \n     XXI of such Act (relating to the State children's health \n     insurance program) (42 U.S.C. 1397aa et seq.), and with other \n     Federal or State programs that provide services to children.\n       (c) Application.--To be eligible to receive a grant under \n     subsection (a), a State shall submit to the Secretary an \n     application in such form, made in such manner, and containing \n     such information as the Secretary may require, including--\n       (1) information on existing Federal, Federal-State, or \n     State-funded children's vision programs;\n       (2) a plan for the use of grant funds, including how funds \n     will be used to complement existing State efforts (including \n     possible partnerships with non-profit entities);\n       (3) a plan to determine if a grant eligible child has been \n     identified as provided for in subsection (a); and\n       (4) a description of how funds will be used to provide \n     items or services, only as a secondary payer--\n       (A) for an eligible child, to the extent that the child is \n     not covered for the items or services under any State \n     compensation program, under an insurance policy, or under any \n     Federal or State health benefits program; or\n       (B) for an eligible child, to the extent that the child \n     receives the items or services from an entity that provides \n     health services on a prepaid basis.\n       (d) Evaluations.--To be eligible to receive a grant under \n     subsection (a), a State shall agree that, not later than 1 \n     year after the date on which amounts under the grant are \n     first received by the State, and annually thereafter while \n     receiving amounts under the grant, the State will submit to \n     the Secretary an evaluation of the operations and activities \n     carried out under the grant, including--\n       (1) an assessment of the utilization of vision services and \n     the status of children receiving these services as a result \n     of the activities carried out under the grant;\n       (2) the collection, analysis, and reporting of children's \n     vision data according to guidelines prescribed by the \n     Secretary; and\n       (3) such other information as the Secretary may require.\n       (e) Limitations in Expenditure of Grant.--A grant may be \n     made under subsection (a) only if the State involved agrees \n     that the State will not expend more than 20 percent of the \n     amount received under the grant to carry out the purpose \n     described in paragraph (3) of such subsection.\n       (f) Definition.--For purposes of this section, the term \n     ``comprehensive eye examination'' includes an assessment of a \n     patient's history, general medical observation, external and \n     ophthalmoscopic examination, visual acuity, ocular alignment \n     and motility, refraction, and as appropriate, binocular \n     vision or gross visual fields, performed by an optometrist or \n     an ophthalmologist.\n       (g) Authorization of Appropriations.--For the purpose of \n     carrying out this section, there are authorized to be \n     appropriated such sums as may be necessary for each of fiscal \n     years 2008 through 2012.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, today, Senator Bond and I are introducing \nthe Vision Care for Kids Act of 2007. This legislation will provide \nfollow-up vision care services for those children who have visual \nproblems and are not covered under an insurance policy or under any \nFederal, or State health benefits program.\n  Why is this legislation needed? Let's look at the facts. According to \nthe 2004 Vision Problems Action Plan, published by Prevent Blindness \nAmerica, vision problems affect one in 20 preschoolers and 80 percent \nof children under age six are not screened for vision problems before \nentering public school.\n  Perhaps even more startling than the statistics I have just \nmentioned, is that 20 States do not require children to receive any \nvision care prior to entry or during their early school years. Thus, \nmillions of children are at risk of having possible vision problems \nlater in life.\n  I am pleased that my home State of Connecticut provides annual \nscreenings to children in kindergarten through grade six. In addition, \nduring the ninth grade, each student also receives a vision screening. \nFollowing the eye tests that are administered in Connecticut's schools, \nthe local superintendent sends a note to the parent or guardian of each \nstudent who is found to have a problem.\n  Although Connecticut provides screenings in the early years, it is \nimportant to note that out of the 467,488 children in Connecticut, \nthere are almost 70,000 who have untreated vision disorders, according \nto the most recent Census data. Nationwide, almost 6 million out of \nclose to 40 million children have untreated vision disorders. The \nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention said that ``impaired vision \ncan affect a child's cognitive, emotional, neurological, and physical \ndevelopment.''\n  With the introduction of the Vision Care for Kids Act, Senator Bond \nand I are seeking to improve the data I have outlined. When this \nlegislation is enacted, the States will have the resources to pay for \nfollow-up vision treatment for children who now do not have the \nfinancial means to undergo this much needed care.\n  Our initiative will enable Federal funding to complement existing \nState efforts in regard to: providing comprehensive eye examinations \nfor children under age nine; furnishing the necessary treatment or \nservices needed if an eye exam determines additional\n\n[[Page S4507]]\n\ncare is needed; and developing educational materials for parents, \nteachers, and health care practitioners that will increase recognition \nof the signs of visual impairment in children. The Vision Care for Kids \nAct will serve as an incentive to States to provide eye care to those \nyoungsters who are in need of treatment and are currently unable to \naccess care.\n  This year, we are working on the reauthorization of the State \nChildren's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP). SCHIP was created to \nprovide health care to millions of children who were previously \nuninsured. Over the last ten years, we have seen the positive impact of \nthis essential program. Passage of the Vision Care for Kids Act will be \na key component of ensuring that we have a comprehensive children's \nhealth care delivery system in this country. I look forward to working \nwith Senator Bond and my colleagues to see that this legislation is not \nonly is not only passed by this body soon, but that it is signed into \nlaw.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DORGAN (for himself and Mr. Craig):\n  S. 1118. A bill to improve the energy security of the United States \nby raising average fuel economy standards, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today I am pleased to be joined by Senator \nCraig to introduce legislation called the Fuel Efficiency Act of 2007. \nThis legislation is an important component of broader legislation that \nmy colleague and I recently introduced on March 14, 2007. That \nlegislation is a balanced plan with the overall goal to improve the \nenergy security of the U.S. through a 50 percent reduction in the oil \nintensity of the economy by 2030.\n  This is important to me because the United States remains dangerously \ndependent on foreign sources of oil. Today we import over 60 percent of \nour oil from Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Nigeria, Venezuela, and other \nunstable nations of the world. This is very troubling to me.\n  Our larger proposal is grounded in four cornerstone principles. The \nfirst principle is achievable, stepped increases in fuel efficiency of \nthe transportation fleet. The second principle promotes increased \navailability of alternative fuel sources and infrastructure. The third \nprinciple calls for expanded production and enhanced exploration of \ndomestic and other secure oil and natural gas resources. Finally, the \nfourth principle improves the management of alliances to better secure \nglobal energy supplies.\n  In the United States, we use about 67 percent of our oil to power our \nvehicles. This is the area where we are least secure and increasingly \ndependent. For these reasons and more, we introduced S. 875 as a bi-\npartisan, balanced approach to securing our future energy through \nreducing our dependence on foreign oil.\n  I am also a member of the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation \nCommittee which has jurisdiction over the fuel economy standards of our \nNation's vehicle fleet. I look forward to working with Chairman Inouye, \nRanking Member Stevens, and other members of the committee who are \ninterested in enacting strong, fair, and forwarding-looking fuel \neconomy standards.\n  It should be noted that this is the first time that both Senator \nCraig and I have publicly stated our support for increased fuel economy \nstandards beyond the incremental steps that the current administration \nhas made to date. Our Nation's fuel economy standards have not \nsignificantly changed since the mid-1980s. We now have lower passenger \nvehicle fuel efficiency standards than Japan, the European Union, \nAustralia, Canada, and yes, even China.\n  The bill we have introduced today reforms and strengthens fuel \nefficiency standards by establishing an annual 4 percent increase in \nthe fuel economy of the entire new vehicle fleet, including \nautomobiles, medium trucks, and heavy trucks from 2012-2030. The \nNational Highway Traffic Safety Administration will have discretion to \ninvoke ``off-ramps'' if it is determined that the increase is not \ntechnologically achievable, creates material safety concerns, or is not \ncost effective.\n  Senator Craig and I came together to develop a new pathway forward \nbecause we believe that bolder energy security measures must be taken \nnow to address our long-term security, economic growth and \nenvironmental protection. There is no silver bullet to solving our \nenergy dependence. Digging and drilling is a strategy I call yesterday \nforever. Conservation alone is not the answer. Renewable fuels hold \npromise, but we need to do much more here. We believe the combination \nof steps sets the right pathway to U.S. energy security, and we look \nforward to moving increased fuel economy standards through the Senate \nCommerce Committee.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/16/senate-section/article/S4507-1", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4507]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 149--EXPRESSING THE CONDOLENCES OF THE SENATE ON THE \n               TRAGIC EVENTS AT VIRGINIA TECH UNIVERSITY\n\n  Mr. WARNER (for himself, Mr. Webb, Mr. Reid, Mr. McConnell, Mr. \nAkaka, Mr. Alexander, Mr. Allard, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Bayh, Mr. Bennett, \nMr. Biden, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Bond, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Brown, Mr. \nBrownback, Mr. Bunning, Mr. Burr, Mr. Byrd, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. Cardin, \nMr. Carper, Mr. Casey, Mr. Chambliss, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Coburn, Mr. \nCochran, Mr. Coleman, Ms. Collins, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Corker, Mr. Cornyn, \nMr. Craig, Mr. Crapo, Mr. DeMint, Mr. Dodd, Mrs. Dole, Mr. Domenici, \nMr. Dorgan, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Ensign, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Feingold, Mrs. \nFeinstein, Mr. Graham, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Gregg, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Harkin, \nMr. Hatch, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Isakson, Mr. \nJohnson, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Kerry, Ms. Klobuchar, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Kyl, Ms. \nLandrieu, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Levin, Mr. Lieberman, Mrs. \nLincoln, Mr. Lott, Mr. Lugar, Mr. Martinez, Mr. McCain, Mrs. McCaskill, \nMr. Menendez, Ms. Mikulski, Ms. Murkowski, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Nelson of \nFlorida, Mr. Nelson of Nebraska, Mr. Obama, Mr. Pryor, Mr. Reed, Mr. \nRoberts, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Salazar, Mr. Sanders, Mr. Schumer, Mr. \nSessions, Mr. Shelby, Mr. Smith, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Specter, Ms. Stabenow, \nMr. Stevens, Mr. Sununu, Mr. Tester, Mr. Thomas, Mr. Thune, Mr. Vitter, \nMr. Voinovich, Mr. Whitehouse, and Mr. Wyden) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING LEADERS OF CONGRESS \n                   ENGAGING IN DIPLOMACY WITH STATE SPONSORS OF \n                   TERRORISM.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Secretary of State has designated certain countries \n     that have repeatedly provided support for international acts \n     of terrorism as state sponsors of terrorism.\n       (2) State sponsors of terrorism provide critical support to \n     non-state terrorist groups.\n       (3) Without state sponsors, terrorist groups would have \n     much more difficulty obtaining the funds, weapons, materials, \n     and secure areas they require to plan and conduct operations.\n       (4) United States policy seeks to pressure and isolate \n     state sponsors of terrorism so they will renounce the use of \n     terrorism, end support to terrorists, and bring terrorists to \n     justice for past crimes.\n       (5) Syria remains a designated state sponsor of terrorism, \n     having first been designated as such on December 29, 1979.\n       (6) Iran remains a designated state sponsor of terrorism, \n     having first been designated as such on January 19, 1984.\n       (7) The Secretary of State determined in 2006 that Syria \n     and Iran continue to ``routinely provide unique safe haven, \n     substantial resources and guidance to terrorist \n     organizations''.\n       (8) Senators themselves have historically recognized the \n     constitutional principle that the foreign affairs power \n     resides exclusively in the Executive Branch. For example, \n     Senator J. William Fulbright, former Chairman of the \n     Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate explained in a \n     speech at Cornell Law School in 1959, ``[t]he pre-eminent \n     responsibility of the President for the formulation and \n     conduct of American foreign policy is clear and unalterable. \n     . . . He possesses sole authority to communicate and \n     negotiate with foreign powers.'' (published as J. William \n     Fulbright, ``American Foreign Policy in the 20th-Century \n     Under an 18th-Century Constitution'', 47 Cornell Law \n     Quarterly 1, 3 (1961)).\n       (9) The Supreme Court similarly recognized the ``very \n     delicate, plenary and exclusive power of the President as the \n     sole organ of the Federal Government in the field of \n     international relations'' in the United States versus \n     Curtiss-Wright Export Corporation (299 U.S. 304, 319 (1936)).\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that leaders of Congress should not engage in diplomacy with \n     state sponsors of terrorism over the expressed objections of \n     officials of the Executive Branch, as the Executive Branch \n     has the exclusively responsibility for foreign affairs \n     matters under the Constitution.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 854.

SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING PRESIDENTIAL AUTHORITY \n                   TO CONTROL FOREIGN POLICY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Article II, section 1 of the Constitution of the United \n     States grants ``executive Power'' to the President of the \n     United States.\n       (2) James Madison wrote in Federalist No. 47 that Charles \n     de Montesquieu was ``[t]he oracle who is always consulted and \n     cited'' on issues dealing with separation of powers, and, in \n     ``The Spirit of the Laws'', Montesquieu defined the executive \n     power ``in respect to things dependent on the law of \n     nations'' and as the power by which the ``magistrate . . . \n     makes peace or war, sends or receives embassies, establishes \n     the public security, and provides against invasions''.\n       (3) In a speech to Congress in 1789, James Madison noted \n     that the ``association of the Senate with the President in \n     exercising [the appointment] function, is an exception to \n     this general rule [that executive power is vested solely in \n     the President]; and exceptions to general rules . . . are \n     ever to be taken strictly''.\n       (4) In 1790, Thomas Jefferson wrote, ``The transaction of \n     business with foreign nations is executive altogether. It \n     belongs, then, to the head of that department, except as to \n     such portions of it as are specially submitted to the Senate. \n     Exceptions are to be construed strictly.''.\n       (5) Alexander Hamilton reaffirmed this view in 1793, \n     asserting ``that as the participation of the Senate in the \n     making of treaties, and the power of the legislature to \n     declare war, are exceptions out of the general `executive \n     power' vested in the President, they are to be construed \n     strictly, and ought to be extended no further than is \n     essential to their execution''.\n       (6) John Marshall, during his congressional term in 1799, \n     reaffirmed that the President was ``the sole organ of the \n     nation in its external relations'' because ``[h]e possesses \n     the whole Executive Power''.\n       (7) In 1936, the Supreme Court, in United States v. \n     Curtiss-Wright Export Corporation, 299 U.S. 304, stated, \n     ``Not only, as we have shown, is the federal power over \n     external affairs in origin and essential character different \n     from that over internal affairs, but participation in the \n     exercise of the power is significantly limited. In this vast \n     external realm, with its important, complicated, delicate and \n     manifold problems, the President alone has the power to speak \n     or listen as a representative of the nation. He makes \n     treaties with the advise and consent of the Senate; but he \n     alone negotiates. Into the field of negotiation the Senate \n     cannot intrude, and Congress itself is powerless to invade \n     it.''.\n       (8) Section 953 of title 18, United States Code, originally \n     enacted in 1799 as the Logan Act (1 Stat. 613), states, ``Any \n     citizen of the United States, wherever he may be, who, \n     without authority of the United States, directly or \n     indirectly commences or carries on any correspondence or \n     intercourse with any foreign government or any officer or \n     agent thereof, with intent to influence the measures or \n     conduct of any foreign government or of any officer or agent \n     thereof, in relation to any disputes or controversies with \n     the United States, or to defeat the measures of the United \n     States, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not \n     more than three years, or both. This section shall not \n     abridge the right of a citizen to apply himself, or his \n     agent, to any foreign government, or the agents thereof, for \n     redress of any injury which he may have sustained from such \n     government or any of its agents or subjects.''.\n       (9) In 1952, Senator Arthur Vandenberg asserted that \n     ``politics stop at the water's edge''.\n       (10) Intrusions on the executive power of the President by \n     Members of Congress have had negative effects on foreign \n     policy, and, in the past, some Members of Congress have tried \n     to subvert the goals and aims of the executive branch by \n     pursuing foreign policy goals that are contrary to those of \n     the President.\n       (11) In 1987 and 1988, Speaker of the House Jim Wright \n     attempted to engage in diplomacy between the Sandinista \n     Government of Nicaragua and the Contra regime against the \n     expressed aims of President Ronald Reagan. Speaker Wright's \n     actions undermined the authority and leveraging power of the \n     President at a crucial time in the Nation's history and also \n     ignored the finding of the Permanent Select Committee on \n     Intelligence of the House of Representatives that the \n     Government of Nicaragua was planning to use military force \n     against coterminous states.\n       (12) In 1980, Representative Charlie Wilson began urging \n     the Central Intelligence Agency to arm Afghani mujahideen \n     fighters. The decision to double funding to Afghanistan was \n     unsolicited and was made without the knowledge of the \n     President. The book ``Charlie Wilson's War'', written by \n     George Crile, asserts that Representative Wilson thus \n     violated the Logan Act.\n       (13) In 1983, the decision of Congress to attach a \n     stipulation to legislation authorizing the extension of the \n     presence of the Marines in Beirut, which stated that the \n     extension could be withdrawn if fatalities continued, \n     possibly led to the suicide bombing of the Marine barracks on \n     October 23, 1983, causing the deaths of 241 members of the \n     Armed Forces of the United States.\n       (14) It is essential that the President alone have the \n     ability to formulate foreign policy and engage in diplomacy.\n       (15) The offices of the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives and the Majority Leader of the Senate are \n     positions of special responsibility, seen as \n     ``authoritative'' by foreign governments, and thus, the \n     Speaker of the House and the Majority Leader of the Senate \n     should be held accountable for actions that may be seen by \n     foreign governments as contrary to the foreign policy goals \n     of the President.\n       (16) Recent actions by Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, \n     whether intentionally or unintentionally, have undermined the \n     President's foreign policy toward Syria by giving a false \n     impression of the positions of the United States and Israel \n     on negotiations with the Government of Syria.\n       (17) It is essential that Members of Congress be viewed as \n     supportive of the President's execution of foreign policy.\n       (18) It is harmful and dangerous for the executive power of \n     the President to be subjugated by Congress.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) it is not in the interests of the United States for \n     Members of Congress to intervene in disputes between the \n     United States Government and governments of foreign countries \n     without the authorization of the President; and\n       (2) Members of Congress should heed the foreign policies of \n     the President while traveling outside the United States and \n     meeting with foreign governments.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 880. Mr. INHOFE (for himself and Mr. Craig) submitted an amendment \nintended to be proposed by him to the bill S. 372, to authorize \nappropriations for fiscal year 2007 for the intelligence and \nintelligence-related activities of the United States Government, the \nIntelligence Community Management Account, and the Central Intelligence \nAgency Retirement and Disability System, and for other purposes; which \nwas ordered to lie on the table; as follows:\n\n       At the end, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING PRESIDENTIAL AUTHORITY \n                   TO CONTROL FOREIGN POLICY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Article II, section 1 of the Constitution of the United \n     States grants ``executive Power'' to the President of the \n     United States.\n       (2) James Madison wrote in Federalist No. 47 that Charles \n     de Montesquieu was ``[t]he oracle who is always consulted and \n     cited'' on\n\n[[Page S4548]]\n\n     issues dealing with separation of powers, and, in ``The \n     Spirit of the Laws'', Montesquieu defined the executive power \n     ``in respect to things dependent on the law of nations'' and \n     as the power by which the ``magistrate . . . makes peace or \n     war, sends or receives embassies, establishes the public \n     security, and provides against invasions''.\n       (3) In a speech to Congress in 1789, James Madison noted \n     that the ``association of the Senate with the President in \n     exercising [the appointment] function, is an exception to \n     this general rule [that executive power is vested solely in \n     the President]; and exceptions to general rules . . . are \n     ever to be taken strictly''.\n       (4) In 1790, Thomas Jefferson wrote, ``The transaction of \n     business with foreign nations is executive altogether. It \n     belongs, then, to the head of that department, except as to \n     such portions of it as are specially submitted to the Senate. \n     Exceptions are to be construed strictly.''.\n       (5) Alexander Hamilton reaffirmed this view in 1793, \n     asserting ``that as the participation of the Senate in the \n     making of treaties, and the power of the legislature to \n     declare war, are exceptions out of the general `executive \n     power' vested in the President, they are to be construed \n     strictly, and ought to be extended no further than is \n     essential to their execution''.\n       (6) John Marshall, during his congressional term in 1799, \n     reaffirmed that the President was ``the sole organ of the \n     nation in its external relations'' because ``[h]e possesses \n     the whole Executive Power''.\n       (7) In 1936, the Supreme Court, in United States v. \n     Curtiss-Wright Export Corporation, 299 U.S. 304, stated, \n     ``Not only, as we have shown, is the federal power over \n     external affairs in origin and essential character different \n     from that over internal affairs, but participation in the \n     exercise of the power is significantly limited. In this vast \n     external realm, with its important, complicated, delicate and \n     manifold problems, the President alone has the power to speak \n     or listen as a representative of the nation. He makes \n     treaties with the advise and consent of the Senate; but he \n     alone negotiates. Into the field of negotiation the Senate \n     cannot intrude, and Congress itself is powerless to invade \n     it.''.\n       (8) Section 953 of title 18, United States Code, originally \n     enacted in 1799 as the Logan Act (1 Stat. 613), states, ``Any \n     citizen of the United States, wherever he may be, who, \n     without authority of the United States, directly or \n     indirectly commences or carries on any correspondence or \n     intercourse with any foreign government or any officer or \n     agent thereof, with intent to influence the measures or \n     conduct of any foreign government or of any officer or agent \n     thereof, in relation to any disputes or controversies with \n     the United States, or to defeat the measures of the United \n     States, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not \n     more than three years, or both. This section shall not \n     abridge the right of a citizen to apply himself, or his \n     agent, to any foreign government, or the agents thereof, for \n     redress of any injury which he may have sustained from such \n     government or any of its agents or subjects.''.\n       (9) In 1952, Senator Arthur Vandenberg asserted that \n     ``politics stop at the water's edge''.\n       (10) Intrusions on the executive power of the President by \n     Members of Congress have had negative effects on foreign \n     policy, and, in the past, some Members of Congress have tried \n     to subvert the goals and aims of the executive branch by \n     pursuing foreign policy goals that are contrary to those of \n     the President.\n       (11) In 1987 and 1988, Speaker of the House Jim Wright \n     attempted to engage in diplomacy between the Sandinista \n     Government of Nicaragua and the Contra regime against the \n     expressed aims of President Ronald Reagan. Speaker Wright's \n     actions undermined the authority and leveraging power of the \n     President at a crucial time in the Nation's history and also \n     ignored the finding of the Permanent Select Committee on \n     Intelligence of the House of Representatives that the \n     Government of Nicaragua was planning to use military force \n     against coterminous states.\n       (12) In 1980, Representative Charlie Wilson began urging \n     the Central Intelligence Agency to arm Afghani mujahideen \n     fighters. The decision to double funding to Afghanistan was \n     unsolicited and was made without the knowledge of the \n     President. The book ``Charlie Wilson's War'', written by \n     George Crile, asserts that Representative Wilson thus \n     violated the Logan Act.\n       (13) In 1983, the decision of Congress to attach a \n     stipulation to legislation authorizing the extension of the \n     presence of the Marines in Beirut, which stated that the \n     extension could be withdrawn if fatalities continued, \n     possibly led to the suicide bombing of the Marine barracks on \n     October 23, 1983, causing the deaths of 241 members of the \n     Armed Forces of the United States.\n       (14) It is essential that the President alone have the \n     ability to formulate foreign policy and engage in diplomacy.\n       (15) The offices of the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives and the Majority Leader of the Senate are \n     positions of special responsibility, seen as \n     ``authoritative'' by foreign governments, and thus, the \n     Speaker of the House and the Majority Leader of the Senate \n     should be held accountable for actions that may be seen by \n     foreign governments as contrary to the foreign policy goals \n     of the President.\n       (16) Recent actions by Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, \n     whether intentionally or unintentionally, have undermined the \n     President's foreign policy toward Syria by giving a false \n     impression of the positions of the United States and Israel \n     on negotiations with the Government of Syria.\n       (17) It is essential that Members of Congress be viewed as \n     supportive of the President's execution of foreign policy.\n       (18) It is harmful and dangerous for the executive power of \n     the President to be subjugated by Congress.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) it is not in the interests of the United States for \n     Members of Congress to intervene in disputes between the \n     United States Government and governments of foreign countries \n     without the authorization of the President; and\n       (2) Members of Congress should heed the foreign policies of \n     the President while traveling outside the United States and \n     meeting with foreign governments.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 881.

This is a very small gesture of condolence and support \nfrom our body, but I think it is a very appropriate one, and I am \npleased to be one of the cosponsors of it.
