We have, in Senators Bingaman \nand Domenici, two real professionals in this body. They are both from \nthe same State, both on the same committee, one is chairman and one is \nranking on the committee, and that has gone back and forth in recent \nyears. So I am confident we can move toward resolving this issue.\n  The other issue that is difficult that we need to work on is dealing \nwith the efficiency of automobiles, the CAFE aspect of the bill. There \nshould be an amendment laid down by Senator Levin on that matter. He \nthought he could do that today, so perhaps, when we dispose of this, we \ncan move to that.\n  These are the two big issues, as I see them. There are other \nimportant issues, such as coal and gas, that a number of Senators want \nto debate, and we can do that. It is an important bill and, I repeat, a \nbipartisan bill. This is not a Democratic bill or a Republican bill. \nThe only matters that came before the Senate were bipartisan bills that \nwere reported out of the various committees, and we put those together \nand that is what is now on the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/14/senate-section/article/S7679-7", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7679-S7680]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, today I am very proud and honored to \ncosponsor legislation along with my colleagues, Senators Conrad, \nHarkin, and several Members of the Senate Rural Health Care Caucus, to \nhonor Senator Craig Thomas.\n  The bill is the Craig Thomas Rural Hospital and Provider Equity Act. \nAs we all know, last week the Senate lost a steady hand and man who has \ndone much for his State of Wyoming. Craig was dependable in the finest \nsense of the word. He was the epitome of what I believe a Senator \nshould be.\n  On a personal note, he was not only a colleague but a dear friend, \nand I will cherish that always. He was also a fellow marine. In this \ncase, Semper Fidelis, ``always faithful,'' is always appropriate. If \nanyone faced trouble in their life, the one person they would want by \ntheir side riding shotgun would be Craig Thomas. The people of Wyoming \nand all of Craig's colleagues knew that he fought for rural America and \nalways put the needs of his State above all else.\n  On the health care front, Craig was truly a champion for \nstrengthening our rural health care delivery system and provided much \nneeded relief to our hospitals and other providers in our rural areas. \nHe served for 10 years as the cochair of the Senate Rural Health Care \nCaucus. He actually took the reins over as cochair after my fellow \nKansan, Senator Bob Dole, retired from the Senate. As I know \npersonally, certainly, it is hard to follow in the footsteps of Senator \nDole. But Craig Thomas did this with great ease and with great pride. \nHis steady leadership put the caucus on the map, and he made great \nstrides in showing all of our colleagues the true needs of rural health \ncare. I know the members of the caucus will miss him and his leadership \ngreatly.\n  One of the biggest accomplishments for Craig in the Rural Health Care \nCaucus was passage of the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003, which \nprovided a big boost to our rural hospitals and our providers. Never \nbefore have I seen such recognition and support for our colleagues from \nall geographical areas--large, small, urban, rural--for including these \nbadly needed rural health care provisions.\n  However, you would never know that it was Craig Thomas's hard behind-\nthe-scenes work that caused these rural health care provisions to be \nincluded in the Medicare bill. Craig Thomas was more concerned with \ngetting the work done rather than taking any credit. So instead of \ntaking individual credit for his hard work and dedication on the \nMedicare bill, Craig simply applauded the entire Senate Rural Health \nCare Caucus and patted everybody else on the back--so typical of Craig.\n  However, Craig knew that while the passage of the Medicare bill was a \ngiant step for rural health, we still have much more work to do to \nensure our rural health care system can continue to survive. That is \nwhy we are proud and honored to carry on his legacy by introducing the \nCraig Thomas Rural Hospital and Provider Equity Act.\n  Craig and his staff have worked extremely hard over the last 6 \nmonths, getting this bill together, working with other members of the \nRural Health Care Caucus to identify their top priorities. I thank his \nhealth staffer, Erin Tuggle, for being such a champion alongside of \nCraig. I know my staff worked extremely closely with Erin, as many \nothers in the Senate staff have done. I have a great amount of respect \nfor her hard work. Erin, we are proud of you and we thank you for \neverything you have done on behalf of rural health care.\n  We had actually planned to introduce this legislation last week with \nCraig leading the charge, but now Senators Conrad, Harkin, and I and \nthe other members of the Rural Health Care Caucus will do our best to \nlead in his absence. I have made a personal commitment to making sure \nwe get this bill done and ultimately provide the much needed relief to \nour rural communities.\n  The Craig Thomas Rural Hospital and Provider Equity Act recognizes \nthat rural health care providers have very different needs than their \nurban counterparts and that health care is not one size fits all.\n  The Craig Thomas Rural Hospital and Provider Equity Act of 2007, \nmakes changes to Medicare regulations for rural hospitals and providers \nrecognizing the difficulty in achieving the same economies of scale as \nlarge urban facilities. This legislation equalizes Medicare \ndisproportionate share hospital payments to bring rural hospitals in \nline with urban facilities. This bill provides additional assistance \nfor small, rural hospitals who have a low volume of patients. Often, \nthese hospitals have trouble making ends meet under the Medicare \npayment system.\n  The Craig Thomas Rural Hospital and Provider Equity Act also provides \na capital infrastructure loan program to make loans available to help \nrural facilities improve crumbling buildings and infrastructure. In \naddition, rural providers can apply to receive planning grants to help \nassess capital and infrastructure needs.\n  The bill extends to January 1, 2010, two incentive programs aimed at \nimproving the quality of care by attracting health care providers to \nhealth professional shortage areas. The first is the Medicare Incentive \nPayment Program, which provides 10 percent bonus payments to physicians \npracticing in shortage areas. The second is the physician fee schedule \nwork geographic adjustment, which brings rural doctors' Medicare fee \nschedules for wages more in line with urban doctors'.\n\n  This bill also recognizes that other providers play a great role in \nthe rural health delivery system. Our bill increases the payment cap \nfor rural health clinics to keep them in line with community health \ncenters, provides a 5-percent add-on payment for rural home health \nservices and provides a 5-percent add-on payment for ground ambulance \nservices in rural areas.\n  One of the provisions in the bill Senator Thomas particularly \nchampioned is a provision to allow marriage and family therapists and \nlicensed professional counselors to bill Medicare for their services \nand be paid the rate of social workers.\n  Currently, the Medicare Program only permits psychiatrists, \npsychologists, social workers, and clinical nurse specialists to bill \nMedicare for mental health services provided to seniors. However, most \nrural counties do not have a psychiatrist or a psychologist. Marriage \nand family therapists and licensed professional counselors are much \nmore likely to practice in a rural setting and are often the only \nmental health professionals available.\n\n[[Page S7681]]\n\n  Finally, this bill uses technology to improve home health services \nand quality for care by creating a pilot program providing incentives \nfor home health agencies to purchase and utilize home monitoring and \ncommunications technologies and facilitates telehealth services across \nState lines.\n  Mr. President, today I am proud and honored to co-author this bill on \nbehalf of Craig Thomas. We all miss him greatly as a personal friend, \nconfidant, and strong supporter. Our thoughts and prayers are with his \nwife Susan, his sons Patrick and Greg, and his daughter Lexie. With \nthis legislation, Craig is still with us.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask for 2 minutes as in morning \nbusiness.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Senator, let me say before you leave, first, I would \nappreciate it if you would add me to the legislation, and, second, I \nthank you so much for doing this, for offering this piece of \nlegislation. That is the best we can do. We can't bring him back--we \ncan't do much. We just hope everything will go well with his family, \nand this will be something that in truth indicates how much we cared \nfor him and what a true gentleman he was--strong of will and yet very \nkind and decent. We want to do this in his behalf. Thank you for doing \nit.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I would like to associate myself with the \nremarks of the distinguished Senator from New Mexico, who is himself a \nstrong champion for rural health care, and thank him very much for \nthose personal remarks that are shared by every Member of this Senate.\n  I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me just recount the state of play \nand where we are. I have just spoken to my colleague, Senator Domenici. \nI advise all Senators and their staffs we are still hung up on the two \nproposals that relate to requiring utilities to produce a larger amount \nof their energy from renewables. The amendment I offered, which is \ndesignated the renewable portfolio standard, requires 15 percent for \nrenewable sources. The amendment offered on behalf of Senator Domenici, \nwhich has a different base against which it is applied--but it has a \nrequirement of 20 percent against that different base and has a wider \nlist of ways that people can meet that requirement, a wider set of \noptions available--is a second-degree amendment to my amendment.\n  It would be my hope that we could get a vote on both amendments today \nand move on to other items on the bill. This is a very important part \nof what we are trying to accomplish with this legislation, so I hope \nvery much we can do that.\n  I do have a unanimous consent request that I will propound at this \npoint.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the time between now and 11 a.m. this \nmorning be for debate with respect to the pending amendments, with the \ntime equally divided and controlled between myself and Senator Domenici \nor our designees; that no other amendments be in order prior to the \nvote; and that at 11 a.m., without further intervening action, the \nSenate proceed to a vote in relation to the Domenici second-degree \namendment, to be followed by a vote in relation to the Bingaman \namendment, as amended, if amended.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I object, Mr. President.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, in light of the objection, I have no \nchoice but to move to table the Domenici amendment, which I intend to \ndo sometime after 11 o'clock. I understand there are committees meeting \nright now in important sessions, so I am not going to make that motion \nright now, but I expect to sometime after 11 o'clock. Then the Senate \nwill be able at that point to go on record as to their views on the \nDomenici amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The senior Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I want all the Senators who are concerned about this \nlegislation, concerned about what they think might happen that is not \ngood if, in fact, the Bingaman portfolio mandates become law, to \nunderstand I am holding down the amendments. Certainly we can, if they \nwish--many of our Members do wish to--not let the Bingaman amendment \ncome up for a long time. We can do that. But we cannot then keep \nSenator Bingaman from tabling my amendment. There will be a motion to \ntable, if that is what he desires to do, sometime before noon, if that \nis the time he desires. I wish he wouldn't do that. I would prefer we \nhave a vote on ours and a vote on his. We have asked for that, side by \nside, with 60 votes on each one. That would be satisfactory to me. But \nthat doesn't seem to be satisfactory to Senator Bingaman, which I \nthoroughly understand.\n  With that, those who want to speak against Senator Bingaman's \namendment or in favor of the Domenici amendment, we gladly, on our \nside, accept anything you would like to say. Come down here before 11, \nor shortly after 11, and you will be heard. For those who want to be \npart of what is normally called a filibuster, or delaying tactic, and \nhave asked me to be here with you, I do not mind doing that. In fact, \nthat is my job.\n  I think some of you should come down and speak and be heard on the \nmatter. I wish you would.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Obama.) The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I wanted to speak in favor of the Bingaman \namendment. I have worked with Senator Bingaman not just in this \niteration of our energy policy choices but also previously as a member \nof the Energy Committee when we put together an EPAct 2005.\n  My belief is we ought to manifest change here, and the change with \nrespect to the proposal offered by my colleague, Senator Bingaman, is \nto require that 15 percent of the electricity that we would generate in \nthe future would come from renewable energy sources. That is change.\n  I do wish to say to my colleague from New Mexico, Senator Domenici, \nwe work together on the Energy and Water appropriations subcommittee, \nand we have a good working relationship. I do not believe he needs to \nin any way injure or demolish the Bingaman amendment in order to \nachieve his goals because, frankly, Senator Domenici has pushed very \nhard, for example, to advance the nuclear energy industry in this \ncountry.\n  In conversation with him, as I have told him, I believe we are going \nto see additional nuclear energy power in this country because we now \ncome to a different intersection. That intersection includes energy and \nclimate change. As a result of climate change being a part of this \ncalculation, I think there will be some additional nuclear energy in \nour country. I might say that Senator Domenici has made a substantial \namount of progress in recent years, both on the policy side and also \nthe appropriations side, in advancing those issues.\n  So the point I would make is this: I do not think one has to in any \nway injure what Senator Bingaman is doing in order to accomplish the \nother pieces that Senator Domenici wishes. Because of that, I do not \nsupport the Domenici amendment which I think injures the center of what \nSenator Bingaman is trying to do, because I support the renewable \nportfolio standard. I do not particularly like that name because it is \nnot a very identifiable name. I used to call it homegrown energy. But \nwhatever it is, it is saying: We need a change.\n  What is that change? Well, let's decide that a portion--15 percent--\nof our electric energy in this country shall come from renewable \nsources. We have the capability of producing renewable energy from a \nvariety of sources: wind energy, biomass, solar, and others. There is \ngreat promise in a number of these areas. Take a look at what Europe is \ndoing in solar energy. Some of the very large solar energy applications \nare very promising and exciting, bringing prices down with substantial \nwidespread development.\n  Let me just mention wind energy for a moment. I know some have said \nthis is only about wind energy, but that is\n\n[[Page S7682]]\n\nnot the case at all. But wind energy does have substantial potential. \nTaking energy from the wind, using the new, advanced, highly capable \nturbines, and using that energy to produce electricity--what a \nwonderful thing that is. In fact, it is not even a new idea. Go to a \nfarmstead that has long since been abandoned and take a look at what \nthe homesteaders did on their farmsteads. They used their wind and \ntheir wind-charger devices to pump water to produce some electricity. \nThis is not a new idea, but the new part of it is the unbelievable \ntechnology leap in turbines, to be able to put up these wind towers and \ntake from the wind the energy through these turbines to produce \nelectricity and extend America's energy supplies.\n  Frankly, you can do even more with them, if you like. For example, we \nhave a project in North Dakota that I have helped create that I am very \nproud of. We are taking energy from the wind to produce electricity and \nusing that electricity in the process of electrolysis--separating \nhydrogen from water and creating a hydrogen fuel and storing the fuel. \nSo think of that. Use a turbine to take energy from the wind and \nproduce hydrogen fuel. That is pretty remarkable. There is so much we \ncan do. Now, I am talking about wind, but you can talk about biomass, \nyou can talk about wood chips, you can talk about all of the biomass \nthat is available in all parts of the country.\n  I know some have said, when talking about wind, that there are \ncertain parts of this country that have a fair amount of wind, other \nparts do not have as much, and in any event, it is an intermittent \nsource of energy. That is true, but that does not deny the fact that \nthere are other kinds of renewable sources of energy, including biomass \nand other forms of energy, that can be used to meet this new standard \nwe ought to be embarking upon. For example, we ought to be encouraging \nsolar energy. That is why this amendment by Senator Bingaman makes so \nmuch sense.\n  There is this old saying: If you do not care where you are, you are \nnever going to be lost. Well, that is true. I mean, if you do not set \nsome standards, you are never going to wonder whether you got there. If \nyou did not decide where you were going and did not care where you \nwere, I guess you will never come up short, will you? But I think the \nentire goal here of trying to put together a new energy policy ought to \nbe change, and change with respect to the production of electricity, in \nmy judgment, would be to say: Let's require 15 percent of our electric \nenergy to come from renewable energy.\n  Now, frankly, a lot of the utility companies around the country are \nmoving aggressively in those areas. I mean, they are moving \naggressively in pursuit of that kind of policy. I commend them. Boy, I \nthink many of them are moving in a way that is something they deserve \ngreat compliments about. They understand renewable energy. Yes, even \nintermittent sources of energy, if you put them together in different \nways, can provide almost a stable source of baseload.\n  So I think this amendment is one of the most important amendments on \nthis Energy bill because it represents profound change. We have only 2 \nor 3 percent of the electricity in this country now produced by \nrenewable sources of energy. We can just blithely go and act as if, you \nknow, things never change and we don't have to worry, we can just be \nhappy and decide we don't want to change in this area, or we can decide \nnow that as we debate the policies, let's try to develop fundamental \nchange. That is what the Bingaman amendment does.\n  I understand the resistance to it. I understand there is always \nresistance to change. That is just a fact. There was an old codger who \nwas once interviewed by a radio station. He was 80-something years old. \nThe radio reporter said to him: Well, you must have seen a lot of \nchanges in your long life. He said: Yep, and I have been against every \none of them. Easiest thing in the world to be against change. In many \nways, it is the most natural thing in the world to be against change.\n  There are two changes here. The change with respect to the 15 \npercent--that change makes great sense. Senator Domenici is also \npursuing change in a different way. I think that makes some sense, \nmoving in other areas, but that should not be done in a way that \ninjuries the Bingaman amendment because I think, as I indicated \npreviously, this issue of clean energy, which represents the addition \nof more hydropower, which I support, which represents the understanding \nwe are going to have additional nuclear energy, which I think most in \nthis body understand given the intersection now of climate change and \nenergy--but that ought not and does not have to come at all at the \nexpense of what Senator Bingaman is promoting with respect to \nfundamental change in the construct of the electric energy that is \ndelivered around this country.\n  Mr. President, it will be a profound disappointment if we go through \na second round of energy policy discussion on the floor of the Senate--\nwe did it a couple of years ago; we are doing it now--it will be a \nprofound disappointment if we are not able to enact what is called a \nrenewable energy standard or renewable portfolio standard. I think one \nwould be able to look at this and say: Well, yes, you talked about \nenergy. Yes, you did some things that were good. But you missed a very \nimportant opportunity. This legislation was brought the floor of the \nSenate on a bipartisan basis; that means the absence of partisanship.\n\n  Senator Bingaman and Senator Domenici, both people who know a lot \nabout energy, both have been leaders of the Energy Committee--I have \nworked with both, and have great regard for both of them. So we did \nnot, in the Energy Committee, push this amendment to have a renewable \nportfolio standard because we knew it would cause a division in what \nwas brought to the floor of the Senate. I think it was almost unanimous \nin the Energy Committee, Republicans and Democrats. Now there is a \ndivision. I don't think so much that it is Republican or Democratic, \nbut there is a division with respect to this larger question: Should \nour electric energy reflect a change in how it is produced? Should we \nrequire those who produce electricity in this country to produce 15 \npercent of it from renewable sources--solar, hydro and wind and biomass \nand so on? The answer ought to be a resounding yes. It ought to come in \na chorus from this Senate because it reflects exactly the right kind of \nchange.\n  The question my colleague, Senator Domenici, is asking with his \nsecond-degree is one that, in my judgment, I would prefer he ask \nwithout injuring the Bingaman proposal. I don't think we have to try to \ndefeat a 15-percent requirement in order to say we believe there are \nconstructive choices ahead of us with respect to other forms of energy.\n  That is why I hope--I know there is this discussion about, we ought \nnot to have two votes, a vote on the Bingaman amendment and a vote on \nwhat I believe is a second-degree, and each should require 60 votes. I \ndon't support that at all. That does not make any sense. Let's try now \nto do two things. Let's try, in this area of constructing energy \npolicy, to pass the Bingaman amendment which reflects real change. The \nconstruct of our electric production in this country ought to be 15 \npercent from renewables. If we cannot do that, then we are not going to \nmake great progress in changing energy policy. After we do that, I \nwould hope we could talk about Senator Domenici's aspirations. Could we \nuse more hydropower? Sure. Do I support that? Yes, absolutely. Are we \non the road to additional nuclear energy? Absolutely, and much to the \ncredit of his work in the authorizing and the Appropriations Committee. \nBut that need not be done at the expense of a policy that says: We \nought to, as a matter of course in this country, require 15 percent of \nour electricity to come from renewable sources.\n  You know, this whole energy issue is interesting. I mentioned the \nother day that we just take it all for granted. Every single day, we \nget up in the morning and we just flip a switch; normally it is down, \nwe put it up. All of a sudden, there are lights. We plug something into \na wall which looks like an ordinary wall, with a couple of holes in it, \nand all of a sudden, you can shave or you can run a hair dryer, you can \nrun an electric toothbrush. Through the rest of our entire day, it is \nall about energy. We just take it for granted until it does not exist. \nWhen that energy does not exist, our lives change.\n\n[[Page S7683]]\n\nThe water is not hot--there are so many things in our lives that come \nfrom energy, and we just take it all for granted.\n  Sixty percent of our oil comes from off our shore, much of it from \nvery troubled parts of the world. We want to deal with that. We produce \na substantial amount of electricity, and we now understand there is an \nintersection between the energy production and also climate change in \nour country that we have to address, not just in our country but on \nthis planet. So we bring a bill to the floor that has portions of each. \nThis is not so much a climate change bill as it is an energy bill, but \nit reflects in the bill itself--recognizes where we are headed as a \nCongress with respect to all of it.\n  I have said previously and I believe that we will continue to use \nfossil fuels--coal, oil, and natural gas. That is just the fact. The \nquestion is not whether we use them; it is how we use them. That is why \nsome of us are offering amendments. I will work on the appropriations \nside on the issue of clean power and the issue of clean coal technology \nand so on. But even as we do that, as we decide we will continue to use \nfossil fuels, we should not embrace the same old nonsense we have heard \nfor decades around here; that is, real men dig and drill. If you are a \nreal man, you dig and drill. If you are talking about renewables, \nsomebody can pat you on the forehead and say: Good try. Its kind of a \nsoftheaded thing to be talking about, but it does not have the \nequivalence of understanding that you need to dig and drill for \nAmerica's future. Yes, we need to dig some. Yes, we need to drill some. \nWe are going to use fossil fuels. But we need to understand that \nrenewables are no longer just some sort of sideshow. Renewable energy \nis a significant part of our capability. If we do not exercise that \ncapability and use it in a way that benefits our energy supply and also \nbenefits the climate change issues we confront, then we will have \nfallen far short of what we should do.\n  I see my colleague from Idaho is here. I wanted to mention that he \nhas spoken on the floor about the need to increase supply, and he and I \nagree on that. We introduced a piece of legislation called the SAFE Act \nwhich supports increased automobile efficiency. It also supports \nincreased production of fossil fuels, of oil.\n\n  I see Senator Craig in the Chamber. He and I are filing an amendment \nthat deals with the increased production recommendations we had \npreviously made in legislation that is called the SAFE Act, Security \nand Fuel Efficiency Energy Act. It would authorize additional \nproduction, particularly in the Gulf of Mexico where the greatest \npotential production exists. From my standpoint, Senator Craig and I \nhave had long discussions about this. We have filed the amendment. My \nexpectation is I would not call that particular amendment up. From what \nwe have learned in the Chamber, I don't think we have the capability to \nget the votes for that particular amendment.\n  I believe filing it is important to say this: We need to do a lot of \nthings well, and we need to do a lot of things right in order to \naddress the energy issue. Part of it is conservation. Part of it is \nefficiency. Part of it is production. There exists substantial \nadditional production capability in the Gulf of Mexico that is untapped \nthat I believe we ought to consider for additional production. Senator \nCraig and I have worked on that.\n  The amendment is filed. It is likely we will not call it up for \nconsideration because we do not have the capability to get that enacted \nin the Senate. Everything has a maturity date, and this is short of \nthat date. But because the Senator from Idaho came on the floor, I \nwanted to mention that important issue.\n  Energy legislation that works for this country is balanced \nlegislation which balances a range of issues.\n  I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I thank the Senator for yielding. I appreciate the filing \nof that amendment.\n  What Americans are frustrated by--and I think the Senator realizes \nthat--is the lack of balance. He and I have said that. We can conserve \nand we can change and we can adjust and we can adapt, but we also have \nto produce, and that brings the balance. I think what you and I did \nvery early this year helped drive the debate that is on the floor now, \nwhen we looked at biofuels and efficiencies and production in the SAFE \nAct and began to argue and articulate those points of view. I thank the \nSenator for filing that amendment because that completes a very \nnecessary package that brings us to the reality of what Americans want \nfrom their energy portfolio.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me thank my colleague. I have been \npleased to work with him. Both of us have been putting together a piece \nof legislation we introduced earlier this year. We believe there needs \nto be some significant balance. We support conservation. We support \nefficiency and additional production, all with appropriate safeguards \nand restrictions.\n  Finally, the amendment offered by Senator Bingaman, I believe Senator \nBingaman and Senator Domenici, the chairman and ranking member of the \nEnergy Committee, have done a good job in bringing a bill to the floor \nthat allows us early on this year, in June, to debate an energy policy \nso we can get something through the Congress. This is a good bill. It \nis not the best bill, necessarily, but it is an awfully good bill. I \ncommend their work. I believe we will lose something important if we \nget involved in this debate about the Bingaman amendment, the 15-\npercent RPS, and we decide we can't move in that direction.\n  There is a Cherokee Indian chief who once said: The success of a rain \ndance depends a lot on the timing. Timing is everything. That is \nespecially true in a public policy debate. We have been at this for a \nlong while talking about a requirement, a mandate that a certain \nportion of what we produce for electricity come from renewables. The \nonly way we are going to get there is to pass legislation to do it. \nSenator Bingaman proposes--and I support, as do others--a 15-percent \nrequirement. It adds to the bill. It creates an important public policy \nchange that will add to this bill in a way that tells the American \npeople: We are about constructive change for energy security. I hope \nvery much we can pass this amendment.\n  People need to understand, while Senator Domenici has offered his as \na second degree, some of what he is trying to do makes a lot of sense \nto me and is being done in other venues and should be done in other \ncircumstances and can be done exclusive of the Bingaman amendment. What \nhe aspires to do and what I support, in many cases, ought not be done \nat the expense of obliterating the 15-percent RPS that Senator Bingaman \nand I and others are trying to get done. I hope we can move on at some \npoint, have an up-or-down vote on the Bingaman amendment, and add \nsomething in policy to this energy bill that all of us will be proud of \nin the future.\n  There are many utilities moving in this direction, probably not quite \nthis aggressively, but they are moving in this direction because they \ntoo believe this is essentially good public policy. My hope is the \nBingaman amendment will be approved by the Senate, perhaps today, and \nall of us will believe we have significantly strengthened the Energy \nbill we are considering today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, the debate that has had the Senate occupied \nfor the last several days is a fundamentally very important debate, for \nnot only this Senate but certainly for the American people. There are a \nvariety of things that have grasped the attention of the American \nconsumer at this moment. Obviously immigration has been one, and we \nhave been aggressively involved in that in the Senate the last month. \nThe other thing happens weekly, when that consumer goes to the gas pump \nand pulls his or her car up and fills it. All of a sudden, they pay a \n$45 or a $50 or a $60 or a $70 fuel bill. They say: My goodness, how am \nI going to readjust my family budget to fit these kinds of needs?\n  The broad bill we have before us is in part attempting to address \nthat issue. There is no question about that. We are working very hard \nto get this country back into the business of production but in a \ndiversified way. That is important. We should not be held hostage by \nforeign energy suppliers. Yet over the years we have drifted into that \nenvironment for a lot of reasons, some of them of our own doing, \nbecause we constantly restricted our own ability to\n\n[[Page S7684]]\n\nproduce and we have set standards that make it much more expensive to \nproduce. Some of that production has gone offshore. But we have also \ngrown, and we demand more. We have larger cars, and that is our choice \nin the marketplace.\n  At the same time the American consumer is being hit by pump shock \ntoday, or nozzle shock, whatever you want to call it, in the reality of \nwhat we are about.\n  On the electricity side of the issue--because that is a bit more \nsubtle, because that bill doesn't happen every day or every other day \nor twice a week at the pump by the digits rolling in the pump to show \nyou what it is going to cost you--it comes once a month in a power bill \nor it may even be automatically deducted from your checking account. \nThe subtlety of energy costs from the electrical side are less, but \nthey are still very real. In creating an abundant electrical market, we \nought to be extremely careful that we don't limit it in a way that \ncontinually drives up the cost of electrical production.\n  We have said, and we are continuing to say, the old concepts of \nelectrical production are largely out or at least they aren't as clean \nas we want them to be. Because in the context of this whole energy \ndebate, several years ago entered the concern about climate change, \ntherefore, the emission of greenhouse gases that some believe are a \nmajor contributor to the warming of our globe. That is in dispute. I \nbelieve it is legitimately in dispute as to what or how or in what \nvolume greenhouse gases play to climate change and warming, but the \nreality is, Americans say today: It has to be clean, or you shouldn't \nproduce it. So we are now on the floor debating, if you will, \ncleanliness. Some years ago we started talking about that and we said: \nWell, the only way, 10 or 12 years ago, you could get clean into your \nelectrical production was wind and solar.\n  In the Clinton years, because of the environmental movement and the \npower they had over that administration, they no longer said hydro is \nallowed to be considered a renewable or a clean fuel. It is an anomaly \nof the past, and it dams up rivers and changes the ecosystems of \naquacultures. We can't go there anymore. So they pulled hydro out of \nthe mix and out of the blend. As a result, it doesn't get fitted into \nthe environment of a renewable portfolio standard of the kind we are \ndebating today.\n  What evolved out of a 1990s debate to today is a standard we call RPS \nthe Senator from New Mexico has introduced, and it is largely a wind \nstandard. Yes, it includes biofuels, but it is dominantly driven by \nwind today. It creates a unique niche in the electrical market for \nwind, and it subsidizes wind. It requires that to meet the standard, \nyou pretty much have to go wind.\n  I have not disagreed in total with it in the past, although I have \nopposed it because I think it is an arbitrary act on the part of \nGovernment to distort the marketplace. But at the same time there is no \nquestion, through tax subsidy, a tax credit, that we have, in fact, \ndriven the marketplace toward wind. That was then. What is now?\n  The world has changed since the mid-1990s, since the concept of RPS. \nBut we are still here having a 1990s debate when we ought to be having \na 2010 and a 2020 debate. That debate is not all about renewable and \nall about wind. It is partially about it, but it is not all about it. \nToday it is about wind, biomass, biofuels in a lot of forms, nuclear--\nclean, nonemitting sources. It is about new hydro efficiencies. We are \nlearning very rapidly that efficiencies in the marketplace can create \nquantum leaps in savings and, therefore, less growth rate in demand of \nproduction.\n  All of those ought to be a part of a test today, if we are going to \nestablish national policy. If we are going to demand certain levels of \nperformance out of the production side of our utility industry, our \nelectrical industry, then we ought to be balanced. We ought to be \nbroader and, most importantly, we ought to use a new, modern \ndefinition, a new, modern screen, a measurement. I don't think it is \nRPS anymore. I think it is clean.\n  Having said all of that, if RPS survives this debate, here is what is \ngoing to happen. It is going to be a very expensive trip for the \nconsumer and the taxpayer. If RPS survives and we don't move to a newer \nstandard and we put into place the kinds of demands that take us to a \n15-percent requirement and then we turn to the Finance Committee, I \nbelieve Senator Baucus and Senator Grassley--and we will debate that as \nit relates to wind energy and a tax credit on a 1, 3, 5, sometimes 10 \nyears, someday probably a 10-year involvement--what will it cost? It is \nestimated it could cost $3 billion, $5 billion, $10 billion, $15 \nbillion, in a direct Government subsidy, a tax credit, to produce the \nRPS requirement that is being proposed.\n  Fairness is fair. A CPS requirement will cost some money. We are \nhaving it costed out today. We don't believe it will be anywhere near \nas dramatic, because it will be spread amongst a much broader portfolio \nthan the narrowest of an RPS. Is this an expensive process? You bet it \nis. When you enter a new technology into the market that isn't as \nefficient or competitive, you subsidize it.\n  That is what we are doing with wind today. But we are creating a new \nuniqueness. We are saying: OK, here is a market niche for your wind. We \nare going to give you some of the market. Then we are going to give you \ntax credits and benefits to get into the market because we want you \nproducing wind. So we are creating a very unique market niche, and we \nare saying to all the utilities: You have to meet it.\n  Well, 23 States are already out in front of us. They have some form \nof RPS or renewable portfolio standard. Some of them are higher than \nthe Bingaman standard, some of them are lower. But there is a movement \nout there, and there ought to be flexibility in that movement, instead \nof the rigidity that is the reality of the current RPS. That is what we \noffer in a CPS or a clean portfolio standard--broaden the base, get \nmodern, let's do not keep regurgitating the past.\n  I am always amazed that once one group--any group, any interest \ngroup--locks on to an idea they can capture the mind with, and they \nride that idea for decades, sometimes when it no longer fits the \ntechnology of the day or the demands of the marketplace. I believe RPS \nis that idea that got locked on to in the mid-1990s that no longer fits \nthe marketplace today. I do believe CPS fits the climate change \nconcern, fits the regional disparity as a result of the geography of \nour country, where there is wind and no wind. I tell some of my \nsouthern Senator friends there is a lot of hot air in the South but \nthere is not any wind. Well, there is not any wind in the South. So \nthey have to go out and buy it.\n  You have utilities in Florida buying wind farms out in the Midwest. \nIs that somehow going to make Florida cleaner? Why don't we give \nFlorida the opportunity to build clean energy right in Florida, instead \nof buying something out in the Midwest to offset? It is a strange \nthing. It is kind of like: Well, we believe in a very green standard. \nYou are going to have to buy your way in if you cannot produce your way \nin.\n  I disagree with that. I think you ought to be able to produce your \nway in. I do not mind clean standards, but I do not think you ought to \ndisadvantage certain regions of the country by the standard you are \nrequiring. CPS changes that. It says we are requiring a cleaner \nstandard in new production. You can do it through wind, as the Senator \nfrom New Mexico is proposing; you can do it through biomass; you can do \nit through new nuclear; you can do it through new hydro; You can do it \nthrough new efficiencies. If someday--and I believe it will--coal to \nliquids comes on line, you can do it through carbon sequestration or, \nultimately, we may be able to retrofit our existing coal-fired \ngeneration facilities in a way to capture that carbon and sequester it. \nIf we can, shouldn't they get credit for it? Shouldn't there be some \nbenefit for cleaning up the air, instead of letting that remain dirty, \nbut you buy your way out of it by going somewhere else to buy something \nthat is clean?\n  That is an interesting concept, but that is the concept if you do not \nidentify with the marketplace and you do not identify with the regions \nand the capability of the regions and the uniqueness of our country \ntoday. That is why Southern Senators are frustrated at this moment, \nbecause the amendment on RPS says you cannot do it by what we say so \nyou have to go somewhere else and buy it.\n\n[[Page S7685]]\n\n  Let's make the standard uniform. Let's make it fit all parties. Let's \nallow it to reflect the diversity of the countryside and the resource \nthat is available in the countryside. We think that is possible. We \nthink if you do it, it is less expensive than the RPS that is currently \nbeing proposed.\n  Here is what I am suggesting to those who are a little concerned \nabout budget exposure because we have not seen what the Finance \nCommittee will do. But if the Finance Committee brings about the tax \ncredits that we think for a 1-, a 3-, and a 5- and someday a 10-year \nreality, that cost could be $3 billion, $5 billion, $10 billion, $15 \nbillion. Current law is here. Future law could well be here based on \nwhat we think the Finance Committee will offer. So we create the \nmarketplace niche today for wind, and tomorrow we finance it. It is a \nvery expensive proposition.\n  I have wind farms coming up in Idaho, and I am glad they are there, \nand they are going to blend and be a part of our overall economy. I am \nall for wind, but I am not just for wind. Again, it is a concept whose \nday has matured. It is an idea that now fits well beyond the 1990s into \nthe year 2000 and beyond, as new concepts come on board.\n  In other words, let's get modern. Let's build a policy for the \nfuture. Let's don't simply react to the past because the interest \ngroups of the past are still here driving it. Let's think beyond that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, before the Senator from Idaho leaves the \nfloor, I wish to make a short statement and then pose a question to him \nso I am sure we are understanding things correctly.\n  My short statement is that the Energy Information Administration has \nmade it clear they see the main beneficiaries of the renewable \nportfolio standard proposal I have put forward--not as wind--they see \nthe increase in wind capacity at 50 percent, but they say biomass will \nincrease 300 percent. Beyond that, they recognize biomass currently \nproduces more electricity--about twice as much electricity--as does \nwind. So they see a dramatic increase in biomass, which the Southeast \npart of the country has a great deal of. They also project a 500-\npercent increase in electricity production from solar power.\n  But to the point the chart makes that the Senator from Idaho has in \nthe Chamber, first of all, there are two ways--Mr. President, this is \nin preface to a question I am going to pose to the Senator from Idaho. \nThere are two ways we are trying to stimulate more use of renewable \nenergy and more production of renewable energy. One is through the Tax \nCode. As he points out, there are various tax credits--the production \ntax credit, the investment tax credit for various kinds of renewable \nenergy. The other is through what I have proposed here, which is the \nrenewable portfolio standard, which is a requirement that utilities \nproduce power from these sources.\n  Now, if we just do the tax provisions, and do not do the renewable \nportfolio standard, then that is what is indicated on the bottom line \nof the chart, as I understand it. You get the substantial increase in \nbudget impacts--that the red line reflects--if you do both, if you do \nthe tax provisions and you also do the renewable portfolio standard \nbecause the renewable portfolio standard will ensure that more people \nqualify for the tax credits because you are going to be producing more \nelectricity from solar, you are going to be producing more electricity \nfrom wind, you are going to be producing more electricity from biomass. \nEvery time you do, it costs the Federal Treasury because that new \nenergy is eligible for these tax credits.\n\n  Am I understanding correctly that is why the budget impact is \nreflected as it is there?\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, that is my understanding, I say to the \nSenator, if there is a renewal of the tax credit based on what we think \nFinance will do. Here is the problem--\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me ask another question. Does the \nchart the Senator from Idaho has on the floor assume there is a renewal \nof the tax credit or that the tax credit expires?\n  Mr. CRAIG. It assumes there is a renewal of it. Because what you do, \nwhat you know you are doing, if your policy becomes law--there is no \nopt out at this point--you drive the entire national utility \nmarketplace to a standard. By driving them there, you give them this \nopportunity, and it is a U.S. tax opportunity. There is no question \nthat is the tax credit. You must go here. And when you go there, you \ncan identify with the tax credit under the assumption--and that is \nfair--the Finance Committee is going to come forth with it. And we have \nevery reason to believe they will.\n  That is what drives it. The reason it does is because, if you do not, \nyou put the industry in a very precarious situation. Wind today does \nnot pay its way. It is still on the margin. Based on its productivity \nin certain wind patterns, it has to be subsidized to fit into the \nmarket. How you subsidize it is through the credit, or you are simply \nsaying you are going to do something you cannot afford to do, so you \nare going to have to go right to the ratepayers and charge them a much \nhigher price than you otherwise would with the credit to come into \ncompliance with the RPS.\n  Yes. So that is the appropriate assumption of this chart.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me ask one other line of questioning \nto the Senator, and I appreciate his answer.\n  The Domenici proposal, which is the alternative the Senator from \nIdaho is advocating for, as I understand it--not only as it has been \ndescribed by the Senator from Idaho but by my colleague from New Mexico \nand others--not only would encourage utilities to produce more power \nfrom the sources I have identified--the renewable sources, traditional \nrenewable sources of solar, wind, biomass, geothermal, tidal and all--\nbut it also says we want to encourage more production of nuclear power, \nas I understand it.\n  Mr. CRAIG. And new hydro, where it fits, and efficiencies and \nsequestration, yes.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Would the Senator from Idaho agree with me that to the \nextent that amendment is successful in doing that, in encouraging all \nof that additional nuclear power, nuclear generation, and all, that \nalso is going to cost the Treasury, and that is also going to drive up \nwhat is indicated on the chart?\n  I notice there is no line on the Senator's chart to represent what \nthe fiscal impact on the budget would be from the Domenici proposal. \nBut my assumption is, it would be at least as expensive to the Federal \nbudget as mine would be, or else if it would not be as expensive that \nis because the Domenici amendment would not be as effective in \npromoting development of these sources; am I correct?\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I say to the Senator, you are correct to \nassume a CPS standard would have a budgetary impact as much as an RPS \nstandard. The RPS standard--as I have said, it is a bit old school, so \nit is considerably more measurable, and you are forcing production into \na narrower slot in the marketplace--wind and bio--whereas we are \nbroadening the slot dramatically.\n  Yes, there are some of those new nuclear plants, as you know, as it \nrelates to the Energy Policy Act of 2005 that are going to have some \ntax benefits. The first certain numbers are. Sequestration, more than \nlikely--to encourage it, and to make it reasonable in the marketplace--\nis going to have some tax consequence. We promote efficiency in the \nmarketplace through that. But in all fairness to the Senator, it is not \nyet a measurable item. Those who are looking at it now say it is \nprobably spread and less costly, but it is also more than just a cost \nitem.\n  As I said, if you take a Florida utility that meets the standards by \nbuying wind in the Midwest, it does nothing for the airshed in Florida; \nwhereas, a CPS says you can build clean in Florida and benefit the \nairshed of Florida. I think there is the other side of that value.\n  Lastly, if I could react, and the Senator would allow me to, I am all \nfor biofuels. But driving the biofuel market under the current \ntechnology--I am surprised some environmentalists are not reacting \nbecause it is not a totally clean emitting technology. We are all for \nit because it is renewable. I am for it because it helps us clean up\n\n[[Page S7686]]\n\nthe forest floors and do a lot of other things that are the right \nthings to do out there. But we also know when you burn it--and you are \nburning it--you have carbons, and that is escaping to some degree.\n  So driving it is the right thing but giving clean options is also the \nright thing. That is what CPS does.\n  Thank you.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I see my colleague from Georgia is in \nthe Chamber wishing to speak on the bill. I will defer to him, and we \nwill come back for additional debate in the coming hour.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I thank both distinguished Senators from \nNew Mexico.\n  I rise for a few minutes to talk about this bill and the renewable \nportfolio standards and the effects on my State of Georgia.\n  I associate myself with the remarks of the distinguished Senator from \nIdaho. I did not hear them all, but I heard the narrow stovepipe versus \nthe broad approach, and that is one of the things I want to talk about \nbecause we have a diverse country with many assets that regionally are \nvery different. If we are going to have renewable portfolio standards \nthat call on us to find renewable energy to reduce our dependence on \nforeign oil, we have to exploit and promote all those sources, not \nnarrow those sources.\n\n  I also wish to quote from our prayer this morning from Pastor \nSturdivant. Pastor Sturdivant called on all of us during this process \nof legislation, prayed for us to have patience. I do think we all need \nto have patience when dealing with this bill because I wish to tell my \ncolleagues what the effect of the renewable portfolio standards are on \nthe State of Georgia. We don't have the wind to meet the standards; we \ndon't have it. The tax that would in turn be imposed on these \nutilities, all regulated, thus ultimately paid by the taxpayer, would \nbe the following: On electric membership cooperatives it would be a \nhalf a billion dollars between now and 2020, and on Southern Company, \nit would be $7.6 billion.\n  Now, I know the bill attempts to exempt electric membership \ncooperatives, but when you analyze the bill, 7 of Georgia's 42 \ncooperatives would be included. Those 7 cooperatives produce 50 percent \nof all the energy generated by cooperative services in Georgia. So, \ntherefore, because of the way it is worded in its current form, and as \nI understand the Bingaman amendment, 10 States, mine being one of them, \nwould be in a position of not being able to meet the standard because \nof nothing beyond their control and would have an imposition of \ntaxation that ultimately goes to our ratepayers, both to either the \nSouthern Company or the electric membership cooperatives who are not \nexempt, to the tune of almost a total cumulatively of $8 billion.\n  Now, one of the things this bill talks about at its outset: It says \nthis is to reduce our Nation's dependency on foreign oil by investing \nin clean, renewable, and alternative energy sources. I wish to talk for \na minute about a clean, renewable, alternative energy source that we \nknow exists, that we are currently utilizing, and that for some reason, \nwe continue to stay away from reenergizing, and that is nuclear energy. \nWe had great testimony by Vice President Gore before the EPW Committee \nearlier this year, and each of us on the committee got to ask the \ndistinguished Vice President a question--or more questions--5 minutes' \nworth of questions. When it came to be my time, I asked the Vice \nPresident, accepting that every factor in the global warming argument \nis correct, how can we not seek to reenergize the nuclear energy in \nthis country to help meet that demand of lessening carbon, having \nrenewable sources of energy that are safe, efficient, and inexpensive? \nThat is the question I pose today: How do we look toward meeting the \nchallenges of removing or lessening our dependence on foreign \npetroleum, and yet not get back in the business of building nuclear \npowerplants? It is something I think is essential for us to do, and an \nenergy bill that does not include it as a renewable source of energy is \nmissing the boat.\n  My State of Georgia has nuclear powerplants. When I was in the State \nlegislature, we were building plans for them. The Southern Company \nwants to get licensing to put another reactor on Vogle to expand its \ncapacity. In talking about nuclear energy, most of the fears that \nresulted in the 1970s, although well-founded because of Chernobyl, \nhave, in fact, proven American technology to be superior. The Three \nMile Island accident that happened in the 1970s was a tragic accident, \nbut it proved the redundant fail-safe mechanism of the Nuclear \nRegulatory Commission standards in the building of nuclear powerplants. \nThat was technology of the 1970s and late 1960s. Today we have the \nknowledge we have gained from over 30 more years of the use, \ndevelopment, and understanding of nuclear power.\n  Today, we power our nuclear aircraft carriers, such as the Eisenhower \nreturning from the Persian Gulf, on nuclear energy. In Georgia, the \nTrident submarines, where our sailors, at close quarters for months on \nend under the sea, live comfortably and with a nuclear reactor. Why is \nit, when we have petroleum prices running through the roof, when we \nwant to sequester carbon and reduce its input, do we still look the \nother way on a source of energy that is reliable, that is safe, that is \ninexpensive, and that now we know its byproducts are recyclable for \nfurther use? This brings me to a second point.\n  Four Senators in this body, the two Senators from South Carolina and \nthe two Senators from Georgia, along with the Governors of both of \nthose States and the mayors and city councils of the City of Aiken, SC, \nand Augusta, GA, have gone to the Department of Energy and said: Why \nnot take the Savannah River plant, which for years manufactured the \nwarheads for our nuclear weapons, and turn it into a mock facility to \nrecycle spent nuclear material back into productive energy-generating \nnuclear material. So you have two States volunteering to recycle. You \nhave a process that allows it to become renewable. You have a Federal \ninvestment already at a site that has been used for years. These are \nthe types of creative things we need to do as we pursue reducing our \ndependence on foreign oil.\n  Nuclear energy will not do it all. Wind cannot do it all. Solar \ncannot do it all. Hydro cannot do it all, and biomass cannot do it all. \nBut collectively, together, operating as a team, incentivizing by the \nlaws we pass, we have a chance to do exactly what the title of this \nbill portends.\n  I wish to associate myself entirely with the remarks of the Senator \nfrom Tennessee yesterday afternoon, Senator Alexander, who so \neloquently expressed the punitive nature of the RPS standards in the \nBingaman proposal as far as his State of Tennessee and my State of \nGeorgia. I also associate myself with what Senator Craig from Idaho \nsaid. If we are going to seek alternatives, let's seek them all. Let's \nseek safety. Let's encourage them through tax policy, and let's reduce \nour dependence, but let's not make the reduction approach so narrow we \npenalize some and reward others.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I am glad our country continues to focus \non what we can do better to produce energy for electricity, fuel for \nour automobiles, and the like, in a way that is friendly to our \nenvironment and promotes our national security because in many \nsituations, we are far too dependent on nations that are not friendly \nand are hostile, actually. Huge amounts of our wealth each year, \nparticularly for the fuel that goes into our automobiles, is \ntransferred to nations, such as Venezuela. It has made them very rich \nin the short term, and as a result, as Tom Friedman, a writer, said: \nThe richer they get, the worse they behave. So we need to reduce the \namount of America's wealth being transferred abroad.\n  With regard to electric power, almost all of that power is generated \ndomestically with our own energy sources and by our own American \npeople. It is not\n\n[[Page S7687]]\n\nas significant for us in the economic and national security area as is \nautomobile gasoline, 60 percent of which is imported. That is why I \nthink when it comes to choices, we need to emphasize automobile fuels \nand what we can do to reduce our dependence and improve efficiencies.\n  I have been pleased to serve with Chairman Bingaman on the Energy \nCommittee. I just joined that committee. He is a man of intelligence \nand decency and commitment to doing right. We have had quite a number \nof hearings. We have not gone into this issue lightly. I am, however, \nreluctantly compelled to oppose his renewable portfolio standard \namendment and would like to share a few thoughts about it.\n  First, the overall estimate is that in areas of the country that do \nnot have the natural conditions that allow us to expand renewable \nenergy sources there will be huge costs that will be borne. It seems \nthat some like to suggest those costs will fall on the utilities. \nNobody likes utilities because they send us a bill every month. We tend \nto forget they send us electricity every month also. But they send us a \nbill every month, and if we don't pay it, they will shut off our \nelectricity. It is not a very pleasant thing to hear from your utility. \nBut utilities throughout America are regulated utilities. What they \ncharge has to be approved by public service commissions or commissions \nof a like nature.\n  We have a public service commission in Alabama. Those public service \ncommissions monitor their profits and monitor their charges for \nelectricity and disapprove many times requests for rate increases.\n  There is a principle that each and every one of our Senators need not \nforget; and that is, if areas that don't have the capacity to generate \nelectricity with renewables have to pay the penalties and have to pay \nfor other ways to get electricity, that cost, which some have estimated \nto be $100 billion to $200 billion annually, is the equivalent of this \nCongress taxing the people in those areas of the country $100 billion \nto $200 billion and directing it to be spent in this fashion whether or \nnot it is the best way to protect our environment.\n  In an economic sense and in a true sense, we are saying we are not \ngoing to tax the people in the country to fund these programs. We are \njust going to pass a mandate, and we are going to mandate it on these \nbusinesses. And if they cannot meet it, then we are going to require \nthem to pay a penalty. We didn't tax them, we are not taxing anybody, \nand we are going on about our business and we are going to move us to a \nmore renewable portfolio--a good goal, you see.\n  But if you step back and look at this, it is the equivalent of taxing \nthe people hundreds of billions of dollars, and that tax will be passed \non to consumers of electricity. Already their gasoline prices have gone \nup dramatically, and now we are seeing some rise in electricity rates, \nand this is going to be passed on. There is no free lunch. It will be \npassed on, and the people to whom it is going to be passed on to the \nmost are the people in my State because our wind resources will not \nwork.\n  Wind in some areas of this country will work. It really will. It can \nbe virtually competitive with other sources of electricity, and that is \nnice; although in areas that are fairly congested with people, people \ndon't like all these wind turbines. But out West, in some areas, I \nassume there is still potential to expand wind, and I am for that. I \njust don't like to see us require wind turbines where it is not going \nto work, or solar panels where it won't work.\n  In my home State of Alabama, one would think we have a good bit of \nsunshine, but in truth, we have a lot of clouds, and solar is not \neffective in our area. It is not effective anywhere really. It is much \nmore expensive than any other form of generating electricity and least \neffective in the Northeast. Even in the Southeast, because of our \nthunderstorms and our long periods in which we have cloudy weather, it \nis an unpredictable source of electricity, and it is very expensive \nanyway. It will be a great expense.\n  I share with my colleagues a letter from the Southeastern Association \nof Regulatory Utility Commissions. These are the people who, for the \nmost part, are elected by their constituents. They represent the States \nof Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, \nMississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Tennessee. They are \nvery much opposed to this amendment, not because they are not for \nrenewables, not because they want to defend some utility, but because \nthey know if this amendment is adopted, rates are going to go up on \ntheir constituents and with nothing to show for it.\n  This is their May 31 letter, just a few weeks ago, to the leadership \nin this body and the House. They say:\n\n        . . . to express our concerns about the nationwide, \n     mandatory federal renewable portfolio standard being \n     discussed/introduced by Senator Bingaman. As state \n     regulators, we are responsible for ensuring that retail \n     electricity consumers receive affordable, reliable electric \n     service. We are concerned that a uniform, federal RPS mandate \n     fails to recognize adequately that there are significant \n     differences among the states in terms of available and cost-\n     effective renewable energy resources and that having such a \n     standard in energy legislation will ultimately increase \n     consumers' electricity bills.\n\n  Then they go on to note, quote:\n\n       The reality is that not all States are fortunate enough to \n     have abundant traditional renewable energy resources, such as \n     wind, or have them located close enough to the load to render \n     them cost effective. This is especially true in the southeast \n     and large parts of the Midwest.\n\n  They go on to say, quote:\n\n       Our retail electricity customers will end up paying higher \n     electricity prices, with nothing to show for it.\n\n  With nothing to show for it.\n  So the letter goes on, and they say, quote:\n\n       While State public service commissions and energy service \n     providers should certainly consider available and cost-\n     effective renewable energy resource options as they make \n     long-term decisions for incremental energy needs, the \n     imposition of a strict Federal RPS mandate, as contrasted \n     with a State-driven cost-effectiveness determination, will \n     only result in higher electric prices for our consumers.\n\n  So that is the fundamental concern.\n  The goal of how we can go about this is complicated. I think we can \nmake progress toward more renewable energy sources, but I don't see how \nwe can omit nuclear power as a major player in this as the source of \ntremendous amounts of electricity with no adverse emissions into the \natmosphere. How we could be ignoring that is difficult for me to \nunderstand, I would say to my colleagues.\n  My goal is pretty simple, in how I analyze legislation. First, I \nbelieve we ought to consider our national security. How does it help us \nremain independent? Does it impact our economy adversely? A healthy, \ngrowing economy is good for this country. I certainly think we should \nnot and must not have a goal of raising energy costs, whether it is \ngasoline at the pump or electricity on the monthly bill. Raising those \nprices cannot be our goal. It can only make us less competitive in this \ncompetitive global marketplace.\n  Our goal cannot be to raise prices, but I will tell you that it is a \nsecret, unstated goal of many of the people who are driving some of \nthis legislation. They think if they can drive up the price of \ngasoline, if they can drive up the price of electricity, the average \nperson won't use so much of it because they do not have enough money to \npay for it.\n  Well, that is not good. Our goal as a nation should be to have safe, \nclean, reliable energy available at a cost as low as possible as part \nof living a healthy, productive life. Electricity in nations that have \nit readily available compared to countries where it is not available \nhave twice the lifespan. You have twice the lifespan if electricity is \nreadily available in your country as you do if you don't. It is a \ntragedy to see countries struggle so badly. So it is a blessing for us. \nEnergy is not something bad. It is a fabulous blessing to our Nation to \nhave it as readily available as we do, and we need to keep that cost \ndown.\n  The proposal requires all distribution utilities that sell more than \n4 million megawatt hours a year to meet targeted levels beginning in \n2010. The RPS standard in this amendment requires each such utility to \nhave 15 percent of its load in renewables, and renewables are only \nsolar, wind, geothermal--there is no geothermal out East, either; there \nis no ocean capability in our area of the country--biomass--some small \npossibility but nothing like this area--\n\n[[Page S7688]]\n\nlandfill gas--which is only incremental--and the like. It does not \ninclude nuclear or hydro, which is so important.\n  The Domenici substitute would require 20 percent by 2020, but it \nwould allow for new nuclear and incremental nuclear, new hydropower, \nand certain efficiency measures to qualify. Even then, I am afraid we \ncannot reach that number.\n  According to the Energy Information Administration, current \nnonhydroelectric renewables only account for 2.3 percent of total \ngeneration in the United States. To get to 15 percent of all \nelectricity from this source would require us to increase that \nproduction over six times. That is a lot--over six times the current \nrate. So under these standards, as they are written today, according to \nthe Tennessee Valley Authority, according to the Southern Company and \nother companies that are in our area of the country, they say there is \nonly one way, one thing they can do, and that is to pay the Department \nof Energy the two-cents-per-kilowatt-hour penalty to meet these \ntargets.\n  Let me tell you, two cents per kilowatt-hour is a big deal. \nHuntsville Utilities in Huntsville, AL, a progressive utility run by \nthe city, a board appointed through the city, states that the Bingaman \nRPS and even the Domenici CPS would cost them $4.2 million in 2010. \nThis is just the city of Huntsville--$4.2 million; $8.8 million in \n2013; $14.1 million in 2017; and $19.8 million in just 1 year--2020. \nThat is a lot of money on a city--$19 million a year, $4 million a \nyear. They are trying to manage their budgets carefully.\n  The Tennessee Valley Authority, the governmental entity Franklin \nRoosevelt started back many years ago, the conservative TVA--this is a \nquasi-government agency--estimates that systemwide it would cost an \nadditional $70 million to comply with the 3.75-percent RPS requirement \nin 2011 and $410 million to meet the full 15 percent requirement in \n2020. That is $400 million for the TVA system per year. That is a lot \nof money.\n  I think Senator Alexander had raised some points: Well, what if you \nused all that money--the $100 billion, $200 billion--how could you use \nit if you just applied it in some rational way to include renewables \nand reduce our dependence on foreign oil and keep the cost of energy at \na good level and encourage research and development? Man, you could put \nscrubbers on every coal plant in the country. You could build nuclear \nplants in large numbers. We could do lots of things. So this is a cost \nwe are imposing, but the movement it will accrue in the direction we \nwant to go is not great. The Association of Regulatory Utility \nCommissioners said, quote, ``There will be nothing to show for it.''\n\n  That is the problem I have. I want to move in this direction. I would \nlike to see us use more biofuels, and I believe there is a potential \nfor that. That is the only thing that seems to be viable in my area of \nthe country, is expanded use of biofuels. But this is really such a \nhuge step that I don't think there is any way it can be met except by \npaying penalties or a tax. Also, the way this thing works is the money \nmay very well end up just going to the Government in the form of \ncompliance payments or a penalty or a tax, maybe as much as $100 \nbillion.\n  I really am excited about the leadership Senator Bingaman and Senator \nDomenici have given to the Energy Committee. We have had lots of \nhearings with some of the world's best experts on energy. We all share \na view that if we develop a good energy policy, we can improve our \nenvironment, we can strengthen our national security, we can improve \nour economy, and the like. Any change that can actually reduce our \nconsumption of energy and actually pay for itself over a period of time \nis a step we clearly should take. But when you are taking steps that \nare likely to cost far more than the benefit you receive, you have to \nbe very cautious.\n  Remember, we are not spending Federal taxpayers' money and, \ntherefore, creating a cost. We are passing a law which mandates that \nthe citizens around the country, particularly in areas that don't have \nreadily renewable power, will have to pay more for their electricity to \nmeet this standard. And they are going to have to pay a lot more. The \ncost is going to be very significant, and the question is, Would that \ncost have been better spent in other areas? I suggest that it would. \nSome people have already made some suggestions about how we could spend \nthat money better.\n  I thank my colleagues for giving me a few moments to talk about this \namendment. I am sorry I could not be in agreement with it. The goal is \nworthy. My analysis of it is the burden will fall disproportionately on \nconstituents in my area of the country, particularly in my State, and \ntherefore I must oppose it. I think we can do better in how to achieve \nthis goal.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, just to advise folks of what I believe \nthe course is going to be here in the next few minutes, Senator \nCantwell from Washington is waiting to speak. She is going to speak for \nup to 10 minutes or something in that range; Senator Corker is here \nfrom Tennessee, and he wishes to speak for a relatively short period \nalso; and then, as I have indicated to Senator Domenici, it will be my \nintent at that point to move to table his amendment.\n  So that is my expectation of how we will proceed. I am not asking for \nany consent to do that, but I wanted to advise Senators.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of what is \nthe Bingaman amendment, to make sure we diversify our national energy \nsupply by investing in 15 percent renewables, and against the Domenici \namendment, which the chairman of the Energy Committee, the Senator from \nNew Mexico, just mentioned he is going to make a motion to table pretty \nsoon. I agree to tabling that amendment.\n  Let me say that I have listened to a lot of the debate on renewables \nand what we need to do, and I have heard a lot of people talk about \nwind out here and a lot of people talk about solar. I look at this a \nlittle differently. I really think this debate is all about natural \ngas.\n  I say it is about natural gas because I listen to the farmers in \nWashington State and throughout America about the high price of natural \ngas. I hear how much the price of natural gas is going up. The issue is \nthat natural gas is used both for our electricity grid and it is used \nas a product to make a solid for fertilizer that farmers need, and the \nprice is going up. It has gone anywhere from what historically used to \nbe $2, to $7 or $8, and in some cases we have seen it go as high as $14 \nor $15.\n  What I am saying is that we are having competition for natural gas \nbetween our electricity grids and our farmers. The future of natural \ngas is only going to increase. It is only going to increase. That \nleaves us with one choice; that is, to diversify off of natural gas for \nour electricity grid. How do we diversify off natural gas for our \nelectricity grid? We start planning for renewables.\n\n  I know there are many utilities wandering the Halls of Congress \ntrying to lobby against this particular provision of the United States \nsetting a goal of focusing on renewable energy. I would say to them: Go \nlook at how the U.S. economy is being impacted because we are already \ndependent on coal, already dependent on nuclear power, and already \ndependent on this natural gas that is continuing to rise at steady \nlevels and is going to impact our agricultural economy.\n  In fact, 15 years ago, only 10 percent of our U.S. nitrogen, a \nfertilizer product, was imported. Today about half of it is imported. \nWe have seen many of these businesses, over 21 of them in the United \nStates, shut down because of these high costs. What we need to do is \npush to give alternative fuel; that is, alternative sources of \nelectricity generation, an opportunity to be used in America. The best \nway for us to do that is to set this mandate in Federal policy so we \ncan protect consumers from the high cost of natural gas in the future.\n  To do nothing is to say that farmers are going to have to pay more or \nmaybe go out of business or their products are going to be too \nexpensive for international markets or say to consumers: You are going \nto pay more for your electricity because natural gas prices are going \nto rise or we can say to consumers instead: We took active\n\n[[Page S7689]]\n\nmeasures to diversify our electricity supply and to start using other \nrenewables that will help in getting off the high cost of natural gas.\n  To my colleagues who come to the floor and say alternative fuels are \ngoing to cost more, doing nothing is going to cost more, and depending \non the current infrastructure is going to cost more because we already \nknow those supplies are going to go up. Let's take the use of natural \ngas down by creating other alternatives.\n  I happen to believe that creating those other alternatives actually \nwill save consumers. I know people have mentioned how the Union of \nConcerned Scientists say it will basically generate $16.7 billion \nbecause of what it will generate in new economic activity, by using \nalternative fuels. I do applaud the former chairman of the Energy \nCommittee, the other Senator from New Mexico, Mr. Domenici, because he \ndid get the ball rolling with the last Energy bill, getting us focused \non incentives for renewable energy. My State probably has taken more \nadvantage of that than just about any other State in the variety of \nproducts that we are producing. We now have, in some of the communities \nof our State, the alternative generation community--whether it is wind \nor solar or alternative fuels. They are actually out there producing \nlarge quantities of cheaper electricity for the grid, and they are also \nbecoming some of the largest employers in some of our rural \ncommunities. From an economic development perspective, it is working. \nIn fact, one analysis on a national level says the clean energy \nstrategy could generate as much as $700 billion in economic activity \nand create 5 million new jobs.\n  That is not just on this particular Bingaman amendment proposal but \nthe whole package, of which this is a symbol of the kinds of activities \nthat could be done with our electricity grid.\n  Let me say something about other sources because we keep hearing, \nagain, about wind and solar. This is a lot about biomass. I am a big \nbeliever that we are going to see a lot of biomass generation across \nthis country--whether you are talking about switch grass or whether you \nare talking about using waste to supply new electricity.\n  Two major industries just came by my office--one a big timber \ninterest and another a big existing oil company--talking about how they \nare going to diversify in Southern States on biomass. I know of many \ninvestments in the southern parts of our country in biomass, so I \nexpect to see a lot of jobs created in the southern region of the \nUnited States from biomass. We have to push forward in saying we as a \nnation want to see a percentage of our electricity grid from that \nbiomass--not just solar, not just wind, but from that biomass. To me, \nthis is a great opportunity to do that.\n  One cost that no one is talking about, because no one has put a price \non it, is the future cost of continuing to rely, with our electricity \ngrid, on CO2 emittance and the cost to our environment of \nrelying on coal and some of our other generation sources in this issue. \nI know my colleagues are working on what we think the cost of that will \nbe to future generations. But what is clear when you look at this \ndebate is that part of our clean energy policy, when the electricity \ngrid diversifies off of the more expensive products that we know are \ngoing to go up, like natural gas, it creates more jobs in the short \nterm and diversifies our portfolio, driving down the demand for natural \ngas and helping us on supply. It also helps us with that hidden cost \nthat we all are actually paying in the pollution of our current \nelectricity grid. It is helping individual regional economies grow.\n  I think the chairman of the Energy Committee, Senator Bingaman, has \nput forth a great proposal on 15 percent. Let's make sure we take this \nstance so we let Americans know we don't think the existing energy \nstream is what we are going to saddle them with for the future. The \nAmerican people believe alternative fuel can help us off of this \ndependence we have right now on fossil fuel, and they believe its \ndevelopment will be cheaper, cleaner, and more efficient for us in the \nfuture. But we have to show them the Senate gets it and understands and \nis willing to set that goal into Federal statute.\n  I hope the President will also join in this effort because the \nPresident, as Governor of Texas, implemented a similar mandate in \nTexas. I think it worked very well for them so I hope he will lend his \nsupport; come up to the Hill and encourage people that the high cost of \nnatural gas on our farmers, on our businesses, is something we are not \ngoing to tolerate, its continuing to rise is something we are not going \nto tolerate. We are going to diversify off of that, protect consumers, \nand give them alternative fuel sources to supply our electricity grid.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in strong support of \nthe Domenici amendment. I want to say as I begin my comments I think we \nare extremely blessed in this Senate to have the two very distinguished \nSenators from New Mexico, two Senators I respect greatly and have \nadvanced the energy agenda in our country in a very beneficial way.\n  While I speak against the Bingaman amendment, I do so with tremendous \nrespect for his leadership on our committee. I look forward to working \nwith him on many future endeavors. However, today, I must say I am in \nstrong opposition to that amendment. I have just come to the Senate 5 \nmonths and 2 weeks ago. One of the things the American people see in \nthe Senate is the tendency to want to create one-size-fits-all programs \nand not take into account the various differences that exist around our \ncountry. That happens in so many programs we put in place here in \nWashington. People back home do not understand how we can be so \nshortsighted as to try to put in place one-size-fits-all programs.\n  I think it is admirable that we are moving toward renewables. I am \nvery proud to be focused heavily on that in our Energy Committee and \nvery supportive of the base bill, with some amendments, that is before \nus today. But this is nothing more than a tax, a tax on Southeast \nUnited States, a tax where basically it is a transference of wealth \nfrom Southeast America to other parts where wind and solar take place.\n  To me, a much more sensible approach is to say we do want to use \nclean technologies, as the Domenici amendment does. We want to use \nclean technologies, but we want to let the market do that. We want to \ninclude technologies like nuclear. Many utilities around the country \nhave invested heavily in nuclear. We are finding even better ways to \nprocess the unutilized fuel that is left. To me, what we ought to be \ndoing is setting a standard that allows many technologies to be brought \ninto America's energy production so that we are, as the Senator from \nWashington just mentioned, far less dependent on carbon-emitting fuels, \nfar less dependent on natural gas, which is compromising our ability to \ncompete in other areas, in other industries, because of the high price \nof natural gas.\n  I rise today, even though Tennessee is playing a role in wind and \nsolar. We have 500 employees in Memphis, TN, who are making solar \ntechnology. I applaud the efforts to promote that technology in \nAmerica. But I rise to say the Bingaman amendment is a very \nshortsighted amendment that does create a one-size-fits-all policy that \ndoes not take into account the various geographical differences that \nexist in our country. The Domenici amendment tries to rectify that. I \nspeak today in strong support of that amendment and hope that others in \nthe Senate will realize what we are doing and, hopefully, they will \nembrace a standard that moves our country ahead while taking into \naccount the various geographic differences that exist.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The junior Senator from New Mexico is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me say a few words about the \nDomenici amendment, which I will move to table. I know my colleague, \nSenator Domenici, wishes to speak in support of his amendment. I \ncertainly will not make the motion to table until he gets a chance to \ndo that.\n  Let me say why I think his amendment is a major mistake for the \nSenate to adopt and why we should table the amendment. The underlying \namendment that I offered tries to put in place a requirement that over \nthe next couple of decades we move toward more\n\n[[Page S7690]]\n\nelectricity in this country being produced from renewable sources. We \nhave a very extensive list of what we are talking about. We are talking \nabout solar energy, wind energy, geothermal energy, biomass, ocean \ntidal current wave energy, incremental hydropower, landfill gas--those \nare all what are defined as renewable energy sources, and we are trying \nto stimulate the production of electricity from those sources.\n  We have said we have to get to a point by 2020, each utility does, \nwhere it is either producing 15 percent of the power that it is selling \nfrom those sources or it is buying 15 percent, taking 15 percent of \nwhat it is selling from someone else who has produced it from those \ntypes of sources or it is buying credits from someone who has produced \nmore than they were required to and therefore has sold them credits or \nthey have made a compliance payment. Those are all ways that utilities \ncan comply.\n  The Domenici amendment comes along and says three things: First, it \npurports to say the 15 percent is not the right percentage, it ought to \nbe 20 percent. That sounds encouraging for those of us who like \nrenewable energy. But there is a bit of a sleight of hand in there, and \nlet me explain what that is.\n  In that amendment they say you take the base amount of electricity \nthat the utility sells and then go back and define what is the base \namount of electricity that the utility sells. It is what they sell \nminus what they are selling that is produced from nuclear. That is 20 \npercent. So instead of taking 15 percent of 100 percent, which is what \nmy amendment proposes, they are taking 20 percent of the lower amount, \nwhich would be 18 percent of the base because 20 percent of our \nelectricity today is produced from nuclear power. So we have \nessentially a requirement that would be something in the range of 16 \npercent instead of the 15 that I have asked for.\n  Then they say: OK, let's define the requirement in a way that it does \nnot just include those things the Bingaman amendment calls for; that \nis, production of electricity from solar power, wind power, geothermal, \nbiomass, ocean tidal, current wave energy, incremental hydropower, \nlandfill gas; you get credit for doing any of those if you want to do \nthem. But if you want to build a nuclear plant, we will give you credit \nfor that too. If you want to improve energy efficiency, we will give \nyou credit for that too. If you want to adopt the demand-response \nprogram to reduce the demand of your customers, then we will give you \ncredit for that too. If you want to adopt capture-and-storage \ntechnology for carbon in some coal plant, we will give you credit for \nthat too.\n  Then it has a general catchall. It says: The Secretary of Energy can \npick out other things in the future he may think people ought to get \ncredit for. So what it does is it eliminates any real requirement that \nany company, any utility, actually go and produce additional power from \nrenewable sources. That was the whole purpose of the Bingaman \namendment.\n  There is one other provision I want to alert my colleagues to, \nbecause it is a very important provision, and this relates to the \nStates' abilities to opt out. I know various people have been here and \nsaid: Well, States ought to be able to opt out. Well, you don't have a \nnational renewable standard. You don't drive the development of these \ntechnologies in a national market if it is up to each State to decide \nwhether they want to participate.\n  There is a provision in here called Governor certification. This is \non page 9 of my friend's amendment. It says: On submission by the \nGovernor of a State to the Secretary--that is the Secretary of Energy--\nof a notification that the State has in effect and is enforcing a State \nportfolio standard that substantially contributes to the overall goals \nof the Federal clean portfolio standard, under this section the State \nmay elect not to participate.\n  Under this section, it is clear to me the problem with the Domenici \namendment is it essentially prescribes that utilities should do what \nthey are doing at any rate. Then it sets up a complicated procedure of \ncredits and monitoring and trading they have to comply with as well. \nBut it does not require any change in the mix of energy they are, in \nfact, producing and selling. That, of course, is the purpose of the \nBingaman amendment, which is a second-degree amendment.\n  I do think it is very important we table this amendment so we have a \nchance to consider the Bingaman amendment and add it to this bill. For \nthat reason I urge my colleagues to support the motion to table which I \nwill make following the remarks of my colleague from New Mexico.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, fellow Senators, I know this is a \ndifficult situation for the Senator from New Mexico, because on big \nmatters of energy for the last 3 years, I have been working with my \ncolleague, and we end up coming forth with bipartisan ideas.\n  In fact, the basic underpinning of this bill that was brought before \nus is bipartisan. If we can keep all of that that came through us, it \nwill be a very big and powerful bill. I am not sure we can, because \nthere will be those who are trying to take out big pieces of it before \nwe are finished.\n  But after the bill was out of committee and here on the floor, \nSenator Bingaman proposed an amendment I could not possibly support, so \nit did not end up in our bill. So it is not bipartisan; it is his. I \nhave to oppose it.\n  First, let me say if I were Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, \nAlabama, Kentucky, Tennessee, Arkansas, Louisiana, or South Carolina--\nand I am not, and nobody sent me here to represent them or defend them, \nbut they are busy and some of them understand this issue. I hope they \nwill vote accordingly. These States I have just mentioned--Florida, \nGeorgia, North Carolina, Alabama, Kentucky, Tennessee, Arkansas, \nLouisiana and South Carolina--are the States that are going to have to \npay into this program and they get nothing for it. They cannot produce \nwind energy, and so Florida is going to pay $21 billion over the course \nof this legislation; South Carolina is going to pay 6; Alabama is going \npay to 7, and so on. I think any piece of legislation that comes to the \nfloor in the field of energy that is so distorted that right off the \nbat we can come here, whether we are from New Mexico or whether we are \nfrom Louisiana, we can come here and say this about our sister States \nand our fellow Senators should not be adopted. There are not enough \nSenators to join this list, but we ought to protect them, and we ought \nto inquire very seriously how can this be such a good bill.\n  Incidentally, these States have to pay 2 cents per kilowatt-hour. \nThat is where this money comes from I am talking about that I just said \nthey are going to have to pay. That is a huge amount of money they are \ngoing to have to pay, these States I am here trying to protect. I am \nasking them to come down and protect themselves a little more, because \nI need your help. If you do not help, and if you do not stand up and \nnot let this amendment even pass, ultimately you have got to have a \nfilibuster on this amendment, you southerners and you people I just \nmentioned, because this is the worst bill that could ever happen to \nyou.\n  Now what happened was the wind experts and the wind people in this \ncountry got big headed. They got a big head. You see, I love them. I \nhave been part of giving them every energy credit we could give to wind \nenergy. Wind is doing preposterously well, but not because it is, per \nse, such a great source of energy. We are giving it subsidies. And when \nyou give the subsidies, it is a natural that it is clean. I am not so \nsure it is pretty. After people had it around a long time, they began \nto complain. But in my State it is terrific. It is up in the low \nmountains where it can't be seen too much. The ranchers who lease their \nland love it too because they get paid very heavily, I say to my friend \nfrom Alabama.\n  But the problem is we should have allowed more energy sources \nincluded in this major program. My definition changed from Senator \nBingaman's to clean, to offer clean energy into this proposal. We \nraised it to 20 percent with these new kinds of energy I have described \nmany times here on the floor, that everybody supports, that we ought to \nencourage as much as we are encouraging wind, which cannot be built in \ncertain States of the Union, and yet this is a national policy. Openly \nhe states it is a national policy.\n\n[[Page S7691]]\n\n  My friend Senator Bingaman says what is wrong with mine is it is not \nnational. I guess that means his must be a national policy. But it is \nnot, because the States I mentioned cannot do it. They cannot produce \nthe wind that is contemplated by this amendment. Since they cannot \nproduce it, they have to pay a fine, a pretty whopping penalty.\n  I think we ought to try every way we can to try to get alternatives \nthat are clean and put them in this mix. I believe we ought to keep it \nopen as long as we can for those who develop new sources to get in. I \nam not embarrassed that our amendment says you can let some new sources \nof energy in after the amendment is adopted, even 5 or 10 years into \nit. If, in fact, America is acting the way it normally does, they will \ndo that.\n  I want to give those technocrats we like and love who get things done \nmaximum time to get in and improve clean energy and put it in this mix \nlikewise, since I do not think wind ought to be the national energy. I \nam not impressed with wind being the national energy source for \nAmerica. Right now we are stuck; it is probably crude oil that is the \nenergy of America. We don't want it, but it probably is. But I don't \nthink we want to say America has nominated, of all of the sources we \nhave, wind to be the national source of energy.\n  I think that is what it says, because my opposition and good friend \nsays mine is not national, his is, so he is bragging about it being \nnational. I do not see why it needs to be national.\n  I never heard of a weaker energy policy being national for America \nthan wind. I mean, it is pretty. It produces energy. It has got a lot \nof problems. It does not produce it all the time, so you have to have \nbackup energy for it. But it is pretty good stuff. I mean, it is doing \na great job.\n  What we ought to do is we ought to make sure it continues to get its \ntax incentive. That would be the best thing we could do to keep wind \nenergy going. We don't need this for it. What we need is a 5- or 10-\nyear assurance that we are going to have the tax credit, if that is \nwhat people think. That is another thing you look at. This is not even \nan energy source that can make it on its own, and we are trying to make \nit the national energy source, the national energy. It cannot do it on \nits own. Right? It cannot do it without tax incentives right now. Maybe \nit can later. Maybe that is the way a lot of them start and maybe later \non they get there.\n  I hope my friends in the wind industry don't think what Senator \nDomenici has been saying here on the floor is anti-wind. It is anti \nwhat people are trying to make wind be when it can't be; that is what I \nam. I have supported everything that has caused wind to move ahead.\n  I urge my fellow Senators today not to table the Domenici amendment \nand to leave pending in the Senate two amendments, the Domenici \namendment and the Bingaman amendment. Don't kill mine. Leave his here, \nleave mine here. We will probably get up, get off that amendment, go on \nto something else in the bill. But even if we close mine, then I urge \nall of those who are here, who are listening and who understand, we \nought to be very careful about adopting this national standard, wind; \nthat you watch out and make sure that we try to force 60 votes on this \namendment before it can breathe as an amendment that will be part of \nthis bill.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I would, but I don't want to hold him up.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I won't persist. I thank the Senator for comments that \nare very valid for my part of the country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I move to table the Domenici amendment \nand ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set the \npending amendment aside. I have an amendment, No. 1557, at the desk and \nam asking for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to setting aside the \npending amendment?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I am disappointed the Senator from New \nMexico has objected to the consideration of my amendment No. 1557. It \nprovides for a national greenhouse gas registry and has the support of \nmany people on the other side of the aisle as well as this side of the \naisle. I ask that we try to work this out in the future, but I ask that \nI may discuss this amendment.\n  My amendment, which I have submitted with Senators Snowe, Bingaman, \nCollins, Carper, Coleman, and Kerry, establishes a national greenhouse \ngas registry--a comprehensive and uniform method of tracking greenhouse \ngas emissions by major industries. This registry creates a national \nframework for credible and consistent greenhouse gas emissions \nreporting.\n  Currently, reporting of greenhouse gas emissions data falls under a \nnumber of different Federal and State programs. Reporting is largely \nvoluntary, and the criteria and reporting formats are inconsistent. The \nresulting data is meager and unsatisfactory.\n  The Klobuchar-Snowe-Bingaman amendment requires the Administrator of \nthe EPA to gather complete, consistent, transparent, and reliable data \non greenhouse gas emissions at the facility level. It builds upon \nexisting reporting requirements to minimize the impact on businesses as \nwell as the EPA.\n  This amendment is very similar to legislation that has passed this \nSenate twice in the past 5 years as part of comprehensive energy \nlegislation.\n  A little over 5 years ago, Senator Brownback, along with then-Senator \nCorzine, passed an amendment creating a greenhouse gas registry. This \nregistry would have been voluntary, but\n\n[[Page S7692]]\n\nafter 5 years--if the registry contained less than 60 percent of the \ntotal national greenhouse gases in the United States--mandatory \nreporting of greenhouse gases would have been triggered.\n  Now it has been over 5 years since the passage of that amendment in \nthis body of Congress, and we still lack credible greenhouse gas \nemissions data from nearly all major sectors of our economy.\n  This amendment is simpler than the Brownback-Corzine amendment, \nrequiring reporting from a little over 10,000 establishments in the \nU.S. economy, representing over 80 percent of our human-induced \ngreenhouse gas emissions, without requiring costly monitoring equipment \nfor smaller entities.\n  Collection of greenhouse gas emissions data is necessary to better \nunderstand how much greenhouse gas various sectors of our economy emit \nand design effective strategies to address greenhouse gas emissions.\n  Last week, on National Public Radio's ``Morning Edition,'' a reporter \nasked a seemingly simple question that helps illustrate the need for \nsuch a registry: Who is the largest producer of greenhouse gases in the \ncountry?\n  It turns out, finding the answer is not that simple. The reporter \ncould not find an answer because we do not have an accurate and \ncomplete inventory of greenhouse gas emissions in this country.\n  This is a problem. As Peter Drucker, the famous business management \nscholar, has said:\n\n       If you can't measure it, you can't manage it.\n\n  Without accurate measurement, it is hard to implement effective \nsolutions. At the moment, there is a void of accurate measurements on \ngreenhouse gases, and what data is available is not certified by either \nthe EPA or a third party.\n  There is strong support in the business community for the \nestablishment of a national registry. In January 2007, a group of \nbusinesses unified to form the U.S. Climate Action Partnership. This \ndiverse group of businesses urged Congress to act within the year to \ncreate a greenhouse gas registry, along with a number of other steps. \nThe group includes General Electric, DuPont, Duke Energy, General \nMotors, PG Corporation, and many others.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a list of the companies \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                             USCAP Members\n\n       Alcan Inc.; Alcoa; American International Group, Inc. \n     (AIG); Boston Scientific Corporation; BP America Inc.; \n     Caterpillar Inc.; ConocoPhillips; Deere & Company; The Dow \n     Chemical Company; Duke Energy; DuPont; Environmental Defense; \n     FPL Group, Inc.; General Electric; General Motors Corp.; \n     Johnson & Johnson; Marsh, Inc.; National Wildlife Federation; \n     Natural Resources Defense Council; The Nature Conservancy; \n     PepsiCo; Pew Center on Global Climate Change; PG \n     Corporation; PNM Resources; Shell; Siemens Corporation; World \n     Resources Institute.\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. The strength and breadth of this coalition \ndemonstrates the fact that the U.S. business community anticipates a \nmandatory greenhouse gas reduction program coming into force. Having \naccurate greenhouse gas emissions data is necessary to assess risks of \ncapital investment decisions.\n  It also provides an opportunity for major industries to gather \ninformation on greenhouse gas emissions from previous years and make \ngood decisions on the design of any future greenhouse gas regulatory \nprogram.\n  In response to the absence of action by the Federal Government, 31 \nStates--representing over 70 percent of the population of this \ncountry--have banded together to create a greenhouse gas reporting \nsystem called the Climate Registry.\n  While it is a good start, and a sign of bipartisan impatience with \nthe Federal Government's inaction, this registry is no substitute for a \ncomprehensive national registry. You now have a situation where 31 \nStates are having to start their own registry because we have not \nacted.\n  The other issue with the 31-State registry is that it does not \nrequire mandatory reporting or third-party verification. Its \nparticipants range from States that are moving to impose mandatory \ngreenhouse gas reduction programs to those that are beginning to \nevaluate whether to take any steps.\n  According to Arizona Governor Janet Napolitano:\n\n       The State Climate Registries are another example of how \n     States are taking the lead in the absence of Federal action \n     to address greenhouse gas emissions in this country.\n\n  These States will benefit from a national registry, which will reduce \nadministrative costs, centralize technical expertise and support, and \ngreatly reduce the risk of under- or overreporting.\n  As the Climate Registry--the nonprofit entity coordinating the 31 \nStates' efforts--claims:\n\n       The creation of a Federal greenhouse gas emissions \n     reporting system would be a significant step forward in U.S. \n     climate policy that will build on the progress made through \n     existing reporting systems and make it easier and less costly \n     for corporations to track and report their greenhouse gas \n     emissions.\n\n  We need a greenhouse gas registry because there simply isn't a \nconsistent set of data. We have a patchwork system that is simply \nunworkable for accurate data measurement. We can't make good policy \nchoices unless we collect good data.\n  At the Federal level, the Environmental Protection Agency and the \nDepartment of Energy collect a lot of data on energy production and \nconsumption. However, the quantity and quality of the data vary greatly \nacross different fuels and different sectors. For example, data on \ncrude oil and petroleum product stocks is collected weekly from \nselected oil companies, while data on energy use in the industrial \nsector is collected only once every 3 years through surveys. In some \ncases, the EPA collects the data itself, while in other cases, the data \nis collected through State or Federal agencies.\n  There are two existing programs that provide some, but not nearly \nenough, data on greenhouse gas emissions. The first is the Department \nof Energy's 1605(b) Program, and the second is EPA's Climate Leaders \nProgram. However, neither of these programs gathers facility-by-\nfacility emissions data. Additionally, both of these programs are \nvoluntary with no means of verifying greenhouse gas emission reports. \nThe PEW Center on Global Climate Change, as well as the National \nCommission on Energy Policy, have criticized both of these programs for \nlacking rigorous reporting standards and verification requirements, \nallowing for the double-counting of reductions and failing to account \nfor overall greenhouse gas emission increases. This inconsistency in \napproaches has resulted in a lack of comparability of reported \nemissions from company to company, as well as a lack of comparability \nof results from reporting program to reporting program. We need to have \nconsistent, high-quality data across all sectors, which is what I call \na national carbon counter system.\n  Our amendment--again, a bipartisan amendment--seeks to create common \nstandards for measuring, tracking, verifying, and reporting greenhouse \ngas emissions by major industries. These standards do not currently \nexist at either the State or the Federal level.\n  This amendment does not place limits on greenhouse gas emissions; it \nsimply requires that the EPA establish and maintain a database of \ngreenhouse gas emissions. A national greenhouse gas registry will \ncreate reliable and accurate data that can be used by public and \nprivate entities to inform their financial decisions and allows \ninvestors to identify and manage future risks and opportunities.\n  The amendment has a number of checks to ensure it does not harm small \nbusinesses, as defined by the Small Business Administration, which emit \nless than 10,000 metric tons of greenhouse gases. It will promote full \nand public disclosure by requiring the EPA to post greenhouse gas \nemissions on its Web site. You really can't see greenhouse gas \nemissions, but at least you will be able to check the Web site. It will \nbuild on existing reporting requirements to minimize the impact on \nbusinesses and the EPA.\n  This amendment is not designed to support any specific legislation or \npolicy position; it simply ensures that greenhouse gas emission data \nwill be generated and collected in a consistent manner, regardless of \nits intended use. We will be able to make good decisions in the future \non policy only if we have good and accurate information.\n\n[[Page S7693]]\n\n  I would note that Senator Boxer is also a cosponsor, in addition to \nSenators Snowe, Collins, and Coleman, and Senator Kerry and Senator \nBingaman, who is managing this Energy bill, as well as Senator Carper.\n  I would like to add that I am very disappointed that the Senator from \nNew Mexico has objected to me putting this amendment in at this time. \nThere is support on the Republican side of the aisle for this bill. I \nam hoping I can work with him and others to finally get this amendment \nadmitted and considered by the Senate. I believe it is very important. \nI think it is the least we can do to begin information-reporting and to \nbegin doing something about climate change. So I will work with the \nSenator from New Mexico and others to be able to get this amendment \nconsidered.\n  I thank the Chair.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1573 to Amendment No. 1537\n\n        (Purpose: To provide for a renewable portfolio standard)\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Bingaman, I call \nup amendment No. 1573 and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota [Ms. Klobuchar], on behalf of \n     Mr. Bingaman, proposes an amendment numbered 1573 to the \n     Bingaman amendment No. 1537.\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR.

Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I know there are other amendments pending, \nbut I wish to speak to an amendment that is to be offered by our \ncolleague, the Senator from Minnesota, Ms. Klobuchar, on creating a \nnational greenhouse gas registry. I am pleased to join her in this \neffort because I do think it is so critical if we are to aggressively \nand comprehensively address the question of climate change and \ninstituting some major initiatives with respect to global warming. I am \npleased to join Senator Klobuchar and the Senator from New Mexico, Mr. \nBingaman, in offering this amendment at the appropriate time today.\n  I know Senator Klobuchar has spoken to the question, and I want to \nmake sure I have the opportunity to express my views on creating this \ngreenhouse gas registry which I think is absolutely essential in \nfulfilling the existing void by requiring vital information to help us \nmore effectively and efficiently reduce our Nation's carbon dioxide \nemissions.\n  I know this is Senator Klobuchar's first major initiative in the \nSenate as one of our newest colleagues. I had the pleasure of working \nwith her on this initiative. No question it is going to be a major \ncontribution to the environmental debate and to our national energy \npolicy because a greenhouse gas registry is an absolutely integral \nbeginning for collecting emissions data that will lead to an economy-\nwide number for our Nation's greenhouse gas emissions.\n  Everyone rightly speaks of the increased greenhouse gas emissions \nthat scientists, through peer-reviewed research, have verified are \ncreating the temperatures to rise, severe droughts, weather events to \nintensify, and sea levels to rise around the globe. We now have \nsufficient scientific certainty to know we must act to decrease carbon \ndioxide emissions, the largest greenhouse gas pollutant both \ndomestically and globally.\n  While there is this sense of urgency, as there should be, I think we \nwell recognize all the consequences of our failure to act both \ninternationally as well as domestically. The United States EPA has no \nfacility-by-facility inventory to even accurately report emissions in \nthe United States. We simply have no solid number representing how much \ncarbon is even emitted.\n  While the powerplant sector is responsible for reporting under the \nClean Air Act, the Government has no accurate system to account for the \nlargest U.S. emitters, as we are currently under an incomplete and \nvoluntary system for reporting yearly emissions for non-powerplant \nfacilities.\n  Now is the time to follow the lead of our neighbor to the North, \nCanada, which already has a mandatory registry system in place. In \nfact, the Senate has addressed establishing a greenhouse gas registry \nin the past. Specifically, the 107th Congress 2002 Energy bill called \nfor a national database for greenhouse gas emissions with voluntary \nreporting language, and also a hard trigger that I proposed that made \nthe program mandatory after 5 years if industry had not stepped to the \nplate and voluntarily reported and reduced greenhouse gas emissions. \nYet, regrettably, no bill emerged from conference that year.\n  I have no doubt our Nation would be in a much better position today \nif such a provision had been put in place 5 years ago. I also have no \ndoubt the United States would have engendered more respect \ninternationally if we had instituted a mandatory program for greenhouse \ngas emission reductions.\n  Indeed, let us recall--and I certainly do because I was here, I was \nin the House of Representatives at the time--the United Nations \nFramework Convention on Climate Change that was signed by former \nPresident Bush and ratified by the Senate and which entered into force \non March 21, 1994. The United States agreed to gather and share \ninformation on its annual greenhouse gas emissions.\n  In response, the EPA makes an estimate on what the total U.S. \ngreenhouse gas emissions are every year. Frankly, I would call it more \nof a guesstimate because how precisely and exactly can emissions be \nreported under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate \nChange when accurate data is not even available to the EPA from well \nover half of the emitters in the United States?\n  There are around 12,000 U.S. industries, from petroleum refiners, \ncement and steel manufacturers, chemical plants, and others, that do \nnot have to report any greenhouse emissions whatsoever. They are only \nbeing asked to participate in a voluntary reporting scheme called the \nDepartment of Energy's 1605(b) voluntary registry program which has \nbeen marginally successful at best when one considers that according to \nthe Energy Information Administration, in 2005, only about 200 \ncompanies voluntarily reported their emissions--only 200, Mr. \nPresident. It is truly alarming there is no comprehensive national \naccounting of greenhouse gas emissions for major emitters in the United \nStates, nor is there any certification that the reported greenhouse gas \nemissions are even accurate.\n  The Department of Energy's Office of Policy and International Affairs \nis only asked to review the 1605(b) guidelines every 3 years. All we \nare requiring today is a mandatory greenhouse gas emissions registry to \nsecure accurate numbers. For those who don't favor advancing climate \nchange legislation, they should at least be concerned that the United \nStates meets its obligations by accurately reporting its total annual \ngreenhouse gas emissions, not having a guesstimate or uncertain data, \nbut data that give us the most precise and accurate information.\n\n  For those of you, like myself, who support a market-based carbon cap-\nand-trade system, as called for in the Kerry-Snowe legislation and the \nLieberman-McCain climate bill to decrease domestic greenhouse gas \nemissions through a carbon cap-and-trade system, the registry we are \nrequesting has to be the very first step. It is an integral component \nto any type of carbon cap and trade we might initiate in the future.\n  We are being proactive by not waiting until we have established a \ncap-and-trade system that will require reporting emissions for major \nindustries. This will jump-start the actions in the United States for \ndecreasing emissions.\n  A trading system carries with it a value of every ton of carbon. A \nton of\n\n[[Page S7694]]\n\ncarbon not emitted is worth a credit that can be sold to a company that \nemitted a ton too much. So we will need a level of detail and \nverification to make the market truly work in distributing credit for \ntons not emitted in the shortest timeframe possible.\n  The European Union has been a living laboratory for its bold step in \nsetting up the world's first carbon cap-and-trade system. They modeled \nits greenhouse gas emissions scheme after a sulfur dioxide cap-and-\ntrade program that was put into place by the Clean Air Act amendments \nof 1990 to combat acid rain.\n  A European official, in appraising the mistakes made with their still \nnew system, said:\n\n       You need a registry, and you need a reporting vehicle.\n\n  That information gathering is vital, ``a very important first step,'' \nhe indicated.\n  I recall it took EPA 5 years to get the acid rain program up and \nrunning because powerplant operators had to install devices to gather \npollution rates. The European Union is going through similar growing \npains because they had no registry of verified data to make its cap-\nand-trade system work accurately. Too many credits were given.\n  So a national greenhouse gas registry is a crucial precursor to both \nmandatory and market-based carbon cap-and-trade regulations of \nindustrial greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming which we \nknow has been verified indisputably by the numerous reports and \nscientific data and studies, such as from the Intergovernmental Panel \non Climate Change.\n  It is quite simple: If there is no system for counting carbon \nemissions, there is no accurate way these emissions can be reduced, and \ncertainly there is no accurate way they can be capped or a trading \nscheme developed.\n  Once again, the States are undertaking initiatives. They are \ncertainly assuming a leadership role for climate change actions. There \nare 31 States, with California and the New England States in the lead, \nthat represent more than 70 percent of the population in the United \nStates that are now participating in the Climate Registry, all \nmeasuring in the same manner and jointly tracking greenhouse gas \nemissions from major industries.\n  This partnership with the climate registry is yet another example of \nthe States going farther than the Federal Government and taking the \ninitiative and taking the steps essential to combating global warming.\n  More significantly, the emissions statistics of the new registry are \nsubject to third-party verification as opposed to the Federal voluntary \nprogram that doesn't require any verification of any kind and, \ntherefore, undermines the certainty, the credibility, and the \nconfidence in that information because it has not been certified in any \nway.\n  I hope my colleagues will support this initiative offered by Senator \nKlobuchar, Senator Bingaman, and myself to establish this essential \naccounting tool that will give businesses and policymakers the ability \nto track emissions as a building block for climate change emissions \nreduction initiatives that are currently before Congress.\n  Very recently, the Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. Kerry, held a \nmeeting with a number of CEOs of various major corporations around the \nUnited States who have supported a carbon cap-and-trade system. They \nhave joined in a major partnership, the U.S. Climate Action \nPartnership, with environmental organizations and other stakeholders in \nsupport of initiating domestic climate change initiatives and \nlegislation.\n  This is very significant because these companies and these corporate \nexecutives have indicated their support for a carbon cap-and-trade \nsystem for the very first time because they understand that many of the \nStates, as I indicated, the 31 States--with California having taken the \nlead and now the New England States and my State of Maine is certainly \none of them that has been in the forefront of environmental \nleadership--have adopted the various regulations that will be part of a \ncarbon cap-and-trade system.\n  The fact is, these States have taken the lead, and they have been \nvery aggressive and bold in their steps to reduce emissions in their \nrespective States and regions. Now companies understand the true value \nthat will emerge in having one national standard so they have \npredictability, if they have a national standard that creates a carbon \ncap-and-trade system, so they can plan for the future. After all, \ncompanies have to make long-term decisions and have to have lead time \nin making decisions 30 to 40 to 50 years and beyond. So they have to \nunderstand exactly what regulations they will be governed by. They want \nthe certainty, and they do not want to deal with States' different \nrules and regulations. They would like to be governed and regulated by \none standard, a Federal standard, with respect to regulations through a \nnational carbon cap-and-trade system.\n  In our discussions during the course of that luncheon, they indicated \na greenhouse gas emissions registry would be absolutely integral to \nthis process; that, in fact, it is the very first step that is so \nessential in developing the predictability, the certainty, and the \nconfidence in the data that has been yielded so we know for sure which \ncompanies are emitting how much so the carbon cap-and-trade system that \nis ultimately put in place is put in place with confidence. We can then \nhave a verifiable trading system that can buy and sell credits that \nwill be important to this process if we are going to establish a cap \nand trade program to ultimately reduce carbon dioxide emissions which \nis, of course, what it is all about if we are ever going to begin the \nprocess of curtailing climate change and to avert any increases in the \nEarth's temperature by the year 2050, which most scientists have \nindicated is the tipping point. We have to prevent an increase in the \nEarth's temperature by more than 2 degrees centigrade by the middle of \nthis century.\n  Ultimately, it is going to require a major reduction in carbon \ndioxide emissions at least at a minimum at 65 percent, which is the \nlegislation I have joined Senator Kerry on that will achieve that level \nin order to avert that climatic tipping point we obviously want to \naccomplish over the next few decades.\n  This carbon cap-and-trade system is going to be a vital component to \nbringing everybody on board in industry, and having an economy-wide \napproach is very important if we are going to be effective in \ncurtailing these emissions that indisputably and undeniably are having \nan unambiguous impact on our environment. The science has obviously \nbeen verified by so many of the reports that have been issued in the \nlast couple of years and these reports are alarming. Now is the time to \nbegin action. So I want to commend my colleague from Minnesota, Senator \nKlobuchar, for taking this initiative for a national greenhouse gas \nregistry. By all accounts it is absolutely an integral part of our \neffort as we begin to take the measures needed to be proactive in \ncombating global warming.\n  Mr. President, with that, I yield the floor, and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THUNE. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska). Without objection, it \nis so ordered.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I rise to speak about an amendment I filed \nthat would extend the current tariff on imported ethanol by 2 years. \nOver the past 2 years, I have been proud to stand with my colleagues in \nthe Senate as we have made clean renewable energy a top priority in our \nnational energy policy. The Energy Policy Act of 2005, passed in the \nprevious Congress, made a historic commitment to renewable fuels by \nestablishing a national renewable fuels standard and extending several \nimportant renewable energy tax credits. This law has effectively \npromoted homegrown sources of energy such as ethanol and biodiesel. The \nbill before the Senate today builds upon that success by boosting the \nrenewable fuels standard to 36 billion gallons by the year 2022 and \nestablishing other valuable incentives for renewable energy production.\n  The amendment I have offered to the underlying bill would \nsignificantly add\n\n[[Page S7695]]\n\nto the existing renewable energy incentive promoted by this bill. My \namendment would extend the 54-cents-per-gallon tariff on ethanol \nimports through 2010. The current tariff is set to expire at the end of \n2008.\n  This energy legislation does some great things for renewable fuels \nsuch as corn-based ethanol and advanced biofuels such as cellulosic \nethanol. However, if we increase the renewable fuels standard without \nextending the tariff on ethanol imports, we are sending a mixed signal \nto our ethanol producers, their investors, and the farmers who sell \ntheir products to ethanol plants. In essence, Congress is telling the \nethanol industry that we are demanding more of your product, but at the \nsame time we are going to open the backdoor and begin subsidizing \nforeign sources of ethanol.\n  We need to ask: What is the purpose of the ethanol import tariff, and \nwhat will happen if the tariff is allowed to expire? First, the ethanol \ntariff serves to offset heavily subsidized ethanol from foreign \ncountries. Brazil, which is a world leader in ethanol production, has \nbeen subsidizing its ethanol industry for the past 30 years. Now that \nBrazil's ethanol industry is mature and meeting a high percentage of \nBrazil's fuel needs, Brazil is hungry to export their subsidized \nethanol to the United States. In 2005, Brazil exported 33 million \ngallons into the United States. In 2006, that number increased more \nthan tenfold to 433 million gallons. That same year Brazil paid over \n$220 million in duties to import this amount of ethanol. Further, \nMembers of Congress and the American public have every reason to \nbelieve this trend will continue well into the future and will \ncertainly be expedited if the tariff is allowed to expire.\n  According to media reports, Brazil's state-run oil firm, Petrobas, \nhas publicly announced plans to build an ethanol-only pipeline from \ncentral Brazil to ports in the western part of Brazil in order to more \neasily export ethanol to North America and Asia. According to the \nInter-American Development Bank's Global Biofuels Outlook for 2007, \nBrazil will be exporting almost 1.6 billion gallons of ethanol by 2012. \nClearly, foreign producers of ethanol would love to import billions of \ngallons of unregulated ethanol into our country.\n  The second purpose of the ethanol tariff is to offset the current tax \ncredit available to domestic blenders of ethanol. It is important to \nremember that each gallon of ethanol that is blended with gasoline in \nthe United States currently receives a 51-cent-per-gallon tax credit. \nThis tax credit, which has played a leading role in ethanol's success \nstory, does not discriminate between domestic or foreign sources of \nethanol. If a shipment of Brazilian ethanol arrives at a U.S. port and \nis blended with gasoline on U.S. soil, this Brazilian ethanol is \neligible for the blenders tax credit. This tax credit is currently \nscheduled to expire at the end of 2010.\n  Extending the ethanol import tariff to correspond with the expiration \nof the tax credit is in the best interest of our ethanol producers and \nthe American taxpayer. If the tariff expires before the ethanol \nblenders tax credit expires, American taxpayers will be subsidizing \nhundreds of millions of gallons of foreign-made ethanol each year. \nSimply put, the well-intentioned policy of boosting the renewable fuels \nstandard could have serious unintended consequences, if the ethanol \ntariff expires at the end of 2008. In fact, we would merely trade our \ndependence upon foreign sources of oil for a new and growing dependence \nupon foreign ethanol. This tradeoff is dangerous and will undermine \nhard-fought efforts to grow our domestic ethanol industry which is \ncreating jobs and economic growth in America's heartland.\n  Critics of the tariff claim that we will need ethanol imports to meet \na growing demand for ethanol and to comply with the strengthened \nrenewable fuels standard. However, the facts tell a very different \nstory. Our Nation's current domestic production capacity is 6.2 billion \ngallons of ethanol. According to industry experts, an additional 6.4 \nbillion gallons of capacity are currently under construction and will \nsoon be refining ethanol. That is a total of 12.8 billion gallons in \ncurrent and planned production. By comparison, the heightened renewable \nfuels standard in this bill is 12 billion gallons in 2010, the year the \nethanol import tariff would expire under my amendment. The renewable \nfuels standard will require 12.6 billion gallons in 2011. Clearly we do \nnot need imported ethanol to meet the renewable fuels requirement \nincluded in this bill.\n  The Senate has also voted on extending the ethanol tariff to the year \n2010. During debate on the transportation reauthorization bill in the \n108th Congress, 76 Senators voted in favor of extending the ethanol \ntariff through the year 2010. Again, I stress, the Senate is already on \nrecord in support of the very proposal outlined in my amendment.\n  In addition to extending an effective renewable fuels policy, my \namendment would also shed light on a disturbing loophole in our trade \npolicy which allows foreign ethanol producers to avoid the ethanol \ntariff by shipping ethanol through the Caribbean Basin Initiative. The \nCBI is a Cold-War-era policy established to promote the political and \neconomic stability of 24 Caribbean countries. Under the Caribbean Basin \nInitiative, many goods, including ethanol, can be shipped into the \nUnited States duty free. Brazil is currently shipping wet ethanol, \nethanol that contains 10 percent water, to beneficiary countries, only \nto be dehydrated and shipped to the United States duty free. According \nto the Congressional Research Service, ethanol dehydration plants are \ncurrently operating in Jamaica, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Trinidad, and \nTobago, all of which are Caribbean Basin Initiative countries.\n  Although Caribbean Basin Initiative imports are capped relative to \nthe size of the U.S. ethanol market, these imports are increasing \nrapidly and could reach 2.5 billion gallons by the year 2022, under an \nexpanded renewable fuels standard.\n  The troubling part of this policy is that it is unclear how much of \nthis ethanol actually originates in Caribbean countries. If the \nmajority of this ethanol is simply dehydrated in Caribbean countries, \nthen the purpose of the ethanol tariff and of the Caribbean Basin \nInitiative is being subverted. My amendment calls for a study of \nCaribbean Basin Initiative imports to determine the origin of these \nimports and the economic impact on both the domestic ethanol market and \nthe economies of the Caribbean Basin Initiative countries.\n  My amendment also promotes renewable energy on another front. Part of \nthe revenue generated by duties applied to ethanol imports would be \ndirected to a renewable energy fund within the United States Treasury.\n  This fund would be dedicated to funding renewable energy systems \nrebates, which were authorized in section 206 of the Energy Policy Act \nof 2005. Transfers from this fund would be subject to appropriations.\n  The section 206 rebate program offers incentives for the installation \nof renewable energy systems in homes and small businesses. The amount \nof the rebate is 25 percent of the costs for purchasing or installing \nthe equipment or $3,000, whichever is less.\n  According to the Energy Information Administration, section 206 \nrebates could increase residential renewable energy consumption between \n7 trillion to 14 trillion Btu's by the year 2010.\n  The Energy Information Administration also predicts that section 206 \nrebates would greatly increase the use of geothermal heat pumps, \nresidential wood stoves, solar technologies, residential wind turbines, \nand wood-pellet and corn-burning stoves.\n  This commonsense, bipartisan measure gives consumers choice and \nflexibility to produce and consume renewable energy in their homes. \nAlthough it was supported by the Senate in 2005, it is yet to be \nfunded. My amendment would direct some of the revenue generated from \nextending the tariff toward funding this important program.\n  Specifically, it would direct up to $100 million in 2009 and $150 \nmillion in 2010 to fund the renewable energy systems rebate program--\nwell below the $250 million authorized level.\n  In conclusion, ethanol is being produced here at home at record \nlevels, but it is an industry that is still in its infancy, and we need \nto be doing all we can to invest in it and encourage its growth--not \nthe growth of foreign ethanol companies. I encourage my colleagues to \nsupport my amendment\n\n[[Page S7696]]\n\nwhich will keep American-made, homegrown renewable fuels at the \nforefront of our national energy policy.\n  Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time and suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Salazar). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN.

I am anxious the \nChamber give it very serious consideration because our situation in the \nUnited States of America and, indeed, in the context of the global \ndemand for energy, is becoming more serious.\n  Our citizens are laboring under higher prices--be it for home heating \noil, gasoline, natural gas--and we must look at the full potential of \nAmerica to help resolve this situation. So in that sense we could, \nhopefully, reduce some of our dependence on the need to import various \nforms of energy from abroad.\n  It is my firm belief the United States must take a balanced approach \ntoward its energy policy. Not only must we increase conservation--I \nsupport that--and efficiency efforts--I strongly support that--use more \nalternative and renewable fuels--I support that, to the extent we can; \nthere is quite a deliberation going on as to the ability of certain \nStates, including mine, which does\n\n[[Page S7697]]\n\nnot have a lot of natural wind power during much of the year, to try to \nbring in wind power but, nevertheless, I encourage clean coal \ntechnology. The bottom line is, we simply have to look at the natural \nresources we have in this country.\n  Because the United States has strong domestic natural gas resources, \nand because the potential for increasing our domestic supply exists--\nbecause the demand is ever increasing for natural gas--I bring forward \nthis amendment.\n  Natural gas is the fuel of choice for many of America's businesses \nand industries. Today, natural gas meets 23 percent of U.S. energy \nrequirements. It heats 57 percent of U.S. households and accounts for \n90 percent of the new electricity--new electricity--capacity built in \nthe last 5 years.\n  I might also add, for those colleagues who have an interest in \ngasohol, look at how most of the gasohol is produced and its reliance \non natural gas. That is a growing source of energy for our country, and \nit involves a large usage of natural gas.\n  Our supply clearly is not meeting our growing demand. Prices--I find \nthis astonishing--prices for natural gas have risen 74 percent since \n2000. That is in the last 7 years. Domestic production has remained \ncomparatively flat, but imports are on the rise.\n  I want Senators who are thinking maybe this amendment does not meet \nall of their needs to think carefully about what I have said: a 74-\npercent increase in prices, domestic production remaining basically \nflat, and our imports, at considerable prices, are on the rise.\n\n  It is time America turned to its own resources. Therefore, I offer \ntoday an amendment to the pending legislation that seeks to allow my \nState--the Commonwealth of Virginia, providing its Governor and the \nState legislature concur--to explore for natural gas offshore. If that \nexploration--the first step. This is a two-step amendment. It simply \nsays, first, the Governor and the State legislature--going through the \nvarious procedures with the Department of the Interior--can explore. If \nthey find a reservoir of natural gas which economically can be \nextracted to help meet America's needs, then they can start a second \nstep. The Governor has to go back to the State legislature, and with \nthe concurrence of our Government--the legislature and Governor acting \ntogether--then, working with the Department of the Interior, the State \ncan provide for the extraction of this natural gas, which will come--\nall of it--to America--it is ours--thereby lessening our reliance on \nimporting it.\n  I know the Virginia General Assembly, over the years, and the \nGovernors of Virginia have already expressed--the last two--a measure \nof support for exploring--I underline and I carefully delineate \n``exploration'' from ``extraction.'' The Virginia Governor and the \nState legislature have indicated, in various ways, they are receptive \nto a program regarding the exploration of natural gas off the Atlantic \nCoast.\n  The amendment I offer today returns power to the Commonwealth of \nVirginia, using this two-step process I have outlined, to make \ndecisions about exploration and, if they wish to go to the second step, \ntaking the second procedure to extract that gas for purposes of \nbringing it to America.\n  So, specifically, it first allows the Governor of our State to \npetition the Department of Interior for a targeted waiver from the \ncurrent moratorium to explore for natural gas in the waters of the \nOuter Continental Shelf. That term is well defined.\n  Should this exploration justify a second step--namely, that the \nexploration shows there is a sufficient reservoir for economic \nextraction--then the Governor goes back to the legislature, and if they \nagree, they can further pursue that extraction by working out \narrangements, which are well known, with the Department of Interior; \nnamely, to petition the Department of Interior for the various \npermittings that are required.\n  Again, the Virginia General Assembly has already passed legislation \nin favor of, and the Governor of Virginia has already expressed his \nsupport for exploring--that is ``exploration''--for natural gas in this \narea offshore.\n  When drafting this legislation, I was certain to note that Virginia's \nneighbors should also have an input on what goes on near their own \ncoastlines. Consequently, if Virginia petitions the Secretary of \nInterior for the right to explore--that is, do the exploration--or the \nright to extract--a subsequent step--the Secretary of the Interior, in \nboth instances, shall provide our Atlantic coastal neighbors with an \nopportunity to comment on the petition or petitions coming from the \nState of Virginia, because I want to ensure that these neighboring \nStates have a voice in this process before the Secretary of the \nInterior--and therein resides the ultimate authority--issues the \nappropriate concurrences to, first, explore and, then subsequently, to \nextract.\n  This amendment also addresses a matter of equity by allowing for \nrevenuesharing between the Federal Government and the Commonwealth of \nVirginia for this offshore reservoir of gas, should it be produced, \nthat is extracted and brought to America.\n  My bill is modeled, in large measure, after last year's Gulf of \nMexico Energy Security Act, S. 3711. That bill states that 50 percent \nof all revenue would be tagged for the General Treasury. Mr. President, \n37.5 percent would be for the Commonwealth of Virginia. Mr. President, \n6.25 percent would go to the land and water conservation fund for \nconservation purposes.\n\n  In addition, I have put in here--and this is for the first time that \nI have seen it--I want to alleviate the concerns of bordering States, \nand therefore, in this bill, another 6.25 percent of any revenues would \nbe placed into a fund administered by the Secretary of the Interior \nwhich would be used to mitigate for any damages incurred by those \nseveral States as a consequence of the drilling, the exploration \nprocess, and the subsequent extraction process.\n  Now, it is highly unlikely, with the advanced technology, that \nanything would occur. You need only look at the aftermath of the \ntravesty we experienced with the various hurricanes in the gulf \nrecently: While some rigs were made inoperable, to the best of my \nknowledge, there was no consequent damage to the shoreline as \noccasioned by the disruption of the operation of those rigs, certainly \nnone of any great consequence. So I repeat that it is a source of \nrevenue for Uncle Sam, the State, and it seems to me to be very \nequitable in the distribution of these funds.\n  I once again note that this bill is natural gas only. There is no \nmention, no request for other products such as oil.\n  I have again tried to make it clear that this Nation is in dire \nstraits regarding its domestic energy supply and its ever-increasing \nreliance on foreign energy. Now is the time for each Member of the \nSenate to stand and be counted. Geological exploration and geological \nanalysis of these areas offshore to date have indicated that there are \npotentially enormous reserves of natural gas off the Atlantic \ncoastline. I say to my colleagues, I say to every citizen of this \ncountry, now is the time we should begin to, first, find out and \ncorroborate and verify the existence of those reserves and, second, let \nthe individual States decide for themselves by a Democratic process--\ni.e., the Governor working with the State legislature--to start the \nextraction of those natural resources of gas.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1578 to Amendment No. 1566\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I have a second-degree amendment to the \nWarner amendment No. 1578, and I ask that it be called up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Jersey [Mr. Menendez] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1578 too amendment No. 1566.\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To require the approval of certain States before approving a \n    petition for the issuance of leases authorizing the conduct of \n                 exploration or extraction activities)\n\n       Beginning on page 4 of the amendment, strike line 20 and \n     all that follows through page 5, line 3, and insert the \n     following:\n       ``(E) Comments and approval from other states.--\n       ``(i) In general.--On receipt of a petition under paragraph \n     (2), the Secretary shall provide Atlantic Coastal States with \n     an opportunity to provide to the Secretary comments on the \n     petition.\n\n[[Page S7698]]\n\n       ``(ii) Requirement.--The Secretary shall not approve a \n     petition under this paragraph unless the Governors of all \n     States within 100 miles of the coastal waters of the State \n     have approved the petition.\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I appreciate and respect the desire of \nthe Senator from Virginia to be an advocate for his State for the \npursuit of whatever natural resources it may have. However, the ocean \nis not refined to defined blocks that can be confined in terms of \nconsequences. We share that Atlantic Ocean along many States. So the \ndecision of one State, while it may be seen to be sovereign to it, \nactually has a ripple effect to other States, and the consequences can \nbe very significant.\n  Now, the Warner amendment, far from helping end our dependence on \noil, is seeking to tap another vein to feed our oil and our fossil fuel \naddiction. I would say to all of my colleagues in this body, all States \nand Members of those States who reside within the Outer Continental \nShelf should be paying a lot of attention to this amendment because the \nundoing of the moratorium for one State can create a domino effect that \nwill undo the whole basis of the moratorium throughout both the east \nand west coasts. That moratorium has existed for a quarter of a \ncentury, and for good reason. It has existed for a quarter of a \ncentury, and for good reason because it is about preserving the very \nessence of other natural resources as well--the shorelines of those \nStates which often generate billions of dollars in economic activity--\nand also about being good stewards of the land for future generations \nof Americans.\n  Now, I appreciate that the Senator from Virginia has in his amendment \na percentage of the proceeds, some which will go to the Commonwealth of \nVirginia, some which will go to a fund to potentially mitigate damages, \nbut that recognizes, in fact, that damage is possible to other States. \nI don't want to be in a position of New Jersey having to mitigate \ndamages caused to its coastal shoreline which is critical in estuary \ncapacity, critical in terms of the economy of our State, critical to \nthe fishing industry of our State, critical to the tourism of our \nState, and critical to the State of New Jersey. I would replicate that \nthrough other States throughout the Atlantic seaboard as well as on the \nPacific seaboard. So having a fund that says to other States: Well, if \nthere is damage, we will work to mitigate it, is not very consoling. \nAnd to think that one would say: We will only drill for gas, don't \nworry about it, it is not about oil, we are only going to drill for \ngas, but if while we are drilling for gas we happen to hit oil, to \nbelieve that, oh, we are going to stop and plug it up and we are not \ngoing to pursue oil exploration I think is rather ludicrous.\n  The Clean Energy Act of 2007 which we are debating is supposed to \nbe--supposed to be--about transforming our economy from one based on \nfossil fuels to one based on renewable energy; from an economy which \nthreatens our planet to one which is sustainable; from energy sources \nwhich are old and inefficient to ones which conserve our resources and \nuse them efficiently. Instead, this amendment would promote oil and \nnatural gas drilling in the mid-Atlantic. To me, that is an \nunacceptable threat to New Jersey's coastline.\n  The area the Senator from Virginia is interested in opening to \ndrilling is about 75 miles from Cape May, NJ--more than close enough \nfor spills to pollute New Jersey's beaches. Furthermore, any drilling \nin the mid-Atlantic puts us on a slippery slope toward a day when oil \nrigs are the norm along the entire eastern coast. One of the greatest \njewels of New Jersey is without a doubt our shore. Millions of people \nvisit the Jersey shore every year, bringing an estimated $20 billion \ninto the State's economy--$20 billion into the State's economy--and \ncreating hundreds of thousands of jobs. We simply cannot afford to put \nour shoreline at this type of risk.\n  Mitigation doesn't help us. We had a time in New Jersey history where \noil slicks, where garbage came up on New Jersey's beaches and shores, \nand the consequences were enormous for the State's economy, for the \nvitality of the communities that are along the shoreline, consequences \nin employment. We worked very hard at cleaning up through the Clean \nWater Act and other initiatives to make sure the shoreline was \npreserved for future generations of New Jerseyans and, for that fact, \nthe entire Outer Continental Shelf for the future generations of \nAmericans who call that part of our country home.\n  Now, the proponents of this amendment say that other States on the \neast coast will have the opportunity to provide input into any drilling \ndecision, but to be very honest, the Secretary of the Interior will \nhave the ability just to ignore their views and approve a \nrecommendation for drilling anyway. Actually, this administration has \nalready, through the mineral-mines management part of the Interior \nDepartment, been promoting a plan that actually seeks to create more \ndrilling off the Outer Continental Shelf. It is an advocate of that \nregardless of any potential consequences to natural resources. So I \nhave no faith in a Secretary of Interior directed by an administration \nthat promotes drilling, and all he has to do is say: OK, I heard you, \nNew Jersey; thank you, but no thanks. That doesn't do anything to \nsafeguard the sovereignty of any State that may be affected by the \ndecisions of another State as it relates to the Outer Continental \nShelf. This would leave States well within the scope of environmental \nimpacts helpless--helpless--to stop most leases and, more importantly, \nfor the circumstance at hand in my home State of New Jersey, we could \nnot object to any drilling off the coast of Virginia--object in a way \nthat would ultimately have a consequence--even though this drilling \ncould seriously endanger our coast.\n\n  Now, the proponents of this measure also claim drilling for natural \ngas will not have any negative environmental impact on our shores. With \nall due respect, that assertion is just simply not rooted in science, \nand it couldn't be more wrong. Massive amounts of waste muds and drill \ncuttings are generated by drilling operations. Most of this waste is \ndumped untreated into surrounding waters. Drilling muds often contain \ntoxic metals, including mercury, lead, and cadmium. Mercury in \nparticular has been found in very high concentrations around rigs in \nthe Gulf of Mexico and has raised significant concerns about \ncontamination of fish.\n  In our own State of New Jersey, one of the challenges--and I know \nVirginia has very significant port activity as part of its economic \ngeneration--where there are ports, in the nature of the activity that \ntakes place in those ports, there is often contamination of various \nsites. We had that reality as we dealt with the Port of Elizabeth in \nNewark and the Port of Newark in New Jersey, the megaport of the east \ncoast. So the reality is that drilling muds often contain toxic metals, \nand mercury in particular is one of those.\n  A second major polluting discharge is called produced water. Produced \nwater typically contains a variety of toxic pollutants, including \nbenzene, arsenic, lead, naphthalene, zinc, toluene, and can contain \nvarying amounts of radioactive pollutants. All major field research \nprograms investigating produced-water discharges have detected \npetroleum hydrocarbons, toxic metals, and radium in the water column \ndown-current from the discharge. Again, these pollutants have a \ndevastating effect on fish populations that are already under \nconsiderable stress, particularly along the eastern seaboard, and those \nindustries are very important, not only to the economies and the jobs \nthey create and the economies of those States but to the consumers of \nthose States who seek to have fish as part of their daily diet.\n  Now, even if offshore areas are leased for gas exploration, there is \nalways the possibility that oil could also be found, and if oil is \nfound, the exploration company will surely drill for it since there has \nnever been an instance where a lease prohibits--prohibits--an oil \ncompany from developing oil if oil is found in a ``gas-prone region.'' \nWithout such a restriction included in the lease, there would be no \nassurances that oil, in fact, would not be developed, raising the \npossibility of an oil spill.\n  According to the Department of the Interior, 3 million gallons of oil \nspilled from Outer Continental Shelf oil and gas operations in 73 \nincidents between 1980 and 1999. Oil is extremely toxic to a wide \nvariety of marine species. Even if oil is not found, liquid natural gas \ncondensates and can also spill. These gas condensates are highly toxic \nto virtually all forms of marine life.\n\n[[Page S7699]]\n\n  Those are just some of the environmental concerns. But beyond these \nenvironmental impacts, the Department of Defense has specifically \nexpressed grave concerns about drilling off the coast of Virginia. In a \nletter drafted on April 10, 2006, to the Minerals Management Service, \nthe Department of Defense made it clear that drilling off the coast of \nVirginia would interfere with the Department of Defense training and \ntesting exercises.\n  The letter states in part that proposed drilling would compromise the \nVirginia Cape's operations area. The Navy, Army, Air Force, and Marine \nCorps all use the Virginia Cape's operation area for critical training \nthat could not be accomplished elsewhere.\n  The letter makes clear that any structures built in the water where \nthese types of activities are conducted would severely restrict \nmilitary activities to test missile systems or have amphibious or air \ntraining missions. The letter by the Department of Defense concludes by \nsaying:\n\n       [b]ecause hazards in this area to operating crews and oil \n     company equipment and structures would be so great, the \n     department opposed oil and gas development activity in this \n     Outer Continental Shelf planning location.\n\n  The moratorium this amendment would begin to undo began in 1981, and \nit has continued ever since then. Congress has imposed restrictions on \nthe Outer Continental Shelf leasing in sensitive areas off the Nation's \ncoasts. These moratoria now protect the east and west coasts of the \nUnited States and a small portion of the eastern Gulf of Mexico near \nFlorida.\n  The moratoria reflects a clearly established bipartisan consensus on \nthe appropriateness of OCS activities in sensitive areas of the \ncountry, and they have been endorsed by an array of elected officials \nfrom all levels of Government and diverse political persuasions.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. In a moment, I will be happy to. I strongly oppose \nlifting these protections because not only is there concern for my home \nState of New Jersey, which has enormous consequences, but at the same \ntime, the incredible domino effect it can have as it relates to the \noverall moratorium on the Outer Continental Shelf. Anyone who believes \nit can just be done for Virginia and that others will not pursue it and \nthey have at least under this amendment's procedures very little to \nsay--they can raise a clamor, but they have no real ability to do \nanything.\n  My amendment simply says, if we are going to let this happen, those \nStates within 100 miles from where the drilling should take place \nshould have some significant say, the ability to have a significant say \nabout their future as well, their economies as well, and the right to \nbe good stewards of the land for future generations of their States and \nof this Nation as well.\n  I am happy to yield to my distinguished colleague from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I have a couple questions for the Senator. \nI am very taken with his response to this amendment offered by my dear \nfriend, one of the senior members of the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee. I feel the Senator from New Jersey has hit on a number of \npoints, and I wish to go over them. So if we reiterate, I think it is \nimportant.\n  This Energy bill is supposed to be about reducing our dependence on \nfossil fuels, not increasing it. It seems to me that by turning to the \nsame old, same old is ignoring the fact that our coastlines and our \nshores and the area out 50 miles where this will kick in are huge \neconomic engines for our various States.\n  So doesn't my friend believe, to restate his argument in a slightly \ndifferent way, that we are going back to the same old solutions and \nignoring what has happened in the last 20 years since we protected our \ncoasts, that the economic engines of our coastal States have driven \njobs and tourism and all the good things that come with a protected \ncoast?\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I appreciate the Senator's question. The reality is \nthat for a quarter of a century, we have had a moratorium exactly \nbecause we have come to understand that the values that are generated \nby our coastal regions, in economic terms, in terms of the environment, \nin terms of marine and aquatic life, in terms of all the ripple effect \nthat means, has a greater value than any of the deposits that might \nexist there.\n  The Senator from California is absolutely right as well, if all we \nare going to do is go back to what this bill seeks to undo, which is \nour dependency on oil, whether that oil is foreign or that oil is \ndomestic, at the end of the day, it is a nonrenewable source, it is a \nhighly polluting source, and it has consequences to the ozone. Yes, the \nSenator is absolutely right. That is why I oppose it.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I have a further question. I would like to get the \nattention of Senator Bingaman, if I may, on this particular question \nbecause there are some people in this Chamber who think this particular \namendment just deals with Virginia. Is it not so, if we look at page 2, \nit deals with any coastal State, and it is defined here to mean Maine, \nNew Hampshire, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Delaware, New \nYork, New Jersey, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, \nGeorgia, and Florida? So we are not just dealing at all, as I \nunderstand it, with one State. It appears as if we are dealing with a \nnumber of States on the east coast, if not all the States that border \non the coast.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I think the latest copy of the amendment that was \nfiled, the final copy that was filed by Senator Warner only says the \nState of Virginia, if I am not mistaken, on page 2 at line 21. But I do \nbelieve, however, that the consequence of opening the Outer Continental \nShelf, even for one State, has a ripple effect to all the States the \nSenator mentioned.\n  Mrs. BOXER. So the amendment I have in front of me, 1566, is not the \namendment that is before the Senate; is that correct? Parliamentary \ninquiry to the Presiding Officer: Is amendment No. 1566 not before the \nSenate, or has it been modified since it included all the other States?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is before the Senate.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I perhaps can clarify for the Senator \nfrom California, there is a definition of Atlantic coastal States on \nthe second page of Senator Warner's amendment. But the definition, as I \nread the amendment, is there for the purpose of defining which States \nare eligible to comment on a petition the Governor of Virginia would \nmake or submit. Only the Governor of Virginia and only the State of \nVirginia is affected by it, except to the extent these other States \nhave a right to comment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I simply say to my distinguished colleague \nand chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, on which I \nam privileged to serve, this amendment is carefully drawn to apply only \nto Virginia.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes, I understand.\n  Mr. WARNER. The Senator can oratorically describe something. This is \na one-State package.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Senator. That is why I took the floor to ask \nsome questions because my staff reading of it was not correct. I am \nglad it only applies to Virginia.\n  However, my next question I was going to ask of my friend from New \nJersey is this, because I think it is very important: We have one \ncountry from sea to shining sea. It seems to me my friend is pointing \nout, even with comments from other States, if, in fact, one particular \nGovernor prevails, will there not be impacts most likely on other \nStates?\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Yes. The answer, in my view, is clearly yes. I \nappreciate that Senator Warner says this is drafted only for the State \nof Virginia. It is drafted only for the State of Virginia so far as \nthat State will make a determination as to whether to exempt itself \nfrom the moratorium. But the consequences of that action clearly have, \nin my mind, consequences to other States that will be absolutely \nneutered in their ability to do anything more than to vociferously \nobject but without consequence. So, therefore, a drilling takes place. \nEven the Senator recognizes by virtue of having in his amendment a \nprovision where some of the royalties go to the State of Virginia, some \ngo to a fund for the purposes of damages done by a spill. So, \ntherefore, there is a recognition of the possibility of damage, and who \nis that damage to? To other States.\n\n[[Page S7700]]\n\n  I don't want to be in a position of having to draw on a fund because \nmy State has been damaged. I wish to avoid the damage in the first \ninstance, and that clearly cannot be done under the amendment as \noffered. That is why my second-degree amendment is so critical to \nStates for them to have a say as well about their well-being.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am not going to take very much time. I say to my good \nfriend, I know he is just looking at his own State but, in essence, \nwhat he will do today, if he succeeds, is to destroy, I believe, a very \nimportant bipartisan environmental agreement that has been in place for \ndecades now--I guess it is, what, 25 years or so, or getting close to \nthat--where we have basically said as Republicans and Democrats: We \nhave a God-given country, and one of our most precious resources is our \ncoastlines, our shores; that because we have stood together, shoulder \nto shoulder, on this issue perhaps until this moment--and I hope not, \nbut so be it, we are going to find out--we send a signal to our States \nthat they should preserve and protect their coastlines and, indeed, to \nmany in the private sector who have taken advantage of the fact that \nthe beauty of our coastlines, the beauty of our oceans that attract \nmillions of tourists, not just from around the United States to our \ncoastlines but from throughout the world.\n  I would hate to see us today, through the amendment process, without \na pretty good hearing, take a step to cast asunder 25 years of \nbipartisanship and agreement by Presidents, both Republican and \nDemocratic.\n  Look, we know we want to become energy independent, and I think this \nunderlying bill takes us very far down that road. Why turn to the same-\nold, same-old answers, when we have within our grasps the ability to \nget better fuel economy in our cars, the ability to get new kinds of \nrenewable fuels, the ability to look forward, not backward, and not \ncast asunder the beauty we have inherited, I believe, from our Creator?\n  I hope we can stand firm on this point because I am very fearful that \nif this idea is adopted, it is the beginning of the unravelling of \nsomething of which I have been so proud to be a part. I came to the \nCongress in 1982. I know my colleague has been here much longer than \nthat. The fact is, since that time, we have worked in such a good way \nto preserve and protect the coasts.\n  Again, I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, will the Senator entertain a question?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I will be happy to.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey has the floor.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I will be happy to yield. I wish to make sure I have \nnot yielded the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, this measure is deserving of a strong \ncolloquy. I have often felt it is through the colloquies that the \nSenate does its best work, not through a series of canned speeches and \neverybody getting up and down. Anyway, so much for that.\n  The Senator from California said 25 years this moratorium has been in \neffect. I say to my good friend, I have been here 29 years, and I have \nwatched the Nation in these 25 years grow more and more dependent on \nforeign energy. When this moratorium was put in, we didn't have $4 to \n$5 a gallon gasoline prices. We didn't have natural gas at its all-time \nhigh. I say to my good friend from California, this is a changing \nworld, and we cannot lock ourselves into a world that existed 25 years \nago and ask our citizens to continue to bear these ever-increasing \ncosts.\n  This Senate last year approved legislation which granted to the \nseveral States in the gulf the right to continue drilling. So it is not \nas if I am breaking a precedent. Other States have been accorded this \nright. Why deny my State, if my citizens, my Governor, decide it is in \nthe best interest of our State? Is there nothing left to States rights?\n  The Senator talks about this pollution thing--\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, is the Senator asking a question?\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes. Then I will pose a second one.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I will answer that one because it was so brilliantly \nposed. I got caught up in the Senator's poetic expression. I don't want \nto forget.\n  I think Senator Menendez, and pretty soon we are going to hear from \nan eloquent opponent of Senator Warner's amendment, Senator Nelson from \nFlorida, they are going to express how they feel being on the east \ncoast. I am on the west coast. But, again, to me the beauty of this \nwhole moratorium has been that we have said our coastlines and our \nocean, that those are national treasures, east coast, west coast. And I \nthink my colleague, Senator Menendez, has pointed out, it isn't as easy \nas all that. You are not going to build some kind of a sand dune around \nthe drilling. You don't know what could happen. You don't know how far \nthe problem could go. I know the Senator talks about the mitigation \nfund, but that just speaks to the point. So it isn't just about one \nState, it is about an entire coast, and it is about a precedent.\n\n  Let me just say to my friend that the world has changed after 9/11. I \nvoted to go to war against bin Laden--and we are still waiting--and, \nclearly, we learned very quickly over the years that we have to not be \ndependent on foreign oil, but we also understand we need a strong \neconomy and a good economy, which means some other things, too. It \nmeans a beautiful coast, it means a healthy tourist industry, it means \na healthy fishing industry.\n  There are more jobs in tourism in my State than almost any other \nsector. So I think it is simplistic to say the only thing that drives \nus is oil. As I said, the beauty of the underlying bill is that we want \nto get past that and into the new solutions that are coming. We are \ngoing to have a vote, probably, on the CAFE standards, corporate \naverage fuel economy, if Senator Feinstein's provision remains. It will \nbe the equivalent of taking 5 million cars off the road.\n  So there are new ways to think about the future, new ways to get off \nof foreign oil, and I don't think a good new way is to cast asunder \nyears of bipartisan agreement and perhaps endanger the economies of \nmany States along the Atlantic coast.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey has the floor. If \nthere are other Senators who wish to ask a question, they need to ask \nit through the Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. WARNER. If the Chair would indulge as much colloquy as is \npossible--and before the chairman leaves, she posed, in a sense, a \nsituation. So if I could ask just two quick questions, I ask of my \ncolleague.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I would be happy to yield to the Senator from Virginia \nfor the purpose of propounding his questions.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my colleague.\n  Now, the Senator from California is the distinguished chairman of the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee, and she has raised this specter \nof oil flow, and my good friend from New Jersey is talking about the \noil that has washed up.\n  Does the Senator from California know what percentage of the oil that \nreaches our beaches, absent a tanker problem, the oil that seeps from \nthis drilling, what percentage ever comes to shore?\n  Mrs. BOXER. We don't have any offshore oil drilling very much anymore \nin California, but I am familiar with the big spill that occurred in \nSanta Barbara, which was so devastating that our State said never \nagain, and our Governors, Republicans and Democrats, have said never \nagain to drilling in State waters.\n  Now, I can't give the Senator an answer to his question, but I have \nseen Exxon Valdez, and I have seen the great damage that has been done \nin my home State, as we study what happened in Santa Barbara. It is \nfortunate we don't have much offshore drilling in my State anymore, so \nI would be happy to have my friend put that in the Record.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe following from the National Academy of Sciences, a very trusted and \nrespected objective organization. According to their studies, less than \n1 percent of petroleum seepage comes from drilling and extraction \nactivity--63 percent, conversely, comes from natural seepage; 32 \npercent from cars, boats, and other sources; and 4 percent from \ntransportation.\n  So I just have to say this is workable.\n\n[[Page S7701]]\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey has the floor.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I will not ultimately object, but I would note that it \nis not just the potential from drilling and it is not just the \npotential of oil spills from drilling. I have listed in my remarks a \nseries of other consequences environmentally from drilling, but it is \nalso the consequence of when drilling takes place and then we have, \nduring hurricane seasons, the consequences to those drill rigs and how \nthat can create a disruption.\n  So there are many facets that are involved that are not addressed by \nthe National Academy of Sciences information. But as it relates to the \nSenator's unanimous consent request, I will withdraw my objection so \nthat he may enter that into the Record, and I will reclaim my time.\n  Mr. WARNER. Well, then, I would say to both colleagues, if I could, \nlastly, put the question to both colleagues, because this is intrinsic \nto the debate: Is it your position that the United States of America \nshall never permit its several States to ever, ever, ever drill \noffshore, be it east coast, west coast? And, somehow, I don't know how \nyou rationalize it, we will let the gulf do it, but we won't let the \ntwo coasts do it?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey has the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. If I could have my colleague answer that question.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I will wait in line. It is his time.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Reclaiming my time, I appreciate the dialogue, and if \nthe Senator from California would like to respond, I will yield to her.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I would. I want to be very clear--very clear. I support \ndrilling where it makes sense to drill. I oppose drilling where it \ndoesn't make sense. I submit to my friend and to the Senate and to the \nAmerican people that we made a very wise bipartisan decision a long \ntime ago--and I think we should stick to it--that the fact is, it is \nimportant for the economy of the coastal States to keep and preserve \nthe coast in the pristine nature in which it was given to us by God. \nThat is my view, and I hope we will not support this amendment.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, reclaiming my time, I see my colleague \nfrom the State of Florida is here, and he has a lot of experience in \nthe situation, so I will be happy to yield to him for his comments.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I thank the Senator, and while \nthe chairman is here and while the distinguished Senator from Virginia \nis here, for whom, he knows, I have the utmost respect, I want to point \nout very respectfully to the Senator that the statistics that he just \nindicated from the National Academy of Sciences do not take into \nconsideration the natural disasters that occur, such as hurricanes.\n\n  As a result of the 2005 hurricanes all along the gulf coast, oil rigs \nupended, and there were oil slicks on the beaches and the shores of \nLouisiana. We have innumerable photographs of pelicans and other birds \ncompletely covered. So there is the fact on the Atlantic coast and the \ngulf coast of hurricanes.\n  The other thing I wanted to point out to the distinguished chairman \nbecause someone will argue that the Senator from Virginia is only \nproposing gas drilling, as the Senator from California knows, it was a \ngas well off of Santa Barbara three decades ago that suddenly spilled \nall of that oil, from which came this moratorium that was placed on the \nContinental Shelf of the United States.\n  Now, with regard to the point of the distinguished Senators from \nVirginia about drilling in the gulf but not off the rest--\n  Mr. WARNER. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. President: I believe the \nSenator from New Jersey has the floor, and I believe the rules do not \npermit him--\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. He yielded to me.\n  Mr. WARNER. I think he yielded for the purpose of a question, not to \nyour right to the floor. Just a technicality, but I think we ought to--\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey has the floor. The \nSenator from New Jersey may yield for a question.\n  Mr. WARNER. That is right, but, Mr. President, I don't hear the \nquestion. I hear a speech. That is fine. I think we want to hear the \nspeech. I don't wish to deny him the right to speak, but let us at \nleast follow parliamentary procedure.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, if the Senator from New Jersey \nwill yield.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I will put it in the form of a question. But \nthe Senator from Virginia knows that this Senator did not object when \nhe did not make his remarks in the form of a question.\n  Now, my question to the Senator from New Jersey would be, since this \nSenator was one of the people who crafted with other Senators the \ncompromise off the Gulf of Mexico last year, giving--I might remind the \nSenator from Virginia--twice as much area to drill but was kept off the \nState of Florida for the purposes that we have been discussing, but for \nanother reason was kept off, and that was the U.S. military--the \nlargest training and testing area in the world--would the Senator from \nNew Jersey be surprised to know that the Department of Defense, \nDepartment of Navy, has objected to the drilling that the Senator from \nVirginia has proposed off of his coast?\n  I read specifically a letter dated April 10, 2006, from the Assistant \nSecretary of the Navy:\n\n       We have considerable concern, however, with the proposed \n     lease sale areas within the Mid-Atlantic Planning Area off \n     the coast of Virginia.\n\n  It goes on to reaffirm:\n\n       Because hazards in this area to operating crews and oil \n     company equipment and structures would be so great, the \n     Department opposes oil and gas development activity in this \n     OCS planning location.\n\n  I would further ask the Senator from New Jersey, does he not remember \nthat was one of the strongest arguments that this Senator made in \ndesigning the area that could be drilled in the Gulf of Mexico, \nbasically off of Alabama and Louisiana and keeping it away from the \ntraining and testing area where the live ordnance and the testing of \nnew weapons is?\n  Then, because of that, would it surprise the Senator from New Jersey \nthat one of the most eminent supporters of the U.S. military--the \nSenator from Virginia, the person whose knee I have sat at and learned \nso much as the former chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee--\nwould now be in contradiction with the request of the U.S. military? \nWould the Senator believe what I just said?\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Well, I appreciate the Senator from Florida asking a \nquestion and raising a concern. I expressed it in my comments. I am \nfamiliar with the letter of the Department of Defense to the Minerals \nManagement Service of the Department of the Interior that made clear \nthat drilling off the coast of Virginia would interfere with the DOD's \ntraining and testing exercises, and it went on for a variety of reasons \nand then concluded by saying:\n\n       Because hazards in this area to operating crews and oil \n     company equipment and structures would be so great, the \n     Department opposes oil and gas development activity in this \n     OCS planning area.\n\n  So, yes, I am aware, and it is an additional concern. However, I know \nthe Senator from Virginia has an exceptional record, which we all \nadmire, in his support of the Nation's military forces. I am sure that \nsomehow he believed he could overcome that objection. Nonetheless, it \nis an objection on the record in addition to the objections of States \nsuch as my own.\n  What I hope, in reality, is that the second-degree amendment I have \noffered to the amendment from the Senator from Virginia would be \naccepted and we could move forward because it still would allow \nVirginia to move forward, but it would give those States whose \ncoastline is within 100 miles of the coastal waters of Virginia the \nreal opportunity to work between States to come to a mutually \nsatisfactory conclusion. I think that is a reasonable effort to try to \nachieve some compromise.\n  I know the Senator from Virginia raised previously with the chair of \nthe Environment Committee: Well, does it mean that we shouldn't drill \nanywhere else? Well, the gulf coast had already\n\n[[Page S7702]]\n\nbeen drilling. It had been well established. But there is a reason \nthere is a moratorium for other parts of the country, and the \ndistinguished Senator from Florida wanted to preserve what is a \ncritical part of the Florida coastline, which means so much to \nFlorida's economy and to all of us who visit, as Americans, the great \nState of Florida--what it means to us as Americans, as one Nation.\n  Yes, there isn't a one-size-fits-all policy, I say to my friend from \nVirginia. Just because the gulf coast has for quite some time pursued \nit, there are limitations, limitations the Senator from Florida created \nto ensure its coastline.\n  Last, we talk about the cost. What is the cost of an oilspill? What \nis the cost of a leakage? What is the cost of the consequences? What is \nthe cost of a hurricane? What is the cost to the other States, not just \nNew Jersey, but the other States within 100 miles of the coastal waters \nof Virginia?\n  I believe our amendment allows Virginia to move forward, but it has \nto move forward in concert with those States that can most profoundly \nbe hurt, potentially, as is recognized by the amendment of the Senator \nby virtue of the fact of creating a fund for damage, so they can work \ntogether and come to a conclusion.\n  In the absence of that amendment being accepted, I have to notify the \nbody that this is such a critical issue to my State and to others along \nthe Outer Continental Shelf that this Senator is willing to spend as \nmuch time on the floor as is necessary to pursue the full discussion of \nthis matter and, if necessary, to raise it to a 60-vote level because \nit is that critical an issue.\n  I thank the Senator from Florida for his observations. I thank him \nfor his leadership in this regard, both past and present.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. I wonder if I might reply to my good friend for a minute, \nand I will then likewise yield the floor so my colleague from Florida, \nmy good friend, can continue in his own right.\n  First, I think I have worked out with the Department of Defense an \nanswer to your question. I simply do not have with me at this time the \ndocuments, so therefore I am going to have to indulge the Senate by \neither laying my amendment aside or some other parliamentary procedure \nto let the Senate go forward until I can come back with that. I thank \nthe Senator for bringing that up because it is an important \nconsideration. We have a significant command there, the Atlantic \nCommand.\n  I wish to go to the amendment of my good friend and read the last \nparagraph:\n\n       Requirement.--The Secretary shall not approve a petition \n     under this paragraph unless the Governors of all States \n     within 100 miles of the coast waters of the State--\n\n  presumably the State making the petition--\n\n       have approved the petition.\n\n  That gives all the Governors a veto power on this; Mr. President, \nwould that be correct? I pose that as a question to my colleague.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I am happy to answer. What it is is an opportunity for \nthose Governors within 100 miles of the coastal waters of the State of \nVirginia to work together to ensure that their interests are protected \nand maybe come to a collaborative approach as to how it might be done, \nwhich the Senator from Virginia does not, under his amendment, permit \nin any way whatsoever.\n  Mr. WARNER. There is a difference between the amendments. My \namendment generally states the Secretary of the Interior, who is the \nfinal arbiter of this whole issue, would entertain the petitions from \nthe several Governors, whatever geographic area, as he, the Secretary \nof Interior, makes a decision.\n  But I think the Senator has gone a step too far. If there is anything \nleft of States' rights after this sort of paragraph, I don't know what \nit would be. Listen to what you say:\n\n       The Secretary [Interior] shall not approve a petition under \n     this paragraph unless the Governors of all States within 100 \n     miles of the coastal waters of the State have approved the \n     petition.\n\n  It doesn't say anything about working it out. It is flat veto power \nput in the hands of such Governors within 100 miles.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. If I can respond to my friend from Virginia, I would \nsay under the amendment of the distinguished Senator, clearly there are \nno States' rights for those States that will be affected by the \namendment of the Senator. Second, there can be no negotiation of any \nconsequence if there is not some sound footing under which one can \nnegotiate. If you have no right, then there is very little to \nnegotiate.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am enjoying this debate, perhaps to \neducate the Senate. But I bring up another situation to my good friend \nwho has recently joined this body. I don't know how many times I have \ngone to the floor and contested the right of the several States north \nof my State, largely, to ship through Virginia thousands of tons of \ngarbage by truck, by rail, leaking, exuding methane gas in my State.\n  You have the good fortune of a clause in the Constitution on \ninterstate commerce, by which you can throw up your hands and say it is \nthe exercise of that constitutional power. You say my State cannot \nobject to your shipping garbage through it every day. The Senator knows \nNew Jersey ships through 1,000 tons of it. Yet you are saying to me, we \ncannot go through a process--working with the Federal Government of the \nUnited States and the Department of Interior--to drill offshore unless \nyour Governor and all others, any one of the Governors within 100 \nStates--if he has not given the approval, this thing stops?\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. If the Senator will yield, first of all it is all \nGovernors within 100 miles, not 100 States.\n  Mr. WARNER. No, 100 miles.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. But the distinguished Senator from Virginia has a very \nsignificant port operation in his State, and his trucks come through \nthe interstate into the State of New Jersey and do quite a bit of \ndamage on the roads of New Jersey along the way, in terms of the wear \nand tear, in terms of the movement of its product. Some of that product \nis not the most fanciful product we might all enjoy. That is the \ncollectivity of our consequence as a Nation.\n  There is a reason there is a moratorium that we, collectively as a \nbody, the Congress, have adopted for 25 years. The distinguished \nSenator, whom I admire so much on so many issues, wants to aggregate \nwhat the Congress has done as a body for his State, without recognizing \nthere are consequences to others. I simply offer an amendment that says \nwe will allow Virginia to do what they want, but they must do it in \nconcert with those within 100 miles of its territorial waters. I didn't \nsay the whole eastern seaboard but within 100 miles of its territorial \nwaters, to make sure those States rights are not affected.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, ``in concert'' to me means entrusting to \nthe Secretary of that department of our Federal system, by which the \npower resides, to grant or deny the license. That Secretary has to \narbitrate the concerns of all Governors within 100 miles of this \ndrilling, so to speak. I thought that is the only procedure I know. But \nI think you have gone to an extreme. You put an absolute veto power in.\n  At this time, I would like to advise my colleague that, in \nconsultation with the managers of the bill, I would like to lay my \namendment aside until I can give a definitive answer to the Senator \nfrom Florida. I think I have it worked out in the Pentagon, but I need \nto provide you with the documents to manifest that resolution.\n  I will put in a quorum call at this time, such that the managers can \nadvise me.\n  I will withhold that if the Senator wishes to speak.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I will only speak briefly, since the \ndistinguished Senator from Virginia is going to lay his amendment \naside. But I point out, when he does bring forth the documentation from \nthe Department of Defense, it needs to answer the Assistant Secretary \nof the Navy's admonition:\n\n     . . . but because hazards in this area to operating crews and \n     oil company equipment and structures would be so great, the \n     Department opposes oil and gas development activity in this \n     OCS planning location.\n\n  Further, I remind the two Senators involved in this colloquy--the \nSenator\n\n[[Page S7703]]\n\nfrom New Jersey and the Senator from Virginia--one of the reasons we \ncrafted the compromise last year that we did, that still allowed \ndrilling in the central gulf area and indeed allowed more acres of \ndrilling than had originally been sought, was we constructed it not \nonly so it was far away from the pristine beaches of Florida, which are \nso necessary to our economy, that it did not intrude upon the military \ntesting and training area, which is essential to the preparation for \nthe defense of this country, but that in addition, we consulted all the \nnautical charts to find the currents so that if an oilspill occurred, \nit would lessen the likelihood that the currents would carry it to the \ncoastline.\n  As the Senator talks as if 100 miles is some statute of the Holy \nGrail, I would simply say that what should be the concern, since \nVirginia happens to be close to North Carolina and South Carolina and \nalso happens to be close to Maryland and Delaware and New Jersey--that \nwhat clearly ought to be considered are the water currents, the ocean \ncurrents, instead of an arbitrary question of miles.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, in reply to the question of my good \nfriend, I remember that very well. As a matter of fact, he and I worked \non that. I remember breaking out the charts in the Armed Services \nCommittee and looking how the aircraft and everything would operate and \nthe ships in that area. You are well spoken and well taken on that.\n  But I have to tell you, Senator, face to face, things have changed. \nEvery day, things change. We have to reexamine, periodically, that \nframework of laws that have protected our environment, to a certain \nextent, in the light of our growing desperate needs for energy and the \ngrowing capability of our industrial base to do the drilling, to do the \nextraction in such a way as to minimally put at risk our environment.\n  I do not take a backseat to any person in this Chamber with regard to \nmy fervor in protecting the environment. I don't want to be called a \ntree hugger, but I am one step removed. I work on that Environment \nCommittee, where I have now served 24 years or something--I don't know, \na long time.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. The Senator certainly doesn't take a backseat \nto anyone in this Chamber in his protection of the interests of the \nU.S. military.\n  Mr. WARNER. That is correct. But the military can't do a broad sweep. \nI know what is underlying this thing. I have to get the papers here. \nThere are certain navigational aspects of it, certain electronic \naspects, but the military can't say no drilling on the east coast.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Klobuchar). The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, I further point out to the \nSenators involved in this debate that this Senator's perspective \ncertainly agrees with that of the Senator, that we have to produce the \nenergy we have to produce. But the problem is, what has changed and \nwhat ought to be changed, I say to the Senator from Virginia--the \ndistinguished senior Senator from Virginia, for whom I have great \naffection and respect--is that the policy of this country has been \ndrill, drill, drill for too long. It is time for us to break that \npsychology and start moving into alternative fuels other than oil.\n  This Senator from Virginia knows full well, as well as anybody else, \nthere is this precarious flow of oil from all foreign ports, including \nthe very hazardous port I visited in Nigeria, which is virtually \nunprotected to any kind of terrorist activity and from which this \ncountry gets 12 percent of its daily consumption of oil, from that one \nnation, Nigeria.\n  The problem has been the past and the present policy attempted not to \nbe changed, this mindset of drill, drill, when, if we keep that up, we \nwill not do what we have to do to protect ourselves; that is, break \nthis dependence, wean ourselves from this dependence on oil.\n  So I am sure, with the eminent intelligence and salubrious nature of \nthe Senator from Virginia, we can work this out.\n  Mr. WARNER. I hope it works out my way, Madam President.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. TESTER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is soordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1568\n\n  Mr. TESTER. Madam President, I know there is at least one amendment \npending on the floor. I want to speak about a different amendment, but \nI am not going to call it up. I only want to talk about it with hopes \nthat it will be called up in the near future and be given the kind of \nconsideration we do here in the Senate, and hopefully get it put on \nthis energy bill we are discussing. It is the geothermal initiative \namendment.\n  I first thank my colleagues Senators Bingaman, Reid, Murkowski, \nStevens, Salazar, Akaka, Sanders, Snowe, and Hatch for cosponsoring \nthis amendment. It is all about geothermal energy. It is what \ngeothermal energy can be as far as a key component to our Nation's \nenergy security, and how it can help contribute to a national renewable \nelectricity standard.\n  I have to point out that when we talk about the RPS amendment, the \nrenewable portfolio standard amendment Senator Bingaman has, it seems \nas though the conversation always revolves around wind when, in fact, \nwe ought to be talking about a lot more than wind.\n  One of those things is geothermal energy. Geothermal energy is \nsomething that is clean, it is efficient, it is, in fact, renewable and \ncan fight climate change. Once again, this amendment will do several \nthings to help our geothermal energy potential: It supports research \nand development, development and demonstration of commercial \napplications of geothermal energy projects, it supports State \ncooperative development programs, and it supports research and \ndevelopment of commercially viable applications. It advances high \npressure and high temperature drilling so we can get into the zones \nthat best have geothermal potential, and it prioritizes discovering and \ncharacterization of geothermal resources.\n  If you take a look at the map we have here of the United States, you \ntake a look at this, and in the light green, or the lime green, I \nshould say, is where we have less ability to have geothermal activity. \nThe darker the green into the orange and red is where we have more \npotential. Through this bill we can help develop that potential and \nthrough an assessment determine where most of our ability to get \ngeothermal energy is. I think it is quite extensive. As you can see, it \nis nationwide.\n  This amendment also has a national geothermal assessment component to \nit. The last time we had a comprehensive assessment for geothermal \nenergy was back in 1978. We have got far better technology now, and we \nneed to do it right this time.\n  Unfortunately, this assessment program did not receive funding to \ncomplete the assessment. But this amendment will provide the funding to \ngive us the assessment. Take a look at the map of the United States. \nTake a look at the map of Montana. You can see once again we have \ntremendous ability for geothermal development here and in the \nSouthwest. I live right here. It is blue. I can tell you from oil wells \nthat were drilled over 60 or 70 years ago, there is geothermal \npotential there, but we do not know about it because we have not done \nthe assessment for so long. It doesn't even show up. So there are a lot \nof areas around the country, I believe, where geothermal will work and \nhelp create our energy independence in a long-term energy policy.\n  This bill also gives assistance to academic institutions and State \ngovernmental agencies, particularly in the intermountain west and \nAlaska. These are institutions that are teaming up with businesses to \nget pipes in the ground.\n  Ultimately, we will have the ability, through this amendment, to \nmaximize our ability to have geothermal energy to contribute to our \nelectricity supply, heating supply, and other energy needs in this \ncountry.\n  A couple of months ago I had the opportunity to meet with President\n\n[[Page S7704]]\n\nGrimsson of Iceland. Twenty-seven percent of their electricity comes \nfrom geothermal resources. Of course, in Iceland that makes sense. \nEighty-seven percent of their homes are heated with geothermal heat. \nThey even lay pipes in the ground to melt the roads and keep them free \nof snow in the wintertime. It is something that has already been done \nand that we can do here in this country. It does not apply just to \nMontana, it applies to the entire country, and we can have our \ngeothermal resources developed. Montana has great geothermal resources, \nbut we need to have an overall geothermal policy that maximizes our \nability to draw energy from the heat in the ground, not only in places \nsuch as Montana, but also in places such as Arizona, Louisiana, Texas, \nMaine, and New Hampshire, and just about every State in the Union.\n  I will tell you this amendment is a bipartisan amendment. It is \ninnovative, in that we have not even begun to tap our potential for \ngeothermal energy in this country, and it is clean.\n  I would encourage all of the Members of this body, when this \ngeothermal amendment comes to the floor, that we give it good \nconsideration and attach it to the bill so we can have geothermal \nenergy be a significant part of our energy future.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Madam President, I recognize we are in the midst of a \ndebate surrounding the Outer Continental Shelf.\n  I would ask unanimous consent to speak briefly as in morning business \non a related but different topic.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Madam President, the facts about our Nation's energy \nconsumption are not pretty right now. The United States currently \nconsumes one-quarter of the world's oil. Sixty percent of the oil we \nconsume comes from foreign countries, including many countries whose \ninterests are hostile to us.\n  To make matters worse, the oil used in the U.S. transportation sector \naccounts for one-third of our Nation's emissions of greenhouse gases. \nIt is long past time for us to take significant steps to use oil more \nefficiently in order to deal with the dual challenges of climate change \nand energy dependence.\n  In January of this year, California took an important first step \ntoward addressing this problem by establishing a low-carbon fuel \nstandard for passenger vehicle fuels sold in the State. Under the \nCalifornia standard, the carbon intensity of these fuels would be \nreduced by 10 percent by the year 2020.\n  In signing the executive order creating the low carbon fuel standard, \nGovernor Schwarzenegger noted some of the dangers of his State's \nexcessive reliance on gasoline: volatile oil prices dictated by hostile \nforeign countries, lack of economic security, American jobs at risk, \nbusinesses in jeopardy, and, most importantly, dangerous levels of \ngreenhouse gas emissions. I applauded the Governor's leadership on this \nissue and want to take his proposal one giant step further.\n  Today, I rise to suggest that it is time for us to establish a \nnational low carbon fuel standard for the entire transportation fuel \npool in the country, whether the fuel is used for cars, trucks, or \nairplanes. I recognize we will not be able to move this necessarily on \nthe legislation currently pending, but it is important for us to \nintroduce the concept. I have already spoken to Senator Bingaman.\n  If my proposal were to become law, by the year 2015, the carbon \nemissions in our national fuel supply would be 5 percent less than they \nare now. By the year 2020, the carbon emissions would be 10 percent \nless. The effect of these seemingly modest reductions would be \nsignificant. According to one estimate, a national low carbon fuel \nstandard would reduce annual greenhouse gas emissions by about 180 \nmetric tons in 2020. This is the equivalent of taking 30 million cars \noff the road by 2020.\n  My amendment would reduce carbon emissions overall in the \ntransportation fuel pool, but it would not dictate what feedstocks \ncould satisfy the low carbon fuel standard or how many gallons of a \nparticular fuel would have to be produced. Instead, fuels could be \nmixed and matched to achieve the carbon reduction targets. In essence, \nthe market would dictate what pool of fuels would be sold in the United \nStates in order to satisfy requirements. The fuels could be corn-based \nethanol, cellulosic ethanol, biodiesel made from soybeans, electricity \nused by plug-in hybrid vehicles, or perhaps some kind of fuel that has \nnot even been developed yet. The only requirement is that the overall \nmix of fuels sold in the United States would have to meet the carbon \nreduction targets set forth in my proposal.\n  This is a new concept. Indeed, fewer than 6 months have passed since \nCalifornia adopted it. I know some of my colleagues are not familiar \nwith how it would work, so let me address the relationship between the \nlow carbon fuel standard and something we know a lot about, the \nrenewable fuels standard.\n  Under the able leadership of the two Senators from New Mexico, the \nEnergy Committee has crafted the underlying bill to require greater \nvolumes of biofuels in our national fuel supply. The bill increases \nnational production goals in the RFS over the next 15 years and \nestablishes the first production targets of next-generation fuels such \nas cellulosics. Under the bill, the RFS target would increase to 36 \nbillion gallons of renewable fuels by the year 2022. When combined with \nthe new advanced biofuels requirement in the bill, this would result in \nan estimated 2 to 6 percent reduction in carbon emissions in our \nnational fuel pool in 15 years. These are significant reductions, but I \nbelieve we can do better.\n  My low carbon fuel standard would require a 10-percent reduction in \ncarbon emissions by 2020. I know that sounds ambitious, but the \nmagnitude of our Nation's problems demands bold and innovative action. \nIndeed, the experts with whom we have consulted firmly believe that a \n10-percent reduction is realistic, with greater research in advanced \nbiofuels and new fuel sources. But that research will only happen if \nbusinesses are assured of a market for their new products. Just as the \nexisting RFS has spurred the construction of ethanol plants, a low \ncarbon fuel standard would incentivize development of new advanced \nfuels.\n  We in Congress support biofuels because these fuels strengthen our \nenergy security, support our rural economies, and reduce our greenhouse \ngas emissions. But our current policy doesn't recognize producers when \nthey do a better job achieving these goals. Our farmers, manufacturers, \nand investors are ready to produce better biofuels, fuels that are more \nefficient, fuels that support a broader base of rural communities, \nfuels that reduce greenhouse gases by 90 percent or more, but they need \na signal that their investment in better performance will be recognized \nin the marketplace.\n  Let me be clear: A low carbon fuel standard is not intended to \nreplace the RFS. Instead, the two standards would complement each other \nby encouraging greater use of renewable fuels. Here is an important \ndifference between the two standards: The RFS evaluates renewable fuel \nbased on the feedstock that creates the fuel, while the low carbon fuel \nstandard looks at the carbon emissions produced by the fuel. That is an \nimportant distinction as we wrestle with perhaps the greatest challenge \nof our generation--climate change.\n  Going forward, it is not enough just to say that a fuel uses \nhomegrown products such as corn or soybeans. We also need to look at \nwhat effect the fuel has on carbon emissions. This amendment does that \nand, in doing so, offers something for everyone. If you support rural \nAmerica, this approach ensures widespread development and use of \nbiofuels from agricultural products. If you support energy security, \nthis approach reduces our consumption of oil by 30 billion gallons by \n2020, 60 percent of which would have to be imported from foreign \nsources. If you support certainty for industry, this approach provides \nthe market certainty that is critical for investment dollars in key \ntechnologies. Most importantly,\n\n[[Page S7705]]\n\nif you support the environment, this approach reduces carbon emissions \nby 180 metric tons by 2020 and ensures that any future billion-dollar \ncapital investment in a fuel plant would have to produce a fuel with \nbetter life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions than conventional gasoline \nbecause under a low carbon fuel standard there would be no place for \ncarbon-intensive fuels.\n\n  The energy debate this week underscores the fact that as we pursue \nthe best course of action for our energy independence, there are no \nperfect answers. There is no single fuel or feedstock that offers the \nbest combination of affordability, reliability, transportability, and \nsensitivity to the environment. Even if there were, I am not sure we in \nthis Chamber would be the most qualified to identify it. But our \ncurrent course; that is, maintaining our dependency on an unstable \nregion of the world for the fuel we cannot live without, is far too \ngreat a risk to delay action. That requires us to take aggressive \naction that will set the stage for the second and third generation of \nfuels that will truly help us achieve energy independence and fight \nglobal warming. A low carbon fuel standard accomplishes these goals.\n  Finally, let me say a word to my colleagues about climate change. I \nknow that when it comes to the word ``carbon,'' the range of views \namong my colleagues is varied and complex. I am among those Senators \nwho believe carbon from human activities contributes to climate change, \nthat it is an immediate threat, and that we must immediately require \nemission reductions through a strong cap-and-trade system. Others among \nmy colleagues agree with some type of carbon-controlled economy but \ndisagree with the various legislative approaches to date. Still others \nbelieve the climate is in no imminent danger.\n  The approach I have suggested here today addresses carbon, but it \nallows my colleagues to maintain their differences on the larger debate \nof climate change while coming together to achieve progress on all our \nmultiple policy goals, whether it is ending our energy dependence, \nattacking the problem of climate change, promoting economic stability, \nor creating American jobs. I am aware this proposal may be a little bit \nahead of its time, but given the magnitude of our problems, we can't \nafford to be too cautious in our policy solutions.\n  I am going to be urging my colleagues to learn more about this \napproach. I have talked to Senator Bingaman. I will be talking to \nSenator Boxer as well. My hope is that if we are not able to introduce \nthis amendment during the current debate, we reserve time when we have \na debate on dealing with global warming and climate change to ensure \nthat this approach gets full consideration.\n  I thank the Chair and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KOHL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KOHL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside and that I be recognized to call up amendment \nNo. 1519; that once the amendment is reported by number, I be \nrecognized to speak in reference to the amendment; that the amendment \nthen be set aside, and Senator DeMint then be recognized to call up his \namendment No. 1546, and that once Senator DeMint concludes his \nstatement, the amendment be set aside; and that prior to Senator DeMint \nbeing recognized, Senator Byrd be recognized to speak as in morning \nbusiness; and that the DeMint amendment be called up after I conclude \nmy remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. KOHL. Thank you very much, Madam President.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1519 to Amendment No. 1502\n\n  Today, Madam President, I rise to offer an amendment with Senators \nSpecter, Leahy, Grassley, Biden, Snowe, Feingold, Coburn, Schumer, \nDurbin, Boxer, Lieberman, and Sanders, which will authorize our \nGovernment, for the first time, to take action against the illegal \nconduct of the OPEC oil cartel. It is time for the U.S. Government to \nfight back on the price of oil and to hold OPEC accountable when it \ndoes act illegally. Our amendment will hold OPEC member nations to \naccount under U.S. antitrust law when they agree to limit supply or fix \nprices in violation of the most basic principles of free competition.\n  Our amendment--identical to my NOPEC bill, S. 879; legislation that \nnow has 14 cosponsors--will authorize the Attorney General to file suit \nagainst nations or other entities that participate in a conspiracy to \nlimit the supply, or fix the price, of oil. In addition, it will \nspecify that the doctrines of sovereign immunity and act of state do \nnot exempt nations that participate in oil cartels from basic antitrust \nlaw. I have introduced this legislation in each Congress since 2000. \nThis legislation has passed the Judiciary Committee unanimously four \ntimes since it was first introduced, including this April, and in 2005 \npassed the full Senate by voice vote as an amendment to that year's \nenergy bill before being stripped from that bill in the conference \ncommittee. Last month, companion House legislation passed the other \nbody by an overwhelming 345 to 72 vote. It is now time for us to at \nlast pass this legislation into law and give our Nation a long-needed \ntool to counteract this pernicious and anticonsumer conspiracy.\n  Throughout the last 2 years since we last considered this measure on \nthe Senate floor, consumers all across the Nation have watched gas \nprices rise to previously unimagined levels. As crude oil prices \nexceeded $40, then $50, and then $60 per barrel, retail prices of \ngasoline over $3 per gallon have now become commonplace. While prices \nhave temporarily receded from time to time, the general trend is \nconsistently, and significantly, upwards. Gas prices have now increased \n77 cents per gallon just since the start of the year to a national \naverage of $3.07 per gallon, which is an increase of more than 30 \npercent.\n  As we consider gas price changes, one fact has remained consistent--\nany move downwards in price ends as soon as OPEC decides to cut \nproduction. Referring to the 18 percent rise in worldwide crude oil \nprices since the start of the year, OPEC President Mohammed al-Hamli \ncommented ``we had a bad situation at the beginning of the year. It is \nmuch better now.'' The difference was OPEC's decision last fall to \nenforce combined output cuts of 1.7 million barrels of oil a day in \norder to drive up the price of crude oil. And while OPEC enjoys its \nnewfound riches, the average American consumer suffers every time he or \nshe visits the gas pump or pays a home heating bill. The Federal Trade \nCommission has estimated that 85 percent of the variability in the cost \nof gasoline is simply the result of changes in the cost of crude oil.\n  So there is no doubt that the price of crude oil dances to the tune \nset by OPEC members. Such blatantly anticompetitive conduct by the oil \ncartel violates the most basic principles of fair competition and free \nmarkets and should not be tolerated. If private companies engaged in \nsuch an international price fixing conspiracy, there would be no \nquestion that it would be illegal. The actions of OPEC should be \ntreated no differently because it is a conspiracy of nations.\n  For years, this price fixing conspiracy of OPEC nations has unfairly \ndriven up the cost of imported crude oil to satisfy the greed of the \noil exporters. We have long decried OPEC, but, sadly, no one in \nGovernment has yet tried to take any action. This amendment will, for \nthe first time, establish clearly and plainly that when a group of \ncompeting oil producers such as the OPEC nations act together to \nrestrict supply or set prices, then they are violating U.S. law. The \namendment will not authorize private lawsuits, but it will authorize \nthe Attorney General to file suit under the antitrust laws for redress.\n  The most fundamental principle of a free market is that competitors \ncannot be permitted to conspire to limit supply or fix price. There can \nbe no free market without this foundation. And we should not permit any \nnation to flout this fundamental principle.\n  The suffering of consumers across the Nation in the last few years \nhas made me and many others more certain than ever that this \nlegislation is necessary. I urge my colleagues to support this\n\n[[Page S7706]]\n\n amendment so that our Nation will finally have an effective means to \ncombat this price-fixing conspiracy of oil-rich nations. The Senate \nshould now join with 345 of our colleagues in the House of \nRepresentatives and vote to add the NOPEC legislation to the Energy \nbill.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. Kohl], for himself, Mr. \n     Specter, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Biden, Ms. Snowe, Mr. \n     Feingold, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Coburn, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Lieberman, \n     Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Sanders, and Ms. Klobuchar, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1519 to amendment No. 1502.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To amend the Sherman Act to make oil-producing and exporting \n                            cartels illegal)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __.

Madam President, I am proud to join Senator Kohl in \nsupporting his amendment to the Energy Act. Under Senator Kohl's \nleadership, the NOPEC bill has passed unanimously out of the Senate \nJudiciary Committee without amendment in four separate Congresses, \nunder both Democratic and Republican leadership.\n  This NOPEC amendment will hold accountable certain oil producing \nnations for their collusive behavior that has artificially reduced the \nsupply and inflated the price of fuel. Unless this amendment becomes \nlaw, consumers across the Nation will continue to suffer.\n  According to a recent Washington Post article, gas prices last month \ncame within a half-penny of the modern era's inflation-adjusted record \nset in 1981. The rise and fall of oil and gas prices has a direct \nimpact on American consumers and our economy.\n  Prices have come down slightly in recent weeks, but that is no reason \nto condone anticompetitive conduct by foreign government cartels. \nAmerican consumers should not be held economic hostage to the whim of \ncolluding foreign governments.\n  Just a few days ago, the Associated Press reported Iran's oil \nminister's statement that the members of OPEC would not release more \noil into the market. This, despite reports that demand is on the rise. \nWithout collusion, OPEC members would compete to serve that demand and \nprices at home would fall.\n  When entities engage in anticompetitive conduct that harms the \nAmerican consumers, it is the responsibility of the Department of \nJustice to investigate and prosecute. It is wrong to let members of \nOPEC off the hook just because their anticompetitive practices come \nwith the seal of approval of national governments. I am disappointed \nthat the administration, which announced it would oppose this bill, \ndoes not share this view.\n  NOPEC has bipartisan, bicameral support. The Senate Judiciary \nCommittee approved it unanimously, and the House passed it with 345 \nMembers voting for it.\n  We cannot claim to be energy independent while we permit foreign \ngovernments to manipulate oil prices in an anticompetitive manner. It \nis long past time for Congress to act. I thank Senator Kohl for his \nleadership on this issue.\n\n\n                amendment no. 1546 to amendment no. 1502\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Madam President, at this time I ask unanimous consent that \nSenate amendment No. 1546 be called up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. Kohl], for Mr. DeMint, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 1546 to amendment No. 1502.\n\n  Mr. KOHL.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \npending amendment be set aside, and I call up amendment No. 1572.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Tennessee has reserved the right to object.\n  The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Madam President, while my colleagues are seeing if they \ncan work out the objection, let me proceed to speak about this \namendment.\n  The amendment I hope to call up is amendment No. 1572, and it is an \namendment which is part of----\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, if the Senator will yield.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. I yield.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. The Senator has a worthy amendment of which I am proud \nto be a cosponsor. At the moment we are checking with Senator Domenici, \nso if at this point the Senator wishes to speak to his amendment and \ngive us a few minutes, we would appreciate that.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. That will be fine. I appreciate the Senator from \nTennessee and his leadership, not only on these issues, but also on \npark issues and so many other issues that he has spent a long career \nworking on in behalf of our country.\n  The amendment No. 1572, which I have introduced with my colleagues \nSenator Bayh, Senator Alexander, Senator Lieberman, Senator Brownback, \nSenator Coleman, Senator Cantwell, Senator Lincoln, Senator Clinton, \nand Senator Biden, is an important amendment to move us forward in our \nvision of energy independence and to set America free from the \naddiction we have on imported oil. The amendment we have here is part \nof the DRIVE Act, which is sponsored by a group of 26 Senators, a true \nbipartisan coalition which has wanted to move forward in our efforts to \nset America free from our addiction to foreign oil.\n  The DRIVE electric amendment will make better use of the electricity \nin the transportation sector by spurring development and deployment of \nplug-in hybrid electric vehicles and by promoting oil savings at key \ntransportation hubs, including airports and truckstops. The amendment \nwe are offering today will move us toward our oil savings targets \nincluded in this bill by making better use of electric in the \ntransportation sector.\n  Currently, it is our cars, trucks, boats, planes, and trains which \naccount for about two-thirds of the Nation's oil consumption. The \neasiest way to save oil and reduce our dependence on imports is to \nfirst improve the efficiency of our vehicles, which we are doing in the \nunderlying bill in a number of ways, especially by raising the CAFE \nstandards and helping manufacturers refuel their vehicle fleets; \nsecondly, by replacing the oil-based fuels that power our vehicles with \nenergy from other sources.\n  The amendment we are offering today will help substitute electric for \noil in the transportation sector in two ways. First, this amendment \nencourages commonsense oil-saving electrification measures at \ntruckstops, ports, and airports. Our amendment directs the Secretary of \nEnergy, in coordination with the Secretary of Transportation and EPA, \nto create a revolving loan and grant program to support the \nelectrification of these transportation hubs.\n  You would be surprised at how much oil we can save through these \nsimple measures. For example, truckers must rest 10 hours after driving \nfor 11 hours. When they do this, they often park at truckstops, leaving \ntheir engines idling to power heaters, air-conditioners, TVs, or \nrefrigerators. This overnight idling by long-haul trucks consumes \naround 20 million barrels of oil per year. The solution is very simple: \nYou simply give truckers the option of plugging their trucks into an \nelectrical outlet to power their systems while they are stopped at \nthese truck stops. The EPA today estimates that this measure alone \nwould save around $3,240 in fuel costs per truck parking space per \nyear. We can take similar measures at airports and seaports to improve \nefficiency of handling cargo, refrigerating goods, and powering \nvehicles. Our amendment helps transportation hubs make these oil- and \ncost-saving investments.\n  The second way in which our amendment improves the use of electricity \nin the transportation sector is through the development and deployment \nof plug-in hybrid and electric drive technologies.\n  The National Renewable Energy Lab in Golden, CO recently conducted a \nsimulation to assess the capabilities of plug-in hybrid electric \ntechnology. The simulation showed that a plug-in hybrid electric \nvehicle fleet with modest technological capabilities would double the \nfuel economy of a conventional fleet, with less than half the energy \ncosts per mile.\n  Detroit is on the cusp of offering these plug-in hybrid electric \nvehicles to consumers across the Nation and across the world. Some of \nthe prototypes are far more advanced than those which NREL studied and \nwould get over 100 miles to the gallon, with energy cost to the \nconsumer that is equivalent to around 75 cents per gallon of gas. These \nplug-in hybrid vehicles are a building block of our new energy economy, \nand we should be doing more to push these technologies out the door. \nAmericans will benefit from these plug-in hybrid electric vehicles with \nlower costs and reduced emissions.\n  While the underlying bill would allow for basic and applied energy \nstorage research, the amendment we are proposing would also establish \nan electric drive transportation research and development program. That \nprogram would stimulate research into high-efficiency onboard and \noffboard charging components, high-power and energy-efficient \ndrivetrain systems, powertrain development and integration, the use of \nadvanced materials technology, and several other areas that are key to \ngetting electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles to the American consumer.\n  Our amendment will also help prepare utility companies to handle the \nadded load these new vehicles will place on the electrical grid. We \nhave directed the Secretary of Energy and EPA to work with the \nutilities to develop low-cost, simple methods of using off-peak \nelectricity and better managing on-peak use to support a growing fleet \nof electric drive vehicles.\n  These investments in research and preparation of our electrical grid \nwill usher in an era when all assumptions about how we power our cars \nand trucks will change. We will see oil consumption, emissions, and \ncosts fall, and we will see a new way of innovation and design, with \nAmerican engineers leading the charge.\n  So that America gets out front on the development of this electric \ndrive revolution, we are creating a nationwide education program for \nelectric drive transportation technology. The amendment will provide \nfinancial assistance to create new university-level degree programs for \nneeded engineers, support student plug-in hybrid electric vehicle \ncompetitions, and promote other educational initiatives. We believe \nAmerican minds can and should power this electric drive revolution so \nthat our best and brightest are delivering the next generation of \nAmerican cars to consumers.\n  I am proud of how far we have already come on the Energy bill that is \nbefore us today. Chairman Bingaman and Senator Domenici, along with the \nleaders of the Environment and Public Works Committee, the Commerce \nCommittee, and the Finance Committee, have done yeoman's labor over the \nlast 5 months to get us to where we are today.\n  The DRIVE Act electric amendment will magnify the positive impacts of \nthis bill and accelerate the arrival of a clean energy future in which \nall Americans can access plug-in hybrid technologies that save them gas \nand money.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan amendment which, \nagain, has the cosponsorship of Senator Lieberman, Senator Brownback, \nSenator Coleman, Senator Cantwell, Senator Lincoln, Senator Clinton, \nSenator Biden, and my colleague from Tennessee, Senator Alexander.\n  Madam President, I inquire of my friend from Tennessee if I can call \nup my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, if I can say to the Senator through \nthe Chair, the Senator still would like to have a chance to talk with \nSenator Domenici. In the meantime, both Senators Warner and DeMint have \nbrief\n\n[[Page S7708]]\n\nstatements they would like to make. We are working quickly on Senator \nSalazar's amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1566, as Modified\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I call for the regular order, and I \nbelieve that will make my amendment pending. I send to the desk a \nmodification. I have a right to modify my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right, and the amendment \nwill be so modified.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ___. AVAILABILITY OF CERTAIN AREAS FOR LEASING.\n\n       Section 8 of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (43 \n     U.S.C. 1337) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(q) Availability of Certain Areas for Leasing.--\n       ``(1) Definitions.--In this subsection:\n       ``(A) Atlantic coastal state.--The term `Atlantic Coastal \n     State' means each of the States of Maine, New Hampshire, \n     Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Delaware, New York, \n     New Jersey, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South \n     Carolina, Georgia, and Florida\n       ``(B) Governor.--The term `Governor' means the Governor of \n     the State.\n       ``(C) Qualified revenues.--The term `qualified revenues' \n     means all rentals, royalties, bonus bids, and other sums due \n     and payable to the United States from leases entered into on \n     or after the date of enactment of this Act for natural gas \n     exploration and extraction activities authorized by the \n     Secretary under this subsection.\n       ``(D) State.--The term `State' means the State of Virginia.\n       ``(2) Petition.--\n       ``(A) In general.--The Governor may submit to the \n     Secretary--\n       ``(i) a petition requesting that the Secretary issue leases \n     authorizing the conduct of natural gas exploration activities \n     only to ascertain the presence or absence of a natural gas \n     reserve in any area that is at least 50 miles beyond the \n     coastal zone of the State; and\n       ``(ii) if a petition for exploration by the State described \n     in clause (i) has been approved in accordance with paragraph \n     (3) and the geological finding of the exploration justifies \n     extraction, a second petition requesting that the Secretary \n     issue leases authorizing the conduct of natural gas \n     extraction activities in any area that is at least 50 miles \n     beyond the coastal zone of the State.\n       ``(B) Contents.--In any petition under subparagraph (A), \n     the Governor shall include a detailed plan of the proposed \n     exploration and subsequent extraction activities, as \n     applicable.\n       ``(3) Action by secretary.--\n       ``(A) In general.--As soon as practicable after the date of \n     receipt of a petition under paragraph (2), the Secretary \n     shall approve or deny the petition.\n       ``(B) Requirements for exploration.--The Secretary shall \n     not approve a petition submitted under paragraph (2)(A)(i) \n     unless the State legislature has enacted legislation \n     supporting exploration for natural gas in the coastal zone of \n     the State.\n       ``(C) Requirements for extraction.--The Secretary shall not \n     approve a petition submitted under paragraph (2)(A)(ii) \n     unless the State legislature has enacted legislation \n     supporting extraction for natural gas in the coastal zone of \n     the State.\n       ``(D) Consistency with legislation.--The plan provided in \n     the petition under paragraph (2)(B) shall be consistent with \n     the legislation described in subparagraph (B) or (C), as \n     applicable.\n       ``(E) Comments from atlantic coastal states.--On receipt of \n     a petition under paragraph (2), the Secretary shall--\n       ``(i) provide Atlantic Coastal States with an opportunity \n     to provide to the Secretary comments on the petition; and\n       ``(ii) take into consideration, but not be bound by, any \n     comments received under clause (i).\n       ``(4) Disposition of revenues.--Notwithstanding section 9, \n     for each applicable fiscal year, the Secretary of the \n     Treasury shall deposit--\n       ``(A) 50 percent of qualified revenues in the general fund \n     of the Treasury; and\n       ``(B) 50 percent of qualified revenues in a special account \n     in the Treasury from which the Secretary shall disburse--\n       ``(i) 75 percent to the State;\n       ``(ii) 12.5 percent to provide financial assistance to \n     States in accordance with section 6 of the Land and Water \n     Conservation Fund Act of 1965 (16 U.S.C. 460l-8), which shall \n     be considered income to the Land and Water Conservation Fund \n     for purposes of section 2 of that Act (16 U.S.C. 460l-5); and\n       ``(iii) 12.5 percent to a reserve fund to be used to \n     mitigate for any environmental damage that occurs as a result \n     of extraction activities authorized under this subsection, \n     regardless of whether the damage is--\n\n       ``(I) reasonably foreseeable; or\n       ``(II) caused by negligence, natural disasters, or other \n     acts.''.\n\n     SEC. __\n\n       No extraction or exploration plan under this provision \n     shall be accepted by the Secretary of the Interior if the \n     Secretary of Defense determines that such a plan is \n     inconsistent with critical military test or training \n     activities off the Virginia coast.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I should like to read it for the benefit \nof those following the debate. The modification is as follows. A new \nsection is added to my amendment:\n\n       (5) No extraction or exploration plan under this provision \n     shall be accepted by the Secretary of the Interior if the \n     Secretary of Defense determines that such a plan is \n     inconsistent with critical military test or training \n     activities off the Virginia coast.\n\n  The distinguished Senator from Florida referred to a letter he read \nregarding the concerns the Department of the Navy--and most \nspecifically, the Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Navy--had \nwith regard to the ability of this body to enact legislation which \npresumably would result in the Department of Defense finding that \nsomething was done inconsistent with our national security interests. \nSo this modification corrects that so that the Secretary of the \nInterior, acting under my amendment, would not take any such action \nunless he had the concurrence of the Secretary of Defense.\n  I also have discovered, since the colloquy between Senator Nelson of \nFlorida and myself, a letter which was written subsequent to the letter \nhe had and addressed the Senate. This letter addresses a modification \nto the letter of April 10, 2006. This letter was written on November \n27, 2006, and it states the following:\n\n       Notwithstanding the above, the Department is willing to \n     discuss with you--\n\n  That is, the Department of Interior--\n\n     possible alternatives that may provide opportunities for \n     exploration and potential joint use of the Mid-Atlantic area \n     consistent with the critical military test and training \n     activities in this area.\n\n  The letter goes on to say:\n\n       Our departments--\n\n  That is, the Department of Defense and the Department of the \nInterior--\n\n     have worked closely together over the years to insure a \n     continuing successful leasing program with a manageable \n     impact on defense operations. We agree that oil and gas \n     development on the Outer Continental Shelf must strike a \n     balance between our Nation's energy and national security \n     goals. As the administration moves forward on a plan to best \n     meet the Nation's oil and gas energy needs for 2007 to 2012, \n     we look forward to working with you to ensure its success.\n\n  Clearly, this indicates that with all good intention my colleague \nfrom Florida read the older letter which is now amended substantially \nby a subsequent letter that the Department of Defense will work with \nthe Secretary of Interior to make certain that any action with respect \nto drilling off the coast of Virginia is not inconsistent with national \ndefense requirements.\n  Madam President, I am perfectly willing to accommodate the managers \nas to how best they want to proceed on a vote. I hope I can get my \namendment up this afternoon for purposes of a vote, but I leave that to \nthe discretion of the managers.\n  I yield the floor, and I thank the Chair for her courtesy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Madam President, what is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment of the Senator from Virginia is \npending. He called for the regular order.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1546\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment, and I call up amendment No. 1546. It is pending.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DeMINT. I understand the amendment is pending.\n  Madam President, my amendment will make it harder for this body to \nenact legislation that increases the price of gasoline. That may sound \nunneeded in a debate where the whole purpose is to supposedly relax the \nprice of gasoline in this country, lower the price for our consumers. \nThe whole bill is supposedly aimed at providing stable and affordable \nenergy, including gasoline for all American citizens; however, I am \ndisappointed that this bill actually does nothing to reduce prices and \nmay very well show that Congress will propose policies that would raise \nthe prices of gasoline in the future.\n  Specifically, there is nothing in the bill to ensure Congress will \nnot enact legislation that actually increases the\n\n[[Page S7709]]\n\ncost of gasoline. At the very least, this Senate should take a ``do no \nharm'' approach to legislating and enact safeguards to ensure that we \ndo not increase the cost of gasoline for American consumers. My \namendment will do just that. It is very straightforward. It would \nrequire that the Congressional Budget Office evaluate legislation and \ndetermine whether it would increase the cost of gasoline. If the \nlegislation does increase the cost of gasoline, a 60-vote point of \norder would lie against the bill. This applies the same principles we \nuse in the congressional budget process to energy policy.\n  The traveling public is coping with high prices of gasoline every \nday, and while there are many factors out of our control that are \nforcing up the cost of gasoline, we can control what we do in the \nSenate.\n  I know some of my colleagues may support policies that would raise \nthe price of gasoline and, consequently, raise the point of order that \nI am proposing, but I encourage them to amend this bill anyway. If the \npolicy they are proposing is important enough, then this body will come \ntogether with more than 60 votes to pass their bill.\n  We can adopt this commonsense proposal which ensures that at the very \nleast, the Senate is less likely to increase the cost of gasoline as we \nseek to improve the Nation's energy policy.\n  I thank the Chair for this time. I encourage my colleagues to support \nthis amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1572 to Amendment No. 1502\n\n    (Purpose: To reduce United States dependence on foreign oil by \npromoting the development of plug-in electric vehicles, deploying near-\n  term programs to electrify the transportation sector, and including \n       electric drive vehicles in the fleet purchasing programs)\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \npending amendment be set aside, and I call up amendment No. 1572.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Colorado [Mr. Salazar], for himself, Mr. \n     Bayh, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Coleman, Ms. \n     Cantwell, Mrs. Lincoln, Mrs. Clinton, and Mr. Biden, proposes \n     an amendment numbered 1572 to amendment No. 1502.\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nBrownback be recognized to speak on this amendment for up to 10 \nminutes, and following Senator Brownback, then to hear from Senator \nCardin for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, I thank my colleague from Colorado \nfor this recognition. I am a cosponsor of this amendment, and he is the \nlead sponsor of the drive electric amendment. This is an exciting \nbipartisan proposal. It has 26 cosponsors. It does one narrow issue, \nbut it is a big one, and that is this: It gives consumers another \noption in the marketplace.\n  Right now, we are 97 percent dependent on oil for our transportation \nfuel. We are trying to expand that into ethanol, having more ethanol in \nthe marketplace, and I think that is key. What this amendment focuses \non is getting another option out there, a great one--it is an electric \noption--and to put it forward so we can have more transportation \nrunning off electricity. I think one of the key things for us to do in \nour future is to be able to reduce our consumption of oil, particularly \nforeign oil, and one of the key ways for us to do that is to have our \ntransportation fleet become more electric--a plug-in technology where \nyou plug the car in at night in the garage and you drive the next day. \nAbout half of the Nation doesn't drive over 30 miles a day. Having \nplug-in cars that can go that first 30 miles off electricity and then \nswitch over, I would hope, to ethanol, E85 ethanol at that point, in \nfact, could reduce aggressively, substantially, and quickly our \ndependence on foreign oil.\n\n  This amendment is a part of an overall strategy that a number of us \nhave put forward. One of the amendments of this strategy was passed on \nMonday, where an oil savings plan was put forward and accepted by this \nbody in the overall bill.\n  Let me go to the specifics of this particular bill, if I could, and I \nknow the Senator from Colorado will get to these more in depth, but the \nDRIVE electric amendment would expand the advanced transportation \ntechnology program in H.R. 6 and augment the energy storage \ncompetitiveness program in section 244 of the bill. The funding of $125 \nmillion would be authorized for the near-term deployment, market \nassessment, and the electricity usage provisions of the amendment.\n  The point of this is, if we are to rapidly expand plug-in technology, \nwhere the car is driven initially, or the pickup is driven initially \noff of electricity and then on to gasoline or ethanol, we need to get \nstorage technology in the batteries. We need to get drive train \ntechnology to be able to do this, and it is within reach. I talked to a \nrepresentative of General Motors yesterday about having the first wave \nof plug-in cars in the marketplace as soon as possibly 2008 or 2009.\n  These are exciting prospects, but you have clear hurdles that we have \nto overcome in the process. Those are identified in this bill, and we \nprovide funding for the research in those areas to go forward. We also \nurge the Federal Government in fleet acquisition programs to establish \nunder the Energy Policy Act of 1992 an assurance that fleet operators \nsubject to that law can choose electric drive transportation \ntechnology, including hybrid electric vehicles, for compliance.\n  This amendment is endorsed by a large group, certainly electric \ncompanies, as you might suspect, but also others interested in \nstretching our fuel usage, our oil usage in this country, and getting \nit from other sources. I might point out, too, one of the things people \nask about: OK, if you are going to switch to electric, you are going to \nhave to build more power-generating units, and that may happen in the \nfuture. But initially we can handle this by using the power grid we \nhave now in offpeak hours.\n  Most of the plug-ins will happen at night. Most of the recharging \nwill happen at night. So you don't have to build additional capacity to \nbe able to do this. It is good for the environment, reducing our \nCO2 emissions overall into the atmosphere, and it is good \nfor the economy. It develops a new way of moving forward on personal \ntransportation on a mass quantity basis for us to be able to do it in \nthis society and then sell that technology globally. So it helps our \ncar manufacturers to be able to compete.\n  I think this is a win all the way around, and I am delighted to be a \ncosponsor of the amendment with my colleague from Colorado, Senator \nSalazar, and many others.\n  I would urge my colleagues to adopt this amendment as a key provision \nto how we become energy secure in the next 15 years, while at the same \ntime growing our economy and helping the environment. All together it \nis an exciting and excellent amendment, and I urge my colleagues to \nsupport it.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nKlobuchar be added as a cosponsor to this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Madam President, I thank my friend from Kansas for his \ngreat statement with respect to the DRIVE electric amendment, and I \nalso recognize that he was one of the original members of the whole \ncoalition that put together this DRIVE Act and was part of implementing \nthe principles of the Set America Free Coalition.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor to my friend from Maryland, Mr. \nCardin, who is up next.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1566\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, let me thank my friend from Colorado for \nhis courtesy.\n  This Nation needs energy independence for many reasons. We need it \nfor\n\n[[Page S7710]]\n\nour national security. We should not be making decisions on foreign \npolicy based upon our oil needs from countries that disagree with our \nforeign policy objectives.\n  We need energy independence for economic reasons. Today, we held a \nhearing in the Committee on Small Business and pointed out the dangers \nto our economy because of the unpredictability of gasoline prices.\n  We need energy independence because of environmental issues. For this \nreason, I want to emphasize why I have great respect for my colleague \nfrom our neighboring State of Virginia, but I very much disagree with \nthe amendment that he has submitted, and I urge my colleagues to reject \nthe Warner amendment.\n  For 25 years, the Outer Continental Shelf moratorium and the long-\nstanding Presidential OSC withdrawals have protected our coasts. There \nare several reasons I oppose the Warner amendment. Virginia and \nMaryland are neighboring States, and we share a lot. We share a coast, \nwe share the Chesapeake Bay, and we share a special way of life because \nof the Chesapeake Bay.\n  The coast and the bay are critically important to our region because \nof tourism, because of commercial and recreational sports fishing, \nbecause of the real estate impacts, and because of the quality of life. \nBillions of dollars in our economy depend upon the health of our \ncoasts, and many jobs are dependent upon what we do in protecting our \nshores.\n\n  Gas drilling presents an unacceptable risk, and we should not allow \nit to take place. I heard my friend say this is a Virginia issue. No, \nit is not a Virginia issue. It will have a direct impact, or could have \na direct impact on my State of Maryland and on neighboring States. \nLiquid gas condensed is highly toxic to marine life. Waste discharges, \nmud spills, everything you can conceive of related to drilling presents \na true risk to the environment in my State and surrounding States. We \ndon't need to incur this type of a risk.\n  Now, we don't have to look very far to see what has happened \nhistorically with spills. In 2002, there was a spill 150 miles--not 50 \nmiles but 150 miles--off the coast of Spain. It affected 1,000 beaches \nin Spain and France. If there is a spill during unpredictable weather, \nit can be transmitted hundreds of miles and can affect an entire \nregion. So this is a very important decision we are making as to \nwhether to open up drilling along the Virginia coast, which will affect \nour entire east coast of the United States.\n  The main tragedy is that we don't need to do this. We can't drill our \nway to energy independence. The United States has but 5 percent of the \nworld's reserves in oil and gas. That is not the way we are going to be \nable to achieve energy independence. The bill that we have before us is \na balanced bill. It recognizes first and foremost that we need to \nbecome energy independent through efficiency, saving energy use, using \nless energy in our buildings, using less energy in transportation, and \nconserving our energy use. That is the first way to do it.\n  On alternative and renewable energy sources, yes, we can achieve a \nlot toward energy independence, and we also should be doing a lot more \nin research to determine ways in which we can use energy more \nefficiently and produce more alternative and renewable energy sources. \nBut we are not going to drill our way out of our energy problems.\n  As I said in the beginning, energy independence is important for our \nsecurity, for our economy, and our environment. I believe the Warner \namendment will take us a step backwards in trying to make sure as we \npresent policies to make us energy independent that we also protect our \nenvironment. I urge my colleagues to reject the Warner amendment.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up \nto 10 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           General Peter Pace\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, the other day I saw something--and I \nshould have it with me but I don't now--in the media that was critical \nof GEN Peter Pace, the outgoing Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. \nWhen I think of words to describe Peter Pace, the words that come to my \nmind are always loyalty and honor. Those happen to be the words of the \nUnited States Marine Corps. These are their watch words.\n  Peter Pace is today, and has always been, a true marine--the first \nmarine to serve as both the Vice Chairman and Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff. He is loyal to this country, its people, and to the \nmen and women who wear the uniform of its Armed Forces.\n  He served this country with honor as a rifle platoon leader in \nVietnam. He has done everything: a marine commander in Somalia, \ncommander of U.S. Marine forces in the Atlantic, commander of the U.S. \nSouthern Command, and then Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n  As Chairman, he has led our military during one of the most critical \ntimes in history, fighting in wars against terrorists in Afghanistan \nand Iraq, engaged throughout the world providing support and aid to our \nallies and friends.\n  I have long been, and still am, a real fan of Peter Pace, and I \ncannot think of one military leader I have known in the 21 years I have \nserved on the House Armed Services and the Senate Armed Services \nCommittees who is a greater American than Peter Pace. Let me just pay \nthis tribute to him today as one great marine and one great American.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Inhofe pertaining to the introduction of S. 1623 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. INHOFE. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. I ask unanimous consent to proceed as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, today we are considering the Energy bill. \nWhen you talk about energy policy, you think about--you almost can't \nseparate it from trade policy, from manufacturing policy, from what is \nhappening to American jobs and American industry. American \nmanufacturing has been a bedrock of our country's strength and \nprosperity for much of this country's existence, certainly for the last \ncentury and a half. Our current trade policy has caused our Nation to \nhemorrhage manufacturing jobs and devastated communities in my home \nState of Ohio and across the Nation. Last week, Senator Stabenow and \nothers participated in a manufacturing summit with leaders from \nGovernment and industry, trying to figure out how we remain \ncompetitive, how we shape trade and tax policies to help, not hurt, our \nsmall companies or medium-size manufacturers.\n  I live in a state, from Steubenville to Toledo, from Ashtabula to \nDayton, where job loss has way too often been the order of the day--\nmanufacturing jobs lost, often jobs going to Mexico when plants close, \noften jobs outsourced to China--so often devastating communities. When \na plant shuts down in Lima or Mansfield or Zanesville or Marion, that \nis not just a loss to those workers or to those families, but it is \nlayoffs of firefighters and police officers; it is fewer schoolteachers \nto teach children in those communities where parents may have lost \ntheir jobs. It is pretty clear as a Nation we need to fight back.\n  When I look at what this Energy bill can be about and the leadership \nof Senator Bingaman and what he is doing with this energy legislation, \nI think about Oberlin College. Oberlin College, a school in northern \nColorado, is the site of the largest building on any campus in America \nthat is fully powered by solar energy. Yet the solar panels in Oberlin \nCollege to power this solar building, this building on Oberlin's\n\n[[Page S7711]]\n\ncampus, were all purchased in Japan and Germany because we don't make \nenough of them in this country.\n  The same can be said for wind turbines. As we have begun to construct \nwind turbine fields around the country, looking at places such as Lake \nErie and the Great Plains and other places, we know that most of the \ncomponents for these wind turbines are built abroad. That is something \nwhere a manufacturing policy and an energy policy come together.\n  At the same time, we have seen across the hall, in the House of \nRepresentatives, a move afoot with the Bush administration to pass two \nmore trade deals, a trade agreement with Panama and a trade agreement \nwith Peru. The trade policy in this country--you have to wonder how \nmany more trade deals are we going to pass before the powers that be in \nthe White House understand our trade policy has failed? Fourteen or \nfifteen years ago, when I ran for Congress, we had a trade deficit in \nthis country of $38 billion. Today that trade deficit exceeds $700 \nbillion. It is a growth of almost 20 times.\n  To understand in some sense what a $38 billion trade deficit that a \ndecade and a half later is a $700-plus billion trade deficit means, \nthink about it in these terms. The first President Bush said a billion \ndollar trade deficit translates into 13,000 lost jobs. Do the math and \nyou can see why we have had the devastation across particularly the \nindustrial Midwest, but also every State in this country has lost \nsignificant manufacturing jobs. Five million manufacturing jobs have \nbeen lost during the Bush administration, hundreds of thousands of \nthose in Ohio, in places such as Bryan and places such as Portsmouth, \nin places such as Xenia and Springfield.\n  The President said he is willing to sign now a trade agreement with \nPeru and Panama, with labor and environmental standards in those trade \nagreements. That was the announcement the President recently made, the \nU.S. Trade Representative recently made. But go back and look. We have \na history with this administration of not doing what they promised in \ntrade agreements. Go back to an administration before, the North \nAmerican Free Trade Agreement. They passed labor/environmental \nstandards as a side agreement in those trade agreements, something \nprobably they plan to do with Peru and Panama. Those side agreements \nfor labor and environmental standards in the end meant absolutely \nnothing.\n  Then go back to the year 2000, where both Houses of Congress passed--\nI supported it--the trade agreement with Jordan. That trade agreement \nhad strong labor and environmental standards. But one of the first \nthings President Bush's Trade Representative did--back then it was \nRobert Zoellick--was to send a letter with the Jordanians regarding \ndispute resolution, saying they would not enforce, telling the \nJordanian Government they were not going to make them enforce their \nlabor and environmental standards.\n  What happened, you got a good trade agreement with strong labor and \nenvironmental standards with Jordan. When you don't enforce those \nstandards, you end up with Jordan being a sweatshop and an export \nplatform, with mostly Bangladeshi workers imported into Jordan, making \ntextiles and apparel, mostly apparel, sewing clothes, as a sweatshop \nthat simply violated all we say we stand for with American values and \nall we said we stood for in this trade agreement.\n  The point is, before we pass trade agreements, we need labor and \nenvironmental standards at the core of the agreement; we need \ncommitment from the administration that they will, in fact, unlike in \nthe past, enforce these labor and environmental standards; and we need \nbenchmarks--as Senator Dorgan has said many times, benchmarks that \nallow us to gauge whether these trade agreements serve our national \ninterest. We pass a trade agreement, and we then begin to measure its \nsuccess. Does it mean more jobs or fewer jobs for American workers? \nDoes it mean a trade increase in the trade deficit or does it mean a \nshrinking of the trade deficit? Does it mean an increase in income or \ndoes it mean stagnant incomes, as we have seen for so many American \nworkers?\n  We know profits are up. We know salaries are up for top management. \nBut we also know wages for most American workers--especially \nmanufacturing workers but most American workers--have been flat. This \nwas brought home to me at Senator Stabenow's manufacturing summit a \nweek or so ago when John Colm, a businessman from Cleveland, handed me \na stack of auction notices about this high. There were 47 of them he \nhad received since December 2006. These were auction notices from small \ncompanies which were selling off their assets in machinery, which were \ncannibalizing their plants, selling off at rock-bottom prices because \nthey can't compete with cheap imports and can't compete because of this \nunlevel playing field because of trade agreements and because of tax \nlaw in this country that is simply so uneven.\n  That is why, before we consider trade promotion authority, before we \nconsider the Peru or Panama trade agreements, before we consider \nColombia or South Korea trade agreements, we have to ask ourselves the \nquestion: Are these trade agreements fair to American workers? Will \nthey help our communities? Will they help us strengthen the middle \nclass or will these trade agreements continue to contribute to an \nexploding trade deficit, to lost jobs, to devastating communities all \nover my State of Ohio and all over the country? That is the fundamental \nquestion on trade policy--what does it do to strengthen the middle \nclass? If it fails that test, these trade agreements should fail in the \nSenate.\n  We will hear more in the upcoming months about these trade agreements \nand about U.S. trade policy and how we cannot just oppose bad trade \nagreements but bring forward trade agreements with benchmarks that help \nAmerican workers and help to strengthen the middle class.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown.) The Senator from Minnesota is \nrecognized.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 1557\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I am here to make some brief comments \nabout amendment No. 1557, which was introduced today. I spoke about \nthis earlier, but it had not yet been accepted and introduced.\n  I appreciate that Senator Snowe, one of the coauthors on this \namendment, also spoke. I wish to thank the other authors of this \namendment. That would be Senator Bingaman, who is managing this Energy \nbill, as well as Senators Carper, Coleman, Kerry, and Boxer.\n  This amendment is a very important one. It establishes a national \ngreenhouse gas registry that will gather and consolidate consistent, \ntransparent, and reliable data on greenhouse gas emissions.\n  Now, it may not be the most exiting amendment that is being \nintroduced today or this week, but it is a very important one. The \nreason we need this amendment is we actually do not have mandatory \nreporting right now for greenhouse gas emissions. I think that is \nsurprising for people. If you were to ask what are some of the largest \nemitters of greenhouse gasses, you would not be able to easily find \nthat information. Recently, a reporter for National Public Radio tried \nto find out that answer. She was unable to do it.\n  Although most electric powerplants already report their carbon \ndioxide emissions to the EPA, this only represents 37 percent of total \nU.S. greenhouse gas emissions that are reported. As for the remaining \ngreenhouse gas emissions data, the Department of Energy and the EPA \ncollect data on energy production and consumption; however, the \nquantity and the quality of this data collected vary significantly \nacross different fuels and different sectors. For example, data on \ncrude oil and petroleum products is collected weekly from selected oil \ncompanies, while data on the industrial sector is collected only once \nevery 3 years through surveys. In some cases, Federal agencies collect \nthe data themselves, while in other cases data is collected through \nvoluntary reports. This\n\n[[Page S7712]]\n\ninconsistency in approaches has resulted in a lack of comparability of \nreported emissions from company to company within specific economic \nsectors, as well as the lack of comparability of results from reporting \nprogram to reporting program.\n\n  Many people have called for a national registry. Currently, as you \nknow, 31 States have asked for some type of registry. They have \nactually joined together and tried to create their own national \nregistry because of inaction by the Federal Government. I cannot think \nof a better example when you have 31 States banding together when, in \nfact, they would prefer a national registry with the EPA. That is why \nthese States are interested in a national registry.\n  We also have some significant businesses which would like to see a \nregistry such as this. They have come together as part of the U.S. \nClimate Action Partnership. They have urged Congress to fast-track a \ngreenhouse gas inventory and registry. They actually did this back in \nJanuary of this year. We still see no action. These are companies such \nas Boston Scientific, BP America, Caterpillar, Deere and Company, Dow \nChemical, Duke Energy, DuPont. It is time to act.\n  Justice Brandeis once talked about how the States were the \nlaboratories of democracy and how one courageous State can go ahead and \ndo things and experiment and set an example for the Nation. Well, that \nis happening right now across this country. He never meant, however, \nfor the Federal Government to be complacent.\n  This is a simple piece of legislation with bipartisan support. It is \ntime to act. This is the bill to do it. We can get the accurate data. \nIt does not dictate the policy with greenhouse gas emissions. We will \nhave as many policy choices as we do now; the difference is we will get \nthis national greenhouse gas registry in place, not for small business, \nas there is an exemption, but for our largest emitters of greenhouse \ngases so that we can have accurate information with which to proceed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n\n\n                     Amendments Nos. 1566 and 1578\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time \nuntil 5:20 today be for debate with respect to the Warner amendment, \nNo. 1566, and the Menendez amendment, No. 1578, with the time to run \nconcurrently and be equally divided and controlled between Senators \nWarner and Menendez or their designees; that the Menendez amendment be \nmodified to be a first-degree amendment; that no amendment be in order \nto either amendment prior to the vote; that each amendment must receive \n60 affirmative votes to be agreed to; and that if each amendment fails \nto receive 60 affirmative votes, it will be withdrawn; provided further \nthat the first vote occur with respect to the Warner amendment; that if \nthe Warner amendment does not receive 60 votes, then the Menendez \namendment, as modified, be withdrawn; that at 5:20 today, the Senate \nproceed to vote in relation to the Warner amendment without further \nintervening action or debate; provided further that Senator Lautenberg \ncontrol up to 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment No. 1578), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ___. AVAILABILITY OF CERTAIN AREAS FOR LEASING.\n\n       Section 8 of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (43 \n     U.S.C. 1337) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(q) Availability of Certain Areas for Leasing.--\n       ``(1) Definitions.--In this subsection:\n       ``(A) Atlantic coastal state.--The term `Atlantic Coastal \n     State' means each of the States of Maine, New Hampshire, \n     Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Delaware, New York, \n     New Jersey, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South \n     Carolina, Georgia, and Florida\n       ``(B) Governor.--The term `Governor' means the Governor of \n     the State.\n       ``(C) Qualified revenues.--The term `qualified revenues' \n     means all rentals, royalties, bonus bids, and other sums due \n     and payable to the United States from leases entered into on \n     or after the date of enactment of this Act for natural gas \n     exploration and extraction activities authorized by the \n     Secretary under this subsection.\n       ``(D) State.--The term `State' means the State of Virginia.\n       ``(2) Petition.--\n       ``(A) In general.--The Governor may submit to the \n     Secretary--\n       ``(i) a petition requesting that the Secretary issue leases \n     authorizing the conduct of natural gas exploration activities \n     only to ascertain the presence or absence of a natural gas \n     reserve in any area that is at least 50 miles beyond the \n     coastal zone of the State;

Who yields time? The Senator from Virginia is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I would like to speak on behalf of my \namendment, which presumably will be voted on here in a matter of \nminutes.\n  I accept the 60 votes because what I want to do is to have a record \nof just where the sentiments are among my esteemed colleagues with \nregard to what I view as an advancement in technology and a worsening \nof the situation with regard to our energy supply and why these two \nforces cannot converge in such a manner as to enable a Member of the \nSenate to acknowledge that a State has a right to utilize those \nresources on the Continental Shelf off of its shore. It just concerns \nme greatly. I mean, natural gas is up--a 78 percent increase in price \nsince the year 2000.\n  My good friend and chairman of the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee got up in her usual eloquent way to explain why she was very \nmuch opposed to my amendment. So I went back and did a little homework \nand determined that California is the second largest consumer of \nnatural gas in the Nation. So I say to my colleague: Where is it going \nto come from? Where is it going to come from?\n  Florida. My good friend got up and raised a technical amendment, \nwhich momentarily knocked me off stride, but I went back and found \ndocuments\n\n[[Page S7713]]\n\nwhich clarify the situation that the Department of Defense will work \nwith the Department of the Interior, and in no way should a petition be \nfiled by the Governor of Virginia for a drilling permit to explore and \ndetermine the presence or absence of natural gas off our coast, in no \nway will that interfere with national security. And that letter is in \nthe record. But he is very much against that. It is interesting; \nFlorida consumes 2\\1/2\\ times the amount of natural gas that Virginia \nconsumes, and New Jersey--my good friend who opposed me on this--\nconsumes twice the amount of natural gas that the State of Virginia \nconsumes.\n  My State is simply trying to manifest the courage, and thus far two \nsuccessive Governors have broken ground on this, both of them \ndistinguished members of the Democratic Party. And the State \nlegislatures--coincidentally under the control of Republicans--have \nindicated Virginia's willingness to look in the direction of drilling \noffshore.\n  Our State, I believe, is on the verge of stepping up to accept the \nresponsibility to help this Nation meet its needs to begin to prepare \nto ward off this energy crisis which is rapidly coming our way.\n  I thank Virginians. I would hope that given the right of States to \nmake choices for themselves, my colleagues would see fit to recognize \nthe problem of the shortage of energy and the need for States such as \nours to step up and help.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, do I have any time constraints?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the remaining time \nis under the control of the Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. How do I speak if I don't have any time?\n  I ask unanimous consent to be granted permission to speak for up to \n10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Reserving the right to object, if there would be equal \ntime, 10 minutes on each side, I would not object.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I am speaking on my own. I am not the proponent. Do you \nthink it is fair that just for my speaking you must speak? If you do, I \nwill have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is a unanimous consent request that \nthere be a vote held at 5:20.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask unanimous consent that he then have that time. I \nwill take 5 minutes.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, am I to assume the unanimous consent \nrequest is for 5 minutes additional for each side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the unanimous consent \nrequest, as modified?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That is fine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Mexico is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I say to my good friend, the Senator \nfrom Virginia, I sense what is going on here today would indicate you \nwill have a hard time with this amendment and maybe you won't win. But \nI guarantee you it will not be long before what you espouse here \nhappens. You will once again, as in so many other things, be ahead of \nthe politicians. You will be two steps ahead of those who do things for \npolitical reasons around here instead of the many times you have come \nforth and put your Senate privileges on the line by doing what is \nright. Your State must be elated with the idea--if they aren't now, \nthey will be--that they will have the option of letting drilling occur \n50 miles off the coast. They won't see the drilling unless they have \nbinoculars. So for those who say they are going to see one of these \nbeautiful wells with all of the equipment, they better have binoculars \nto see it. For those who are worried about a spill, they will have to \nbe grandmas and grandpas and even older than that before they see one, \nbecause even with the big earthquakes and the big things that happened \nin Louisiana, they didn't even get a spill. How are you going to get a \nspill if you can't get one out of that thing?\n  So here you come and you say, with natural gas at $7, feeding all the \nindustries in America--and it does; natural gas feeds the underlying \nbusinesses that produce in America--they are all telling us the one \nthing that is forcing us to do what, to leave America, can you imagine, \nto be forced to go to another country? It used to be this or that, now \nit is: We can't afford natural gas. It is so cheap somewhere else, and \nwe have it in abundance on our own property. Offshore is America's \nproperty. Here you come with a very innocuous proposal to let the State \ndecide. Then if they say, OK, they, too, have said they are not afraid, \nthen they are going to share in the royalties just like Louisiana and \nMississippi. But guess what. The United States is going to share in not \nonly the royalties, they are going to get natural gas for users in \nAmerica who are desperate. The price used to be $1 and $2. You haven't \nseen that, and you won't see it. It is $7 for the unit we use. How \ncould some company that uses that for its base industries survive?\n  If you are in the business of ethanol and running around here \nbragging about ethanol, let me remind you, the second biggest cost item \nfor turning corn to ethanol, the second biggest cost product is natural \ngas. Then comes corn. Corn is first and then it. Can you imagine? It \nitself is making gasoline more expensive, not only natural gas, because \nwe are making gasoline out of corn. Then we are spending a huge amount \nfor the natural gas that goes into heating it, burning it and all the \nother things, and we can't even get an amendment adopted here today. I \nhope I am wrong. It used to be the States that didn't want us to. Now \nwe have somebody else objecting. What is it, other States? We are going \nto have to go around with a cop and ask the States all around us.\n  I would hope we would pass the Warner amendment here today. This \nbill, which has nothing in it to produce anything, would at least turn \na little bit toward production. You could put up a flag and say: We \nhave an energy bill, and John Warner's amendment is the first one that \nproduced any energy of any significance. We would all be glad to see \nthat happen. We hope we have some other amendments that produce before \nwe are finished.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I understand my colleague, the \ndistinguished Senator from Virginia, has submitted additional \ncorrespondence from the Department of Defense and I would like the \nopportunity to comment on this letter. The Department of Defense \nroutinely provides generic comments, as requested by the Minerals \nManagement Service, on the various steps leading to a Draft Proposed \nFive-Year OCS Leasing Program, and my friend, Senator Warner, has \napparently quoted, in part, from such a generic comment letter from \nDonald R. Schregardus, Deputy Assistant Secretary, Environment, of the \nDepartment of the Navy.\n  With all due respect to my colleague Senator Warner, this letter only \nprovides vague reassurances about the hopeful intent of the Department \nof the Navy to be able to work out, sometime in the future, remaining \nmilitary space-use conflicts with proposed MMS OCS leasing activities \nin various areas.\n  In Florida, working out such space-use conflicts with military \nexercise and training areas took several years, and in the end required \ncongressional action, which we completed only last December in this \nChamber.\n  Further, the same letter from the Department of the Navy recently \nquoted by my colleague Senator Warner goes on to say, and I quote \ndirectly from the letter:\n\n       However, the special interest sale proposed for the Mid-\n     Atlantic Region in late 2011 is not acceptable to the \n     Department because of its incompatibility with the military \n     training and testing conducted in this area.\n\n  While the Navy's letter goes on to conclude on a conciliatory note, \nhoping that things can be worked out in the future, such negotiations, \nas we have experienced in Florida for years, take time, effort, and \noften, a very long period of time.\n  We do not think that going forward with my friend Mr. Warner's \namendment at this time, in spite of the continuing clear concerns \nexpressed by the Department of the Navy, is a wise idea at this time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, may I thank my colleague for his very \nthoughtful remarks.\n\n[[Page S7714]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I ask if I may use 1 minute of the time of the Senator \nfrom New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I am happy to yield to the distinguished Senator from \nNew Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Let me speak very briefly to oppose the amendment by my \nfriend and colleague from Virginia. In my view there are two reasons \nwhy we do not have drilling off the coast of Virginia. No. 1 is that \nthe President, by executive order, has put a moratorium on any drilling \noff the coast of Virginia or the mid-Atlantic. Second, every year when \nwe pass the Interior appropriations bill, we include in it boilerplate \nlanguage. We have done it for a couple decades now. It says: No funds \nprovided in this title may be expended by the Department of Interior to \nconduct oil and natural gas preleasing, leasing, or related activities \nin the middle Atlantic and south Atlantic planning areas.\n  If the Senator from Virginia wants to see drilling off the coast of \nVirginia, he should change this provision when we get to the Interior \nappropriations bill in 3 or 4 weeks. That is the place to get that \nchanged. If that is not changed, I would say even if the Senator's \namendment today were enacted, it would have no force and effect, \nbecause no funds could be spent to carry it out. In my view, it should \nbe changed in that respect.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized for \n6 minutes 40 seconds.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I yield to the senior Senator from New Jersey 5 minutes \nand reserve the remainder of the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from New Jersey is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague from \nNew Jersey.\n  I rise in opposition to the amendment offered by the Senator from \nVirginia. It is not often I disagree with the Senator from Virginia. I \nthink this is the wrong course. To allow exploration and potential \ndrilling off the coast of Virginia? We are from a State with a \ncoastline that we cherish and must protect with all of our energy. \nImagine the devastation an oil or a natural gas spill off the coast of \nVirginia would cause. New Jersey is only 75 miles from the proposed \ndrilling sites off the coast of Virginia. An oil spill can travel \nhundreds of miles. For instance, when the Exxon Valdez dumped 11 \nmillion gallons of oil in Alaska, the oil traveled 470 miles. I was \nthere within 3 days. It had already traveled hundreds of miles in \nAlaska. An oil spill from any offshore site off Virginia's coast could \neasily devastate the shoreline of our State and States up and down the \nEastern Seaboard. It could poison the Atlantic and marine life that has \nmade the ocean their home. It would damage our economy enormously. Our \ncoastline accounts for approximately $50 billion a year in tourism \nevery year and supports almost 500,000 jobs.\n  The Warner amendment calls for offshore exploration and drilling for \nnatural gas. According to the Department of Interior, natural gas is \nseldom found as a solitary product. Oil is almost always found in those \nlocations. So not only can natural gas have environmental problems, but \ndrilling for natural gas can easily result in puncturing oil deposits \nand causing major spills.\n  According to the Department of Interior, approximately 3 million \ngallons of oil were spilled as a result of offshore drilling between \n1980 and 1999. Each of these spills averaged more than 40,000 gallons. \nThe Warner amendment will increase the likelihood of a spill ravaging \nour beaches. We won't allow New Jersey's coastline and our marine life \nto be placed at such a risk.\n  It is not just me who is urging my colleagues to vote against this. \nThe Governors from New Jersey, Delaware, Connecticut, and Maine have \nwritten letters to Congress urging this body to act responsibly and not \nallow drilling off our coasts. The energy we might be able to get there \npales in comparison to the damage we could do to our coastlines in a \nvery short time.\n  Reluctantly, I say to my friend from Virginia, I oppose the \namendment. I encourage my colleagues to do the same.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I hope all States within the Outer \nContinental Shelf understand the passage of the Warner amendment begins \nthe undoing of the moratorium. For if one State is able to do this, the \ndomino effect that could undo the whole basis of the moratorium that \nhas existed for a quarter of a century will begin to be undone.\n  Secondly, this is not simply about Virginia's waters. These are \nFederal waters. This is the Federal Outer Continental Shelf. It is a \nnational context in which we look at it. That is why we have a national \nmoratorium.\n  Thirdly, even the Senator from Virginia recognizes that damage to \nother States can take place, because he creates a fund in his amendment \nto mitigate damages that may take place as a result of such drilling. I \ndon't want my State or any other coastal State to have to deal with \ndamages and to mitigate damages. I want to prevent those damages.\n  Fourthly, anyone who believes we are going to drill for gas and then \nmaybe find oil and plug it up and not pursue the oil is living under a \ndifferent set of illusions. That is the reality.\n  Lastly, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the \nApril 10, 2006 letter from the Department of Defense to the Department \nof the Interior opposing such efforts for drilling off of Virginia.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Department of the Navy, The Assistant Secretary of the \n           Navy\n                                   Washington, DC, April 10, 2006.\n     Ms. R. M. ``Johnnie'' Burton,\n     Director, Minerals Management Service, Department of the \n         Interior, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Ms. Burton: This is in reply to your letter to \n     Secretary Rumsfeld requesting comments on the Department of \n     the Interior's Draft Proposed 5-Year Outer Continental Shelf, \n     OCS, Oil and Gas Leasing Program for 2007-2012. I am \n     responding as the Defense Department's Executive Agent for \n     OCS matters.\n       The Department of Defense has reviewed the draft proposed \n     program and the seven OCS planning areas proposed for \n     leasing. Based on our review, we foresee no OCS-use conflicts \n     within the lease sale areas proposed for the Alaska Planning \n     Areas, and only minimal conflicts with the proposed lease \n     sale areas within the Gulf of Mexico Planning Areas. We have \n     considerable concern, however, with the proposed lease sale \n     areas within the Mid-Atlantic Planning Area off the coast of \n     Virginia,\n       Notwithstanding the above, the eastern Gulf of Mexico \n     remains an area of importance to the Department of Defense \n     because of the critical military test and training activities \n     the Department conducts there. These activities, which are \n     intensifying, require large, cleared safety footprints free \n     of any structures on or near the water surface. Because the \n     majority of the new Gulf of Mexico proposed sale area is west \n     of the Military Mission Line, MML, 86  41'W longitude, the \n     new proposed program should not present unmanageable effects \n     on military test and training. A small area in the \n     southeasternmost portion of the Central Gulf Planning Area \n     crosses the MML, an area that the Secretary of Defense has \n     stated is incompatible with drilling structures and \n     associated development because of the diversity of military \n     testing and training activities conducted there now, and \n     those planned for the future. We therefore request this area \n     be removed from the program. Also, stipulations mirroring \n     those contained in current leases held by the oil/gas lessees \n     will need to be included for new program areas that overlap \n     our Gulf Range Water Test Areas. An example copy of the \n     current stipulations is enclosed.\n       The draft program option of greatest concern to the \n     Department of Defense involves the special interest sale \n     proposed for the Mid-Atlantic off the coast of Virginia. The \n     proposed area lies within the Virginia Capes, VACAPES, \n     Operations Areas where the Navy's training and test and \n     evaluation community conducts significant activity.\n       This is the Navy's primary area for weapons separation \n     testing, conducting supersonic flight profiles, and \n     performing target launches in support of acquisition programs \n     and ship qualification testing. It is the designated area, \n     both for test and evaluation and for training missile \n     launches, that requires cleared sea space as an impact area. \n     It is also the Navy's primary area for conducting autonomous \n     underwater vehicle testing from submarines. The VACAPES \n     undersea, surface, and air space areas are critical to the \n     development, fielding and certification of naval weapon \n     systems; as a consequence, the Navy requires unencumbered \n     access to the full expanse of this operations area. The Navy, \n     Army, Air Force, and Marine Corps all use the VACAPES \n     Operations Areas. Training operations that occur in the \n     proposed oil and gas use area include aircraft carrier \n     operations, amphibious vehicles operations, gunnery training, \n     and F/A-18, F-15, F-16 and F-22 guns firings. Any structures \n     built in the water where these types of activities are \n     conducted, particularly low-level gunnery practice and \n     missile separation testing, would restrict where military air \n     wings\n\n[[Page S7715]]\n\n     can fire their weapons, drive aircraft further away from the \n     coast, increase fuel costs and wear and tear on the \n     airframes, increase flight times enroute to training areas, \n     and increase the risk to aircrews due to the increased \n     distance from emergency recovery bases. Because hazards in \n     this area to operating crews and oil company equipment and \n     structures would be so great, the Department opposes oil and \n     gas development activity in this OCS planning location.\n       The Navy has compiled an exhaustive and detailed assessment \n     of the type, frequency, and sponsor of activities conducted \n     in the VACAPES Operations Areas. This includes both current \n     and future test activity and training. We are prepared to \n     share this data, should it be necessary, with members of your \n     staff that have appropriate clearances. We have attached for \n     your immediate reference a map of the VACAPES test, \n     evaluation, and training complex and a brief synopsis of the \n     important military activities conducted there.\n       We support the promotion and production of offshore oil and \n     gas exploration that is critical to our country's energy and \n     national security and look forward to working with you and \n     your staff in the period ahead to ensure success in this \n     area.\n                                            Donald R. Schregardus,\n                                                     By direction.\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I believe on all of these scores, this is not pursuing \nthe renewable energy sources the underlying bill is all about. This \nundermines the moratorium on the Outer Continental Shelf. This puts at \nrisk other States. This is not about Virginia alone. This is about the \nentire Federal Outer Continental Shelf. Other States have interests \nwhen one shore can ultimately create consequences on the rest of that \ncoastline. Also the Department of Defense takes the position that it is \nin opposition. For all of those reasons, it is fitting and appropriate \nthat we oppose the Warner amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter \nwhich superceded the letter to which the Senator from New Jersey \nreferred to be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Department of the Navy, Office of the Assistant Secretary \n           (Installations and Environment),\n                                Washington, DC, November 27, 2006.\n     Ms. R.M. ``Johnnie'' Burton,\n     Director, Minerals Management Service, Department of the \n         Interior, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Ms. Burton: This responds to your letter to Secretary \n     Rumsfeld requesting comments on the Department of the \n     Interior's Proposed Program for Outer Continental Shelf Oil \n     and Gas Leasing for 2007-2012 and accompanying Draft \n     Environmental Impact Statement. I am responding for the \n     Secretary in my capacity as the Defense Department's \n     Executive Agent for Outer Continental Shelf matters.\n       The proposed program is very similar to the draft proposed \n     program that we commented on in our letter to you of April \n     10, 2006. For the Gulf of Mexico Planning Region, we concur \n     with the proposed program change that excludes from leasing \n     the area east of the military mission line at 86  41' W \n     longitude. As for the Alaska Planning Region, the Department \n     is neither affected by nor objects to the proposed area \n     reductions in the North Aleutian Basin and Chukchi Sea. \n     Lastly, the Department supports the Mid-Atlantic Region \n     proposed program changes that exclude the area within 25 \n     miles of the coastline of Virginia and provide a no-\n     obstruction zone from the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay as \n     depicted in Map 9 of the published proposed program. However, \n     the special interest sale proposed for the Mid-Atlantic \n     Region in late 2011 is not acceptable to the Department \n     because of its incompatibility with the military training and \n     testing conducted in this area. Notwithstanding the above, \n     the Department is willing to discuss with you possible \n     alternatives that may provide opportunities for exploration \n     and potential joint use of the Mid-Atlantic area consistent \n     with the critical military test and training activities in \n     this area.\n       Our departments have worked closely together over the years \n     to ensure a continuing successful leasing program with a \n     manageable impact on defense operations. We agree that oil \n     and gas development on the Outer Continental Shelf must \n     strike a balance between our nation's energy and national \n     security goals. As the Administration moves forward on a plan \n     to best meet the Nation's oil and gas energy needs for 2007 \n     to 2012, we look forward to working with you to ensure its \n     success.\n                                            Donald R. Schregardus,\n                         Deputy Assistant Secretary (Environment).\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n  Under the previous order, the question is on agreeing to amendment \nNo. 1566, as modified, offered by the senior Senator from Virginia, Mr. \nWarner.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

The junior Senator from New Mexico is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, my colleague from New Mexico wishes to \nmake a statement for some of his colleagues before they leave.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from New Mexico is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, a number of Republican Senators have \nindicated they are preparing amendments they want to get into this \nbill. I just want to remind my colleagues that it doesn't seem like it, \nbut time has really been flying. We will be lucky if we are on this \nbill until Wednesday of next week, and when we come back on Monday, \nthere are no votes. So if you have amendments, you had better get them \nready and get them in, or we probably will not have them considered. \nYou tell me about great things when we stand around here and talk, but \nI don't have your amendments, so it would be good if you have them. I \nassume Senator Bingaman has a similar request, maybe not.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The junior Senator from New Mexico is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I underscore the point that my colleague \nhas made. If Senators do have amendments they want to have seriously \nconsidered, they need to get them to us. We will be trying to consider \nor at least organize amendments tomorrow. We are not having rollcall \nvotes, I have\n\n[[Page S7716]]\n\nbeen informed by the majority leader, either tomorrow or Monday, but we \nare going to try to process any amendments we can get agreements to \nmove ahead with. We urge Senators to get those amendments to us and get \nthose amendments filed.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Florida). Without objection, it \nis so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Byrd are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1572, as Modified\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, one amendment that was offered today by \nSenator Salazar on behalf of himself, Senator Bayh, Senator Cantwell, \nSenator Lincoln, Senator Clinton, Senator Brownback, Senator Lieberman, \nSenator Coleman, Senator Biden is an amendment related to plug-in \nhybrids. It is amendment No. 1572, as modified. We have now cleared \nthis with all interested parties on both sides of the aisle. It is my \ninformation that it is ready for a vote. I will send the modification \nto the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

If there is no further debate on the \namendment, the question is on agreeing to the amendment, as modified.\n  The amendment (No. 1572), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote, and I \nmove to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I thank my colleague from Alaska for her courtesy in \nyielding me time to do this.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise this evening to speak in support \nof a bipartisan amendment to provide assistance to geothermal power \ndevelopment. This is the National Geothermal Initiative Act of 2007.\n  I can really get excited about geothermal. In the State of Alaska, \nwhere about 70 percent of our State's communities could theoretically \ntap into hot water from inside the Earth to produce electricity, the \npossibilities for us as a State are truly enormous. Alaska has nearly a \ndozen proposed geothermal projects right now that could proceed if \nthere were additional Federal assistance to help in the identification \nof specific geothermal well sites or aid in the drilling or perhaps \nprovide assistance to develop the geothermal turbines that operate more \nefficiently.\n  We have had great discussion on the Senate floor about the price of \nfuel, the price of energy. It is truly near record highs. Hot water \nheated naturally by the Earth supports zero fuel cost. Geothermal power \nonly provides the Nation with three-tenths of 1 percent of its \nelectricity at present. This is because of currently high capital costs \nof siting and building geothermal plants. Geothermal is not yet a \nmature technology.\n  Even though we have been trying to promote geothermal technology for \nover two decades now, there is still a great deal of work to be done. \nWe have not finished a national geothermal mapping assessment. This was \nstarted back in 1978. It was never actually conducted in Alaska. But to \nbe able to identify those areas in this country that hold geothermal \npotential is extremely important.\n  MIT recently published a report that suggested that geothermal power \nholds the promise of providing low-cost electricity for most of the \nNation. Unlike the discussion earlier today where there was debate \nabout wind generation, and some States are blessed with more wind than \nothers, this MIT report suggests that with geothermal there is greater \npotential in so many parts of the Nation. But the Federal Government--\nand this is according to the MIT report--the Federal Government would \nneed to increase its research and financial assistance to help prove \nthe new technology. This is the technology to mine the hot rocks or to \ninject water deeper into the Earth to heat up, rather than simply \ntapping the natural hot water springs or only heated subsurface water \npools closer to the surface where they are known.\n  What this amendment, the National Geothermal Initiative Act, would do \nwould be to create a geothermal initiative that will lead to the \ncompletion of a geothermal resource base assessment by the year 2010. \nIt will encourage demonstration plants to show the full range of \ngeothermal production and push new technology in the engineering of \ngeothermal plants.\n  Besides restating a Federal commitment to geothermal, this amendment \nwould fund a national exploration and research effort on the \ndevelopment of geothermal information centers.\n  We had real reason to celebrate in the State of Alaska last year. A \nlocal geothermal developer by the name of Bernie Karl--he owns a small \ngeothermal spring resort called Chena Hot Springs. This is about 35 or \n40 miles outside of the community of Fairbanks. This natural hot \nsprings has been there for years. There is a nice natural hot springs \nwhere you can come and bathe, and in the wintertime it is a wonderful \nspot for viewing the northern lights, since you are in these beautiful \nnatural hot springs.\n  But Mr. Karl had a vision that he could take this small resort--they \nhave about 65 beds there--that he could take this resort and power \neverything by geothermal. He could have the kitchen operating, he could \nhave the lights on in the lodge, and he could go beyond that. He was \ngoing to be a self-sustaining resort. He was going to grow his own \nvegetables. So he built a beautiful greenhouse where they grow, \nhydroponically, tomatoes and lettuce. Mr. Karl visited me in January \nand he brought with him some of the produce that he had just picked the \nday before, in Fairbanks. In January, in Fairbanks and in Chena Hot \nSprings, he was coming from temperatures of about 40 degrees below \nzero. He is able to grow this incredible produce in these temperatures \nwith a greenhouse that is completely heated and lighted by geothermal.\n  Right next door to his greenhouse he has an ice museum.\n  It is a large museum structure that has everything from knights in \nshining armor on horses that are larger than life-size, to a bar, a \nwedding chapel, bedrooms. The whole thing is an ice palace. He is able \nto keep it chilled, and you say, well, of course he can keep it chilled \nin Fairbanks in the winter: it is 40 below zero, but he is able to keep \nit chilled all throughout the summer using the geothermal energy he has \ntapped into. This is a remarkable demonstration of what can be done.\n  You need to understand that the technology he has utilized is not \nsome incredibly difficult and complex technology. He utilized a \ntechnology that is designed by United Technologies to produce \nelectricity from relatively cool water. The water that comes from these \nhot springs is about 160 degrees in temperature. They told Mr. Karl: \nThat is not hot enough to generate the power you need; it needs to be \nhotter. He did not believe them. He said: I know I can make it work. \nFor just a $1.5 million Federal grant, work at Chena Hot Springs has \nconfirmed that economic electricity can be generated from relatively \nlow-temperature geothermal resources.\n  Mr. Karl has taken his initiative even further than what is happening \nat that small resort. He is saying: I can create more geothermal energy \nthat we can sell down the road, sell into the system down in Fairbanks. \nBut again demonstrating we do have enormous potential, we just need a \nlittle bit of assistance in demonstrating this technology. It truly \nopens the door to so many more communities in Alaska that could \npotentially benefit from geothermal power.\n  Right now, besides Chena Hot Springs, there are geothermal projects \nthey are looking at in Akutan; this is down in the Aleutian chain. If \nyou ever look at the Aleutian chain, that long strip of islands off the \nState of Alaska, it is nothing but a string of volcanos, enormous \npotential. There are also opportunities at Mount Spurr near Anchorage. \nWe are looking at a situation within the south central part of the \nState where our natural gas resource in that area is waning. What \nbetter source to go to than Mount Spurr, just across the inlet, for \nthat geothermal power. Near Naknek, there is great potential. At \nTenakee Springs in the southeast, Pilgrim's Hot Springs in western \nAlaska--these are all ready to potentially produce power if there is \nsome Federal assistance to help lower the cost of their development. \nThis bill will also provide help to university-led geothermal research \nprograms and set up a similar program in Alaska to help expand \ngeothermal power.\n  Now, there are some who will argue that we do not need Federal aid \nfor this, that geothermal is this mature technology, it has been around \nfor a long while. But the new technology development, according to the \nMIT report, could result in geothermal power providing America with 100 \ngigawatts of electricity within 50 years, which is a significant \nportion of its future power needs, without the risk of supply \ndisruption or fuel price fluctuation.\n\n[[Page S7719]]\n\n  Then, of course, the other issue we are always very cognizant of on \nthis floor is how we care for our environment, how we deal with \nemissions from our fuel and energy sources. With geothermal power, we \ndo not produce greenhouse gas emissions, we do not release carbon into \nthe environment. There is a significant, a hugely significant advantage \ngiven the current concerns over global warming and climate change.\n  I had an opportunity, not too many weeks back, to meet with the \nPresident of Iceland when he was visiting. I know he met with many \nMembers of this body. I talked to the President of Iceland before. \nComing from an Arctic environment, we share a lot in common; we like to \nexchange notes. We have always talked about the geothermal energy in \nIceland and how that country has truly turned to that as their primary \nsource of energy generation.\n  He indicated to me that just in this past year, he has had major \ncorporations, international and national corporations from this \ncountry, looking to Iceland to locate their businesses. There used to \nbe a time when countries would look elsewhere to find cheap sources of \nlabor. Well, what companies are looking for now is affordable, \nreliable, clean energy.\n  Think about the potential again with geothermal. It is about as \nreliable as you are going to come across, just this constant bubbling \nsource from underneath. It is absolutely clean. If we can develop the \ntechnology, it can be that affordable source.\n  Right now, we have researchers in the Alaska Aleutians hoping for a \nFederal grant to test whether new types of unmanned aerial vehicles can \nbe used to pinpoint these geothermal hotspots, the exact spots where \nwells should be sunk to tap into the hot water resources. For a nominal \nFederal grant, this technology could be proven up and would save all \ngeothermal projects many millions of dollars in drilling costs. This \none project is an example of why and how Federal aid could be very \nuseful.\n  This amendment would authorize a couple hundred million dollars in \nFederal funding for all forms of geothermal work over the next 5 years. \nThat is less than what we have authorized for other forms of renewable \nenergy in the Energy Policy Act of 2005 or have proposed for biomass, \nwind, solar, or hydrogen fuel development in EPAct and in this bill.\n  You don't hear people talk a lot about geothermal. You hear a great \ndeal right now about wind, you hear a great deal right now about \nbiomass. But we need to recognize the potential, the enormous potential \ngeothermal holds for this country. As you hold it up against all of the \nother renewable sources, geothermal kind of sits out there all alone, \nby itself, along with ocean energy, which you are going to have another \nopportunity to hear me speak on that and the enormous potential we have \nwith ocean energy. Geothermal and ocean received relatively little \nFederal assistance in the EPAct 2 years ago, but I believe geothermal \nis really on the verge of making great things happen in this country.\n  If we encourage geothermal development, I believe it will pay \nenormous dividends to the Nation. If we spend the money now to advance \nthat technology, it will help the entire Nation, not just in the West \nbut all across the country.\n  I urge my colleagues to take a look at the potential for geothermal \nand recognize that what we would do in this legislation is provide for \nthat very necessary assessment to find out where this exists in terms \nof the ability to meet our growing energy needs and our desire to find \nthose reliable, affordable, clean sources of energy. I hope my \ncolleagues will endorse assistance to geothermal when this amendment \nfinally comes to a vote.\n  I yield the floor, and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders).

Mr. President, the Bible admonishes us to ``honor thy \nfather and thy mother.'' Courtesy insists that ladies go first. Last \nmonth, the Nation honored mothers with Mother's Day. The ladies were \ntreated to cards, flowers, phone calls, brunches, gifts, and sometimes \nprecious handmade crafts from the preschool set. Retailers urged more \nextravagant manifestations of our love for our wives and mothers with a \ndazzling array of usually heart-shaped diamond jewelry, all of which is \ncertainly deserved, even if not always affordable.\n  This Sunday, June 17, the fathers get their due. Lumpy clay bowls, \naftershave lotion and cologne, odd pieces of sports paraphernalia and, \nof course, neckties in remarkable fashion colors constitute the classic \nFather's Day gift for the man who has everything. There does not seem \nto be quite the same level of extravagance in the gift suggestions by \nmerchants, however, perhaps because men do not wear as much jewelry, \nand golf clubs do not lend themselves to heart shapes. For that I \nsuppose we can all be grateful. Still, I am sure that most American \nfathers will enjoy being the center of the family's attention on \nSunday. Fathers will enjoy their brunch. Fathers will enjoy a respite \nfrom lawn care and other chores. They might even indulge in an \nafternoon nap, a rare luxury--a rare luxury--for most family men.\n  Fathers deserve their day in the limelight. Good fathers are very \nbusy men, and their contributions to the family merit recognition, just \nas much as their equally busy wives do. Good fathers work hard--they \ndo--they work hard to provide for their families, but they also invest \na lot of time and energy into the home. They often fulfill the \nstereotypical ``dad role''--they keep the house and the yard in good \nrepair, even if it means tackling mechanical or construction activities \nfor which they have little training. They spend countless hours \ncoaching neighborhood sports teams so that their sons and daughters \nlearn the values of teamwork, leadership, and good sportsmanship. They \nhelp with the homework and with assorted school projects, patiently \nhelping to build foaming volcanoes or seaside dioramas. They teach \nchildren to set a fishing rod, paddle a canoe, ride a bicycle, or build \na dog house. They urge their children to try new things to push \nthemselves harder, to struggle, to win graciously, and to lose with \nhonor. Good fathers want great things for their children. Good fathers \nhelp their children to achieve by letting them know that they believe \nin them. That is a lot to accomplish in a few precious hours between \ngetting home from work and getting to bed each night.\n  The great man who raised me, the greatest man I ever knew, was my old \ncoal miner dad. I always called him my dad. My adoptive father was just \nsuch a good man. He walked to work in the coal mines every day, and he \nwalked home at night. Tired he was, covered with coal dust. Tired as he \nalways was, he always greeted me with a smile, a quick smile. And \nsometimes he had a cake, a cupcake in his lunch box, and he always \nsaved the cake for me.\n  He took pride in my school work. Even though I wanted to go into the \nmines like him, he always told me not to do it, but to do well in \nschool instead. He did not want me in the mines, in those dangerous \ndays of long ago. He wanted better for me than he had. And he put his \nenergy into urging me to do better. His influence on me has been a \nresource for my whole life. He is the greatest man I ever knew. I have \nmet with Presidents, kings, and princes. He is the greatest man I ever \nknew.\n  I was blessed with a good father. I hope that everyone's father is as \nspecial to each of you. Fatherhood is a great gift. Fathers gain new \nresponsibilities, but also gain the joys of having children. For \nchildren, to have a great father, whether he is one's biological father \nor one's adoptive father\n\n[[Page S7720]]\n\nor just a father figure who influences one's youth, is a very special \nthing indeed.\n  It is certainly possible for a child to grow into a talented, \naccomplished, and good adult without the influence of a father figure, \nbut good fathers and good mothers give their children an advantage. \nThey give their children the security of knowing always that they are \nloved and that someone is rooting for them, someone is looking out for \nthem. In that security, a child can find the confidence to try and to \nfail, and to try and to fail, and to try and to fail, and to try again, \nand to try and to fail again. It is a great and lasting gift that our \nfathers give to each of us, one that certainly deserves one day of \nrecognition every year.\n  So, Mr. President, I close with a short poem by Holly Dunn called \n``Daddy's Hands'' and a salute to fathers everywhere:\n\n     I remember daddy's hands folded silently in prayer.\n     And reachin' out to hold me, when I had a nightmare.\n     You could read quite a story in the callous' and lines.\n     Years of work and worry had left their mark behind.\n     I remember daddy's hands, how they held my mama tight\n     And patted my back for something done right.\n     There are things that I'd forgotten that I loved about the \n           man\n     But I'll always remember the love in daddy's hands.\n     Daddy's hands were soft and kind when I was cryin'\n     Daddy's hands were hard as steel when I'd done wrong.\n     Daddy's hands weren't always gentle but I've come to \n           understand\n     There was always love in daddy's hands.\n     I remember daddy's hands workin' 'til they bled\n     Sacrificed unselfishly just to keep us all fed.\n     If I could do things over, I'd live my life again\n     And never take for granted the love--\n\n  The sweet love----\n\n     in daddy's hands.\n\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/14/senate-section/article/S7720-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7720-S7721]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                                FLAG DAY\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, June 14 is celebrated in the United States \nas ``Flag Day.'' Flag Day is not a big holiday. Offices will not close \nto observe it; stores will not hold special sales; no fireworks will \nlight the sky; no special presents or dinners will make June 14 stand \nout for most people. I doubt that even the holiday card makers have put \nout much of a selection of cards to send to loved ones, reminding them \nthat we are thinking of them on Flag Day. But it is a special day \nnonetheless. One may notice more flags than usual--small ones \ncantilevered into the breeze next to neighborhood front doors and \nlarger ones snapping smartly before schools and storefronts. In \nWashington, DC, of course, we are blessed with a plethora of flags. \nFlag Day is a good time to take special note of them, flying proudly \nabove the Capitol Building and in front of all the other government \noffices and monuments, like those encircling the Washington Monument. \nThey are a grand sight every day of the year, but especially so on Flag \nDay.\n  Americans honor their flag, the Stars and Stripes, or Old Glory, on \nJune 14 because it was on June 14, 1777--230 years ago--that the \nContinental Congress adopted a resolution to give the United States a \nnational flag to replace the British Union Jack. A special committee \nwas formed assigned to suggest the flag's design in a report. The \nresulting proclamation was brief but inspiring. It said, simply:\n\n       That the flag of the United States shall be of 13 stripes \n     of alternate red and white, with a union of 13 stars of white \n     in a blue field, representing a new constellation.\n\n  The new flag was first carried into battle on September 11, 1777, at \nthe Battle of Brandywine, as General George Washington attempted to \nprevent the British from advancing on Philadelphia.\n  The 13 stars on that first flag represented the 13 original colonies, \nbut that constellation continued to grow as the Nation grew, until we \nbecame the 50 stars that grace Old Glory today. At first, the number of \nstripes grew as well, but that quickly became unwieldy, and the number \nof stripes reverted to 13, to represent the original 13 States in the \nNation. George Washington is reputed to have said that:\n\n       We take the stars from heaven, the red from our mother \n     country, separate it by white in stripes, thus showing that \n     we have separated from her.\n\n  Certainly, the original congressional proclamation did not specify \nthe symbolism of the colors of the flag, or the design, but that has \nonly left the field of symbolism wide open for poets and philosophers, \nfor generals and Presidents as well as everyday citizens. The red has \nbeen seen as the blood that has been shed for our Nation, as well as \nfor the red of the British Union Jack. The white has been seen as \npurity or hope, while the blue has been compared to honor or to the \nheavens that guard over the Nation. Flags are full of symbols, and Old \nGlory means many things to Americans. It sums up our Nation in a single \nicon, and we project our love, pride, determination and even, \nsometimes, our frustration on it.\n  The American flag usually brings out the best in us, or rather, the \nbest in us usually brings out the American flag. There are few sights \nmore moving than the sudden appearance of so many American flags on the \nafternoon of September 11, 2001, and in the days immediately after. The \nfierce determination and unshaken loyalty to our Nation in the face of \na threat was clear in the sight of the flags that appeared on homes, \nstores, mailboxes and cars within hours of that unspeakable event.\n  The Stars and Stripes are seen when we celebrate, such as on the \nFourth of July or at inaugurations. Old Glory also marks more solemn \noccasions. The sight of the American flag draped over the coffin of a \nsoldier home from the war, to be solemnly folded and placed in the lap \nof his grieving family, is a grim reminder of the sometimes great cost \nof serving our Nation. Those flags, sitting still folded in triangular \nflag cases on mantels, under shadowboxes with medals, and the small \nflags so carefully placed in front of the markers at veterans' \ncemeteries around the Nation on the last Monday in May, remind us of \nthe close proximity between Memorial Day at the end of May and Flag Day \nin mid-June. But again soon, on July 4, we will see the Stars and \nStripes back in party mode, flying proudly over our heads as a part of \nour grand national birthday celebration.\n  Mr. President, I like to close my observation of Flag Day with one of \nmy favorite poems, by Henry Holcomb Bennett, entitled ``The Flag Goes \nBy.''\n\n                            The Flag Goes By\n\n     Hats off!\n     Along the street there comes\n     A blare of bugles, a ruffle of drums,\n     A flash of color beneath the sky:\n     Hats off!\n     The flag is passing by!\n\n     Blue and crimson and white it shines,\n     Over the steel-tipped, ordered lines.\n     Hats off!\n     The colors before us fly;\n     But more than the flag is passing by.\n\n     Sea-fights and land-fights, grim and great, Fought to make \n           and save the State; Weary marches and sinking ships; \n           Cheers of victory on dying lips.\n\n     Days of plenty and years of peace;\n     March of a strong land's swift increase; Equal justice, \n           right, and law, Stately honor and reverend awe;\n\n     Signs of nation, great and strong\n     Toward her people from foreign wrong;\n     Pride and glory and honor,--all\n     Live in the colors to stand or fall.\n\n     Hats off!\n     Along the street there comes\n     A blare of bugles, a ruffle of drums;\n     And loyal hearts are beating high;\n     Hats off!\n     The Flag is passing by!\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, today is a day of great significance to me \nand many Americans. In 1949, after decades of unofficial celebrations, \nPresident Truman signed an act of Congress that National Flag Day would \nbe celebrated each year on June 14. Sadly, this national holiday goes \nunnoticed by far too many Americans. I wish to make a few brief \ncomments about our Nation's flag on this day of celebration and \nremembrance.\n  Whenever I get a chance to speak with foreign visitors to the United \nStates, I like to ask about their impression of the United States, \nespecially if it is their first time visiting. Time after time, they \nexpress amazement at the abundant presence of the U.S. flag, not only \nin Washington, DC, but in cities and towns of every size across the \nNation.\n  Truly, flags are flying everywhere, not only at government buildings \nbut at restaurants, parks, malls, gas stations, along highways, not to \nmention\n\n[[Page S7721]]\n\ninside and outside private homes. Flag pins adorn lapels, flag stickers \ngrace our cars, flag designs make for popular home decoration, and on \nIndependence Day, our clothing often takes on the theme of Old Glory.\n  Clearly, we Americans love our flag and love displaying it. It is an \nexpression of patriotism, reverence, and love of country.\n  From 1776 to today, from the marines who fought their way to plant \nthe flag at the top of Iwo Jima to the firefighters who lifted the flag \nabove the ruins of the World Trade Center, it is clear that our flag \nrepresents so much more than a nation. In truth, the American flag \nrepresents thousands of years of struggle to achieve political liberty, \nreligious autonomy, and freedom from want. More important, our flag \nrepresents the inspiration of the life of our Nation and what humanity \nhas the potential to accomplish.\n  Throughout our Nation's history, the American flag has enjoyed the \nprotection of its people and its laws. Unfortunately, this safeguard \nwas eroded in 1989 by the Supreme Court decision in Texas v. Johnson. \nThis decision, which many of my colleagues and I agree was misguided, \nfound within the Constitution a right that had never before existed: \nthe right to physically assault the flag under the first amendment. \nSince then, Members of Congress have been faced with reconciling the \ntension between ``free speech'' and the symbolic importance of the \nAmerican flag. As citizens, we can no longer allow flag burning to be \nconsidered a ``norm'' in our society. Although we can do nothing when \nterrorists or those with anti-American sentiments defile our flag \nabroad, we owe it to our brave service men and women, to ourselves, and \nto our children to do something when it happens on our own soil.\n  Our colleagues in the House have submitted a joint resolution to \namend the Constitution to allow Congress to protect our flag. I do not \ntake amending the Constitution lightly, but I commend the sponsoring \nrepresentatives for taking action on such an important issue.\n  On this Flag Day, I hope we can all remember that our flag is much \nmore than tightly woven cotton mixed with beautiful colors. It is a \ntrue symbol of the struggle of this Nation to remain free and it flies \ntall as a reminder to all of the liberties that we enjoy as proud \ncitizens of this country. The respect that our flag deserves depends on \nus. I will close by quoting Franklin K. Lane, former Secretary of the \nInterior, who said this about the flag:\n\n       I am what you make me; nothing more. I swing before your \n     eyes as a bright gleam of color, a symbol of yourself.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President. I would like to take a few moments to \nobserve Flag Day.\n  Two hundred thirty years ago this week the second Continental \nCongress passed a resolution that created the flag of our Nation. On \nFlag Day we commemorate the anniversary of this resolution and pay \ntribute to this honored symbol of the United States.\n  For every generation of Americans the flag has represented the \nhighest ideals of our Nation, democracy, liberty, and justice. I am \nproud that although the number of stars has changed over the years, \nwhat our flag stands for has not.\n  I hope New Mexicans will take a moment today to honor the flag and \nall it represents.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/14/senate-section/article/S7721-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7721]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING THOMAS F. HOUSTON\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I wish to honor Thomas F. Houston for his 37 \nyears of public service. For the past 9 years, Tom has served as the \nSenior Policy Advisor to the Director of the Naval Criminal \nInvestigative Service. After almost four decades of service, he will \nretire this month after a career in which he served the United States \nin numerous capacities, including almost 20 years as a congressional \nstaff member.\n  He left Mississippi in 1973 to join me on the staff of Congressman \nWilliam Colmer. Tom served as Congressman Colmer's press assistant and \nlater helped with my first campaign to replace our former boss. Tom's \nskill and hard work earned him a stint as deputy press secretary for \nthe Ford-Dole Presidential campaign in 1976, and when that came to a \nclose, Tom joined the staff of the House Committee on Government \nOperations, serving there until June 1989.\n  During his 12-year tenure on the committee, Tom had a major hand in \nwriting a number of historical pieces of legislation, including the \nInspector General Act of 1978 that first established Inspector General \nOffices inside Cabinet-level agencies to independently monitor their \nwork.\n  In 1989, Tom left the Hill to join the George H.W. Bush \nadministration at the Department of Defense. During the Persian Gulf \nbuildup and war, he was the Director of the Desert Shield/Desert Storm \nPublic Affairs Cell. That operation set the precedent for the \nmilitary's public affairs policy during the recent wars in Afghanistan \nand Iraq. The impact of his tenure at the Pentagon is reflected in the \nfact that during just a 4-year period in office, Tom was twice honored \nby Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney with the Secretary of Defense Medal \nfor Outstanding Public Service.\n  In 1992, Tom left the administration and returned to the Hill to \nserve as the communications director for the first Defense Base \nRealignment and Closure Commission. He met with potentially-affected \ncommunities and their congressional delegations to negotiate the best \npath forward for the transformation of the U.S. military. When the \nfirst commission began wrapping up its work, he was named Staff \nDirector to oversee the transition to the next round.\n  In 1995, Tom signed on as chief of staff to Congressman Jim Saxton of \nNew Jersey as the second BRAC round began. Congressman Saxton's \ndistrict stood to be hit hard by the BRAC process, and Tom devoted \nhimself to helping see the Congressman and his constituents through the \nduration of the second round of the process.\n  When it came to a close in 1996, Tom accepted an offer to serve as \nthe chief of staff to Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas, a key \nmember of the Senate Armed Services Committee at the time and later a \nmember of the powerful Senate Appropriations Committee.\n  Tom's seemingly endless devotion to his country was only surpassed by \nhis commitment to his family. Tom decided in 1998 to step away from the \nHill in order to spend more time with his children. In a move he later \ncalled ``the best decision I've ever made,'' Tom took a job at the \nNaval Criminal Investigative Service, NCIS. He was recruited by NCIS \nDirector David Brant, who charged him with overhauling the way the \nagency conducted its public affairs. Tom proceeded to do just that, \nworking as head of communications for NCIS and Senior Policy Adviser to \nthe Director to help bring about this revitalization that resulted in \nNCIS receiving the international recognition it enjoys today.\n  Tom worked tirelessly to make lasting improvements in the way NCIS \napproached public affairs during his tenure. Recruiting a top-notch \nmedia and congressional affairs team, he undertook an unprecedented \npublic outreach campaign to make NCIS and its mission more widely known \nand better understood.\n  I am confident that his enormous efforts will continue to bear fruit \nfor years to come. Perhaps the most well-known outcome of his efforts, \nthough, has been in garnering NCIS international attention through the \nhit TV show ``NCIS,'' which Tom was instrumental in bringing about. The \nshow has earned NCIS and its employees the kind of public acclaim few \nin Federal Government enjoy, and through constant collaboration with \nthe show's producers, Tom has worked to ensure the show continues to be \na credit to the hard-working men and women that make up the agency.\n  I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate, honor, and \nthank Tom and his wife Ginger for their friendship and contributions to \nour country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/14/senate-section/article/S7721-2", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7721-S7723]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     BUDGET RESOLUTION ADJUSTMENTS\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, section 207(f) of S. Con. Res. 21, the \n2008 Budget resolution, directs the chairman of the Senate Budget \nCommittee to make appropriate adjustments in allocations, aggregates, \ndiscretionary spending limits, and other levels of new budget authority \nand outlays to reflect the difference between the budgetary impact\n\n[[Page S7722]]\n\nof enacted legislation making supplemental appropriations for fiscal \nyear 2007 and the corresponding levels assumed in S. Con. Res. 21. On \nMay 25, the U.S. Troop Readiness, Veterans' Care, Katrina Recovery, and \nIraq Accountability Appropriations Act, 2007, became Public Law 110-28.\n  As enacted, the U.S. Troop Readiness, Veterans' Care, Katrina \nRecovery, and Iraq Accountability Appropriations Act, 2007, contains \nchanges in new budget authority, outlays, revenues, and other levels \nthat differ from those assumed in the 2008 budget resolution. In total, \nPublic Law 110-28 contains approximately $4.2 billion less in budget \nauthority both in fiscal year 2007 and over fiscal years 2007 through \n2012. It also contains $810 million less in outlays in fiscal year 2007 \nand approximately $4 billion less in outlays over fiscal years 2007 \nthrough 2012. In addition, it contains $54 million less in on-budget \nrevenues over fiscal years 2007 through 2012 than was assumed in the \n2008 budget resolution.\n  Most of the new budget authority and outlays contained in Public Law \n110-28 was designated as an emergency pursuant to section 204 of the \n2008 budget resolution. Those amounts are not counted for purposes of \nbudget enforcement. As a result, the adjustments made for budget \nenforcement purposes differ from the total amount of the difference \nbetween Public Law 110-28 and the corresponding levels assumed in S. \nCon. Res. 21.\n  For purposes of the allocation provided to the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee pursuant to section 302 of the Congressional Budget Act and \nthe discretionary spending limits provided pursuant to section 207(b) \nof the 2008 Budget Resolution, new budget authority is decreased by \n$188 million in fiscal year 2007 and new budget authority and outlays \nare increased by $1 million each in fiscal year 2008. Similar \nadjustments will be made for purposes of enforcing the 311 aggregates \nin the Senate for new budget authority and outlays in 2007 and 2008. \nThe 311 aggregates additionally will be adjusted for differences in \ndebt service resulting from Public Law 110-28 versus what was assumed \nin the 2008 budget resolution.\n  For purposes of enforcing the 311 aggregates in the Senate, total on-\nbudget revenues are adjusted downward by $17 million in fiscal year \n2008 and by a total of $54 million over fiscal years 2008 through 2012, \nwhile off-budget Social Security revenues are adjusted upward by $17 \nmillion in fiscal year 2008 and by a total of $54 million over fiscal \nyears 2008 through 2012.\n  Finally, I am making a clarifying and technical adjustment to the \nSenate Committee allocations provided pursuant to section 302 of the \nCongressional Budget Act and printed on pages 126 through 128 of House \nReport 110-153, the report accompanying S. Con. Res 21.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a set of tables \nwhich show the revised allocations, aggregates, and other levels for \nuse in enforcing the 2008 budget resolution.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\nConcurrent Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal Year 2008--S.

Mr. President, on June 5, I had the privilege of attending \na gala where my friends Lee Hamilton and John Warner received the \nGeorge C. Marshall Foundation Award honoring statesmen of courage and \nintegrity.\n  At the event our former colleague, Senator Nancy Kassebaum Baker, \nintroduced Senator Warner. I appreciate this opportunity to share with \nmy fellow Senators her speech honoring the distinguished career of our \ncolleague and friend. I ask unanimous consent that the speech of Nancy \nKassebaum Baker be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record.\n\n       I first met John Warner when the new Senators elected in \n     1978, including me, gathered in Washington. The teacher \n     instructing us was Howard Baker.\n       John Warner already had behind him a distinguished career \n     in service to his country--World War II, Korea, Under \n     Secretary of the Navy and then Secretary of the Navy during \n     the Vietnam War.\n       As a recipient this evening of the George C. Marshall \n     Foundation Award, along with Congressman Lee Hamilton, I am \n     certain that Senator Warner would agree with the emphasis \n     that the George C. Marshall Foundation has placed on the \n     importance of the ROTC and JROTC programs.\n       The idea of educating and training Army officers goes back \n     to the 1700s. The first civilian institution of higher \n     learning to incorporate military education into its \n     curriculum was founded in 1819 in Vermont. There have been \n     peaks and valleys in support of such a program ever since. It \n     would be my hope that there could be ever stronger support to \n     the JROTC and ROTC programs in training future leaders in \n     responsibility, dedication and integrity in service to our \n     country. I hope, John, you don think I am lobbying you as a \n     member of the Armed Services Committee.\n       You may not remember, but I well do, my first debate in the \n     Senate, June 1980. I had offered an amendment and you led the \n     opposition. You kept saying ``my distinguished colleague of \n     Kansas,'' and I kept saying this just makes common sense. The \n     question was whether 18-19-year-old women should also be \n     included in the reinstitution of the male-only registration \n     program. It seems a rather quaint debate in the scheme of \n     things today.\n       Time marched on--28 years--Senator Warner is now the second \n     longest serving Senator from the Commonwealth of Virginia. I \n     believe there has never been a Chairman of the Armed Services \n     Committee who has been better prepared for an understanding \n     of the Armed Services.\n       But beyond just material security interests you have \n     provided thoughtful consideration of all issues facing our \n     country and our Armed Services.\n\n[[Page S7724]]\n\n       You are truly a Senator Statesman.\n       On behalf of the Marshall Foundation, I am pleased to \n     present the 2007 George C. Marshall Foundation Award to \n     Senator John Warner.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/14/senate-section/article/S7724-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7724]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         HONORING LEE HAMILTON\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, on June 5, I had the privilege of \nintroducing my longtime friend and fellow Hoosier, Representative Lee \nHamilton, at a gala where he received the George C. Marshall Foundation \nAward honoring statesmen of courage and integrity.\n  I appreciate this opportunity to share with my fellow Senators my \nspeech honoring the distinguished career of this outstanding public \nservant. I ask unanimous consent that my speech be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record.\n\n       Thank you for inviting me to attend this remarkable event, \n     which honors two close friends and colleagues, Lee Hamilton \n     and John Warner.\n       I have the special honor this evening to pay tribute to Lee \n     Hamilton, with whom I served in the Indiana congressional \n     delegation for more than two decades. Though born in Florida, \n     Lee moved with his family to Indiana where he distinguished \n     himself as a scholar and an athlete at Evansville Central \n     High School and DePauw University. At DePauw, Lee graduated \n     with honors, led the basketball team in scoring and \n     rebounding, and received the Walker Cup, given to the senior \n     judged to have contributed the most to the University during \n     a 4-year career. Lee went on to earn a law degree from \n     Indiana University. He practiced law before Indiana's Ninth \n     Congressional District elected him to the House of \n     Representatives in 1964.\n       Though our home state was not typically associated with \n     international affairs, both Lee and I sought a seat on the \n     foreign policy committees of our respective chambers, and \n     both of us eventually became chairman. Over the years, we \n     have shared a passionate interest in international affairs, \n     and we have had the opportunity to work together on \n     legislation and projects that we hope will stand the test of \n     time.\n       The award that Lee Hamilton receives this evening honors \n     the spirit of General George C. Marshall and the Marshall \n     Plan. It is fitting that the George Marshall Foundation would \n     honor the statesmanship and vision of my friend. As an \n     exchange student in 1951 at Goethe University, Lee had the \n     opportunity to study in Europe when the wounds of World War \n     II were still fresh. I have heard him speak of his amazement \n     that even 6 years after the end of the war, he could witness \n     omnipresent bomb damage and encounter rationing that allowed \n     students just one egg per week.\n       Lee saw firsthand the hope and goodwill that was fostered \n     by the Marshall Plan, and he saw its tangible effects as our \n     assistance began to take hold in many European nations. This \n     success made a lasting impression on Lee that would influence \n     his work in the U.S. House of Representatives.\n       During Lee Hamilton 34-year congressional career, he \n     promoted the importance of the U.S.-European relationship as \n     one of the pillars of American foreign policy. He was the \n     Founding Chairman of the Congressional Study Group on \n     Germany, which has facilitated a close working relationship \n     between the U.S. Congress and the German Bundestag. For more \n     than two decades, Members of the U.S. Congress and Members of \n     the German Bundestag have traveled to each others nations to \n     heighten appreciation for trans-Atlantic cooperation and \n     communication. The deep cultural affinity the United States \n     shares with Europe is rooted in our immigrant past and a \n     century of common struggle for the values of democracy, human \n     rights, and political freedom. Lee has always nurtured this \n     relationship and recognized that whatever disagreements might \n     exist, the fundamental interests of both sides of the \n     Atlantic are best served by a resolute European-American \n     partnership.\n       Having seen the transformational effects of U.S. foreign \n     assistance first-hand, Lee Hamilton has been a stalwart \n     advocate of diplomatic and economic engagement. Lee has \n     always understood that effective diplomacy depends on \n     personal relationships and developing respect for foreign \n     perspectives and cultures. These are principles epitomized by \n     General Marshall, and they are more vital today than ever. \n     They are principles that are at the core of the \n     recommendations of the September 11 Commission and the Iraq \n     Study Group--both of which Lee Hamilton co-chaired with skill \n     and dignity.\n       In the United States, Lee Hamilton is committed to making \n     sure that the American citizenry knows how Congress works and \n     why engagement with the world is important. His latest \n     project, through the Center on Congress at Indiana \n     University, will create a ``virtual Congress'' in which \n     students from across the county can assume the role of a \n     Member of Congress attending committee meetings, holding town \n     hall conversations, and offering their own ideas to our \n     current challenges. In this endeavor, Lee is elevating the \n     process of learning about Congress and national issues to a \n     new level. It will result in a better informed citizenry, \n     and, in the end, better government--which is what Lee \n     Hamilton's service to our Nation has always been about.\n       George Marshall once said that, ``Military power wins \n     battles, but spiritual power wins wars.'' Lee Hamilton's \n     service has epitomized this concept.

Mr. President, I rise today to wish the U.S. Army a happy \nbirthday. It was 232 years ago today, June 14, 1775, that the \nContinental Army of the United States was formed.\n  Over the past 232 years, millions of men and women have served in the \noldest branch of our Armed Forces. Their honor, courage, sacrifice, and \nservice are the foundation of America's greatness. The Army principles \nof ``Duty, Honor, Country'' represent the core values of America. Every \ngeneration of Americans who have served in the U.S. Army--from the \nContinental Army to our fighting men and women serving today in Iraq, \nAfghanistan, and elsewhere--has been shaped by these principles. They \ninspire us and will continue to serve as role models for future \ngenerations.\n  The Army has steadfastly protected our way of life and has never \nturned from a challenge. As the Army Song so eloquently says:\n\n     First to fight for the right,\n     And to build the Nation's might,\n     And The Army Goes Rolling Along,\n     Proud of all we have done,\n     Fighting till the battle's won,\n     And the Army Goes Rolling Along.\n\n  Today's soldiers are the newest generation in a long line of \ndedicated professionals who have put service to the Nation over self. \nThese soldiers, just as those who have gone before them, will continue \nto protect our democracy and make the world more secure, peaceful, and \nprosperous.\n  On this 232nd birthday of the U.S. Army, we recognize and thank all \nthose who have served or are serving our country with pride and honor \nin the uniform of the U.S. Army, especially those serving today in Iraq \nand Afghanistan.\n  ``Happy Birthday'' to the U.S. Army.\n  HOOAH!!!!\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, today, the U.S. Army celebrates its \n232nd birthday. Since a time before the signing of the Declaration of \nIndependence, the body that soon became the U.S. Army has proudly \nserved the people of this land. This is a birthday that should be \nrecognized by all Americans. Created by the Second Continental Congress \nin Philadelphia on June 14, 1775, our Founding Fathers possessed great \nvision when making the decision to establish the Army. They realized \nthe importance of having a well-trained, reliable, always-ready Army to \ndefend freedom and the rights of the people. The U.S. Army and its \nsoldiers have admirably served in more than ten wars from the American \nRevolution to the present war on terrorism.\n  All branches of our military know the deepest depths of sacrifice; \nand as our oldest military branch, the U.S. Army and its 232nd birthday \nsymbolize\n\n[[Page S7725]]\n\ncenturies of struggle and sacrifice on behalf of us all. Members of our \narmed services valiantly serve and strive to keep us safe, protect our \nway of life, and defend freedom whenever and wherever it is in harm's \nway. This June 14th--the day we also celebrate Flag Day--reminds us of \nthe meaning of patriotism and the importance of service to country.\n  As there are Army birthday celebrations going on across the country--\nand the world--today, we should once again pause to remember the \ndedication of our brave men and women in uniform and their commitment \nto ``Duty, Honor, Country.''\n  To every member of our military--whether a veteran, active duty, or \nreserve--and your families, we say, thank you. You have helped, and \ncontinue to help keep our country free, safe, and secure. We honor your \ndedication and continual sacrifices.\n  And to the Army on this day, I say, Happy Birthday. Thank you for \nhelping to keep America safe and free for us and the next generation. \nAs the Army's slogan states: ``Army Strong.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/14/senate-section/article/S7725-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7725]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           TRIBUTE TO KAZAKHSTAN AMBASSADOR KANAT SAUDABAYEV\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I wish to send my best wishes to the new \nKazakhstan Secretary of State, Kanat Saudabayev. Before assuming his \nnew position, Secretary Saudabayev served as the Kazakh Ambassador to \nthe United States for almost 7 years. During this time, I have had the \nprivilege of working closely with Secretary Saudabayev in strengthening \nthe relationships between Kazakhstan, the United States, and \nparticularly Louisiana.\n  On May 15, 2007, Ambassador Saudabayev was appointed to the position \nof Secretary of State for Kazakhstan. This elevation follows a two-\ndecade career as a diplomat. His postings include such important \nnations as the United Kingdom and Turkey during the 1990s. In December \n2000, Secretary Saudabayev was selected as the Ambassador to the United \nStates.\n  Secretary Saudabayev has proven what a skilled diplomat can do in \nWashington. Representing a young nation with immense potential, he has \nbuilt Kazakhstan's reputation as a reliable ally in the war on \nterrorism and a pro-American voice in Central Asia.\n  While Ambassador, Secretary Saudabayev helped arrange two White House \nmeetings between President Bush and Kazakh President Nursultan \nNazarbayev, promoted massive U.S. investment in his country, and even \nturned a satirical movie about Kazakhstan into a promotional vehicle to \nattract tourists.\n  Additionally, I must express my personal thanks for Secretary \nSaudabayev and Kazakhstan's contributions to my home State of \nLouisiana. In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, Secretary Saudabayev \npresented $50,000 in donations to St. Bernard Unified School and \neducation in New Orleans and made a significant donation to the Bush-\nClinton Katrina Fund on behalf of Kazakhstan.\n  Kazakhstan and Louisiana have a unique and unprecedented \nrelationship. Through Secretary Saudabayev's dedication and hard work, \nKazakhstan and Louisiana have executed a direct trade agreement, a \nconduit of business and ideas between my home State and Kazakhstan. In \naddition to this, Secretary Saudabayev has been working with \nCongressman Melancon and me to expand Louisiana's business presence in \nKazakhstan. For example, we have been working toward opening \nKazakhstan's energy markets to Louisiana companies.\n  Although Kazakhstan is a young nation, it has shown tremendous \nprogress and occupies an enviable place in the international community. \nSecretary Saudabayev has made significant contributions to the \nestablishment of strong and friendly relations between Kazakhstan and \nthe United States, and I am confident that through his new role as the \nSecretary of State, he will continue to do so. Therefore, I would like \nto congratulate Secretary Saudabayev and look forward to working with \nhim in his new capacity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/14/senate-section/article/S7725-2", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7725]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        HONORING CAXTON PRINTERS\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I wish to honor one of Idaho's oldest \nbusinesses--Caxton Printers of Caldwell, ID. This year they are \ncelebrating their 100th anniversary; they are older than many Caldwell \nmainstays including the J.R. Simplot Company and the Caldwell Night \nRodeo.\n  For 100 years, Caxton Printers has served the people of Idaho. Their \nideals are reflected in the statement of one of the founders, J.H. \nGipson: ``Books to us never can or will be primarily articles of \nmerchandise to be produced as cheaply as possible and to be sold like \nslabs of bacon or packages of cereal over the counter. If there is \nanything that is really worthwhile in this mad jumble we call the \nTwentieth Century, it should be books.''\n  Well, times have certainly changed since then. One can only imagine \nwhat Mr. Gipson would say about the 21st century. Caxton Printers, \nthough, continues to survive by focusing on quality--both in their \nservice and in their product. My staff and I know this firsthand.\n  What they do for us, though, is just a sliver of their storied \nhistory.\n  During their first 100 years, the family-run business has been a \nshining example of a couple bootstrappers making it in the rural West. \nIn fact, at one point, they were the exclusive printing and binding \ncompany west of Kansas City, and in the 1920s they decided to help \nwestern writers receive the attention they deserved. By 1928, they had \nproduced five titles. Output steadily grew, and by 1936 they had \nreleased well over 100 new books. While they lost money on virtually \nevery book published before World War II, Mr. Gipson ``felt repaid in \nproducing at least a book or two which have a fair chance of gaining a \nplace in the permanent literature of our country.'' Well, Caxton's most \nfamous author, Ayn Rand, certainly achieved that acclaim.\n  Caxton Printers has helped to preserve and tell the history of the \nWest. In addition to focusing their publishing on nonfiction books \nabout the West, they have served as the Idaho State Textbook Depository \nsince 1927. Just about every student in Idaho has been impacted by \nCaxton Printers. I can tell you that this Senator certainly appreciates \nall they do to preserve and tell the stories of the people, places, and \nevents that shaped the West.\n  Over the past 100 years, Caxton Printers and the Gipson family have \nexperienced a lot and, through it all, have prospered while remaining \ntrue to J.H. Gipson's philosophy of producing high-quality books and \nproducts. They make Idaho, and the West, proud.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/14/senate-section/article/S7725-3", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7725-S7726]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        DYSTONIA AWARENESS WEEK\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity \nto call to the attention of my colleagues that the week of June 3 to 10 \nwas Dystonia Awareness Week. The Dystonia Advocacy Coalition, through \nthe commemoration of this week and a number of other outreach \nactivities, sought to raise awareness of dystonia, a neurological \ndisorder.\n  Dystonia is a movement disorder that causes the muscles to contract \nand spasm involuntarily. There is presently no cure, and although \nremarkable progress has been made in unraveling the causes and \nmechanisms of dystonia, the availability of effective treatments is \nlimited. Approximately 50 percent of patients with dystonia have a \ngenetically inherited form while the other half suffers from dystonia \nas a result of birth injury, physical trauma, exposure to certain \nmedications, surgery, or stroke. Estimates suggest dystonia affects at \nleast 300,000 people in North America.\n  Given the prevalence and limited treatment options for this disorder, \nI call on my colleagues to increase support for the National Institutes \nof Health, which funds dystonia research through the National Institute \nof Neurologic Disorders and Stroke, NINDS, the National Institute on \nDeafness and Other Communication Disorders, NIDCD, and the National Eye \nInstitute, NEI.\n  I have consistently supported increases in NIH funding in the past \nand recently signed onto a letter asking for a 6.7 percent increase in \nNIH funding for the fiscal year 2008 appropriations bill. The lack of \ntreatment options and a cure for serious conditions like dystonia \nunderscores the overall need to support basic science and translational \nresearch that allows for\n\n[[Page S7726]]\n\nthe transfer of discoveries from the laboratory bench to actual medical \ntreatments. I am continuing to develop legislation to enhance our \nFederal translational research efforts. I believe we can and must bring \nnew treatments for diseases such as dystonia to the public faster than \never.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/14/senate-section/article/S7726-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7726]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   CONGRATULATIONS FOR REBEKAH FRESE\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today I would like to recognize the \naccomplishment of a particularly talented student from my home State of \nIowa. Rebekah Frese has been chosen to present her National History Day \ndocumentary, ``Boarding the Freedom Train: The Underground Railroad in \nIowa,'' at the Smithsonian American Art Museum. I congratulate her on \nthis achievement and commend her for her hard work and determination in \ncreating such a wonderful project.\n  Rebekah's documentary highlights the significant role Iowa and Iowans \nplayed in the effort to ensure the safety of escaped slaves prior to \nthe American Civil War. She is a student at the Lenihan Intermediate \nSchool in Melbourne, IA and was selected as one of 22 presenters out of \n2000 finalists that attended the National History Day national contest \nat the University of Maryland June 10 to 14.\n  In Iowa, we take great pride in our educational system, and it is \npersonally rewarding when one of our students sets themselves apart at \nthe national level. Programs such as National History Day give students \nopportunities to succeed through hard work and determination, \nencouraging what is at the heart of the American spirit. I appreciate \nNational History Day and its commitment to improving the teaching and \nlearning of American history in our schools.\n  I would also like to take this opportunity to make special mention of \nteachers Millie Frese and Karen Roessler, who offered their assistance \nand encouragement to Rebekah while undertaking this difficult project. \nQuality teachers like these motivate and inspire students to push \nthemselves to realize their potential. By helping to shape citizens and \nfuture leaders, teachers like Millie Frese and Karen Roessler are \nindispensable parts of our democracy. Once again, congratulations, \nRebekah, for your first-class work bringing greater awareness to Iowa's \nrole in the Underground Railroad.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/14/senate-section/article/S7726-2", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7726]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                HONORING LINDA DAVIS AND BRIGID O'CONNOR\n\n Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I wish to honor Linda Davis and \nBrigid O'Connor. I want to recognize their public service, their \ncourage, and their dedication. As public health nurses in Lake County, \nMT, they worked tirelessly since last year to manage the care of a \nperson diagnosed with tuberculosis. They did this while continuing to \nensure the safety of other Lake County residents.\n  Let me share with you a little more about Linda and Brigid.\n  Linda Davis has been the director of nursing services for the Lake \nCounty Health Department since 1991. Her vision and leadership have \ntransformed Lake County's nursing services. Under her guidance, the \noffice staff has grown from 3 to 15. And services have become more \ncomprehensive.\n  For Linda, public health is about creating programs that address all \nthe community's needs. Linda's resourcefulness and ingenuity have made \nher a success. She continues to overcome barriers and move forward. \nThis current example of patient care shows that.\n  Linda is a dedicated public servant. She has worked in public health \nfor 29 years, all in Lake County. And Linda is a fine example of \nMontana's education system. She is a graduate of the Montana State \nUniversity-Bozeman School of Nursing.\n  Brigid O'Connor is the communicable and infectious disease nurse for \nLake County. She has worked in public health for the last 10 years, all \nin Lake County. Before that, she worked in home health. Although Brigid \nis not originally from Montana, she has spent her entire nursing career \nin our great State. Brigid also received her degree from the Montana \nState University-Bozeman School of Nursing. Before moving to Montana, \nshe spent some time in India working with leprosy patients. This \nexperience moved her to pursue nursing. Brigid is a compassionate, \ndriven, and dedicated professional.\n  The residents of Lake County are fortunate to be served by such \noutstanding nurses as Linda and Brigid.\n  The Lake County Health Department's handling of this case is \nexemplary. It worked because Linda and Brigid focused on patient \neducation and community awareness. They balanced respect for a \npatient's rights with taking appropriate steps to protect public \nhealth.\n  Lake County is a low-incidence area. That means that these cases are \nuncommon. Typically, one patient a year is diagnosed with tuberculosis \nin Lake County. And that makes Linda's and Brigid's ability to react \neffectively even more impressive.\n  And people are recognizing Linda's and Brigid's handling of this \ncase. The Montana Tuberculosis Officer is presenting the case at the \nCenters for Disease Control's annual meeting on tuberculosis.\n  This case exemplifies the creativity of individuals across Montana. \nIt highlights their resourcefulness. The Lake County Health Department \nhas been able to use emergency preparedness funds to help create an \ninfectious disease response program. These funds have also allowed them \nto step up their after-hours capabilities.\n  Linda and Brigid worked with the Montana Department of Public Health \nand Human Services in caring for this individual and the community. \nResponding to a challenge like tuberculosis requires cooperation, \ningenuity, and hard work.\n  I am very proud, not only of Linda and Brigid's work, but of all of \nMontana's State and local health officials.\n  We are lucky in Montana. Even though we are a big State with a small \npopulation, we are well prepared to respond to such public health \nchallenges because of our dedicated and capable public health \nprofessionals.\n  Working together, the Montana health care community has found ways to \nbeat challenges like these, despite apparent obstacles.\n  We depend on our public health professionals to constantly come up \nwith creative ways to respond to such challenges while continuing to \nprovide high quality care for the sick.\n  Linda and Brigid are two such professionals. It is my honor to \nrecognize them here today in the Senate. And it is an honor to be able \nto work with them to create a safe and healthy Montana.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/14/senate-section/article/S7726-3", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7726-S7727]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          NATIONAL HISTORY DAY\n\n Mr. BINGAMAN Mr. President, today I recognize three New Mexico \nstudents who participated in the National History Day contest that took \nplace earlier this week at the University of Maryland.

I am very proud that three New Mexico students \nwere chosen to present their National History Day projects at the \nNational Portrait Gallery here in Washington yesterday.\n  Ryan Andrews-Armijo and Ashley Page, from Moriarty Middle School, \nused this year's National History Day theme: ``Triumph and Tragedy in \nHistory'' to produce a documentary entitled ``Breaking the Unwritten \nRules.'' Ryan and Ashley put in many hours of hard work, researching \nthe 1966 Texas Western Miners basketball team. I commend them for their \nexcellent work.\n  Shannon Burns, from Los Alamos Middle School, filmed a documentary \nentitled:' ``Learo Dochias (Ray of Hope) The Irish Triumph over Tragedy \nin America.'' Shannon did a superb job in putting together a beautiful \ndocumentary about the history of Irish immigration in America.\n  Along with these three exceptional New Mexico students, I would also \nlike to recognize their outstanding teachers: Ms. Bethany Vaughn from \nMoriarty and Ms. Gayle Beckett from Los Alamos. These teachers have \ndemonstrated great skill and commitment\n\n[[Page S7727]]\n\nin helping their students understand and appreciate history.\n  I commend Ryan, Ashley, and Shannon for their hard work and \ncommitment to sharing our national history. They are models of student \nexcellence not only for their peers in New Mexico, but for students \nnationwide.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/14/senate-section/article/S7727-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7727]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               TRIBUTE TO LIEUTENANT COLONEL DAREL LEETUN\n\n Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, on Saturday July 7, Hettinger, ND, \npopulation 1,574, a town near where I grew up, will celebrate its \ncentenary. In honor of that historic date, the entire community is \nhosting a week of parades, speeches, dances, picnics, concerts and all \nkinds of entertainment.\n  Along with all the other centenary events, Hettinger has set aside \ntime with a choir and a band to honor America's veterans. During the \nprogram the community will recognize the service of LTC Darel Leetun, a \nlocal son who earned the Air Force Cross and lost his life in Vietnam.\n  Darel Leetun's service is typical of the dedication and sacrifice \nthat American veterans have exhibited throughout our history. But his \nindividual story is remarkable. And I would like to spend a few minutes \nto tell you some of it.\n  Darel Leetun was born in Hettinger on December 24, 1932. He was \nraised in North Dakota and graduated from Steele High School and North \nDakota State University. He served as a county agent, spent a year in \nIndia and then joined the Air Force and became a fighter pilot. He was \nsent to Vietnam.\n  On September 17, 1966, then-Captain Leetun took off on his 96th \nmission, leading a flight of F-105 Thunderchiefs against a high \npriority target near Hanoi. It was heavily defended and Captain Leetun \nhad to lead his flight through intense and accurate flak, surface-to-\nair missiles, and MiG fighters.\n  On the bomb run, Leetun's Thunderchief was hit by ground fire. \nAccording to witnesses, his F-105 become a flaming torch and nearly \nuncontrollable. But Leetun remained in formation and delivered his \nhigh-explosive ordnance directly on target.\n  After releasing his bombs, Captain Leetun's plane went out of control \nand was seen to crash approximately 10 miles from the target area.\n  Other pilots in the flight saw the jet crash, but did not receive \nemergency beeper signals or see a parachute.\n  For a long time, his family did not know what had happened to him. \nThey didn't know if he was killed in the crash or if he was a prisoner \nof war.\n  The Air Force declared Darel Leetun missing in action and promoted \nhim twice. But finally, in 1975, the U.S. Government declared \nLieutenant Colonel Leetun dead.\n  In 1995, remains that were believed to be Leetun's were found on a \nhillside by a joint U.S.-Vietnamese search team. It wasn't until 2005 \nthat they were positively identified by American forensic experts in \nHawaii.\n  Darel Leetun was buried with full military honors on July 8, 2005, at \nArlington National Cemetery. I attended his funeral.\n  Darel's grandchildren Joni, Jack, and Jane sang ``America the \nBeautiful'' at the memorial ceremony in the Arlington chapel. Then \neight Army horses drew his caisson down a twisting road to the grave \nsite, where MG Charles Baldwin presented Darel's son Keith with the \nAmerican flag that covered the casket.\n  The service ended with a 21-gun salute, followed by the playing of \n``Taps.''\n  Darrel Leetun was awarded 14 medals for his military service, \nincluding the Distinguished Flying Cross, the Bronze Star, the Air \nMedal and the Purple Heart. He is the only North Dakotan from the \nVietnam war who received the Air Force Cross for extraordinary heroism, \nwhich is the second highest medal for valor in combat.\n  Keith Leetun was only six when his father was shot down. He barely \nknew his father and he didn't know much about how he died.\n  But one day in 1992, Keith met his father's wingman on the golf \ncourse, completely by accident. They happened to be the only golfers on \nthe first tee at 7 a.m. No one was around except the greens keeper. \nThey started chatting and learned of their mutual connection to Darel \nLeetun.\n  When he found out that Keith was Darel's son, the wingman said, \n``Your father was my mentor, best friend and the `heart and soul' of \nthe squadron. He was the life of the party and we called him `Gravel'. \nHe was a substitute pilot the day he got shot down. He went the extra \nmile and hit his target as his jet was on fire!''\n  Since then, Keith Leetun has been driven to share his father's story \nwith other Vietnam veterans and to get them to share their own stories.\n  After the main veterans program in Hettinger, Keith and the rest of \nDarel Leetun's family will host a smaller program about Darel's life \nand military service called ``My Way Back.'' They are doing that not \njust to commemorate Darel, but to honor all Vietnam veterans and to \nencourage them to share their stories and experiences with each other \nand with the public.\n  Most Vietnam veterans were drafted into service. But they served \nhonorably. Nearly 60,000 of them didn't come home.\n  By the time the Vietnam conflict ended in the 1970s, the war had \nsplit the Nation. In the ugliness of it, the returning veterans were \noften derided for their part in it.\n  Many of them were treated horribly. Much of the general public \nspurned them, and their government ignored them.\n  Fortunately, times have changed.\n  In 1982 the Vietnam Memorial Wall was dedicated with the names of the \nfallen etched into black granite. That has gone a long way toward \nhealing the wounds of Vietnam.\n  And with today's wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, our country is \nbeginning to pay more attention to the needs of all veterans. It is \nironic that the Vietnam veterans who were cheated of their welcome home \nparades have been loud advocates of seeing that today's veterans get \ntheirs.\n  LTC Darel Leetun is an example of the courage and sacrifice of all \nthose who have followed orders and gone into harm's way in defense of \nour country.

Sadly today \nairs his final episode hosting America's beloved ``The Price is Right'' \non CBS, but today is appropriate to remember the impact this wonderful \nman had on all of us, as he became a piece of our history and a small \npart of our lives each day.\n  Bob Barker's name is synonymous with CBS's ``The Price is Right,'' \nwhich he began hosting on September 4, 1972. It ends today as the \nlongest running daytime game show in television history. He holds a \nplethora of longevity records, including a record for holding a weekday \nTV job continuously for 50 years as of 2006, the oldest person to \nreceive an MTV movie award for his role in the comedy ``Billy \nMadison,'' and he has hosted or appeared on a 5-day-a-week television \nprogram longer than anyone else in the history of television. Also on \nDecember 31, 2006, Bob Barker celebrated the anniversary of his 50th \nyear on national television. He is truly a fixture in American culture \nand television legend. His grace and humor have truly contributed to \nhis success, and will be missed greatly by his millions of loyal fans \nranging from the young to the young at heart.\n  Bob Barker is also a strong advocate for animal rights, and brings \nthat passion into his role as host of ``The Price is Right.'' He \ncredits his love of animals and awareness to animal rights activism to \nhis late wife Dorothy Jo. He continued the work in her memory. Bob \ninsisted the show stop giving away fur coats as prizes, and formed the \nDJ Foundation that contributes millions of dollars to fund animal \nrescue and park facilities across the country. His passion for the \ncause has even brought him here to Washington, DC, where he spoke on \nCapitol Hill on the issue of animal rights.\n  Barker has been recognized for his success and talent by receiving 17 \nEmmy Awards and the Lifetime Achievement Award for Daytime Television \nin 1999. Barker has also had the\n\n[[Page S7728]]\n\nhonor of being inducted into the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences \nHall of Fame. In March of 1998, to commemorate the five thousandth \nepisode of ``The Price is Right,'' CBS dedicated the show's soundstage \nin his honor.\n  America will certainly miss being greeted by the smiling and vibrant \nface of Bob Barker each morning, however, his success in both his \ncareer and in life are indisputable. There is no doubt Bob Barker has \npositively impacted the lives of many, and on this day as we celebrate \nwith Bob the airing of his final episode hosting ``The Price is \nRight,'' we should also extend our thanks to Bob for the many \ndelightful years and countless memories he has granted us.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/14/senate-section/article/S7728-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7728]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO CONGREGATION BETH EL\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, it is with great pride that I pay \ntribute to Congregation Beth El on its 120th anniversary. The \ncongregation will celebrate this milestone with a weekend of events \ntitled ``May Ohr L'Ohr: From Light to Light'' on June 22 through June \n24, 2007. This celebration will highlight the congregation's rich \nhistory and recognize its special place in the Grand Traverse \ncommunity.\n  Congregation Beth El was formed in the late 1800s by Jewish \nimmigrants arriving from Poland and Russia. In 1885, the cornerstone \nwas laid for the Beth El synagogue, a simple two-story gable-and-\nclapboard structure. Today, the building is the oldest synagogue in \ncontinuous use in Michigan and is featured on the State Register of \nHistoric Sites. The synagogue, originally built to hold an Orthodox \ncongregation, has evolved over the years to serve all members of the \nJewish community, as well as to welcome those of other faiths.\n  The vitality of Congregation Beth El can be attributed to the hard \nwork, dedication, and vision of the congregation. The congregation, led \nin large measure by the executive committee, has sought to make the \nsynagogue the center of the Jewish community's religious and social \nlife. One such example is the summer rabbi program. The program enables \nyoung rabbis to travel to Traverse City to share their enthusiasm for \nand commitment to Judaism with members of the congregation and \ncommunity. This program has been greatly successful and eventually led \nto a year-round rabbi presence for Congregation Beth El.\n  On the celebration of the 120th anniversary of Congregation Beth El, \nI would like to extend my best wishes to all members of the \ncongregation. I also commend the leadership of Congregation Beth El on \nmaintaining a synagogue that has provided a place for those seeking \nanswers in Judaism and a center of Jewish activities in northern \nMichigan. Once again, congratulations on 120 years of service and \ngrowth in the Grand Traverse area.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/14/senate-section/article/S7728-2", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7728]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO TODD BEUKE\n\n Mrs. MURRAY.

Mr. Beuke is an exceptional teacher who has been honored \nthis year as a finalist for the Richard T. Farrell Teacher of Merit \nAward for his outstanding success in teaching history.\n  As a teacher at Sequim Middle School, Mr. Beuke has been able to \ncreate excitement in the classroom by using creative teaching methods \nthat resonate with his students. Students and teachers alike have \npraised Mr. Beuke for his supportive teaching style and the comfortable \nenvironment he has created in which students can explore history.\n  Mr. Beuke is an innovator in Washington State education, an \ninspiration to his students, and a teacher capable of making history \nlessons relevant and accessible. Mr. Beuke's work extends beyond the \nclassroom as well. He has helped expand the National History Day \nprogram throughout Washington State.\n  The National History Day program is a national education organization \nthat encourages professional development and active student learning. \nThe program provides publications and education programs that help \nguide teachers in methods to engage students and bring history to life. \nWashington State teachers and students have benefited from the effort \nMr. Beuke has made to share information about the History Day program. \nThe National History Day awards are a valuable way to highlight \npositive role models in our education system. I am proud Mr. Beuke has \nbeen nominated for this award.\n  I thank Todd Beuke for his work in the classroom and for his \ncommitment to education in my home State. I am sure he will continue to \nbe successful in inspiring students to enjoy the study of \nhistory.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/14/senate-section/article/S7728-3", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7728]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNIZING BRISTOL, SOUTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Bristol, \nSD. The town of Bristol will celebrate the 125th anniversary of its \nfounding this year.\n  Located in Day County, Bristol was founded as a result of railroad \nexpansion and named after the English city of Bristol by district \nrailroad surveyor C.P. Prior. The town is a designated spot on the \nYellowstone Trail, which once served as a route for covered wagons \nheading west. Found in the Glacial Lakes Region of northeastern South \nDakota, Bristol offers excellent hunting and fishing opportunities. The \ntown is also home to the Zucchini Festival, an annual summer event with \ngames and activities centered on zucchini.\n  Bristol has served as home to famous residents throughout its \nabundant history. One such resident is longtime ``NBC Nightly News'' \nanchor Tom Brokaw. Mr. Brokaw's great-grandfather, Richard P. Brokaw, \nwas one of the first families to settle in Bristol. He operated the \nBrokaw House, the first structure built in town. The hotel was built \nand rebuilt through the years to accommodate people attracted to Day \nCounty.\n  Since its beginning, Bristol has been a strong reflection of South \nDakota's values and traditions. As they celebrate this milestone \nanniversary, I am confident that Bristol will continue to thrive and \nsucceed for the next 125 years.\n  I would like to offer my congratulations to the citizens of Bristol \non their anniversary, and I wish them continued prosperity in the years \nto come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/14/senate-section/article/S7728-4", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7728]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    RECOGNIZING AKASKA, SOUTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. THUNE.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nincentives for plug-in electric drive motor vehicles; to the Committee \non Finance.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Fuel Reduction \nusing Electrons to End Our Dependence on the Mideast Act of 2007, or \nthe FREEDOM Act. Senators Maria Cantwell, Barack Obama, and I have been \nworking closely together since the beginning of the year to author this \nvery important legislation. We believe the FREEDOM Act will begin a \ndramatic shift in the transportation sector away from liquid fuels and \ntoward the greater use of electrons.\n  For years I worked hard to pass a strong tax incentive package for \nalternative fuel and hybrid electric vehicles in the form of the CLEAR \nAct, which was passed into law as part of the Energy Policy Act of \n2005. When I first introduced the CLEAR Act, more than 7 years ago, \nthere were only two hybrid vehicles available commercially. Today there \nare dozens of models of hybrids from which consumers can choose.\n  Already, the move toward hybrid-electric vehicles has helped to \nreduce the demand for liquid fuel in this country. It has also set the \nstage for the next technological step, the plug-in hybrid electric \nvehicle. This vehicle would have an extra battery pack, recharged from \nthe electricity grid, giving the vehicle all the benefits of a plug-in \nbattery electric vehicle but also the freedom and fuel efficiency of a \nhybrid electric vehicle once the battery has used up its charge.\n  With today's advanced plug-in electric and the coming plug-in hybrid \nelectric vehicles, most commuters will be able to make the round trip \nfrom home to work and back using very little or no fuel, relying \ninstead on cheap, clean, and abundant electricity.\n  As you and many of our colleagues know, per mile, electricity can be \nmuch cheaper and cleaner than petroleum, and electrons are generated \ndomestically and independent of the global oil market.\n  It is difficult to overstate the potential the change to plug-in \nelectric vehicles could make in terms of our energy dependence on \nliquid fuels. R. James Woolsey, who is a member of the National \nCommission on Energy Policy, testified before the Finance Committee \nthis spring. In his testimony, he cited a Department of Energy study \nthat estimated that adopting plug-in vehicles would not create a need \nfor new base load electricity generation plants until plug-ins \nconstitute over 84 percent of the country's 220 million passenger \nvehicles. In other words, we already have the power we need to fuel the \nvast majority of the cars in this country right now, and it exists in \nthe excess capacity of our existing powerplants. Because plug-in \nvehicles could mostly be charged at night, during the off-peak hours \nfor electric utilities, this technology represents an elegant solution.\n  In terms of technology and industry focus, the United States is \npositioned to lead the world into the future with plug-in electric \ndrive motor vehicles. The FREEDOM Act would help our Nation to take up \nthat position by helping to develop the market, the technology, and the \ndomestic production capacity needed to fulfill this role.\n  The FREEDOM Act's goals would be achieved through four strong tax \nincentives: First, a tax credit for consumers who purchase plug-in \nelectric or plug-in hybrid electric vehicles; second, for a limited \ntime, a tax credit for consumers who convert their hybrid vehicles to \nhigh quality plug-in hybrid vehicles; third, a strong tax incentive for \nthe U.S. manufacture of plug-in vehicles and of major components of \nplug-in vehicles, such as batteries, electric motors, and electronic \ncontrollers; and finally, a tax credit for electric utilities that \nprovide rebates to customers who purchase plug-in electric drive \nvehicles.\n  Freedom plug-in credits would cover the consumer purchase of vehicles \nthat use batteries and that plug into the electric grid for at least \npart of their power. This would include plug-in electrics, plug-in \nhybrids, and others. The amount of the credit would be based on the \nkilowatt hours of the vehicle's battery pack, with a cap of $7,500 for \npassenger vehicles. The same is true for heavier duty vehicles, except \nthat the caps are scaled up for each vehicle weight class.\n  Freedom conversion credits would go to hybrid-electric vehicle owners \nwho choose to convert their existing hybrid vehicle to a high quality \nplug-in hybrid electric vehicle. These credits would also be scaled to \nthe kilowatt-hours of the new battery installed in their vehicle. Only \nhigh quality conversion kits, which are certified to meet all highway \nsafety and emissions standards would qualify for a freedom conversion \ncredit, and the credits would be available until the market transitions \nto commercially available plug-in hybrid vehicles.\n  The FREEDOM Act also offers first-year expensing for companies \nsetting up production capacity in the United States for plug-in \nelectric drive vehicles and for major components of those vehicles.\n  Finally, in the case that an electric utility in the U.S. chooses to \noffer rebates to customers who purchase plug-in electric drive \nvehicles, the FREEDOM Act would reimburse the utility for part of that \nrebate in the form of a freedom utility credit. The amount of the \nGovernment reimbursement would be based on the rate of greenhouse gas \nemissions for each utility.\n  I want to emphasize that like the tax credits available under current \nlaw for hybrid electric vehicles, the tax incentives in the FREEDOM Act \nare temporary. They are needed in order to help get these products over \nthe initial stage of production, when they are quite a bit more \nexpensive than older technology vehicles, to the mass production stage, \nwhere economies of scale will drive costs down and the credits will no \nlonger be necessary. Consumer acceptance of this exciting new \ntechnology is vital, and these credits will make it easier and more \neconomical for consumers to choose vehicles that will move us away from \ndependence on less clean and more expensive transportation fuel \nproduced by other nations.\n  The consumer acceptance of the hybrid electric vehicle has already \nproven a benefit to our Nation's energy security, and the plug-in \nhybrid will lead to an even more dramatic reduction in fuel use in this \ncountry. Years ago, I argued that the technologies developed to make \nhybrids possible would eventually lead us to a commercially available \nhydrogen fuel cell vehicle. I stand by that argument, and I believe \nthat by the time plug-in hybrid electric vehicles become mass produced \nin this country, we will be ready to use hydrogen fuel cells to \ndisconnect these vehicles from the grid and begin a new age in \ntransportation with much greater freedom of movement and freedom from \ndependence of foreign oil.\n\n[[Page S7734]]\n\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to throw their full support for \nthe FREEDOM Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WYDEN (for himself and Mr. Bennett):\n  S. 1619. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \na credit for fuel-efficient motor vehicles, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today Senator Bennett and I are \nreintroducing legislation to provide a significant financial incentive \nfor automakers to produce, and for their customers to buy, more fuel \nefficient cars and light trucks in the form of consumer tax credits. \nReducing our Nation's dependence on oil should not be a partisan issue \nand Senator Bennett and I have worked together to come up with a plan \nthat will encourage consumers to buy more energy efficient vehicles \neven if those vehicles employ technologies, such as electric hybrid \ndrive trains or clean diesels, that cost more to produce.\n  Under our bipartisan, market-oriented bill, consumers who buy \nvehicles that are at least 25 percent more fuel efficient than the \ncurrent corporate fuel economy standards, called CAFE, would get a \nrebate of at least $630 and as much as $1,860 for the most fuel-\nefficient cars. We have separate standards for cars and trucks so \nconsumers can choose the type of vehicle they want and still get the \ncredit as long as they choose a fuel-efficient model. Similarly, our \nbill is technology neutral. We don't provide a credit based on the kind \nof engine or drive train that a car or truck has. We provide a credit \nbased on the level of fuel economy the vehicle achieves. So, \nmanufacturers are free to pursue whichever efficiency technology they \nwant and consumers have a greater choice of vehicles to purchase.\n  In the past, the automobile industry has said that increasing fuel \neconomy standards is hard to achieve because car buyers place little \nvalue on fuel economy, especially if that fuel efficiency comes with \nadded cost. They also argue that initial purchaser of a new car or \ntruck will not keep that car or truck long enough to recognize the \nlife-cycle fuel savings of a more efficient vehicle. The new program \ncreated by our bill directly addresses these concerns by providing tax \ncredits to consumers for purchasing fuel-efficient vehicles.\n  Providing these credits to purchasers of fuel efficient vehicles will \nfocus consumer attention on fuel efficiency at the time of purchase. \nFor vehicles that qualify, the rebate amount would be printed on the \nwindow sticker on new vehicles, so consumers would know exactly how \nmuch they would receive at the time they buy a new vehicle.\n\n  The consumer would claim that rebate as a tax credit on his or her \ntax return. Alternatively, the rebate could be transferred to auto \ndealers, allowing dealers to provide the rebates to consumers as ``cash \nback'' at the time of purchase.\n  This legislation builds on the incentives that were provided in the \n2005 energy bill specifically for hybrid gasoline/electric, lean-burn \nand fuel-cell powered cars. We believe the approach that we are \nadvocating will be simpler and fairer. Unlike the 2005 credits, we \ndon't pick specific technologies. Unlike the 2005 credits, we don't \nlimit the amount of the credits to a specific number of vehicles or \nmanufacturer. This approach does not pick winners and losers among \ncompetitive technology or companies. It takes a technology-neutral \napproach that allows any vehicle that has superior fuel efficiency to \nqualify for a tax credit, whether it uses hybrid or any other \ntechnology.\n  Finally, legislation already passed by the Senate Commerce Committee \ncalls for the U.S. Department of Transportation to begin to increase \nthe fuel efficiency standards of cars beginning in model year 2011. Our \ntax credit program, which will cover model years 2009, 2010 and 2011, \nwill help bridge the gap between where we are now and implementation of \nthe new fuel economy standards by encouraging consumers to buy those \nmore fuel efficient vehicles earlier while helping manufacturers gear \nup to produce them.\n  I urge colleagues to help jumpstart our Nation on the road to oil \nindependence and chart a new direction for our Nation's energy policy \nby supporting the OILSAVE Act.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no ojection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1619\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide the Coast Guard and NOAA with additional \nauthorities under the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, to strengthen the Oil \nPollution Act of 1990, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Oil \nPollution Prevention and Response Act of 2007 with my colleague Senator \nKerry, This comprehensive legislation strengthens and builds upon the \nOil Pollution Act of 1990, OPA 90. Congress passed OPA 90 shortly after \nthe Exxon Valdez ran aground in 1989, spilling 11 million gallons of \ncrude oil in Alaska's pristine Prince William Sound, the largest spill \nin U.S, history. OPA 90 revolutionized oilspill risk management and we \nhave OPA 90 to thank or improving oil spill prevention, preparedness, \nand response.\n  It is important to recognize that we have come a long way since OPA \n90. This is especially true in my home State of Washington. The Coast \nGuard's District 13 leads the Nation in oilspill prevention and works \nclosely with the State of Washington, tribal governments, and industry.\n  While we recognize the good work that is already being carried out in \nWashington and elsewhere, we must also look to continually improve our\n\n[[Page S7736]]\n\nability to prevent and respond to oilspills. While the probability of a \nmajor oilspill has been greatly reduced since OPA 90, the potential \nimpact of such a spill is now greater than ever.\n  According to Coast Guard data, although the number of oilspills from \nvessels has decreased enormously since passage of OPA 90, the volume of \noil spilled nationwide is still significant. In 1992, vessels spilled \n665,432 gallons of oil; in 2004, the total was higher, at 722,768 \ngallons, and a significant numbers of spills are still occurring. In \n2004, there were 36 spills from tank ships, 141 spills from barges, and \n1,562 spills from other vessels, including cargo ships. Furthermore, \neven though the number of spills from tankers declined from 193 spills \nin 1992 to 36 spills in 2004, a single incident from a vessel like the \nExxon Valdez can be devastating.\n  Again, to use examples from Washington State: endangered species like \nsalmon and southern resident orca whales are increasingly vulnerable to \nthe acute and chronic impacts of an oilspill. We have a National Marine \nSanctuary off our coast that demands stepped-up protection, and we must \ntake care to hold up our trust obligations to treaty tribes whose usual \nand accustomed fishing grounds would be devastated by a major spill. \nThis is all to say that we must factor the consequence major spill into \nour equations for risk. My colleagues from around the country can, I am \nsure, point to similar examples.\n  In August of 2005, I chaired a Commerce Committee Subcommittee on \nFisheries and Coast Guard field hearing in Seattle. This hearing \nfocused on improving our oil pollution prevention and response \ncapabilities. As a result of testimony from that hearing and \nconversations with the Coast Guard and other stakeholders, I introduced \nthe Oil Pollution Prevention and Response Act of 2006 last March.\n  The bill I introduce today, the Oil Pollution Prevention and Response \nAct of 2007, updates that effort and includes additional provisions.\n  New provisions include a requirement that the Coast Guard notify \nStates and tribal governments of maritime incidents in Federal waters \nthat have the potential to impact state resources. The bill would also \natlthorize the Coast Guard to train and work with qualified State \nvessel inspectors to bolster their existing ability to inspect vessels \nin port.\n  Other new provisions include a requirement for the Coast Guard to \npromulgate regulations allowing vessel owners to form nonprofit \ncooperatives to streamline their compliance with vessel response plan \nrequirements. Also new is an authorization for an education and \noutreach grant program to prevent the frequency of small spills that \noccur from recreational vessels.\n  The Oil Pollution Prevention and Response Act of 2007 retains key \nprovisions from last year's bill that address a number of areas to \nimprove prevention and response.\n  First, my bill directs the Coast Guard to finalize all rulemakings \nremaining from OPA 90 within 18 months. Remaining OPA 90 rules include \nthe critical salvage and firefighting requirements, which would \nestablish a national network of salvage and response vessels and \nequipment capable of assisting ships in distress. Implementation of the \nsalvage and firefighting rule has been consistently pushed back, most \nrecently in February of this year. It has been 17 years since the \npassage of OPA 90 and finalizing these rules in a timely manner will \ngreatly improve our prevention and response capabilities.\n  Because human error is the leading cause of accidental oilspills, the \nCoast Guard would be required to identify and pass regulations to \naddress the most frequent sources of human error that have led to \noilspills from vessels as well as ``near-misses.'' It would require the \nCoast Guard to ensure the safety of single hull tankers and other high-\nrisk vessels by increasing inspections of such vessels. My bill would \nrequire the Coast Guard to address and reduce the increased risk of \noilspills from oil transfers. It would also make companies that \nknowingly hire substandard single-hull tank vessels after 2010 \n``responsible parties'' in order to provide a disincentive for such \ncontracts.\n  Of particular importance to my State, the bill would provide a \nmechanism for year-round funding of the Neah Bay response tug, a key \nelement of the oilspill prevention safety net for Washington State's \nOlympic coast. It would also increase oil spill preparedness in the \nStrait of Juan de Fuca by changing the definition of ``High Volume \nPort'' for Puget Sound to make westerly boundary begin at the entrance \nto the strait. This change would require oilspill response equipment to \nbe stationed along the entire strait and not just east of the current \nline at Port Angeles. In addition, the Oil Pollution Prevention and \nResponse Act of 2007 would require improved coordination with federally \nrecognized tribes on oilspill prevention, preparedness, and response.\n  The bill would codify into federal law the establishment of the \noilspill Advisory Council, which was created by the Washington State \nLegislature and Governor Gregoire in the wake of the October 2004 Dalco \nPassage Oilspill, and provide $1 million annually to support the \ncouncil's important work. Finally, this bill would reiterate an OPA 90 \ndirective for the Coast Guard and Department of State to enter into \nnegotiations with Canada to ensure tug escorts for all tank ships with \na capacity greater than 40,000 dead weight tons in the Strait of Juan \nde Fuca, Strait of Georgia, and Haro Strait.\n  The slow response to the oilspill in Daleo Passage in the Puget Sound \nwas largely attributed to difficulties with detecting the oil that was \nspilled. The Oil Pollution Prevention and Response Act of 2007 would \nreinvigorate a Federal research program on oilspill prevention, \ndetection, and response, and would establish a grant program for the \ndevelopment of cost-effective technologies for detecting discharges of \noil from vessels, including infrared, pressure sensors, and remote \nsensing. It would also require the Secretary of Homeland Security, in \nconjunction with other Federal agencies, to conduct an analysis of the \ncondition and safety of all aspects of oil transportation in the United \nStates, and provide recommendations to improve such safety. This was a \nspecific recommendation of the U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy.\n  The Department of Justice has also noted that a major category of \noilspills are intentional discharges of oil from vessels. The United \nStates cannot address this problem alone. Thus, the bill would require \nthe Coast Guard to pursue stronger enforcement measures for oil \ndischarges in the International Maritime Organization and other \nappropriate international organizations.\n  Oilspill prevention and response is timely for Congress to consider \nbecause waterborne transportation of oil in the United States continues \nto increase, significant volumes of oil continue to be released, and \nthe potential for a major spill remains unacceptably high. Recent \nspills involving significant quantities of oil have occurred off the \ncoasts of Alaska, Maine, Massachusetts, Oregon, Virginia, Hawaii, and \nWashington, and involved barges, tankers, nontank vessels, and oil \ntransfer operations.\n  One thing we have learned from these spills is that prevention is \nmore cost-effective than cleaning up oil once it is released into the \nenvironment. We have also learned that although double hulls and \nredundant steering do increase tanker safety, these technologies are \nnot a panacea and we need to do more to ensure against oilspills.\n  The Federal Government has a responsibility to protect the Nation's \nnatural resources, public health, and environment by improving Federal \nmeasures to prevent and respond to oilspills. I urge my colleagues to \nconsider this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no ojection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1620\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Oil released into the Nation's marine waters can cause \n     substantial, and in some cases irreparable, harm to the \n     marine environment.\n       (2) The economic impact of oil spills is substantial. \n     Billions of dollars have been spent in the United States for \n     cleanup of, and damages due to, oil spills; while many \n     social, cultural, economic, and environmental damages remain \n     uncompensated.\n       (3) The Oil Pollution Act of 1990, enacted in response to \n     the worst vessel oil spill in United States history, \n     substantially reduced the amount of oil spills from vessels. \n     However, significant volumes of oil continue to be released, \n     and the potential for a major spill remains unacceptably \n     high.\n       (4) Although the total number of oil spills from vessels \n     has decreased since passage of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, \n     more oil was spilled in 2004 from vessels nationwide than was \n     spilled from vessels in 1992.\n       (5) Waterborne transportation of oil in the United States \n     continues to increase.\n       (6) Although the number of oil spills from tankers declined \n     from 193 in 1992 to 36 in 2004, spills from oil tankers tend \n     to be large with devastating impacts.\n       (7) While the number of oil spills from tank barges has \n     declined since 1992 (322 spills to 141 spills in 2004), the \n     volume of oil spilled from tank barges has remained constant \n     at approximately 200,000 gallons spilled each year.\n       (8) Oil spills from non-tank vessels averaged between \n     125,000 gallons and 400,000 gallons per year from 1992 \n     through 2004 and accounted for over half of the total number \n     of spills from all sources, including vessels and non-vessel \n     sources.\n       (9) Recent spills involving significant quantities of oil \n     have occurred off the coasts of Alaska, Maine, Massachusetts, \n     Oregon, Virginia, and Washington, and involved barges, tank \n     vessels, and non-tank vessels. The value of waterfront \n     property, sport, commercial and tribal treaty fisheries, \n     recreation, tourism, and threatened and endangered species \n     continue to increase.\n       (10) It is more cost-effective to prevent oil spills than \n     it is to clean-up oil once it is released into the \n     environment.\n       (11) Of the 20 major vessel oil spill incidents since 1990 \n     where liability limits have been exceeded, 10 involved tank \n     barges, 8 involved non-tank vessels, 2 involved tankers, and \n     only 1 involved a vessel that was double-hulled.\n       (12) Although recent technological improvements in oil \n     tanker design, such as double hulls and redundant steering, \n     increase tanker safety, these technologies are not a panacea \n     and cannot ensure against oil spills, the leading cause of \n     which is human error.\n       (13) The Federal government has a responsibility to protect \n     the Nation's natural resources, public health, and \n     environment by improving Federal measures to prevent and \n     respond to oil spills.\n       (14) Environmentally fragile coastal areas are vitally \n     important to local economies and the way of life in coastal \n     States and federally recognized tribal governments. These \n     areas are particularly vulnerable to the threat of oil \n     spills. Coastal waters contribute approximately 75 percent of \n     all commercial shellfish and finfish catches, and over 81 \n     percent of all recreational fishing catches in the United \n     States, outside of Alaska and Hawaii.\n       (15) The northern coast of Washington State and entrance to \n     Puget Sound is the principal corridor conveying Pacific Rim \n     commerce into the State, to Canada's largest port, and to the \n     United States' third largest naval complex. The area contains \n     a National Marine Sanctuary, a National Park, and many \n     National Wildlife Refuges contiguous with marine waters.\n       (16) State, local, and tribal governments have important \n     human resources and spill response capabilities which can \n     contribute to response efforts in the event of a significant \n     oil spill. State, local, and tribal governments may have \n     unique local knowledge of natural resources which can improve \n     the quality of spill response. For these reasons, State, \n     local and tribal governments need appropriate information to \n     have knowledge of spills, as well as incidents and activities \n     that may result in a spill, which can impact State waters.\n\n     SEC. 4.

A bill to require the Federal Communications Commission to \nreevaluate the band plans for the upper 700 megaHertz band and the un-\nauctioned portions of the lower 700 megaHertz band and recongifure them \nto include spectrum to be licensed for small geographic areas; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to once again introduce \nlegislation to encourage the deployment of next generation wireless \nservices in rural areas. Cell phones have become a vital part of so \nmany lives. Today, there are more than 200 million wireless subscribers \nin the United States alone, a subscribership that continues to grow. \nThis burgeoning success makes it all the more imperative that we foster \nan environment where this technology and future wireless advancements \ncan flourish and thrive.\n  As we consider the myriad issues affecting this debate, we must bear \nin mind that along with mobility, convenience and safety, cell phones \ntoday engender countless additional benefits from access to \ninformation, global satellite positioning, to entertainment. While \nwireless phones have been rapidly adopted by the general public, \nwireless service faces flaws that could hinder further adoption. I can \ntell you from firsthand experience how frustrated it can be when I am \nat home in Maine when I cannot get cellular service. Something must be \ndone in order to improve advance the capability of wireless service \nthat people across my State and others are relying on in increasing \nnumbers every day.\n  We must be vigilant in safeguarding our smaller communities from \nremaining under served and strive to ensure that they are taken into \naccount as the Federal Government shapes policy in response to this \nchanging technological landscape. As many of my colleagues are well \naware, wireless services, such as cell phones, handheld devices, and \nsome Internet services use frequencies on the radio spectrum to \ntransfer voice and data from one user to another. It is the job of the \nservice provider to convert these airwaves into the valuable services \nthat consumers demand. The quality of service in a given place depends \non how much investment the service provider has put into \ninfrastructure. More urban locations tend to have better service \nbecause the return on investment is much higher because of the \nconcentration of customers. This reality does not mean that rural areas \nare left without service. Viable business models exist that can sustain \nservice in these more remote locations. Oftentimes smaller, local \nwireless companies can serve these areas better than nationwide service \nproviders.\n  But one of the greatest barriers to entry in the wireless industry is \nacquiring a spectrum license in which a service can be operated. \nCompanies bid billions of dollars for rights to be one of the Nation's \nmost critical technological resources. The digital television \ntransition is on the verge of releasing new spectrum into the \nmarketplace, the much-anticipated 700 megaHertz spectrum auction. While \nI am grateful that the Federal Communications Commission has stated its \nintention to auction off the spectrum in licenses that cover both large \nand small geographic areas, without this consideration, smaller \ncompanies will be unable to compete in the bidding process. That is \npatently unacceptable.\n  The bill I introduce today aims to address this problem by \nreiterating to the Federal Communications Commission the necessity of \nprotecting smaller communities during the 700 MHz spectrum that will be \nauctioned as a result of the digital television transition. In the \nfinal auction rules, the FCC must divide some of the frequency \nallocations into smaller area licenses so that local and regional \nwireless companies can have an opportunity to compete in the bidding \nprocess. The proper balance of large and small licenses will encourage \nthe deployment of advanced services throughout all parts of the United \nStates.\n  This bill is not meant to circumvent the expertise or purview of the \nFederal Communications Commission, nor call into question its \nintentions. It merely directs the FCC to use its acumen and good \noffices to develop a plan that will benefit the entire Nation. Rural \nAmerica deserves the same benefits of wireless technologies that are \navailable in urban areas. This act gives those best able to serve \nremote areas the required tools to deploy those services.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INHOFE (for himself, Mr. Nelson of Nebraska, Ms. Snowe, \n        Mr. Stevens, Mr. Bunning, Mr. Crapo, Mr. Craig, Mr. Kyl, Mr. \n        Ensign, Mr. Coburn, Mr. Shelby, Mr. Chambliss, Mrs. Hutchison, \n        Mr. Vitter, Mr. Sessions, Mr. Thune, Mr. Bond, Mr. Cochran, Mr. \n        Burr, Mrs. Dole, and Mr. Allard):\n  S. 1623. A bill to require the withholding of United States \ncontributions to the United Nations until the President certifies that \nthe United Nations is not engaged in global taxation schemes; to the \nCommittee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, today I introduce S. 1623. I introduce \nthis bill to prevent the imposition of global taxes on the United \nStates. The current efforts of the United Nations and other \ninternational organizations are to develop and advocate a type of tax \nsystem that will keep them from having to answer to anybody.\n  Last year, I introduced legislation, S. 3633, which garnered the \nsupport of 31 cosponsors, and I am pleased to reintroduce this bill \ntoday with 23 cosponsors.\n  This bill states if the United Nations or other international \norganizations continue to pursue global taxation, the United States \nwill withhold 20 percent of the assessed contributions to the regular \nbudget of these organizations. This measure will last until \ncertification is given by the President to the Congress that no \ninternational organization has legal taxation authority in the United \nStates, that no taxes or fees have been imposed on the United States, \nand that no taxes have been proposed by any of these international \norganizations.\n  One has to wonder sometimes what has happened to sovereignty in \nAmerica. There are people in this body who don't think anything is good \nunless it is somehow proposed by some international organization, and \nquite often the interests of international organizations are not the \nsame interests of our Nation. Our Government's primary leverage with \nthe United Nations is controlling the flow of our regular \ncontributions. By collecting enormous and global taxes on top of our \nregular contributions, the United Nations, or any other of these \ninternational organizations, would be accountable to no one. The United \nNations' abuse of international trust, rampant corruption, and \nwidespread waste are now all well-known. Allowing this clearly \ndysfunctional institution to extract U.S. dollars is absurd. Permitting \nthis would\n\n[[Page S7743]]\n\ncondone the U.N.'s long sought-after goal of a U.N.-led global \ngovernance--something not in the best interest of the United States.\n  The United States already pays 27 percent of the U.N. Peacekeeping \nbudget and 22 percent of the regular U.N. dues and special assessments, \nthe majority of which our Government tracks very poorly. To further \nloosen the reins on the United Nations would be disastrous. We can't \nallow this to happen.\n  It is fascinating to watch the various things that are not in the \nbest interests of this country and the fact that we are paying for 25 \npercent of that. This is a way we would be able to inject into this \nsystem something that would be far better and would take care of just \nthe sovereignty of the United States; those things that are in our best \ninterests and not just in the best interests of some international \norganization.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BAUCUS (for himself and Mr. Grassley):\n  S. 1624. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nthat the exception from the treatment of publicly traded partnerships \nas corporations for partnerships with passive-type income shall not \napply to partnerships directly or indirectly deriving income from \nproviding investment adviser and related asset management services; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my friend and \ncolleague, Senator Grassley, in introducing legislation to preserve the \ncorporate tax base.\n  The Federal Government taxes corporations. The tax law treats \ncorporations as economic entities, and taxes them separately from the \ncorporation's shareholders. And the tax law treats partnerships \ndifferently from corporations.\n  Recently, some private equity and hedge fund entities have sought to \ngo public without paying a corporate tax. The bill that we introduce \ntoday would treat all publicly traded partnerships that directly or \nindirectly receive income from providing investment advisory or asset \nmanagement services as corporations. The tax law ought to treat as \ncorporations entities that function as corporations.\n  Congress enacted the publicly traded partnership rules in 1987 to \npreserve the corporate tax base. Congress was concerned that publicly \ntraded partnerships might be able to enjoy the privilege of going \npublic like a corporation without the corporate toll charge. The House \ncommittee report stated:\n\n       These changes [referring to the corporate minimum tax \n     included in the 1986 Act] reflect an intent to preserve the \n     corporate level tax. The committee is concerned that the \n     intent of these changes is being circumvented by the growth \n     of publicly traded partnerships that are taking advantage of \n     an unintended opportunity for disincorporation and elective \n     integration of the corporate and shareholder levels of tax.\n\n  Congress carved out an exception for those partnerships that receive \n90 percent or more of their income from passive income. Passive income \nincludes dividends, rents, royalties, interest, and the sale of capital \ngains. But Congress generally treated publicly traded partnerships that \nderive income from active businesses as corporations.\n  To emphasize that point, in 1987, the House committee report stated:\n\n       In general, the purpose of distinguishing between passive-\n     type income and other income is to distinguish those \n     partnerships that are engaged in activities commonly \n     considered as essentially no more than investments, and those \n     activities more typically conducted in corporate form that \n     are in the nature of active business activities.\n\n  This year, some private equity and hedge fund management firms are \nattempting to qualify for partnership tax treatment. They seek to do so \neven though they derive virtually all of their income from providing \nasset management and financial advisory services. These management \nfirms argue that they are able to achieve this result by claiming that \nall of their income from asset management and investment advisory \nservices is passive. But objective observers would say that this income \nactually arises from active businesses. Congress's intent in 1987 was \nto treat such publicly traded partnerships as corporations. In the \nlegislation that we introduce today, we seek to ensure that Congress's \noriginal intent is carried out.\n  This legislation is also important to ensure that some corporations \nare not disadvantaged because they conduct business in the corporate \nform and pay taxes as a corporation. Asset management service and \ninvestment advisory partnerships provide the same types of active \nbusiness services as their corporate competitors. Our tax system \nfunctions best when it is fair. The tax law ought to treat similarly \nsituated taxpayers the same. Thus, these publicly traded partnerships \nshould be taxed as corporations.\n  The legislation that we introduce today would clarify the purpose of \nthe publicly traded partnership rules. Our bill would deny the ability \nof an active financial advisory and asset management business to go \npublic and avoid a corporate level tax on a significant amount of its \nincome.\n  Senator Grassley and I have asked the staff of the Treasury \nDepartment for their views on these transactions, how they plan to \naddress this issue, and whether they think additional statutory changes \nare necessary to clarify the intent of the publicly traded partnership \nrules. If a statutory change is needed, then this legislation will \naccomplish that change. If a change is not needed, then this \nlegislation does not alter the ability of Treasury Department and the \nInternal Revenue Service to issue guidance and enforce congressional \nintent.\n  I urge my colleagues to join with Senator Grassley and me to protect \nthe original intent of Congress, to protect the tax base, and to treat \nsimilarly situated entities similarly. I urge my colleagues to support \nthis bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and an explanation \nand reasons for change be printed in the Record.\n  There being no ojection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1624\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Treatment of Publicly Traded Partnerships Directly or Indirectly \n  Deriving Income From Investment Adviser Services and Related Asset \n                          Management Services\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       Under present law, a publicly traded partnership generally \n     is treated as a corporation for Federal tax purposes (sec. \n     7704(a)). For this purpose, a publicly traded partnership \n     means any partnership if interests in the partnership are \n     traded on an established securities market, or interests in \n     the partnership are readily tradable on a secondary market \n     (or the substantial equivalent thereof).\n       An exception from corporate treatment is provided for \n     certain publicly traded partnerships, 90 percent or more of \n     whose gross income is qualifying income (sec. 7704(c)(2)). \n     However, this exception does not apply to any partnership \n     that would be described in section 851 (a) if it were a \n     domestic corporation, which includes a corporation registered \n     under the Investment Company Act of 1940 as a management \n     company or unit investment trust.\n       Qualifying income includes interest, dividends, and gains \n     from the disposition of a capital asset (or of property \n     described in section 1231 (b)) that is held for the \n     production of income that is qualifying income. Qualifying \n     income also includes rents from real property, gains from the \n     sale or other disposition of real property, and income and \n     gains from the exploration, development, mining or \n     production, processing, refining, transportation (including \n     pipelines transporting gas, oil, or products thereof), or the \n     marketing of any mineral or natural resource (including \n     fertilizer, geothermal energy, and timber). It also includes \n     income and gains from commodities (not described in section \n     1221 (a)(1)) or futures, options, or forward contracts with \n     respect to such commodities (including foreign currency \n     transactions of a commodity pool) in the case of partnership, \n     a principal activity of which is the buying and selling of \n     such commodities, futures, options or forward contracts.\n\n\n                           Reasons for Change\n\n       The rules generally treating publicly traded partnerships \n     as corporations were enacted in 1987 to address concern about \n     long-term erosion of the corporate tax base. At that time, \n     Congress stated, ``[t]o the extent that activities would \n     otherwise be conducted in corporate form, and earnings would \n     be subject to two levels of tax (at the corporate and \n     shareholder levels), the growth of publicly traded \n     partnerships engaged in such activities tends to jeopardize \n     the corporate tax base.'' (H.R. Rep. No. 100-391, 100th \n     Cong., 1st Sess. 1065.) Referring to recent tax law changes \n     affecting corporations, the Congress stated, ``[t]hese \n     changes reflect an intent to preserve the corporate level \n     tax. The committee is concerned that the intent of these \n     changes is being circumvented by the growth of publicly \n     traded partnerships that are taking advantage of an \n     unintended opportunity for disincorporation and elective \n     integration of the corporate and shareholder levels of tax.'' \n     (H.R. Rep. No. 100-391, 100th Cong., 1st Sess. 1066.)\n       These same concerns hold true today, as industry sectors \n     that have never conducted business as publicly traded \n     partnerships start to shift into that form of doing business. \n     News reports have called attention to transactions set in \n     motion in recent months in which partnerships earning income \n     from investment adviser and related asset management services \n     made or will make their interests available on an exchange or \n     market. This trend causes deep concern about preservation \n     of the corporate tax base as it presages the transfer of \n     corporate assets to publicly traded partnerships. When \n     corporate assets are moved to partnership form without \n     relinquishing that hallmark of corporate status, access to \n     capital markets, some businesses are able to lower their \n     cost of capital at the expense of the Federal Treasury. \n     This result subverts a principal purpose and policy of the \n     present-law rules treating publicly traded partnerships as \n     corporations: to preserve the corporate tax base.\n       To the extent these transactions represent a trend toward \n     increased utilization of publicly traded partnerships in the \n     case of businesses earning income from investment adviser and \n     related asset management services, there is the additional \n     concern of distortions caused by inconsistent treatment under \n     the tax law. The present-law exception in the case of \n     partnerships, 90 percent or more of whose gross income is \n     qualifying income, is not intended to encompass income from \n     investment adviser and related asset management services. The \n     bill serves to address this troubling trend by strengthening \n     the rules treating publicly traded partnerships as \n     corporations.\n\n\n                        Explanation of Provision\n\n       The bill provides generally that the exception from \n     corporate treatment for a publicly traded partnership, 90 \n     percent or more of whose gross income is qualifying income, \n     does not apply in the case of a partnership that directly or \n     indirectly derives income from investment adviser services or \n     related asset management services. Thus, such a partnership \n     is treated as a corporation for Federal tax purposes and is \n     subject to the corporate income tax.\n       Under the bill, the exception from corporate treatment for \n     a publicly traded partnership does not apply to any \n     partnership that, directly or indirectly, has any item of \n     income or gain (including capital gains or dividends), the \n     rights to which are derived from services provided by any \n     person as an investment adviser, as defined in the Investment \n     Advisers Act of 1940, or as a person associated with an \n     investment adviser, as defined in that Act. Further, the \n     exception from corporate treatment does not apply to a \n     partnership that, directly or indirectly, has any item of \n     income or gain (including capital gains or dividends), the \n     rights to which are derived from asset management services \n     provided by an investment adviser, a person associated with \n     an investment adviser, or any person related to either, in \n     connection with the management of assets with respect to \n     which investment adviser services were provided. For purposes \n     of the bill, these determinations are made without regard to \n     whether the person is required to register as an investment \n     adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. In the \n     absence of regulatory guidance as to the definition of a \n     related person, it is intended that the definition of a \n     related person in section 197(f)(9)(C)(i) apply.\n       For example, a publicly traded partnership that has income \n     (including capital gains or dividend income) from a profits \n     interest in a partnership, the rights to which income are \n     derived from the performance of services by any person as an \n     investment adviser, is treated as a corporation for Federal \n     tax purposes under the bill. As a further example, a publicly \n     traded partnership that receives a dividend from a \n     corporation that receives or accrues income, the rights to \n     which are derived from services provided by any person as an \n     investment adviser, is treated as a corporation for Federal \n     tax purposes under the bill.\n       Under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 definition, an \n     investment adviser means any person who, for compensation, \n     engages in the business of advising others, either directly \n     or through publications or writings, as to the value of \n     securities or as to the advisability of investing in, \n     purchasing, or selling securities, or who, for compensation \n     and as part of a regular business, issues or promulgates \n     analyses or reports concerning securities. Under this \n     definition, exceptions are provided in the case of certain \n     banks, certain brokers or dealers, as well as certain others, \n     provided criteria specified in that Act are met. These \n     exceptions apply for purposes of the bill. No inference is \n     intended that income from activities described in the \n     exceptions is qualifying income for purposes of section 7704.\n\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The bill generally is effective for taxable years of a \n     partnership beginning on or after June 14, 2007.\n       Under a transition rule for certain partnerships, the bill \n     applies for taxable years beginning on or after June 14, \n     2012. The transition rule applies in the case of a \n     partnership the interests in which on June 14, 2007, were \n     traded on an established securities market, or were readily \n     tradable on a secondary market (or the substantial equivalent \n     thereof). In addition, the transition rule generally applies \n     in the case of a partnership which, on or before June 14, \n     2007, filed a registration statement with the Securities and \n     Exchange Commission under section 6 of the Securities Act of \n     1933 (15 U.S.C. 77f) that was required solely by reason of an \n     initial public offering of interests in the partnership. \n     However, the transition rule does not apply if the \n     registration statement is filed with respect to securities \n     that are to be issued on a delayed or continuous basis \n     (pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act of 1933). \n     Thus, a shelf registration on or before June 14, 2007, of \n     interests in a partnership does not cause the partnership to \n     be eligible for the transition rule. Rather, in the case of \n     such a partnership, the bill is effective for taxable years \n     of the partnership beginning on or after June 14, 2007.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, this legislation that Senator Baucus and \nI are introducing addresses an important issue--preserving the \nintegrity of the Tax Code. Recent public offerings, effected and \nannounced, by private equity and hedge fund management firms have \nraised serious tax concerns that if left unaddressed have the potential \nto fundamentally reduce the corporate tax base over the long run, \nleading other individuals and business taxpayers with a greater share \nof the Nation's tax burden.\n  Congress enacted the publicly traded partnership rules in 1987 out of \nconcern with erosion of the corporate tax base. Given the ease with \nwhich taxpayers can choose the type of entity for their business, an \nappropriate ``bright line'' to define entities that should be subject \nto a corporate level tax was considered to be those entities that are \npublicly traded. A hallmark of corporate status is access to public \nmarkets. Another concern was that the ability to be publicly traded \nwithout paying an entity level tax would create an unwarranted \ncompetitive advantage over publicly traded corporations.\n  These concerns--corporate tax base erosion and a tax-created \ncompetitive advantage--were not considered to be implicated in cases \nwhere the partnership's income is from passive investments because \ninvestors could earn\n\n[[Page S7745]]\n\nsuch income directly--e.g., interest--or because the income is already \nsubject to a corporate level tax--e.g., dividends. The following key \nquote from the legislative history illustrates this point:\n\n       In general, the purpose of distinguishing between passive-\n     type income and other income is to distinguish those \n     partnerships that are engaged in activities commonly \n     considered as essentially no more than investments, and those \n     activities more typically conducted in corporate form that \n     are in the nature of active business activities.\n\n  The recent and proposed public offerings of private equity and hedge \nfund management firms claim to qualify for partnership tax treatment, \neven though virtually all of their income is derived from providing \nasset management and financial advisory services. This result is \nclaimed to be accomplished by structuring service fees in a way that \npurports to characterize those fees as passive-type income. Whether or \nnot these structures comply with the letter of the law, they are \ninconsistent with the purposes of the publicly traded partnership \nrules.\n  This legislation clarifies the purpose of the publicly traded \npartnership rules by denying the ability of an active financial \nadvisory and asset management business to go public and avoid a \ncorporate level tax on a significant amount of its income. Senator \nBaucus and I have asked Treasury for their views on these structures, \nhow they plan to address this issue, and whether they think additional \nstatutory changes are necessary to clarify the intent of the publicly \ntraded partnership rules. If a change is necessary, this legislation \nwill accomplish that change. If a change isn't necessary, this \nlegislation does not alter the ability of Treasury and the Internal \nRevenue Service to issue guidance and enforce Congressional intent.\n  In his introductory remarks, Senator Baucus gave a technical \ndescription of this legislation and reasons for change, which reflects \nmy understanding and intent in introducing this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself, Mr. Coleman, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. \n        Nelson of Nebraska, Mr. Kerry, and Ms. Collins):\n  S. 1628. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to authorize \nprograms to increase the number of nurse faculty and to increase the \ndomestic nursing and physical therapy workforce, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation with my \ncolleagues, Senator Coleman, Senator Lincoln, Senator Ben Nelson, \nSenator Kerry, and Senator Collins, that will help to address the \ncritical shortage of nurse faculty and physical therapists that is \nfacing our Nation. The nationwide nursing shortage is growing rapidly, \nbecause the average age of the nursing workforce is near retirement and \nbecause the aging population has increasing health care needs. And the \nshortage is one that affects the entire Nation. A 2006 Health Resources \nand Services Administration report estimated that the national nursing \nshortage would more than triple, to more than 1 million nurses, by the \nyear 2020. The report also predicts that all 50 States will experience \nnursing shortages by 2015. Quite simply, we need to educate more \nnurses, or we, as a Nation, will not have enough trained nurses to meet \nthe needs of our aging society.\n  One of the biggest constraints to educating more nurses is a shortage \nof nursing faculty. Almost three-quarters of nursing programs surveyed \nby the American Association of Colleges of Nursing cited faculty \nshortages as a reason for turning away qualified applicants. Although \napplications to nursing programs have surged 59 percent over the past \ndecade, the National League for Nursing estimates that 147,000 \nqualified applications were turned away in 2004. This represents a 27 \npercent decrease in admissions over the previous year, indicating the \nneed to scale up capacity in nursing programs is more critical than \never.\n  I know that in my home state of New Mexico, nursing programs turned \ndown almost half of qualified applicants, even though the Health \nResources and Services Administration predicts that New Mexico will \nonly be able to meet 64 percent of its demand for nurses by 2020. With \na national nurse faculty workforce that averages 53.5 years of age, and \nan average nurse faculty retirement age of 62.5 years, we cannot and \nmust not wait any longer to address nurse faculty shortages.\n  Nursing faculty are not the only segment of the population that is \naging. As the baby boom generation ages, there will be an increased \nneed for nurses to care for the elderly. However, less than 1 percent \nof practicing nurses have a certification in geriatrics.\n  The Nurse Faculty and Physical Therapist Education Act will amend the \nPublic Health Service Act, to help alleviate the faculty shortage by \nproviding funds to help nursing schools increase enrollment and \ngraduation from nursing doctoral programs. The act will increase \npartnering opportunities between academic institutions and medical \npractices, enhance cooperative education, support marketing outreach, \nand strengthen mentoring programs. The bill will increase the number of \nnurses who complete nursing doctoral programs and seek employment as \nfaculty members and nursing leaders in academic institutions. In \naddition, the bill authorizes awards to train nursing faculty in \nclinical geriatrics, so that more nursing students will be equipped for \nour aging population.\n  By addressing the faculty shortage, we are addressing the nursing \nshortage.\n  The aging population will also require additional health workers in \nother fields. Physical therapy was listed as one of the fastest growing \noccupations by the U.S. Department of Labor, with a projected job \ngrowth of greater than 36 percent between 2004 and 2014. The need for \nphysical therapists is particularly acute in rural and urban \nunderserved areas, which have three to four times fewer physical \ntherapists per capita than suburban areas. To address this need, the \nbill also authorizes a distance education pilot program to improve \naccess to educational opportunity for both nursing and physical therapy \nstudents. Finally, the bill calls for a study by the Institute of \nMedicine at the National Academy of Sciences which will recommend how \nto balance education, labor, and immigration policies to meet the \ndemand for qualified nurses and physical therapists.\n  The provisions of the Nurse Faculty and Physical Therapist Education \nAct are vital to overcoming workforce challenges. By addressing nurse \nfaculty and physical therapist shortages, we will enhance both access \nto care and the quality of care. I would like to thank my colleagues, \nSenator Coleman, Senator Lincoln, and Senator Ben Nelson, for their \nleadership and hard work on this important issue.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1628\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Nurse \n     Faculty and Physical Therapist Education Act of 2007''.\n       (b) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Nurse Reinvestment Act (Public Law 107-205) has \n     helped to support students preparing to be nurse educators. \n     Yet, nursing schools nationwide are forced to deny admission \n     to individuals seeking to become nurses and nurse educators \n     due to the lack of qualified nurse faculty.\n       (2) The American Association of Colleges of Nursing \n     reported that 42,866 qualified applicants were denied \n     admission to nursing baccalaureate and graduate programs in \n     2006, with faculty shortages identified as a major reason for \n     turning away students.\n       (3) Seventy-one percent of schools have reported \n     insufficient faculty as the primary reason for not accepting \n     qualified applicants. The primary reasons for lack of faculty \n     are lack of funds to hire new faculty, inability to identify, \n     recruit and hire faculty in the competitive job market as of \n     May 2007, and lack of nursing faculty available in different \n     geographic areas.\n       (4) Despite the fact that in 2006, 52.4 percent of \n     graduates of doctoral nursing programs enter education roles, \n     the 103 doctoral programs nationwide produced only 437 \n     graduates, which is only an additional 6 graduates from 2005. \n     This annual graduation rate is insufficient to meet the needs \n     for nurse faculty. In keeping with other professional \n     academic disciplines, nurse faculty at colleges and \n     universities are typically doctorally prepared.\n       (5) The nursing faculty workforce is aging and will be \n     retiring.\n\n[[Page S7746]]\n\n       (6) With the average retirement age of nurse faculty at \n     62.5 years of age, and the average age of doctorally prepared \n     faculty, as of May 2007, that hold the rank of professor, \n     associate professor, and assistant professor is 58.6, 55.8, \n     and 51.6 years, respectively, the health care system faces \n     unprecedented workforce and health access challenges with \n     current and future shortages of deans, nurse educators, and \n     nurses.\n       (7) Research by the National League of Nursing indicates \n     that by 2019 approximately 75 percent of the nursing faculty \n     population (as of May 2007) is expected to retire.\n       (8) A wave of nurses will be retiring from the profession \n     in the near future. As of May 2007, the average age of a \n     nurse in the United States is 46.8 years old. The Bureau of \n     Labor Statistics estimates that more than 1,200,000 new and \n     replacement registered nurses will be needed by 2014.\n       (9) By 2030, the number of adults age 65 and older is \n     expected to double to 70,000,000, accounting for 20 percent \n     of the population. As the population ages, the demand for \n     nurses and nursing faculty will increase.\n       (10) Despite the need for nurses to treat an aging \n     population, few registered nurses in the United States are \n     trained in geriatrics. Less than 1 percent of practicing \n     nurses have a certification in geriatrics and 3 percent of \n     advanced practice nurses specialize in geriatrics.\n       (11) Specialized training in geriatrics is needed to treat \n     older adults with multiple health conditions and improve \n     health outcomes. Approximately 80 percent of Medicare \n     beneficiaries have 1 chronic condition, more than 60 percent \n     have 2 or more chronic conditions, and at least 10 percent \n     have coexisting Alzheimer's disease or other dementias that \n     complicate their care and worsen health outcomes. Two-thirds \n     of Medicare spending is attributed to 20 percent of \n     beneficiaries who have 5 or more chronic conditions. Research \n     indicates that older persons receiving care from nurses \n     trained in geriatrics are less frequently readmitted to \n     hospitals or transferred from nursing facilities to hospitals \n     than those who did not receive care from a nurse trained in \n     geriatrics.\n       (12) The Department of Labor projected that the need for \n     physical therapists would increase by 36.7 percent between \n     2004 and 2014.\n       (13) The need for physical therapists is particularly acute \n     rural and urban underserved areas, which have 3 to 4 times \n     fewer physical therapists per capita than suburban areas.\n\n                 TITLE I--GRANTS FOR NURSING EDUCATION\n\n     SEC. 101.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to exclude \ncertain tax-exempt financing of electric transmission facilities from \nthe private business use test; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce today a bill to \naddress the increasing need for electric power transmission in our \ncountry.\n  The Nation's network of transmission lines is the super-highway of \nthe electric utility industry and the backbone of the electric grid. It \nserves as the means of moving large amounts of electricity continuously \nfrom powerplants to substations where it is distributed to homes and \nbusinesses.\n  A vibrant transmission system helps prevent reliability problems such \nas blackouts which have wreaked havoc in California, the Northeast, and \nthe Midwest in the last 5 years. It enables regions rich in energy \nresources like wind, coal, natural gas, and hydropower, to export \nenergy to power-starved regions of the country. It also serves as the \nengine of our Nation's economic well-being.\n  It has been widely acknowledged by Government and industry experts \nthat investment in the transmission system has tapered off \nsignificantly and more investment is needed. Planning for the Nation's \nfuture electricity needs is a key consideration as adding transmission \ncan take many years, even in the most streamlined process. Decisions on \nsystem enhancements needed in the next decade must be made today. As \nwith other components of utility infrastructure, siting and building \ntransmission lines is both difficult and very expensive, often costing \nmuch more than $1 million per mile.\n  Over the last two decades, transmission investment has decreased by \n$115 million a year, dropping from $5 billion annually in 1975 to $2 \nbillion in 2000. The electric transmission line grid capacity has not \nbeen upgraded to meet growth demands, particularly in the rapidly \ngrowing West. In 2001, the estimated cost for infrastructure renewal \nwas $1.3 trillion over a 5-year period. Today, that cost has risen to \nover $2 trillion.\n  Other investment barriers include lack of regional integrated \nplanning and difficulty in siting new transmission lines. The process \ncan involve acquiring land easements from property owners, and creating \na cleared corridor, 70 to 100 feet wide and often many miles long. On \ntop of all this is the uncertainty regarding investment risks and \nreturns.\n  Adding large transmission lines also requires State regulatory \napproval, which involves significant permitting, research and modeling \ndata, environmental information, cost comparisons, analyses of various \noptions, discussions of scenarios and criteria used in evaluation, and \nother information.\n  Lack of new transmission directly affects the price of retail \nelectricity as a decrease in available transmission lines leads to more \nlimited access to electric generation plants. Any addition of \npowerplants, including nuclear facilities and renewables such as wind, \nwould also require new transmission lines and facilities.\n  In short our Nation's economy and population are still growing, and \nso too are its power needs, but without new transmission, access to new \npower generation is static, which will in turn lead to rising retail \nand industrial power costs.\n  The Energy Policy Act of 2005 included several important provisions \nto encourage transmission investment. I believe there is more that we \ncan do to accelerate the pace of investment in transmission \ninfrastructure and to lower the cost of those investments.\n  My State of Idaho and several others have created State \ninfrastructure authorities to finance and promote needed transmission \ninvestments. The creation of these State authorities is a new and \ninnovative development that could be the appropriate catalyst for this \nneeded investment. However, the full potential of these State \nauthorities will not be realized under existing law.\n  As instrumentalities of the State, these authorities can issue tax-\nexempt bonds to finance transmission projects. But under current law, \nonly a very limited number of industry participants such as other \ngovernmental entities, can use these facilities built with tax-exempt \nbonds. Clearly, we need a system in which new transmission facilities, \nregardless of the source of financing, are available for use by \nindustry participants.\n  The legislation I am introducing today amends section 141 of the \nInternal Revenue Code to modify the so-called private use restrictions \non tax-exempt financing of transmission facilities. Under this \nlegislation, any issuer of tax-exempt bonds to finance transmission \nfacilities would continue to be required to own the facilities. \nHowever, the operation or use of those facilities by a nongovernmental \nprivate party would not jeopardize the tax-exempt status of the bonds. \nAs an example from my State, the Idaho Energy Resources Authority could \nissue tax-exempt bonds to finance a transmission line and all parties, \nprivate utilities, rural electric cooperatives, municipal utilities, \nindependent power producers, could move power across that facility.\n  Thus, all segments of the industry benefit from new, low-cost \ninvestment in transmission. The basic requirement of section 141 that \ntax-exempt financed facilities serve a general public purpose and are \nowned by an eligible issuer is retained. And our whole Nation benefits \nfrom a transmission system that is more robust, reliable and cost \neffective.\n  My legislation sunsets in 5 years. This will provide Congress an \nopportunity to review the effectiveness and implications of this change \nin the code.\n  In addition to support for this proposal from various parties in \nIdaho, this concept has been endorsed by the Western Governors \nAssociation.\n  It is my hope that this commonsense proposal can be quickly enacted \nand that lower cost investments in the Nation's transmission grid can \nbe made.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERRY (for himself and Ms. Cantwell):\n  S. 1631. A bill to establish an emergency fuel assistance grant \nprogram for small businesses during energy emergencies; to the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, last month, Americans emptied their wallets \nat the pump, paying record prices that reached $3.22 a gallon according \nto the Department of Energy's Energy Information Administration. This \nprice represented a 28-percent increase over a period of just 2 months, \nand 52-percent increase since the end of January. Rising prices \nunderscore the increased attention that small business owners are \npaying to this issue. According to a survey conducted by the National \nSmall Business Association, NSBA, 62 percent of small businesses use \nvehicles for delivery or customer transportation, and a majority of \nthose who use vehicles travel more than 50 mile a day.\n  According to the Energy Information Administration's June 12 update \nto the ``Short Term Energy Outlook,'' gas prices are expected to \naverage $3.05 through the 2007 summer months, an increase of 21-cents \nover last summer's average price. Meanwhile, small businesses that \noperate close to the margin and that rely on vehicles every day to \nremain competitive are struggling to keep up.\n  These are the same businesses coping with considerable increases in \nthe cost of providing their employees health care, the same burgeoning \nentrepreneurs that we count on to create roughly two-thirds of the new \njobs in this country. These businesses can no longer be expected to \nshoulder a burden created by a Government that has been reluctant to \nshift its priorities from serving the same old special interests.\n  The good news is that right now, the Senate is debating legislation \nthat would put the country on a clear path towards energy independence. \nIn a single month, we could rewrite the shameful story of \nprocrastination, manipulation and, most of all, failed leadership that \nhas defined our energy policy for 30 years.\n  Democrats in the Senate are working to develop a comprehensive energy \npolicy that will make America safer and will stabilize and lower fuel \ncosts for small businesses and all Americans. But in order to \neffectively address energy security, the final legislation must include \nthree components: 1. a major increase in the efficiency of all sources \nand uses of energy, from pickup trucks to fluorescent light bulbs; 2. \ndramatic incentives for all renewable\n\n[[Page S7749]]\n\nenergy sources, including the requirement that at least 20 percent of \nour energy come from renewable sources like wind and solar by 2020; and \n3. a comprehensive plan to get clean coal technologies and carbon \nsequestration off the drawing board and under construction.\n  These are the first steps Congress must take to address the long term \nsecurity and stability of this country's fuel supply. But there are \nother steps we can take in the short term to make sure our small \nbusinesses are protected against dramatic interruptions in fuel.\n  Today, I am introducing legislation that creates an emergency fuel \nassistance program for small businesses in the event of a severe fuel \ninterruption. Under this program, small businesses and farms that rely \non fuel as a key operating cost would be eligible to receive grants to \nhelp them stay afloat during periods of extraordinarily high gas \nprices. This program could go a long way toward helping businesses \noperating close to the margin deal with costs that are beyond their \ncontrol.\n  Specifically, the Small Business Emergency Fuel Assistance Act of \n2007 would create a program within the Economic Development Agency at \nthe Department of Commerce to assist small businesses through State \ngrants during declarations of fuel emergency. The program is triggered \nby a Presidential declaration of fuel emergency, and would authorize \nthe Secretary of Commerce to give grants to States to provide \nassistance to fuel-dependent small businesses. Eligibility for these \ngrants is restricted to businesses with fewer than 50 employees or less \nthan $5 million in annual gross receipts. Furthermore, to ensure that \nthese businesses are also contributing to America's energy conservation \nefforts, eligibility would be contingent upon a business having a plan \nto become more energy efficient. The program would be authorized at \n$100 million per year, for 5 years.\n  For too long, we have asked Americans to put up with an energy supply \nthat is unstable and flat out dangerous. The path to energy security, a \npath that is being cut in the Senate as we speak, will lead to \nstability and lower prices at the pump. In the meantime, this is a \ncommonsense policy to aid our small business and small farm owners in \nthe short term, so that they can continue to do what they do best, grow \nthe American economy.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1631\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

ELIGIBILITY.\n\n       A small business or small farm is eligible for a grant \n     under this Act if--\n        (a) the average gross receipts of the small business or \n     small farm for the 3 preceding taxable years does not exceed \n     $5,000,000; or\n       (b) the small business or small farm employed an average of \n     more than 1 and fewer than 50 qualified employees on business \n     days during the preceding taxable year.\n\n     SEC. 6. DEFINED TERM.\n\n       In this Act, the term ``aggregate gross assets'' has the \n     meaning given such term in section 1202(d)(2) of the Internal \n     Revenue Code of 1986.\n\n     SEC. 7. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       There are authorized to be appropriated to the Department \n     of Commerce $100,000,000 for each of the fiscal years 2008 \n     through 2012 to carry out this Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE:\n  S. 1632. A bill to ensure that vessels of the United States conveyed \nto eligible recipients for educational, cultural, historical, \ncharitable, recreational, or other public purposes are maintained and \nutilized for the purposes for which they were conveyed; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Vessel \nConveyance Act, a bill which would prevent inappropriate transfers of \nsurplus United States vessels to nongovernmental organizations.\n  It has recently come to my attention that two decommissioned U.S. \nCoast Guard ships that had been conveyed in legislation to a certain \ncharitable organization are no longer being used for the purpose \nexplicitly stated by law. In fact, the ships are no longer in the \norganization's possession. Unaware of the costs affiliated with \nmaintenance of the ships, the recipient found itself unable to afford \nthe upkeep. Against the spirit, if not the letter, of the law, the \ncharity sold first one, and then the second ship, and pocketed the \nproceeds, which totaled $415,000.\n  Though the U.S. General Services Administration has a process in \nplace for disposal of surplus vessels, I understand the value of \ndedicated vessel conveyances under certain circumstances. But we must \nrecognize that these assets are the property of the American people, \nand they represent a significant investment of public funds. When \nCongress acts to convey such valuable items to a private entity, it \nalso conveys the responsibility to use the vessel for a specific \npurpose. In cases where that responsibility has not been carried out, \nwe must be able to seek recourse, and this bill would provide that \ntool.\n\n[[Page S7750]]\n\n  Specifically, this legislation would expressly prohibit the recipient \nof a conveyed vessel from either selling it, or using it for commercial \npurposes. It would require the Administrator of the GSA to monitor \nconveyed vessels the same way he monitors ships dispersed under the \nstandard GSA process to ensure that they are being used appropriately, \nand it gives her the power to reclaim the ship if she determines that \nthose conditions have been violated. The bill would also eliminate the \npossibility of transfer to an organization lacking sufficient financial \nstability to maintain a given vessel. Finally, it includes civil \nenforcement provisions making recipients liable for fines of up to \n$10,000 per day that they are in violation of their conveyance \nagreement.\n  On the rare occasions when Congress determines that a certain asset \nis uniquely suited to assist a worthy and capable organization, I do \nnot oppose a legislative conveyance. But I will not allow any \norganization to fleece the American taxpayers by biting the hand that \nhas provided such a generous gift. I am pleased to introduce this bill \ntoday, and I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no ojection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1632\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

CONVEYANCE OF UNITED STATES VESSELS FOR PUBLIC \n                   PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) In General.--The conveyance of a United States \n     Government vessel to an eligible entity for use as an \n     educational, cultural, historical, charitable, or \n     recreational or other public purpose shall be made subject to \n     any conditions, including the reservation of such rights on \n     behalf of the United States, as the Secretary considers \n     necessary to ensure that the vessel will be maintained and \n     used in accordance with the purposes for which it was \n     conveyed, including conditions necessary to ensure that \n     unless approved by the Secretary--\n       (1) the eligible entity to which the vessel is conveyed may \n     not sell, convey, assign, exchange, or encumber the vessel, \n     any part thereof, or any associated historic artifact \n     conveyed to the eligible entity in conjunction with the \n     vessel; and\n       (2) the eligible entity to which the vessel is conveyed may \n     not conduct any commercial activities at the vessel, any part \n     thereof, or in connection with any associated historic \n     artifact conveyed to the eligible entity in conjunction with \n     the vessel, in any manner.\n       (b) Reversion.--In addition to any term or condition \n     established pursuant to this section, the conveyance of a \n     United States Government vessel shall include a condition \n     that the vessel, or any associated historic artifact conveyed \n     to the eligible entity in conjunction with the vessel, at the \n     option of the Secretary, shall revert to the United States \n     and be placed under the administrative control of the \n     Administrator if, without approval of the Secretary--\n       (1) the vessel, any part thereof, or any associated \n     historic artifact ceases to be available for the educational, \n     cultural, historical, charitable, or recreational or other \n     public purpose for which it was conveyed under reasonable \n     conditions which shall be set forth in the eligible entity's \n     application;\n       (2) the vessel or any part thereof ceases to be maintained \n     in a manner consistent with the commitments made by the \n     eligible entity to which it was conveyed;\n       (3) the eligible entity to which the vessel is conveyed, \n     sells, conveys, assigns, exchanges, or encumbers the vessel, \n     any part thereof, or any associated historic artifact; or\n       (4) the eligible entity to which the vessel is conveyed, \n     conducts any commercial activities at the vessel, any part \n     thereof, or in conjunction with any associated historic \n     artifact.\n       (c) Agreement Required.--Except as may be otherwise \n     explicitly provided by statute, a United States Government \n     vessel may not be conveyed to an entity unless that entity \n     agrees to comply with any terms or conditions imposed on the \n     conveyance under this section.\n       (d) Records and Monitoring.--\n       (1) Compilation and transfer.--The Secretary shall provide \n     a written or electronic record for each vessel conveyed \n     pursuant to the Secretary's authority, including the vessel \n     registration, the application for conveyance, the terms and \n     conditions of conveyance, and any other documents associated \n     with the conveyance, and any post-conveyance correspondence \n     or other documentation, to the Administrator.\n       (2) Monitoring.--For a period not less than 5 years after \n     the date of conveyance the Administrator shall monitor the \n     eligible entity's use of the vessel conveyed to ensure that \n     the vessel is being used in accordance with the purpose for \n     which it was conveyed. The Administrator shall create a \n     written or electronic record of such monitoring activities \n     and their findings.\n       (3) Maintenance.--The Administrator shall maintain vessel \n     conveyance records provided under paragraph (1), and \n     monitoring records created under paragraph (2), on each \n     vessel conveyed until such time as the vessel is destroyed, \n     scuttled, recycled, or otherwise disposed of.

WORKING GROUP ON CONVEYANCE OF UNITED STATES VESSELS.\n\n       Within 180 days after the date of enactment of this Act, \n     the Secretary of Transportation shall convene a working \n     group, composed of representatives from the Maritime \n     Administration, the Coast Guard, and the United States Navy \n     to review and to make recommendations on a common set of \n     conditions for the conveyance of vessels of the United States \n     to eligible entities (as defined in section 2(d)(2)). The \n     Secretary may request the participation of senior \n     representatives of any other Federal department or agency, as \n     appropriate.\n\n     SEC. 4. CIVIL ENFORCEMENT OF CONVEYANCE CONDITIONS.\n\n       (a) Civil Administrative Penalties.--\n       (1) Any eligible entity found by the Secretary, after \n     notice and opportunity for a hearing in accordance with \n     section 554 of title 5, United States Code, to have failed to \n     comply with the terms and conditions under which a vessel was \n     conveyed to it shall be liable to the United States for a \n     civil penalty. The amount of the civil penalty under this \n     paragraph shall not exceed $10,000 for each violation. Each \n     day of a continuing violation shall constitute a separate \n     violation.\n       (2) Compromise or other action by the secretary.--The \n     Secretary may compromise, modify, or remit, with or without \n     conditions, any civil administrative penalty imposed under \n     this section that has not been referred to the Attorney \n     General for further enforcement action.\n       (b) Hearing.--For the purposes of conducting any \n     investigation or hearing under this section, the Secretary \n     may issue subpoenas for the attendance and testimony of \n     witnesses and the production of relevant papers, books, and \n     documents, and may administer oaths. Witnesses summoned shall \n     be paid the same fees and mileage that are paid to witnesses \n     in the courts of the United States. In case of contempt or \n     refusal to obey a subpoena served upon any person pursuant to \n     this subsection, the district court of the United States for \n     any district in which such person is found, resides, or \n     transacts business, upon application by the United States and \n     after notice to such person, shall have jurisdiction to issue \n     an order requiring such person to appear and give testimony \n     before the Secretary or to appear and produce documents \n     before the Secretary, or both, and any failure to obey such \n     order of the court may be punished by such court as a \n     contempt thereof. Nothing in this Act shall be construed to \n     grant jurisdiction to a district court to entertain an \n     application for an order to enforce a subpoena issued by the \n     Secretary of Commerce to the Federal Government or any entity \n     thereof.\n       (c) Jurisdiction.--The United States district courts shall \n     have original jurisdiction of any action under this section \n     arising out of or in connection with the operation, \n     maintenance, or disposition of a conveyed vessel, and \n     proceedings with respect to any such action may be instituted \n     in the judicial district in which any defendant resides or \n     may be found. For the purpose of this section, American Samoa \n     shall be included within the judicial district of the \n     District Court of the United States for the District of \n     Hawaii.\n       (d) Collection.--If an eligible entity fails to pay an \n     assessment of a civil penalty after it has become a final and \n     unappealable order, or after the appropriate court has \n     entered final judgment in favor of the Secretary, the matter \n     may be referred to the Attorney General, who may recover the \n     amount (plus interest at currently prevailing rates from the \n     date of the final order). In such action the validity, \n     amount, and appropriateness of the final order imposing the \n     civil penalty shall not be subject to review. Any eligible \n     entity that fails to pay, on a timely basis, the amount of an \n     assessment of a civil penalty shall be required to pay, in \n     addition to such amount and interest, attorney's fees and \n     costs for collection proceedings and a quarterly nonpayment \n     penalty for each quarter during which such failure to pay \n     persists. Such nonpayment penalty shall be in an amount equal \n     to 20 percent of the aggregate amount of such the entity's \n     penalties and nonpayment penalties which are unpaid as of the \n     beginning of such quarter.\n       (e) Nationwide Service of Process.--In any action by the \n     United States under this Act, process may be served in any \n     district where the defendant is found, resides, transacts \n     business or has appointed an agent for the service of \n     process, and for civil cases may also be served in a place \n     not within the United States in accordance with Rule 4 of the \n     Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n\n[[Page S7751]]\n\n     SEC. 5.

Res. 16. A joint resolution approving the renewal of import \nrestrictions contained in the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act of \n2003; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, earlier this year, while the Senate was \nresuming its business in a new Congress, two dozen families on the \nother side of the world were fleeing their homes. Ninety-four men and \nwomen, some young some old, grabbed whatever belongings they could \ncarry and headed north along the eastern Burmese border to escape the \ntorment of a brutal regime.\n  Human rights officials tell us what happened next. Late last month, \nthese families were forced to move again. And as I stand here today, \nthey are cramped inside the homes of other refugees. We are looking \nforward to summer vacations. They are looking ahead at the bitter work \nof building new homes in the rain, with their hands, in a remote corner \nof a stark, isolated wasteland the world seems to have forgotten.\n  Mr. President, I am here to report that the United States has not \nforgotten. We will continue to shine a light on the oppressive and \nillegitimate military regime that drove these families from their \nhomes. And I will rise every year, as I do today, with my good friend \nthe senior Senator from California, to reintroduce a bill that extends \nfor another year a ban on imports from Burma.\n  Republicans and Democrats work together proudly on some things in the \nSenate. The Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act is one of them. I am \npleased to say that even though the control of Congress has changed, \nits commitment to the people of Burma has not. Senator Feinstein and I \nare joined this year by 57 cosponsors, more than last year and the year \nbefore that. On the Republican side, for example, the people of Burma \nhave no better friend than the senior Senator from Arizona, Mr. McCain.\n  Support for the people of Burma is growing on Capitol Hill. Senator \nFeinstein and the senior Senator from Texas recently formed the Women's \nCaucus on Burma. The First Lady attended its first meeting last month, \nadding her voice to a growing chorus of those opposed to the Burmese \nregime. The voices are not just coming from Washington. But the words \nand actions of Washington are beginning to cause others to take note of \nthis dire situation.\n  Last year, the United Nations Security Council agreed for the first \ntime to put Burma on its agenda. In January, a U.N. Security Council \nresolution that enjoyed the support of a majority of the Council's \nmember nations was unfortunately blocked by Russian and Chinese vetoes. \nWe remain encouraged by the fact that nine countries agreed to hold the \nregime accountable. We urge Russia and China to reconsider their \nstance.\n  We know others are beginning to notice Burma because 3 years ago the \nAssociation of Southeast Asian nations called the sufferings in Burma \n``an internal matter.'' Yet today ASEAN recognizes that the ``Burma \nproblem'' is its problem, too.\n  Southeast Asian leaders have spoken out more frequently and \nforcefully over the last year in calling for democratic reforms. They \njoin the United States and other freedom-loving people who have \ndemanded for years that the military thugs who control Burma loosen \ntheir grip.\n  We know others are starting taking notice because earlier this year \nthe United Nations Secretary General, Ban ki-Moon, urged the release of \nBurma's roughly 1,300 political prisoners, including the world's only \nimprisoned Nobel Laureate, Aung San Suu Kyi.\n  And we know others are starting to take notice because that effort \nwas followed by a letter signed by 59 former heads of state.\n  The Burmese military regime, the State Peace and Development Council, \nis on notice: the wider international community, including its \nneighbors, are increasingly aware and increasingly outraged by its \nbehavior.\n  Mr. President, The purpose of sanctions is to change behavior. And \nthe changes we seek, in partnership with the Burmese people, are these: \nconcrete, irreversible steps toward reconciliation and democratization \nthat include the full, unfettered participation of the National League \nfor Democracy and ethnic minorities; ending attacks on ethnic \nminorities; and the immediate, unconditional release of all prisoners \nof conscience, including Suu Kyi. The regime also needs to know that a \nsham constitutional process and token prisoner releases will not be \nregarded by anyone as progress toward these goals.\n  The argument against sanctions--that they are most harmful to those \nthey are meant to help--is well known. But it does not apply to Burma. \nIt has long been the policy of the NLD, the winner of Burma's last \ndemocratic election, to seek reform through sanctions against the \ncurrent regime.\n  And for good reason. Burma's military junta has maintained an iron \ngrip on every aspect of the country's economy. Its leaders flaunt and \nsquander whatever wealth they can squeeze from Burmese workers, leaving \nthe country's economy in ruins--but leaving enough aside for its \ncurrent leader, GEN Than Shwe, to impulsively relocate the Burmese \ncapital from Rangoon at a cost of millions, or to throw a wedding for \nhis daughter that is reported to have cost millions more.\n  The military junta has complete control over the flow of goods and \nmoney in and out of Burma. And every dollar that is spent on Burmese \nproducts is money spent on financing the regime. It is the SPDC, not \nthe allies of the Burmese people, who are responsible for Burma's \neconomic woes.\n  As diplomatic pressure intensifies, as the rest of the international \ncommunity undertakes the kind of change we have seen in ASEAN, the \nsupporters of the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act are confident this \nregime will be forced to change its ways.\n  The situation is urgent. Burma's military regime has become \nincreasingly reckless. And the humanitarian situation is grave and \ndeteriorating: the junta has intensified its abuse of minority groups \nthrough rape and forced labor. It continues to harass and detain a new \ngeneration of peaceful activists, activists like a young woman named Su \nSu Nway, who has inspired the world with her resolute defiance of \nforced labor practices.\n  In standing up to the Burmese regime, Su Su Nway drew inspiration \nfrom Suu Kyi. Now she is inspiring another generation of Burmese \nactivists who are willing to defend their rights and, despite the \ndanger to themselves, refuse to remain silent in the face of the abuses \nthey see.\n  According to the Los Angeles Times, Su Su Nway was asked by a radio \nreporter last year whether she feared imprisonment. Her simple but \neloquent response should give us hope in the determination of this new \ngeneration of\n\n[[Page S7752]]\n\nactivists. ``I will stand for the truth,'' she said.\n  The crimes of the Burmese government are well documented. Here is \nwhat we know: nearly 70,000 children have been taken from their homes \nand forcibly conscripted--that's more children than live in all of \nLexington, the second-largest city in my State.\n  Forced labor is a daily threat in the southeastern Karen State, where \nmilitary personnel force villagers to build roads and shelters, without \nfood or pay, and to leave their homes and farms to do the work. Some \nare used as human shields against democratic insurgents.\n  These are the lucky ones. Others are forced to walk ahead of military \nconvoys to act as human minesweepers. If there is a landmine, they blow \nup. It is from diabolical thugs like these that desperate, exhausted \nfamilies are fleeing their homes.\n  Drugs and disease are spreading across Burma's borders along with its \npeople, and it is no secret why. According to the World Health \nOrganization, Burma is home to one of the worst AIDS epidemics in \nSoutheast Asia. Yet it spent just $137,000 last year on the care and \ntreatment of people with HIV/AIDS, even as it spends countless millions \non Chinese and Russian tanks and jets.\n  You can tell a lot about a man from the company he keeps. We could \nsay the same about governments. In late April, Burma established \ndiplomatic relations with the government of North Korea for the first \ntime in two decades. It was reported last month that a North Korean \ncargo ship docked in Burma. This is a disturbing development to those \nof us on the outside looking in. It can only be discouraging to \ndemocratic reformers inside Burma.\n  News of North Korea's presence on the Burmese coast came shortly \nafter another troubling piece of news. In early April, Burma's second \nin command led a delegation on the nation's first-ever high-level trip \nto Russia. And last month, the Burmese government announced an \nagreement with Russia to build a nuclear research reactor in Burma.\n  This should send a chill up the spine of every one of us. Even \npeaceful nations that lack the proper legal and regulatory framework \nshould not be allowed to have a nuclear program. Those that torture and \nabuse their own people and consort with rogue regimes such as North \nKorea should not be allowed to even contemplate it.\n  And this is how this rogue regime has held onto its power: Internal \nefforts at reform are violently stamped out, as they were when \nthousands of peaceful prodemocracy protesters were slaughtered in 1988. \nIn response to a national election in 1990, in which Suu Kyi's party, \nthe NLD, won 80 percent of the seats in a new parliament, the regime \nsimply threw out the results.\n  By refusing to accept imports from a regime that terrorizes people \nlike Suu Kyi, Su Su Nway, and so many others, we are standing up and \nfacing these tyrants at our own borders and turning them back--until \nthey release these prisoners and begin the process of democratization \nand reconciliation. Every dollar we keep out of the hands of this junta \nis one less dollar it can use to fund the conscription of children, its \nnuclear program, and the war it has waged against its own people for \nnearly two decades.\n  Later this month, Suu Kyi will celebrate her 62nd birthday, alone. I \nurge my colleagues to stand with her as that day approaches. By denying \nsupport for those who imprison her, we will pressure them to change.\n  There are fresh signs that these sanctions have begun to do their \nwork. But we need to keep the pressure on. So I ask my colleagues to \njoin me in supporting the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the joint \nresolution be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                              S.J. Res. 16\n\n       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the \n     United States of America in Congress assembled, That Congress \n     approves the renewal of the import restrictions contained in \n     section 3(a)(1) of the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act of \n     2003.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today with Senator McConnell \nand 54 of our colleagues to introduce a joint resolution renewing the \nban on all imports from Burma for another year.\n  Simply put, the ruling State Peace and Development Council--SPDC--has \nnot taken the necessary actions to warrant a lifting of the sanctions \nat this time.\n  Indeed, Burma represents one of the most critical human rights \nsituations in the world today.\n  Aung San Suu Kyi, Nobel Peace Prize recipient and leader of the \nNational League for Democracy, is confined to her home by orders of the \nmilitary junta.\n  She has spent the better part of the past 17 years imprisoned or \nunder house arrest and on May 25, 2003 her sentence was extended for \nanother year.\n  There is no indication that the regime will free her anytime soon.\n  This is simply unacceptable. She should be released immediately and \nunconditionally and the regime should begin real and substantive \nnational reconciliation talks with Suu Kyi's National League for \nDemocracy--NLD.\n  The NLD, the winning party in Burma's last free elections in 1990 \nwith 82 percent of the seats in parliament, is forbidden from \nparticipating in public life. For over 20 years, the military junta has \nbeen unwilling to take meaningful steps towards political \nreconciliation.\n  And let us not forget: 4 years ago government sponsored thugs \nattempted to assassinate Suu Kyi and other members of the National \nLeague for Democracy by attacking her motorcade in northern Burma.\n  Indeed, the human rights situation in Burma is deplorable and demands \na clear, unified response from the international community: 1,300 \npolitical prisoners are still in jail; according to the U.N. Special \nRapporteur, over 3,000 villages have been destroyed by the military \njunta; 70,000 child soldiers have been forcibly recruited; over 500,000 \npeople are internally displaced in Burma today, and over 1 million \npeople have fled Burma over the past two decades, destabilizing Burma's \nneighbors. Also, the practice of rape as a form of repression has been \nsanctioned by the Burmese military; use of forced labor is widespread; \nhuman trafficking is rampant; Burma is the world's second-largest opium \nproducer after Afghanistan and increasingly a source of trafficking of \nsynthetic narcotics.\n  Some may argue that while the human rights situation is indeed \ndeplorable, sanctions are not the proper solution and we should try a \nnew course.\n  I agree that sanctions are not a panacea for every foreign policy \nconcern. I am disappointed that Aung San Suu Kyi remains under house \narrest and we still have not realized our goal of a free and democratic \nBurma.\n  Yet now is not the time to lift the import ban on Burma. First, the \nmilitary junta has not fulfilled any of the obligations of the \n``Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act of 2003'' that would allow a \nlifting of the ban. It has not made ``substantial and measurable \nprogress'' towards: ending violations of internationally recognized \nhuman rights; releasing all political prisoners; allowing freedom of \nspeech and press; allowing freedom of association; permitting the \npeaceful exercise of religion and; bringing to a conclusion an \nagreement between the SPDC and the National League for Democracy and \nBurma's ethnic nationalities on the restoration of a democratic \ngovernment.\n  If we were to allow the import ban to expire, we would reward the \nmilitary junta for its inaction, its failure to fulfill these basic \nobligations, and its continued brutal crackdown on the human rights of \nthe citizens of Burma.\n  We simply cannot afford to send that message to those who bravely \nstand up to the SPDC and reject their abuses.\n  I remind my colleagues that we are not voting to enact the import ban \nin perpetuity.\n  We are renewing it for one more year and we will have another \nopportunity to review its effectiveness next year.\n  Second, Aung San Suu Kyi and the democratic opposition continue to \nsupport the import ban.\n  They recognize that it is not directed at the people of Burma, but at \nthe military junta that dominates economic and political activity in \ntheir country and denies them their rights.\n\n[[Page S7753]]\n\n  Third, we are seeing progress in the international community in \nputting additional pressure on Burma.\n  In a recent letter addressed to the State Peace and Development \nCouncil, a distinguished group of 59 former heads of state--including \nformer Filipino president Corazon Aquino, former Czech president Vaclav \nHavel, former British prime minister John Major and former Presidents \nBill Clinton, Jimmy Carter, and George H.W. Bush--called for the regime \nto release Aung San Suu Kyi.\n  They correctly noted that ``Aung San Suu Kyi is not calling for \nrevolution in Burma, but rather peaceful, nonviolent dialogue between \nthe military, National League for Democracy, and Burma's ethnic \ngroups.''\n  The calls for Suu Kyi's release are also coming from Burma's \nneighbors.\n  The Association of Southeast Asian Nations--ASEAN--now recognizes \nthat Burma's actions are not an ``internal matter'' but a significant \nthreat to peace and stability in the region.\n  At a meeting of senior diplomats last month, ASEAN made a clear call \nfor Aung San Suu Kyi's release.\n  As Philippine foreign under secretary Erlinda Basilio said: ``It's a \nconsensus that we want to see her early release.''\n  An editorial in the Jakarta Post recently commented that the regime's \nrefusal to heed these calls ``shows its complete disregard for the \ngrowing values of ASEAN.'' That is from the Jakarta Post, May 29, 2007.\n  We are also seeing progress at the United Nations. In January, for \nthe first time, the United Nations debated a binding, non-punitive \nresolution on Burma.\n  Among other things that resolution called on the military junta:\n\n     . . . to take concrete steps to allow full freedom of \n     expression, association, and movement by unconditionally \n     releasing Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and all political prisoners, \n     lifting all constraints on all political leaders and \n     citizens, and allowing the National League for Democracy \n     (NLD) and other political parties to operate freely.\n\n  While nine countries voted in favor of the resolution, I am extremely \ndisappointed that China and Russia exercised their veto.\n  A report by former Czech President Vaclav Havel and retired \narchbishop Desmond Tutu of South Africa--``Threat to Peace: A Call for \nthe U.N. Security Council to Act on Burma''--confirms the need for U.N. \nintervention. It details how the situation in Burma fulfills each of \nthe criteria used for past intervention by the Security Council: \noverthrow of an elected government; armed conflicts with ethnic \nminorities; widespread human rights violations; outflow of refugees--\nover 700,000; and drug production and trafficking and the spread of \nHIV/AIDS.\n  I firmly believe that momentum for United Nations Security Council \naction is on our side and I am confident that body will revisit this \nresolution again this year.\n  I am also hopeful that the new United Nations Secretary General Ban \nKi-moon will personally get involved in putting pressure on the \nmilitary junta to respect the wishes of the people of Burma and the \ninternational community by releasing Aung San Suu Kyi and restoring \ndemocratic government.\n  In a letter signed by myself, Senator McConnell and a bipartisan \ngroup of 43 other U.S. Senators we wrote:\n\n       We urge you to personally intervene with the regime on a \n     regular basis to establish concrete benchmarks and timetables \n     for democratic progress in Burma. We also urge you to hold \n     the Burmese government accountable for achieving those goals. \n     The Burmese people deserve more than talk--they deserve \n     action.\n\n  We can demonstrate to the Secretary General that we too are committed \nto action by passing this joint resolution promptly.\n  In conclusion, let me say that I believe the women of the U.S. Senate \nhave a special obligation to speak out on this issue. Last month we \ncame together to form the United States Senate Women's Caucus on Burma \nand hold our inaugural event with First Lady Laura Bush. I am proud to \ncochair that caucus with my friend and colleague from Texas, Senator \nKay Bailey Hutchison. Together we expressed our solidarity with Aung \nSan Suu Kyi and called for her immediate and unconditional release so \nthat a peaceful transition to a democratic government may begin.\n  It is my great hope that one day the United States Senate Women's \nCaucus on Burma will welcome Aung San Suu Kyi to Washington, DC, as the \nwoman who led her nation from repression to freedom.\n  Archbishop Desmond Tutu has rightly said, ``As long as [Suu Kyi] \nremains under house arrest, not one of us is truly free.''\n  Today, I urge the State Peace and Development Council to release Aung \nSan Suu Kyi immediately and unconditionally.\n  I urge the United Nations Security Council to pass a binding \nresolution on Burma.\n  And I urge the U.S. Senate to pass this joint resolution to renew the \nimport ban on Burma for another year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/14/senate-section/article/S7753-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7753]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 235--DESIGNATING JULY 1, 2007, AS ``NATIONAL BOATING \n                                 DAY''\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE (for himself and Mr. Vitter) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S.

MICKS FEDERAL FLAG CODE AMENDMENT ACT OF 2007\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 191, \nH.R. 692.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 692) to amend title 4, United States Code, to \n     authorize the Governor of a State, territory, or possession \n     of the United States to order that the National flag be flown \n     at half-staff in that State, territory, or possession in the \n     event of the death of a member of the Armed Forces from that \n     State, territory, or possession who dies while serving on \n     active duty.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, it is critically important that each time a \nsoldier, sailor, airman, or marine is lost in battle, their families, \nfriends, and communities are shown the respect and support of a \ngrateful nation. Tragically, Michigan has lost more than 135 heroes in \nthe wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. One of the most powerful ways we \nhonor those who have made the ultimate sacrifice for our country is to \nfly the flag they fought under at half-staff.\n  On many occasions during the course of the wars in Iraq and \nAfghanistan, Governors around the country have issued proclamations for \nState agencies and residents to lower our Nation's flag to honor fallen \nservicemembers from their States. Many Federal agencies in those States \ncomply with such proclamations, but some have not. To those mourning \nthe death of a loved one, this inaction can be hurtful and interpreted \nas indifference to their loss. I know my colleagues will agree that \nthis is certainly not the message our Government wants to send to the \nfamilies of our men and women in uniform.\n  This legislation would prevent this situation by giving Governors the \nexplicit authority to order our Nation's flag lowered to half-staff \nwhen a member of the Armed Forces from their State dies while serving \non active duty. It would also require federal agencies in that State to \nlower their flags consistent with a Governor's proclamation. The House \nof Representatives passed identical legislation on May 15. I am pleased \nthat my colleagues support this legislation so that all levels of our \nGovernment will send a clear and consistent message when members of our \nmilitary are killed in the course of their service to our country.\n  One of my greatest honors as the chairman of the Senate Armed \nServices Committee is to spend time with our troops, and they are as \ncourageous, honorable, and capable a fighting force as the world has \never known. These men and women have made a commitment to protect our \nNation. We need to make an equally strong commitment to honor them when \nthey make the ultimate sacrifice for our country. We owe our fallen \nsoldiers, their families, and their communities a unified showing of \nrespect.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe bill be read three times, passed, and the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table; that any statements relating thereto be printed in \nthe Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 692) was ordered to a third reading, was read the \nthird time, and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/14/senate-section/article/S7777-2", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7777]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ORDERS FOR FRIDAY, JUNE 15, 2007\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida.
