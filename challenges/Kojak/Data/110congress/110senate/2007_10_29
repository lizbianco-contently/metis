Madam President, last night, temperatures fell in many \nparts of the east coast and, frankly, even the west coast has been \ngetting cold. It was cold in Searchlight. I talked to my brother this \nmorning and he had to start his fire. Searchlight is much colder than \nLas Vegas. In parts of northern Nevada, it has been very cold.\n  All over America, and this morning in the DC area, for the first time \nthis year, people had to reach into their closets for scarves, heavier \nsuits, and even coats for the first time this season. In other parts of \nthe country, there have been colder days earlier. In DC, this is the \nfirst one we have gotten.\n  In Las Vegas, even though it still reaches the high 80s during the \nday this time of year, even now you can feel an overnight chill in the \nair. There are parts of Nevada that are really cold. We have had \nfreezing weather in Ely and Elko already this year.\n  As the temperature falls all over the country, we begin to think \nabout the cost of heating our homes for the winter. That cost has risen \nsteadily during the 7 years of the Bush administration, and we have \nbecome even more dependent on fossil fuel.\n  This morning, as our thoughts turned toward the cold months ahead, \nthe price of oil rose to an all-time record of $93 a barrel. If we \ndon't turn the tide by\n\n[[Page S13498]]\n\nreducing our dependence on oil and foreign energy sources, every \nAmerican will be forced to pay more and more to heat our homes and fill \nour gas tanks.\n\n  I went over to my office in the Hart building today. I don't get over \nthere as much as I would like, but I went around and talked to \neverybody. I have a wonderful employee who has been with me for many \nyears. Her name is Carrie. She lives in Mechanicsville, MD. When the \nrain hit, it took her 3 hours to get to work and 2\\1/2\\ hours to get \nhome. On a normal day, it takes an hour and a half. She sold her \nvehicle she loved so much, which was a Chevrolet Tahoe. It would cost \nher $40 every 2 days for gasoline. She bought a smaller car, and her \ncost for fuel has dropped significantly. Not just Carrie, but everybody \nin the country is more aware of the cost of energy. Whether it is for \ntheir vehicles or whether it is for their homes, the cost of oil is \nsignificant.\n  We are addicted to oil. That is not just me saying that. Even \nPresident Bush said it--even though I think he hasn't done anything \nabout it. He acknowledged we are addicted to oil. I have said on the \nfloor time and again, and I will say it again today: Today in America, \nwe will burn 21 million barrels of oil. Tomorrow, we will use the same; \nthe day after, the same. It is not going down, it is going up. We use \n21 million barrels of oil a day. That is almost 3 gallons for every \nman, woman, and child in our country every day. That is enough oil, \nevery day, to fill a swimming pool, or an oil pool, 10 feet deep, the \nlength and width of 200 football fields--every day. How does the Earth \nhave that much oil? But it does.\n  Day after day, we consume oil at twice the rate of any other \nindustrialized nation. Our consumption only continues to go up. This \noil addiction has become a three-pronged crisis: It does threaten our \neconomy, no question about that. Look what it has done to our \nenvironment. It is threatening our national security.\n  A 10-percent increase in oil prices costs an estimated 150,000 \nAmericans jobs and more than $100 billion of American dollars.\n  Since 2001, oil prices have risen by more than 230 percent. So \nclearly these impacts are real and harmful to working families.\n  Those hard-working, hard-earned American dollars are coming out of \nthe pockets of families, and where is it going? Overseas. Last year, \nAmericans sent almost $300 billion to foreign countries to pay for \nimported oil. I am not stretching the truth to say that many of those \ndollars went to governments that don't have our foreign policy \ninterests at heart.\n  Meanwhile, the world's leading scientists have reached a consensus \nthat the global warming crisis is real, grave, and it is growing. The \nNobel Peace Prize was offered this year to, of course, Al Gore and the \nU.N. study group, which shared it with him, dealing with global \nwarming.\n  Global warming is here. For people to write, as some do--people who \nare so determined to say there is no global warming, that is a figment \nof their imagination. It is here. Why? Because of our gluttony for oil.\n  Earlier this year, the House and Senate both passed a landmark, \ncomprehensive piece of energy legislation to tackle each prong of the \nenergy crisis. If we can finalize this and help lower prices by \nreducing our dependence upon oil, we would be developing renewable fuel \nalternatives and punishing price gougers and begin to turn the tide of \nglobal warming.\n  The legislation we passed was bipartisan. It wasn't just a Democratic \nbill. We had Republican help. I am happy to see the Presiding Officer \nhere today because no one in recent years has done more to focus on the \nproblems with energy than the Senator from Washington, Senator \nCantwell. Because of the strength and conviction of the Senator from \nWashington, who was attacked personally in her last election campaign, \nbecause she was on the right side of the issue, it didn't affect her; \nin fact, it probably helped her.\n  We have to turn the tide of global warming. Remember, we use 21 \nmillion barrels of oil a day. By increasing our CAFE standards by 2020, \nwe can save well over a million barrels a day, and some say even more.\n  In our legislation, we require an additional savings of 10 million \nbarrels a day, on average, by 2030. We set an ambitious schedule to \nreplace about one-fifth of our petroleum consumption with renewable \nfuels.\n  At the Nevada Test Site, where we set off approximately a thousand \nnuclear devices--most of them underground and a few above ground--you \ncould cover that Nevada Test Site with solar panels today, with today's \ntechnology, and supply enough electricity for the whole country. It can \nbe done. It is not being done because we have the utilities which, in \nmost every place in the country, are regulated monopolies. They don't \nwant to do it because it is easier to use fossil fuel. Natural gas is \nexpensive, so now we have a mad rush to coal.\n  I so appreciate that Kansas and Oklahoma, in the last couple of \nweeks, said: No coal. This is the area we all need to look to, the \nStates of Kansas and Oklahoma. We should look to them as role models \nbecause they have done the right thing.\n  We also need more cooperation from energy companies. The utilities \naren't going to do it. Last year, oil companies brought in almost $120 \nbillion in profits. Yet they are doing nothing to help us. The \nautomobile industry is doing nothing to help us. Certainly, the Bush-\nCheney administration--the most energy-dependent administration in \nhistory--nobody has been closer to the oil industry than this \nadministration. They both made their fortunes in oil.\n  Instead, though, lobbyists for the oil, auto, and coal industries are \ntrying their best to weaken our bill or stop its progress. In Nevada, I \ncame out against the coal-fired plants they are pushing there. They are \nspending millions of dollars in the small State of Nevada to try to \nshow I am wrong by opposing coal-fired plants, saying: We want to build \na bridge to alternative energy. Let us build a few coal-fired plants \nand then we will do it.\n  That is a lost cause. They are doing that because it is the cheapest \nway to do it. They could build solar plants, wind, and geothermal for \nno more than what it cost to build these coal-fired plants. It would be \nas many construction jobs, but it would be something different. If it \nhasn't been done before, they don't want to do it. Imagine where we \nwould be today if they agreed to join us in this fight. We know the \nadministration simply had secret meetings and made sweetheart deals \nwith the oil companies, and they refused to let the press know about \nit. The press went to court, and the court upheld the secrecy of the \nWhite House.\n  The time to stand in the way of progress should be long past. Since \nwe passed the Energy bill on a bipartisan basis, Senate Republicans \nhave stopped us from going to conference. We cannot stop. We need to \ncontinue to work with the House to pass a bill, despite these \nchallenges. I hope and believe Democrats and Republicans will find \ncommon ground and set a new course that will keep us safe for our \neconomy and protect our planet.\n  In the Senate, our bill had something the House bill didn't. It \nraises CAFE standards, a renewable portfolio. It seems we ought to be \nable to marry the two and agree to the demand of the American people.\n  Today's record oil prices alone should be enough to convince us we \nmust act quickly to complete the Energy bill and pass it into law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/29/senate-section/article/S13498-1", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13498]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I have been waiting to speak to the \nSenate to place in the Record the case that we have to make to take \naction to ease the impact of unfettered global\n\n[[Page S13499]]\n\nwarming. I think most Americans know by now--at least those who follow \nenvironmental issues--that on our committee, we have Senator Inhofe, \nwho is the former chairman, in a very different place than the current \nchairman, myself. Senator Inhofe spoke for a couple of hours on this \nsubject last week, and I told him I would come down and put forward my \nthoughts. I am sure he will want to respond to what I say. That is what \nthe Senate should be. We should be able to debate. I have been looking \nforward to this debate because, frankly, there are very few isolated \nand lonely voices who keep on saying we do not have to worry about \nglobal warming. Those voices are getting fewer and fewer.\n  The reality is that a growing and diverse group of voices has \nrecognized the importance of addressing global warming.\n  Here are a few calls to action. Some might surprise you. For example, \nPresident Bush, on September 28, said:\n\n       [Y]ears from now our children are going to look back at the \n     choices we make today, at this deciding moment. . . .\n\n  He goes into it and says:\n\n        . . . it will be a moment when we turn the tide against \n     greenhouse gas emissions instead of allowing the problem to \n     grow. . . .\n\n  This is President Bush in September.\n  Again, some of these voices are surprising as we build our case for \naction in the Senate.\n  Gov. Charlie Crist, a Republican Governor from Florida, said:\n\n       We're all on the same planet. We need to work together to \n     make sure the environment is an issue at the forefront. It \n     shouldn't be a political issue. It's a global issue. It's not \n     bipartisan. It's nonpartisan.\n\n  Certainly, in my own State, Governor Schwarzenegger and the Democrats \nin the legislature have worked very closely to make sure we move \nagainst unfettered global warming.\n  ``Vatican to Become World's First Carbon-Neutral State.'' This is \nvery recent, this year:\n\n       The Vatican is installing solar panels and purchasing \n     greenhouse gas offsets to become the first carbon-neutral \n     sovereign state.\n\n  We can see that everyone is working together except for a few. It is \nunfortunate because in the Senate, a few can stop us from doing our \nwork. We already heard about some of the problems we are having getting \nthe Energy bill through. But I am very optimistic because we have had a \nbipartisan breakthrough in the Environment and Public Works Committee \nwith Senators Warner and Lieberman getting together and putting forward \na very solid bill which, if it is enacted, will be the most far-\nreaching global warming bill in the world today.\n  Earlier this year, the U.S. Climate Action Partnership, known as \nUSCAP, which includes major corporations, joined together with \nenvironmental groups to issue a call for action on global warming, \ncalling for reductions of 60 to 80 percent in greenhouse gas emissions \nby 2050. I thought I would go over some of the members of U.S. Climate \nAction Partnership because, again, there are just a few voices out \nthere saying we are putting our head in the sand, this isn't a problem. \nBut mainstream America is with the program. Let me tell my colleagues \nwho they are. I am just going to read a few: Alcoa, Boston Scientific \nCorporation, BP America, Caterpillar, Inc., Chrysler, ConocoPhillips, \nDeere, Duke Energy, DuPont, Environmental Defense, Ford Motor Company, \nGeneral Electric, General Motors, Johnson & Johnson, National Wildlife \nFederation, Natural Resources Defense Council, PepsiCo, Pew Center on \nGlobal Climate Change, PG Corporation, Shell, Siemens Corporation, \nDow Chemical Company, the Nature Conservancy, World Resources \nInstitute, and Xerox corporation.\n  We can see the diverse members of the American family from corporate \nAmerica to environmental organizations that have gotten together and \nhave urged us to cap greenhouse gas emissions and cut them. It is very \nimportant that we think about the amazing coalition that is out there \nbehind us addressing global warming. When we hear some Senators come \ndown to the floor of the Senate and say this is ridiculous, this isn't \nan issue, just remember this list of mainstream America urging us \nforward, urging us to act.\n  Why should so many industries be calling upon us to enact climate \nlegislation? Because they recognize a couple of points. One, the \nscience is strong, it is irrefutable, and a sound business future for \nAmerica lies in dealing with climate change. We cannot grow, we cannot \nmove forward if we all of a sudden turn around and our planet is under \nthreat. We cannot have a business looking out 50 years that does not \nthink about this. We have to think about our grandkids and our great-\ngrandkids, and corporate America thinks about the people who are going \nto come forward to continue the work of that corporation. They \nrecognize the threat, but they also recognize the opportunities.\n  Let's read from USCAP's call for action. It is very clear:\n\n       We believe that a national mandatory policy on climate \n     change will provide the basis for the United States to assert \n     world leadership in environmental and energy technology \n     innovation, a national characteristic for which the United \n     States has no rival. Such leadership will assure U.S. \n     competitiveness in this century and beyond.\n\n  This is a very strong call for action from Republicans, from \nDemocrats, from Independents, from corporate America, from the \nenvironmental community, and others that have joined together.\n\n  All you have to do, Madam President, is pick up a newspaper, any \nnewspaper--I don't care if it is a Republican editorial board, a \nDemocratic editorial board, or Independent--and you will see an amazing \namount of evidence as to global warming and its potential impact. I am \ngoing to go through a few recent headlines. I asked my staff--and they \ndo an amazing job for me--to follow the news and let me know what is \nbeing written, what the scientists are saying. So I am going to give \nyou just an example of some of these headlines. If we can walk away \nfrom this, then it seems to me we are being irresponsible. We have to \nlisten to them.\n  Early warning signs: ``Greenhouse Gases Fueled 2006 U.S. Heat.'' This \nis Reuters.\n\n       According to NOAA--\n\n  That is the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. That is \nthe Bush administration's NOAA--\n\n     ``the annual average U.S. temperature in 2006 was 2.1 degrees \n     Fahrenheit above the 20th century average and the ninth \n     consecutive year of above-normal U.S. temperatures'' and that \n     this was a result of ``greenhouse gas emissions--not El Nino \n     or other natural phenomena.''\n\n  This is our American Government under the President who has been very \nloath to move on global warming, warning us about these high \ntemperatures.\n  ``Scientists Report Severe Retreat of Arctic Ice.''\n\n       The Cap of floating sea ice on the Arctic Ocean, which \n     retreats under summer's warmth, this year shrank more than \n     one million square miles--or six Californias--below the \n     average minimum area reached in recent decades.\n\n  Again, these are scientists from the National Snow and Ice Data \nCenter in Boulder, CO. This is not a matter of opinion; this is fact. \nThey are measuring the ice. I was in Greenland. I saw it myself. \nSeveral of us went. It is the most awesome sight to behold, to see \nthese icebergs, the size of a coliseum, bigger than this beautiful \nSenate floor, taller than this room, floating into the ocean. Each \niceberg is an average of 9,000 years old, and they melt within 12 \nmonths from the time they get into the ocean. So let's not put our \nheads in the sand or under the water.\n  More early warning signs: ``China Blames Climate Change for Extreme \nWeather.'' This is China. China doesn't really want to move forward. \nThey have been slow to come to the table.\n\n       According to an official from Chinese Meteorological \n     Administration's Department of Forecasting Services and \n     Disaster Mitigation, ``It should be said that one of the \n     reasons for the weather extremes this year has been unusual \n     atmospheric circulation brought about by global warming.''\n\n  A lot of people around here say: Let's not do anything until the \nChinese come to the table. Now the Chinese are telling us we better \nwatch out for this global warming.\n  ``As Sea Level Rises, Disaster Predicted for Va. Wetlands.'' My \ncolleague, John Warner, was present at a very important set of hearings \nwhere we looked at the impact of global warming on his State. It says:\n\n       At least half, and perhaps as much as 80 percent, of the \n     wetlands would be covered in too much water to survive if sea \n     levels rise 1\\1/2\\ to 2 feet. The analysis was conducted by \n     Wetlands Watch, an environmental group.\n\n\n[[Page S13500]]\n\n\n  Senator Warner and his colleagues from the DC area all came to that \nhearing and were very concerned.\n  ``From Greenland to Antarctica, the world is losing its ice faster \nthan anyone thought possible.'' This was in the National Geographic.\n\n       Scientists are finding that glaciers and ice sheets are \n     surprisingly touchy. Instead of melting steadily, like an ice \n     cube on a summer day, they are prone to feedbacks, when \n     melting begets more melting and the ice shrinks \n     precipitously.\n\n  This is what is happening. You can come down on this floor and you \ncan put a blindfold over your eyes and you can put your hands over your \nears and say: I see no problem, I hear no problem. Then you are not \nreally taking in the signs.\n  ``Fires a `Consequence of Climate Change.' '' This is touching my \nheart because my State has been burning, and all of my colleagues know \nthis and all of them have been most wonderful to us--to Senator \nFeinstein and to me--about offering help and assistance. In the long \nrun, we need to do something about global warming or we are going to \nhave that horrible combination of drought, low humidity, high \ntemperatures, and terrible winds--weather extremes, Madam President, \nthat you have experienced from time to time. This is what we are going \nto see.\n\n  Greek Prime Minister Costas Kerryman said:\n\n       The weather phenomena this year favored, as never before, \n     the outbreak of destructive fires. We are already living with \n     the consequences of climate change.\n\n  This gives you an idea. There are some more. ``Climate Change \nPollution Rising--Thanks to Overwhelmed Oceans and Plants.''\n  This is the ``Scientific American.'' We are not taking articles here \nto show you where there is bias.\n\n       The world's oceans and forests are already so full of \n     CO2 that they are losing their ability to absorb \n     this climate change culprit.\n\n  This according to the Proceedings of the National Academy of \nSciences.\n  So, yes, someone is going to come to the floor and say: Oh, look at \nthis great scientist, Mr. ABC, or whatever his name, and he is \nchallenging this. Well, he is challenging the world's leading \nscientists. And I think it is very important to say there are always \npeople who will say HIV doesn't cause AIDS; there are always people who \nwill say, geez, cigarette smoking doesn't cause cancer; but thank God--\nthank God--this Government has followed the preponderance of the \nscience and we now are making progress. How sad it would be if America \nsits on the sidelines while the whole world looks to us for leadership \non global warming.\n  Here is this one.\n  ``The Future Is Drying Up.''\n\n       According to Nobel Laureate Steven Chu, diminished supplies \n     of fresh water might prove a far more serious problem than \n     slowly rising seas.\n\n  He also remarked:\n\n       ``The most optimistic climate models for the second half of \n     this century suggest that 30 to 70 percent of the snowpack \n     will disappear.''\n\n  No wonder we have people visiting our offices who are already hurting \nfrom the recreation industry in this Nation. They see what is \nhappening. They see the handwriting on the wall. We have to act.\n  Here is this quote:\n\n       There's a two-thirds chance there will be a disaster, and \n     that's in the best case scenario.\n\n  That is from a prize-winning Nobel laureate. Then this:\n  ``Study Links CO2 to Demise of Grazing Lands.'' From the \nLos Angeles Times.\n\n       Rising levels of carbon dioxide may be contributing to the \n     conversion of the world's grasslands into a landscape of \n     woody shrubs, much less useful for livestock grazing.\n\n  So this has implications for the very way of life we have here in \nAmerica.\n  ``Parks Face Climate Threat.''\n\n       A report shows how climate change could have a huge effect \n     on the Great Smokey Mountains, the Blue Ridge Parkway and \n     other national parks.\n\n  This according to a new report by--by whom?--the National Parks \nConservation Association.\n  Folks, this is mainstream thinking. Mainstream thinking. We have to \nact.\n  ``Likely Spread of Deserts to Fertile Land Requires Quick Response, \nU.N. Report Says,'' New York Times.\n\n       Enough fertile land could turn into desert within the next \n     generation to create an ``environmental crisis of global \n     proportions'' based on a new U.N. report. The report warns of \n     large-scale migrations and political instability in parts of \n     Africa and Central Asia. The report recommends national and \n     international action to address global warming.\n\n  Another call to action. And here, from the Intergovernmental Panel on \nClimate Change, which just won the Nobel Peace Prize, along with former \nVice President Al Gore:\n\n       Projected trends in climate-change-related exposures of \n     importance to human health will increase the number of people \n     suffering from death, disease and injury from heatwaves, \n     floods, storms, fires, and droughts.\n\n  So to come down here and talk about the polar bear and say the polar \nbear is fine--A, the polar bear is not fine, and we will talk about it; \nbut this isn't about the polar bear. This is about God's creation that \nis in jeopardy. We had testimony from scientists that 40 percent of the \nspecies that were created are going to be gone. Now, it is our turn to \ndo our part. That is why I have been working so closely with the \nreligious community, the evangelical community. They are concerned \nabout God's creation, and we ought to be. We talk a good game about it. \nWe talk about values. We talk about it, so let us do something to show \nwe are willing to protect this gift from God we have been given.\n  ``Why Frogs Are Dying.''\n\n       Climate change is no longer merely a matter of numbers from \n     a computer model. With startling swiftness, it is reordering \n     the natural world.\n\n  Newsweek. That is a Newsweek article.\n  We need scientific facts, not science fiction. In the past, we have \nhad science fiction writers come and testify before our committee. \nThose days are over.\n  ``Global Warming May Be Behind Increases in Insects and Disease-\nCarrying Animals,'' Newsday.\n\n       Rising global temperatures may be helping to spark a \n     population boom in insects and disease-carrying animals, \n     creating unexpected threats to human populations, a number of \n     scientific reports say.\n\n  That is not a pretty future for my new grandson, to think about being \nexposed to all these vectors that have not attacked us, but this is \nwhat lies in our future if we do nothing.\n  ``WHO--the World Health Organization--77,000 People Die Annually in \nAsia-Pacific Region From Climate Change.'' ``Pollution Cutting Life \nExpectancy in Europe.'' This was in USA Today.\n\n       According to a Report by the European Environment Agency: \n     ``Poor air and water quality, and environmental changes \n     blamed on global warming, have cut Europeans' life expectancy \n     by nearly a year, Europe's environmental agency warned.''\n\n  Well, Europe is moving forward. To be honest with you, the bills they \nare looking at in Europe don't quite match the bill we are looking at \nin the EPW Committee. That is why I am so proud of the work Senator \nLieberman and Senator Warner have done, and we are only making this \nbill better.\n  ``Report Calls on Europe to Move on Global Warming.''\n\n       The European Commission report warns that unless there is \n     planning, European countries will face ``increasingly \n     frequent crises and disasters which will prove much more \n     costly and also threaten Europe's social and economic systems \n     and its security.''\n\n  The point is, when you invest now, you save $5 later. That is a fact. \nWe know that from Sir Nicholas Stern, who headed the World Bank.\n  Now, how about national security? One of the reasons I got so \nconcerned about this is when I learned what our own Pentagon and our \nown intelligence people are saying to us. And what are they saying to \nus?\n\n       A report commissioned by the Department of Defense in 2003 \n     found that the impacts of global warming would cause the U.S. \n     to ``find itself in a world where Europe will be struggling \n     internally, with large numbers of refugees washing up on its \n     shores and Asia in serious crisis over food and water. \n     Disruptions and conflict will be endemic features of life.''\n\n  And, of course, our Pentagon and our Department of Defense are very \nconcerned about that happening with our allies in Europe.\n  ``Warming Will Exacerbate Global Water Conflicts.''\n  According to many studies, including the IPCC, changing weather \npatterns will leave millions of people without dependable supplies of \nwater for drinking, irrigation, and power.\n  Now, the reason I took so much time and made all these charts--\nbecause it did take a while to get them done--is\n\n[[Page S13501]]\n\nto show the breadth and the depth of the concern in this country, in \nthe world, to make the point that there is a huge movement in this \ncountry and in the world to address global warming. We are not going to \nlisten to those who have their heads in the sand or, frankly, have \ndecided they want to leave this for another generation. That would be \nirresponsible. I know you, Madam President, and I share a conviction \nthat this is our job. This information has been given to us on our \nwatch, and we intend to stand up to the challenge.\n  When Senator Inhofe came on the floor, he made a number of statements \nwhich were not true, and I am going to deal with a couple of them. He \nused an MIT report in a misleading fashion. Senator Inhofe has \nfrequently claimed an MIT report shows the Boxer and Lieberman bills \nwould lead to a $4,500 tax on a family of four. But the author of the \nMIT report, John Reilly, said:\n\n       Senator Inhofe misread his findings. Rather than impose a \n     tax of $4,500 as Inhofe described it, he said, the study \n     shows the regulation could generate a substantial amount of \n     Federal revenue for the government to give back to Americans. \n     A family of four, Reilly said, could earn an additional \n     $4,500 if the United States adopted a carbon tax or auctioned \n     off carbon credits.\n\n  So let us not misquote authors around here, because that is not the \nright thing to do for them nor is it the right thing to do to mislead \nour colleagues.\n  I mentioned the polar bears before, and many of us have been touched \nto see the polar bears clinging to smaller and smaller pieces of ice in \norder to survive. Senator Inhofe has claimed--and he claimed it on the \nfloor--that the polar bear populations are increasing.\n\n       The best-studied population, in Canada's western Hudson \n     Bay, fell by 22 percent from 1,194 animals in 1987 to 935 in \n     2004, according to--who--the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.\n\n  Our own people are telling us that the polar bear is in trouble.\n\n       The World Conservation Union projects that the bears' \n     numbers will drop by 30 percent by 2050 due to continued loss \n     of Arctic sea ice.\n\n  I think it is important that we talk about facts. Science must \ndictate what we do, not ideological arguments that don't have any \nweight behind them. The leading scientists of the world, including the \nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which I earlier mentioned, \nand which won the Nobel prize along with Vice President Gore, and the \nIPCC included hundreds of scientists, the best scientists from 130 \nnations--they tell us clearly that global warming is happening now and \nhuman activities are the cause. I believe we can meet this challenge, \nwith hope, not fear. I believe when we meet this challenge, we will be \nstronger as a nation and we will be healthier as a nation.\n  And, by the way, we will create a whole new array of green-dollar \njobs. My own State, a leader in the environment, has proven the point \nthat when you step out and you address the needs of the environment, \nwhat comes with it are only good things--prosperity, job creation, and \nhealthier families. We are doing it in our State with global warming \nand, by the way, many other States are following. If we did nothing, it \nwould be a shame. It would be a shame if the America we love so much \nstood by and said: Well, gee, let a few States go off on their own.\n  This is a seminal issue, and we need to do something about it, \nbecause doing nothing is not an option we can afford. The potential \nconsequences will be devastating for our families in the future and for \nthe world.\n  We are seeing the early warning signs. People can come down to this \nfloor and say whatever they want. We have seen melting of snow, we have \nseen melting of permafrost, increased temperatures, warming of lakes, \nrivers, oceans, changing in the seasons, shifts in the ranges of plant \nand animal species, rising sea levels.\n  In the future, we can expect to see more extreme weather events, more \nsevere heatwaves, droughts and flooding, increased storm surges and, \nsadly, an increased incidence of wildfires. We will see extinction of \nspecies, we will see freshwater resources at risk. By 2020, between 75 \nmillion and 250 million people will be exposed to increased water \nstress due to climate change in Africa.\n  In Asia there will be problems. Warming in the western mountains of \nAmerica is projected to cause decreased snowpack and reduced summer \nflows, resulting in even greater competition for already overallocated \nwater resources.\n  I mentioned this figure before--we did hold 20 hearings on global \nwarming. At one of them, we had scientists who were experts on \nwildlife. I remember sitting there, being so saddened to hear that if \nwe do nothing, 40 percent of God's species on planet Earth could face \nextinction.\n  Now we hear our oceans are at risk as well. The British Royal Society \nprojects that progressive acidification of oceans due to increasing \ncarbon dioxide is expected to have terrible impacts on marine life, \nsuch as corals and their dependent species. You have heard of coral \nbleaching. It is cause by increased water temperatures as well as the \noceans becoming acidic from storing excess carbon. The water becomes so \nacidic some marine life, such as shellfish and coral reefs, can no \nlonger form their shell, as it dissolves in the acidic water.\n  The IPCC found that pests, diseases, and fire are having terrible \nimpacts on forests, with an extended period of high fire risk and large \nincreases in areas burned. Again, I wish to use this moment to thank \nthe firefighters in my State, all of them--local, State, Federal--\nworking seamlessly together. We have the most extraordinary heroic \nfirefighters in California, as we do all over this country. Their jobs \nare becoming more and more dangerous as these fires are so strong and \nare fueled by droughts, high temperatures, low humidity, and high \nwinds.\n  I mentioned before that in July, I was in Greenland. I was there with \n10 Senators and Dr. Richard Alley, an expert on ice from Penn State, \nwho accompanied us on the trip. It was amazing to see this whole \nsituation with him at my side. What I learned from him is Greenland's \nice is melting faster than anyone thought. In some places, the glacier \nice is moving so quickly, if you stand there you can actually observe \nit moving.\n  In the past year, new islands were discovered that were previously \nconnected to the main mass of ice. The Greenland ice sheet holds enough \nice to raise sea levels globally by 23 feet. Think about 23 feet. Sea \nlevel increases of only a few feet will cause major disruptions.\n  I wish to talk about public health. Public health officials have \nissued a call to action. We had a hearing the other day and we heard \nfrom the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \nUnfortunately, her testimony was heavily edited by the White House. I \nam working very hard, with other colleagues, to get her original draft. \nLet me tell you, we are not going to rest until we get that. But the \nfact is the public has a right to know everything about global warming \nand the threat it poses to their families and to their communities.\n  At the same hearing where we heard from Dr. Gerberding, the \nCommissioner of the Tennessee Department of Health presented the \ncommittee with a position statement from the Association of State and \nTerritorial Health Officials on Climate Change and Public Health. Their \nstatement was adopted unanimously.\n  Yes, if a Senator wants to come down here and condemn all the public \nhealth officials in the country and claim they get some benefit out of \nthis, let the Senator do it. The fact is, they have said they support \nthe latest findings of the U.N., and they recognize that climate change \nhas far-reaching implications for public health.\n  According to the IPCC, climate change has already altered the \ndistribution of some infectious disease vectors and the seasonal \ndistribution of some allergenic pollen and increased heat wave-related \ndeaths.\n  We are already seeing and we are already feeling the difference. If \ntrends continue, we could see increased malnutrition and related \ndisorders, including those related to child growth and development. We \nwill see increases in the number of people suffering from disease, \ninjury, death because of heat waves and because of droughts and fires \nand all the things we mentioned.\n  The World Health Organization has estimated that human-induced \nchanges in the Earth's climate lead to at least 5 million cases of \nillness and more than 150,000 deaths every year already.\n\n[[Page S13502]]\n\n  We saw the European heat wave which caused countless numbers of \nillnesses and claimed 35,000 lives. That is accurate--35,000 lives were \nlost.\n  You can come down to this floor and you can say everything is \nbeautiful, but you are not in touch with reality.\n  We are beginning to see right here in America what happens when the \nwater warms. The Associated Press reported on September 27 that a 14-\nyear-old boy died from an infection caused by an amoeba after swimming \nin Lake Havasu. According to a CDC official, these amebas thrive in \nwarm water and as water temperatures continue to rise, we can expect to \nsee more cases of these amoeba infections.\n  We are going to see an increase of ground-level ozone or smog because \nthat is formed at higher temperatures. We know smog damages lungs and \ncan cause asthma in our kids. We already have asthma as the leading \ncause of school absences in my State. I cannot speak for other States, \nbut we have major problems with dangerous smog days.\n  We know about wildlife. We know, as I said, that 40 percent of the \nspecies are at risk of extinction if we do nothing to reduce global \nwarming. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service concluded that shrinking \nsea ice is the primary cause for the decline in polar bear populations. \nSenator Inhofe comes down and says the polar bears are doing great: \nWrong. False information. Listen to your own administration's U.S. Fish \nand Wildlife Service. The shrinking sea ice is the primary cause for \nthe decline in polar bear populations.\n  Guess what. This administration--because it was threatened by a \nlawsuit--proposed listing the polar bear as threatened under the \nEndangered Species Act. So come down here and show pictures of those \nmagnificent polar bears, saying everything is fine--that is wrong. It \nis wrong by every measure, by every scientific account, by our own U.S. \nFish and Wildlife Service.\n\n  Global warming is a national security issue, as I mentioned before. \nPeople are telling me this current humanitarian catastrophe in Darfur \nis already linked to the extended drought in the region. The Secretary \nGeneral of the United Nations said the Darfur conflict began as an \necological crisis, arising at least in part from climate change. This \nis happening right under our nose. The Senate and the House have been \nasleep at the wheel--until recently.\n  A report commissioned by the Department of Defense found the impacts \nof global warming would cause the United States to ``find itself in a \nworld where Europe would be struggling. . . .'' Projected global \nwarming ``poses a serious threat to America's national security'' and \n``acts as a threat multiplier for instability. . . .'' This is all from \nretired admirals and generals. This is not from Barbara Boxer. This \nisn't from Al Gore. This isn't from Maria Cantwell. This isn't from \nSenator Warner. It isn't from Senator Lieberman. This is from our own \nretired admirals and generals: Projected global warming poses a serious \nthreat to America's national security.\n  The United States, they said, could more frequently be drawn into \nsituations of conflict ``to help provide stability before conditions \nworsen and are exploited by extremists.'' Such missions could be long \nand require the United States to remain for ``stability and \nreconstruction efforts . . . to avert further disaster.''\n  That report also warns of ``extreme weather events, drought, \nflooding, sea level rise, retreating glaciers, habitat shifts . . . the \nincreased spread of life-threatening diseases'' and increased scarcity \nof clean water that could ``result in multiple chronic conditions'' and \n``foster the conditions for internal conflicts, extremism, and movement \ntoward increased authoritarianism and radical ideologies.''\n  I have never seen an issue such as this, where we have such a \nunanimous call for action, a unanimous call for action--from the \nbusiness community, from environmental organizations, from admirals and \ngenerals, from the Department of Defense, from the Wildlife Service--\nfrom all over the world. As yet we are nowhere, but we hope to change \nthat.\n  What are our States and our local governments saying? They are taking \naction.\n  I have had the pleasure of having Mayor Gregg Nickels of Seattle \nbefore the Committee. He started the Mayors' Climate Protection \nAgreement in 2005. To date, mayors from nearly 700 cities across \nAmerica, representing 75 million Americans, have pledged to reduce \ntheir greenhouse gas emissions.\n  So come down to the floor and say what you want. But 75 million \nAmericans are already acting. Come to the floor, say what you want, but \nthe world is passing you by if you close your ears, cover your eyes, \nand convince yourself that you know more than the scientists of the \nworld know.\n  California is the sixth largest economy of the world. I am so proud \nto represent California--37 million people and a spirit of \nentrepreneurship, a spirit of neighbor helping neighbor. It is an \nincredible place.\n  California has set the gold standard with its landmark global warming \nprogram, Republican Governor Schwarzenegger and a Democratic \nlegislature setting us on a clear path toward 80 percent cuts by 2050.\n  You know, what is important about the California experience is look \nat what we have already done on per-capita energy use. I am so honored \nthat you are in the chair, Madam President, because of your expertise \non energy.\n  We have kept our per-capita energy use steady for more than 30 years, \nwhile per-capita energy consumption in the rest of the Nation has \ndoubled. If the whole country could have been as efficient as \nCalifornia, we would have saved an amount of energy equivalent to all \nthe oil we import from the Middle East each year. Can you imagine that? \nSo when people fight against doing something about global warming, I \nsay: If you look at the low-hanging fruit, which is energy efficiency, \nand look at what my State has done and now other States are doing, we \ncan get halfway there without one sacrifice.\n  I don't think anyone has ever said that Californians do not lead a \nvery happy, pleasant life. I don't think anyone looks at Californians: \nOh, those poor people, they are so unhappy because they are energy \nefficient.\n  On the contrary, we have a booming economy and we have people who are \nfeeling good about themselves because of the contribution they have \nmade. It does not take much to get a refrigerator that is more \nefficient or get a car that gets better mileage or get an air-\nconditioner that cuts your energy use in half. I have done it. I have \ndone these things. I am saving money. I am driving my Prius, and I am \nwaving to the gas station because I don't have to go in very often to \nfill up my car.\n  People all over this country are already so far ahead of where we \nare. If you want to come down to the floor, if you want to take issue \nwith 75 million Americans, be my guest. But you are not being honest \nwith the facts. The facts are clear.\n  Twenty-nine States have completed climate action plans and a number \nof States have established mandatory reduction targets, again including \nmy home State. Last week, Gov. Kathleen Sibelius of Kansas wrote an \nopen letter to the people of her State, expressing her support for \nclean energy. What is happening in Kansas? Good things. The State's \nenvironment secretary rejected applications to build two new coal-fired \npowerplants. They want cleaner energy. They want clean energy. They see \nthey are going to move in that direction. The Governor of Kansas \nunderstands what we are facing. If you want to come down on the floor \nand tell her she is wrong, be my guest. It is a free country. But you \nknow what? You are not going to change her mind and you are not going \nto change the minds in so many States that are moving so far past us it \nmakes your head spin.\n  Addressing global warming has major benefits. I have given you the \ntruth about the dangers of global warming because a lot of people walk \naway. I wanted you to hear the truth about the dangers of global \nwarming. Now I want to tell you what gives me hope. When we step up to \nthe plate, we are going to benefit. We cannot only prevent the most \ndangerous effects of climate change, but we are going to be better off \nfor it. I already mentioned Sir Nicholas Stern, former chief economist \nof the World Bank. He said: Spend a dollar now, save $5 later. So \npeople are going to come on the floor and they are going to say: Oh my \nGod, they are spending money on this.\n  No, we are going to save money, because if we can avert the worst \nproblems of global warming--you can't\n\n[[Page S13503]]\n\nbuild a flood protection tall enough unless we do something now. Do you \nknow what it costs to build that flood protection? We know because we \npassed the Water Resources Protection Act and we kept our promises to \nthe people of New Orleans and the others from Katrina and Rita who \nsuffered so much.\n  To take a little segue, the President is threatening to veto that \nbill. Now, that is one where Senator Inhofe and I are exactly together. \nWe cannot walk away from building an infrastructure, but the point is, \nbuilding an infrastructure to protect against the type of floods that \ncould come if we do not act is going to be so much more expensive than \ninvesting the dollars now. And that is the point.\n  Since 1990, Britain has reduced its greenhouse gas emissions by 15 \npercent. Guess what. Britain's economy has grown 40 percent. So people \ncan come down to this floor and say: Oh, it is going to wreck our \neconomy. Wrong again. It did not happen in California; it did not \nhappen in Britain.\n  Britain's environmental industries are the fastest growing sector of \nthe country's economy. I was just there a couple of months ago. They \nare so excited. Their environmental jobs grew to 500,000 from 135,000 \nin just the last 5 years.\n  There is a study at UC Berkeley, University of California, Berkeley. \nThey say that the State product in California, the gross State product, \nby 2020 will be up by as much as $74 billion, with 89,000 new jobs \ncreated because of our work on global warming and our laws.\n  I have been to Silicon Valley. You are familiar with the \nentrepreneurial spirit there. They are just waiting to make the kind of \ninvestments necessary, but they need to have a clue as to what we are \ngoing to do. If we walk away from a cap-and-trade system, which will \nput a market price on carbon, they are not going to make those \ninvestments.\n  The entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley are on the cutting edge. New \ncompanies are starting every day to respond to the growing demand for \nclean energy and more efficient vehicles and other technologies.\n  Sun Microsystems is already reaping the benefits of greater \nefficiency. I just went to visit Sun Microsystems. They made some \nsimple changes in the way they cool their computer servers. They have \nbeen able to cut their electrical consumption in half. I will tell you, \nsimple things can save so much energy. Simple things can cut down on \nglobal warming.\n  Tesla Motors, I would urge all of you to follow that company. They \nare producing an all-electric car with performance that rivals or even \nexceeds the world's best sports cars. It is exciting. It is in \nproduction. It is all electric.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I will yield to the Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. First, I compliment the Senator for her very articulate \nunderstanding of the impact of greenhouse gases and where our country \nneeds to go. So thank you for your leadership. We are so happy that you \nare chairing that committee and showing the fortitude to make sure this \nlegislation starts moving through the Senate.\n  You mentioned California's experience. I wonder if you would just \nelaborate on that one more time because I think the point may have \nbeen--it sounds so simple but yet so complex. California's savings is \nwhat we are trying to do in the Energy bill. Here we have a 20-percent \nreduction of fuel consumption and a 20-percent reduction of greenhouse \ngases. That is why we need to pass the Energy bill. But you are talking \nabout California's efficiency, and the efficiency that it achieved was \nmonumental and significant. If you would, emphasize or explain how it \nis that we should be doing the same thing in the Senate in moving \nforward on efficiency.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank my dear friend, such a great leader on energy \nreform, for taking to the floor. I want to say to you, Senator \nCantwell, in California we have kept our per capita energy use steady. \nIn other words, each person's energy use over time has stayed steady \nfor more than 30 years, while the per capita energy use in the rest of \nthe Nation doubled.\n  Now, we have done it in ways that were very comfortable for people. \nYou know, you look at the energy for appliances, you look at building \ncodes, you look at all the things that we have done, simple things, \nthings you are trying to do in the Energy bill.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Madam Chair, did that cost California jobs?\n  Mrs. BOXER. It created jobs. We have been a leader in jobs. We are \nvery prosperous. We believe our landmark legislation on global warming, \nthe studies show, will create thousands and tens of thousands of green-\ncollar jobs.\n  I think the point I would like to emphasize, and I know my friend \nfrom Missouri will be amazed at this, if every other State were just to \nemulate that, had emulated that, and we all did this as a national \ngoal, not just one State's goal, we would have saved an amount of \nenergy equivalent to all of the oil we import from the Middle East each \nyear.\n  That is the amount of savings from the simple things that we can do, \nsome of the things that my friend is trying so hard to get done in the \nEnergy bill.\n  The fact is, when I look at the whole issue of global warming as a \ngood news/bad news story, the bad news is we really have not tackled it \nhere. The good news is there is so much we can do, so easily, with such \nbenefits.\n  Certainly, energy efficiency is one.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Madam Chair, I thank the Senator from California for \nanswering that question and again for her great leadership on trying to \npush forward global warming and climate impact legislation in the \nSenate.\n  We do have to move forward. Her resiliency in saying the committee \nwill address it, the committee will mark up legislation is the next \nstep in what we need to do in following through. I applaud her for her \ndedication and for answering that question.\n  At $90 a barrel for oil, I certainly wish the rest of the Nation \nwould have followed what California has done in that consumption \nreduction because it would have helped all of us on today's oil prices.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). The Senator has 9 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you very much. I would just say that the California \nstory is a good news story. California is trying to do more. They have \nasked the Bush administration for a waiver to move forward in the \ntransportation sector. That waiver has not been forthcoming.\n  California has gotten 50 waivers in the past. For some reason now \nthere has been a very slow-walking act that has gone along with this \nrequest for a waiver. I am hoping that our committee is going to invite \nmany of the Governors of the various States to the Capitol to talk \nabout why it is so key for the Bush administration to grant the waiver.\n  When I started to talk about what is happening now with the \nentrepreneurial spirit in my State, I talked about Sun Microsystems \nreaping the benefits of energy efficiency to their plant.\n  First of all, they were able to consolidate the space that houses all \nof their computers, which was a big help. Secondly, just by moving \nforward with a new way to cool their computers, cool their computers in \na low-energy way, they cut their energy bills in half.\n  I talked about Tesla Motors producing an all-electric car. It is a \nbeautiful car. They are not marketing it as a way to fight global \nwarming. They are marketing it as a beautiful car, one of the fastest \ncars in the world.\n  Tesla Motors, I hope you will go and take a look. Their first model \nis going to be very expensive, we know that. But their next models are \ngoing to be half the price. And they hope in the future to get to the \n$30,000 range. Now, what we are talking about is clean automobiles, \nzero emissions of greenhouse gases.\n  There is another company, Bloom Energy, in San Jose. They are \ncreating the next generation of fuel cell electrical generation \nsystems. I visited there and the scientists were explaining how all of \nthis works. I can tell you this technology has the potential to \nrevolutionize the way that electricity is generated. It holds the \npotential to bring clean electricity to parts of the world that have no \nelectricity now.\n  So what are the benefits, the benefits of new technology? New jobs, \ncleaner\n\n[[Page S13504]]\n\nair as we reduce the pollution that causes global warming, by \nincreasing our use of clean, renewable energy sources such as wind and \nsolar, driving more efficiently, less polluting cars and trucks, and \nincreasing efficiency. We will reduce other forms of air population \ntoo: sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, mercury.\n  These are issues about which Senators Carper and Alexander are very \nconcerned. They sit on the Environment and Public Works Committee. With \nthis bill we will see that those pollutants will be reduced as we cut \nglobal warming pollution. And that means cleaner, healthier air for us \nall to breathe.\n  Now, the IPCC also concluded that household benefits from reduced air \npollution as a result of action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions can \nbe substantial. So when I say: I meet this crisis with hope, not fear, \nI mean it. I think it is going to create jobs. I think it is going to \nmake our communities healthier. I think it is going to make our air \nhealthier. I think it is going to reduce our dependance on foreign \ncountries to supply oil, which is now up to $90 a barrel.\n  We know oil is a critical strategic interest of America. Our reliance \non oil-rich rogue states and unstable regimes has been at the heart of \nwars and interventions in the Middle East. As we develop these clean, \nrenewable sources of energy, which is all going to be done by the \nprivate sector, my venture capitalists at home cannot wait to make \nthese investments, but they will not make them unless we take the lead \non a strong anti-global-warming bill.\n  Now, world leadership, the United States has always been the world \nleader on environmental protection. The core environmental laws that we \ncreated and enacted, most of them through the committee on which I am \nso proud to be a part of, the Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act, Safe \nDrinking Water Act, National Environmental Policy Act, and others, have \nbeen models for environmental policy around the globe. The global \nwarming legislation we pass will take its place alongside those \nlandmark laws. It is time for us to step up and set the pace.\n  Now, again, our States are doing it. I want our States to continue. I \nreally do. But I really do believe this is an issue that belongs in the \nSenate. By leading now, we can ensure that the solutions to global \nwarming are designed in ways that are good for America, good for our \nbusinesses, good for our consumers, good for our kids. We have the \ntechnology and know-how to export. Now is the time to move forward.\n  Well, I have been working very closely with Senators Warner and \nLieberman as they have assembled their bill. I was so impressed with \nthe effort they have invested in seeking out the views of Senators and \nother groups, environmental organizations, business organizations.\n  They have looked at all the other global warming bills that have been \nproposed: the Sanders-Boxer bill, the Kerry-Snowe bill. They have \nlooked at the Lieberman-McCain bill and the Bingaman bill. I think \nthose are all of them. There has been a broad range of views that they \nhave reconciled in the process. I have laid out some important \nprinciples that I believe must be reflected in the legislation. Any \nbill has to have the emission reductions that will avoid dangerous \nclimate change. It must be flexible to have look-back, to make sure we \nare on course. We need an emissions trading program so there is a price \nput on carbon by the private sector. We must protect the pioneering \nState efforts that are already underway. We need to ensure that other \ncountries are stepping up and doing what they have to do. There are \nways to enforce that, frankly, because a lot of folks want to trade \nwith us. If they want to come in and trade with us, they better make \nsure they are not adding to this problem.\n  Natural resources and wildlife concerns must be addressed. We must \nsupport American workers in their transition as we move to a greener \neconomy and see, again, as they have in Great Britain, how many jobs \nwould be created.\n\n  I also want to express the moral imperative that was really brought \nto me by the religious community. The most vulnerable here and around \nthe world have to be protected. I know we have colleagues who continue \nto say we have to do it, and they are absolutely right.\n  There is no time to waste because the longer we wait, the harder it \nwill be to achieve the goals we have to achieve--before we find we are \nspending a fortune on flood control and we are spending a fortune to \ntry to mitigate the terrible ravages that global warming will bring.\n  The point is, with good legislation we have these lookbacks. If we \nare on target, fine. If we are doing too much, we have a way to back \noff. If we are not doing enough, we could do more. That is the beauty \nof the Lieberman-Warner bill.\n  I believe there is unprecedented momentum for change. Yes, you are \ngoing to have a few voices come down here and say this is ridiculous, \nthis does not make any sense. That is fine. That is their right. But, \nagain, in every great issues debate, you always have a few people who \nstand outside the mainstream, and I respect that. I absolutely give the \nfolks who have that point of view all the time they want to express \nthemselves.\n  But the bill Senators Warner and Lieberman have crafted can set us on \nthe path to achieving the goal of avoiding dangerous climate change. It \nis a bipartisan, mainstream breakthrough, and I am committed to further \nstrengthening this legislation as we move forward because the \nlegislation establishes a framework on which we can build. It embodies \nkey concepts--such as cap and trade and lookbacks and it draws on the \nother strong global warming bills that have been proposed. It gets us \nstarted. Time is short.\n  Now, there are a few who will say we should not do anything.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent for 60 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank my friends for yielding me that 60 seconds \nbecause what I want to do is wrap up.\n  Some will say: This is not an urgent problem. Do nothing.\n  Others will say: Do nothing until you go to the extreme, until you go \nto the 90-percent cut. Let's wait for a new President. Let's wait for a \nnew Congress. Let's wait for a new day. Let's wait for the Sun to come \nout. Let's wait for the rain to fall.\n  I do not ascribe to either of those extremes.\n  We have the facts now. We have a good bill now. We have an \nunprecedented opportunity to send a signal to this country and to the \nworld that we are ready, finally, to move to calm the effects of \nunfettered global warming. I think we can do it. I think we can be \nsuccessful at it, and I do approach this with great hope.\n  Some have tried to argue that we should not act now. These people say \nwe should wait for a new President, a new Congress, another day.\n  As I say, there is no time to waste. Right now, there is \nunprecedented momentum for change. We must harness that momentum to \npass strong global warming legislation. We have a small window of time \nto get started down this path. The longer we wait to get started, the \nharder it will be to achieve the emissions reductions we know we need \nto reach. Starting now will send a signal to the world and the business \ncommunity as they make their future plans that the United States is \nserious about its leadership role.\n  Some have asked me, Why should we pass legislation now, when the \nPresident has said he is opposed to mandatory caps on global warming \npollution and a cap-and-trade system?\n  The President and I agree that technology is the solution. But he \nstill won't accept that it won't happen on its own, not unless the \nprice of carbon is built into the process. We still hope to change his \nmind, but even if we do not, we must begin the hard work of the \nlegislative process. It takes time, patience, fortitude, and courage. \nVery few laws are passed the first time around. We must take good \nlegislation as far as we can. It is our job to start down the path.\n  I have a vision for my 11-year-old grandson and for my new grandson \nwho was born a few months ago.\n  My vision is that these children and yours will grow up and be able \nto know the gifts of nature that we saved for them, that they will \nunderstand we made the right choice for them--we protected the planet \nthat is their home--that because of our action they\n\n[[Page S13505]]\n\nwill not be shackled into fighting wars over the last drops of water or \noil or remaining acres of arable cropland. They will not have to spend \ntheir last treasure building higher flood walls, bigger levees, and \nfortified cities to escape rising seas and angrier hurricanes.\n  Their cars will run on clean renewable fuels that do not pollute the \nair they breathe. The United States will lead in exporting clean \ntechnologies and products that are the engine of a new green economy. \nWe will lead the world in showing the way to live well, in a way that \nrespects the Earth.\n  To make this vision a reality, we must face our challenge in a way \nthat overcomes our differences, and that defies our party affiliations.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor to my friend, Senator Inhofe.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Thank you, Madam President. It is my understanding--I \nwould ask for clarification--I am entitled to 30 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republicans control the remaining 30 \nminutes of morning business.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Thank you very much.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/29/senate-section/article/S13505-1", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13505-S13507]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             GLOBAL WARMING\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, let me, first of all, say it would be \nvery difficult to, in only 30 minutes, refute everything that was just \nsaid. Interestingly enough, I was honored to have about 2 hours 10 \nminutes on the floor last Friday to tell the truth about this subject \nof global warming. I have had a chance to do that. I have very \ncarefully written down all the points that were made by my good friend \nfrom California, and I am going to try to get through these as quickly \nas I can within that 30-minute period of time.\n  First of all, on the wildfires in California--this is interesting \nbecause everything that is out there that is distasteful is blamed on \nglobal warming. People say: Oh, it must be true; that is what I read in \nthe newspapers.\n  I believed, 4\\1/2\\ years ago, it was true. We all know that the \nNorthern Hemisphere has been going through a period--up until about 7 \nyears ago--where it was warming. That has stopped. But it was true at \nthat time. So I assumed it had something to do with manmade gases until \nwe started looking at it and realizing the science just isn't there.\n  On wildfires out in California, just real quickly, it is interesting, \nthe Los Angeles Times headline was ``Global warming not a factor in \nwildfires.'' An excerpt from the article reads: Are the massive fires \nburning across southern California a product of global warming? They \nsay no. Scientists--almost unanimously--say that has nothing to do with \nit.\n  In fact, it is kind of interesting; it is reported: The Santa Ana \nwinds, which typically have gusts of up to 45 miles per hour, were \nrecorded at more than 80 miles per hour several times this week--strong \nbut inside the range of normal variability.\n  Meteorologist Joseph D'Aleo said this past Friday:\n\n       The unfortunate fires can be explained very nicely by \n     natural factors.\n\n  Environmentalists would not allow brush clearing. He goes on to talk \nabout the prohibition against clearing up accumulated brush from the \nareas surrounding housing developments that was instituted at the \ninsistence of the Sierra Club and other environmental organizations.\n  Climatologist Patrick Michaels debunks the wildfire-global warming \nlink. Do not blame this on global warming. There is no trend whatsoever \nin the frequency of heavy-rainfall years and so forth. He goes on and \non. So that just flat is not true.\n  Now, the Senator from California has claimed, on several occasions, \nit would be cheaper in the long run to immediately enact regulatory \npolicies aimed at controlling the Earth's global temperatures. The \nclaim is clearly wrong. Of the half dozen major bills introduced in the \nSenate, all will harm the economy, yet none will put a dent in global \nwarming, even if the worst fears were well founded.\n  Earlier this month, the Environmental Protection Agency concluded \nthat over the long run each bill before Congress, including those that \nwould reduce U.S. emissions by 70 percent--70 percent--would only \nreduce global concentration of greenhouse gases by 4 percent--just 4 \npercent.\n  Here is something that is interesting. When former Vice President Al \nGore was in office, he went to Tom Wigley, who at that time was a very \nrenowned scientist and one of his top advisers. He said: What would \nhappen if all developed nations--not the developing nations such as \nChina and other countries where they do not have any control over what \ncan be done there, but if developed nations all signed on to the Kyoto \ntreaty and lived by their emissions, how much would it reduce the \nEarth's temperature in 50 years? The result was 0.07 degrees Celsius. \nNow, that is if everybody did this and inflicted all the damage.\n  In June of this year, China--this is something which is kind of \ninteresting; they try to blame America and our emissions on greenhouse \ngases--they were projecting we would be the No. 1 greenhouse gas \nemitter by 2040. We were shocked to find out that just recently China \nalready passed us. So they are increasing their emissions of greenhouse \ngases at a real rapid rate. As a matter of fact, we went through the 15 \nyears prior to 2005 by having no new coal-fired generating plants. \nChina is now cranking out one every 3 days. This is kind of interesting \nbecause as we lose jobs to China, because we do not have the energy \nhere, they are going to be using technologies that are not nearly as \necologically refined as ours. So it is going to end up having the \neffect of even more and more greenhouse gases.\n  Now, when Time magazine named the Model T Ford the 20th century's \nworst environmental product because it brought mobility and prosperity, \nit was clear that common sense has been turned on its head in this \ncountry. Almost a century ago, when the first Model T was rolling off \nthe assembly line, the average American could expect a lifespan of 53 \nyears and an inflation-adjusted income of only $5,300 a year. Now that \nthe automobile is here and we can take people long distances--to \nhospitals and that type of thing--we are now looking at an average \nlifespan at 78 years as opposed to 53 years and an annual income, \nadjusted for inflation, of $32,000. Yet, despite this, some are still \nmaking the claim it will not be all that harmful to the economy to take \ndrastic action in trying to do something about this. They keep \ninsisting that China and other countries will mimic us. I think it is \npretty reasonable that when China's Deputy Director General for \nEnvironmental Affairs makes such uncompromising, clear statements of \nChina's policies to pursue an economic growth agenda first and \nforemost, we would be wise to take him at his word.\n  Adopting these policies will only cost the country trillions of \ndollars over time on the naive belief that if China sees how serious \nour country is, it will decide, in the goodness of its heart, to do \nthis. This is just not right. They made it very clear they do not have \nany interest in doing that at all.\n  Now, when we talk about the Kyoto protocol--which is the first one \nthat came along--I think it is interesting that of all 15 Western \nEuropean countries that joined the Kyoto protocol, only 2 out of 15 \nhave lived within the emissions, have emitted the amounts that were \nacceptable by the protocol. One of those is Great Britain, and right \nnow they are increasing their emissions of greenhouse gases.\n\n  The facts above may be what prompted the journal Nature to publish an \narticle declaring that Kyoto is dead and that we need a new approach, \none remarkably similar to the Bush approach, and that is the Asian \nPacific Partnership Act, which I talked about for quite a while last \nFriday, which I will not repeat now.\n  The Senator from California relied on the 2006 Stern report from \nBritain to bolster her claim. Senator Boxer stated:\n\n       This is a very important moment in time. The cost of doing \n     nothing, according to the leading economist on this topic in \n     the world, Nicholas Stern, is five times what the cost will \n     be to address this issue now.\n\n  Now, I do think this is worth spending a little bit of time on \nbecause my good friend, the junior Senator from California, spent quite \na bit of time on this subject.\n  What did the experts say about the Stern report?\n  Economist Richard Tol of Hamburg University, one of the world's \nleading\n\n[[Page S13506]]\n\nenvironmental economists, tore apart the Stern report on January 26, \nsaying:\n\n       If a student of mine were to hand in this report on a \n     Master's thesis . . . [it is] likely I would give him an \n     ``F'' for fail. There is a whole range of very basic \n     economics mistakes that somebody who claims to be a Professor \n     of Economics simply should not make.\n\n  Tol said, according to the BBC:\n\n       Stern consistently picks the most pessimistic for every \n     choice that one can make. He overestimates through cherry-\n     picking, he double counts particularly the risks and he \n     underestimates what development and adaptation will do to \n     impacts.\n\n  Danish statistician Bjorn Lomborg critiqued the Stern report in a \nNovember 2, 2006, Wall Street Journal op-ed piece. He said:\n\n       The report seems hastily put-together, with many sloppy \n     errors. As an example, the cost of hurricanes in the U.S. is \n     said to be both 0.13 percent of U.S. GDP and 10 times that \n     figure.\n\n  Lomborg wrote:\n\n       It seems naive to believe that the world's 192 nations can \n     flawlessly implement Mr. Stern's multi-trillion-dollar, \n     century-long policy proposal. Will nobody try to avoid its \n     obligations? Why would China and India even participate?\n\n  Particularly when they stated they would not do it.\n  Roger Pielke, Jr., the director of the University of Colorado's \nCenter for Science and Technology Policy Research, also chided the \nStern report for ``cherry picking'' data on October 30, 2006. Pielke \nwrote:\n\n       The Stern Report's selective fishing out of a convenient \n     statement from one of the background papers prepared for our \n     workshop is a classic example of cherry picking a result from \n     a diversity of perspectives, rather than focusing on the \n     consensus of the entire spectrum of experts that participated \n     in our meeting.\n\n  Quoting further, he said:\n\n       To support its argument the Stern Report further relies on \n     a significantly flawed report from the Association of British \n     Insurers, which we critiqued here. Its presentation of the \n     future costs of disasters and climate change is highly \n     selective to put it mildly.\n\n  Australian Paleoclimate scientist Dr. Bob Carter ridiculed the Stern \nreport in a November 3, 2006, article:\n\n       The Stern warning could join Paul Ehrlich's ``The \n     Population Bomb'' and the ``Club of Rome's Limits to Growth'' \n     in the pantheon of big banana scares that proved to be \n     unfounded.\n\n  It goes on and on in some detail criticizing the report.\n  Yale University's Sterling Professor of Economics William Nordhaus \nrecently authored a study on the economic effects of climate change \ntitled ``The Challenge of Global Warming: Economic Models and \nEnvironmental Policy.'' The study revealed that so-called global \nwarming solutions would cost two or even three times the benefits they \nwould theoretically achieve. Nordhaus was specifically critical of \nStern's use of novel methodology, in which he assumes a near zero \ndiscount rate which dramatically increases the benefits of addressing \nglobal warming.\n\n  The New York Times captured the views of mainstream economists in its \nFebruary 21, 2007, article by David Leonhardt, when he cited Nordhaus's \nconcerns, adding:\n\n       This was fairly tame compared with the comments of another \n     Yale economist, Robert O. Mendelsohn. ``I was awestruck,'' he \n     said, comparing Sir Nicholas to ``The Wizard of Oz.'' But \n     ``my job is to be Toto.''\n\n  It goes on and on and on.\n  Even Alan Greenspan talks about spending quite a bit of time on this. \nHe said: There is no effective way to meaningfully reduce emissions \nwithout negatively impacting a larger part of the economy.\n  Now, if you look at the Wharton study--there it is, right there. If \nyou look at this, I hope people understand there is no question that \nthere are scientists who actually believe that manmade gases are a \nmajor contributor to climate change. I don't believe--and the \nscientists I outlined last Friday--one thing is sure and that is the \ncost to America, should we decide to take one of these steps. Keep in \nmind, all of this is pushed on us by the United Nations, similar to a \nlot of other things we have to live with. But if you look at the last \nfour largest tax increases in the last three decades, the most recent \none was a $32 billion tax increase in 1993 called the Clinton-Gore tax \nincrease, a $32 billion tax increase. I can remember coming to the \nfloor--it was an increase on all the rates, the rates of individuals, \nregardless of income range. There were all kinds of increases. Yet as \nbad as that was, and as we were talking about the huge tax increase--\n$32 billion--the Wharton School of Economics estimates the Kyoto cost \nwould have been over $300 billion; in other words, ten times the \nlargest tax increase in modern history.\n  I think people do have to understand that, because there have been \nall kinds of articles. The op-ed piece in the Financial Post by Wayne \nWeingarten said that the cost of reducing greenhouse gases through cap-\nand-trade regulations are not trivial. If implemented, cap-and-trade \npolicies would add significant costs to production and would likely \nhave a severe negative impact on long-term growth and an estimated \n$10,800 per U.S. family--$10,800.\n  Recently the MIT study which was referred to, I think, by Senator \nBoxer, the MIT study analyzed how energy producers would have to spend \nto buy allowances if they were auctioned, and the cost to energy \nproducers to buy these allowances would be equal to $4,500 per \nhousehold family. Now, all of these seem to be unanimous in terms of \nwhat it would cost, and I think we all understand that.\n  For fear that I might lose--or run out of time, I am going to real \nquickly go over some of the things I did last Friday, talking about \nwhat has happened in 2007. In August of 2007, a peer-reviewed study \npublished in the ``Geophysical Research Letters'' finds global warming \nover the last century linked to natural causes. The September peer-\nreviewed study counters the global warming theory by finding carbon \ndioxide did not end during the last ice age. In October of 2007, the \nDanish National Space Study concluded the Sun still appears to be the \nmain forcing agent.\n  By the way, all the way through this, we have approximately 11 other \nquotes that I will submit for the record talking about how the \nscientists have come out and talked about how expensive it was.\n  The geologist at the University of Pennsylvania, Dr. Giegengack, \nmakes comments. He says:\n\n       If we reduced the rate at which we put carbon into the \n     atmosphere, it won't reduce the concentration in the \n     atmosphere; CO2 is just going to come back out of \n     these reservoirs.\n\n  He talked about natural reservoirs, which are oceans, soil, and \npermafrost.\n  Going back to Dr. Giegengack, he says:\n\n       In terms of global warming's capacity to cause the human \n     species harm, I don't think it makes it into the top 10.\n\n  He said that in an interview at the University of Pennsylvania.\n  Now, again, if we have time, we will come back and expand a little \nbit on that.\n  What I have done is written down as quickly as I could the things the \njunior Senator came out with. She spent a lot of--let's put the polar \nbear back up there. People wonder why they always keep using polar \nbears. Everybody loves animals. This was a Time magazine top seller. \nThey had this poor polar bear standing on this last cube of ice out \nthere. It says: ``Be worried. Be Very Worried.'' That is the same \npublication that in 1975 said another ice age is coming; we are all \ngoing to die.\n  Let's talk about the polar bear. I think this is kind of a classic \ncase of reality versus unproven computer model predictions. The Fish \nand Wildlife Service estimates that the polar bear population is \ncurrently 20,000 to 25,000 bears; whereas, in the 1950s and 1960s, the \nestimates were 5,000 to 10,000 polar bears. We currently have an \nestimated four to five times more polar bears than we did 50 years ago.\n\n  A 2002 U.S. Geological Survey of wildlife in the Arctic Refuge \nCoastal Plain noted that polar bear populations may now be near \nhistoric highs.\n  Top biologists such as Canadian biologist Dr. Mitchell Taylor, the \ndirector of wildlife research, dismissed these fears about polar bears \nwith evidence-based data on Canada's polar bear populations. He says: \nOf the 13 populations of polar bears in Canada, 11 are stable or \nincreasing in number.\n  There is only one that is dropping down, and that is in the western--\nwhat was it, the Hudson Bay area. This is the one the junior Senator \nfrom California talked about, and that is going down in population, \nmostly because of the hunting rules that have been established in that \narea.\n  The next thing she talked about was computer models. This is \ninteresting because everyone now has debunked\n\n[[Page S13507]]\n\nthe whole idea that computer models were accurate. Even the New York \nTimes has been forced to acknowledge the overwhelming evidence that the \nEarth is currently well within natural climate variation. This \ninconvenient reality means that all the warming doomsayers have to back \nup their climate fears are unproven computer models predicting future \ndoom. Of course, you can't prove a prediction of the climate in 2100 \nwrong today, which reduces the models to speculating on what could or \nmight or may happen 50 years from now or 100 years from now.\n  But prominent U.N. scientists have publicly questioned the \nreliability of climate models. This is kind of interesting because it \nis the U.N. that started this whole thing. The IPCC, the scientists, \nDr. Jim Renwick, a lead author of the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report--\nthis is the United Nations--publicly admitted that climate models may \nnot be so reliable after all.\n  He stated in June:\n\n       Half of the variability in the climate system is not \n     predictable, so we don't expect to do terrifically well.\n\n  Let me repeat, a U.N. scientist admitted half of the variability in \nthe climate system is not predictable.\n  Also in June, another high-profile U.N. lead author, Dr. Kevin \nTrenberth, echoed Renwick's sentiments about climate models by \nreferring to them as nothing more than story lines.\n  Keep in mind, what we are talking about are the things that all this \nis based on and the distinguished junior Senator from California spent \nabout 15 minutes of her 1 hour talking about--computer models. They \nhave all been debunked.\n  Now, as far as Greenland is concerned, this is kind of interesting \nbecause, in fact, current temperatures in Greenland--and Greenland has \nbeen the poster boy for climate alarmists--the current temperatures are \ncooler than the temperatures there in the mid 1930s and 1940s, \naccording to multiple peer-reviewed studies. You heard me right. \nGreenland has cooled since the 1940s, a fact the media and global \nwarming activists conceal. Greenland reached its highest temperatures \nin 1941, according to a peer-reviewed study published in the June of \n2006 issue of the ``Journal of Geophysical Research.'' Keep in mind the \n80 percent of manmade CO2 after these high temperatures.\n  According to a July 2007 report from the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee on Greenland:\n\n       Research in 2006 found that Greenland has been warming \n     since the 1880s, but since 1955, temperature averages at \n     Greenland stations have been colder than the period between \n     1881 and 1995. Another 2006 peer-reviewed study concluded the \n     rate of warming in Greenland from 1920 to 1930 was about 50 \n     percent higher than the warming from 1995 to 2005. One 2005 \n     study found Greenland gaining ice in the interior higher \n     elevations and thinning ice at the lower elevations.\n\n  So it has gone over and over again, the fact that it is factual, that \nit has actually been getting cooler in Greenland.\n  By the way, I think it is also interesting when you talk about global \nwarming, consistently through the last several decades, the Southern \nHemisphere has actually been getting cooler. The last time I checked, \nthe Southern Hemisphere was part of the globe.\n  So I think if we want to talk about some of the changes in terms of \nthe scientists that have been coming along, we could do that. I think \none of the well-known--the scientist staff writer, Juliet Eilperin, \nfrom the Washington Post conceded that climate skeptics appear to be \nexpanding rather than shrinking.\n  Geologist Peter Sciaky echoes this growing backlash of leftwing \nactivists about global warming. He describes himself as a ``liberal and \na leftist'' and wrote on June 9:\n\n       I do not know a single geologist who believes that global \n     warming is a man-made phenomena.\n\n  I think that former Vice President Gore's biggest worry is becoming a \nreality right now, and that is that all these scientists who were on \nhis side 10 years or so ago are now on the other side saying: Wait a \nminute, we thought we were right at that time.\n  The 60 scientists who were advising the Prime Minister of Canada and \nadvised him back in the middle 1990s to sign onto the Kyoto Treaty, \nafter reevaluating, they said:\n\n       If, back in the mid 1990s, we knew what we know today about \n     climate, Kyoto would almost certainly not exist, because we \n     would have concluded it was not necessary.\n\n  So you get back to the 60 scientists who advised the Prime Minister \nat that time to join in the Kyoto Treaty, and right now they have all \nsigned a letter advising Prime Minister Harper not to join on or sign \nonto any successor of the Kyoto Treaty.\n  So when we talk about Claude Allegra from France, David Bellamy from \nthe U.K, and Nir Shaviv from Israel, these are people who were on the \nother side who have come over.\n  I think that in my 2-plus-hour presentation I made last Friday, I \ncovered most of the things--the objections that were given on the floor \nby my good friend, Senator Boxer. I see my friend from New Mexico is \nhere. If he would like me to yield the remainder of my time to him, I \nsay to Senator Domenici, I would be glad to do so.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Senator, how much time is that?\n  Mr. INHOFE. I don't know.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). About 4\\1/2\\ minutes remain.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I appreciate that. First, I wish to thank the Senator. \nI wish to say to the Senate, I talked to Senator Lott, and I understand \nthat when the 4\\1/2\\ minutes is up, the regular order will be that we \nreturn to Amtrak; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The Senator indicated to me he was next with some \namendments, but he would be willing to give me about 5 minutes. Now, we \ncan do it either way. We can say, I would like 5 minutes before--what I \nhave been given here, plus 5 before we go to the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator seek unanimous consent?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask unanimous consent to that effect.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That means I can go up to 9\\1/2\\. I am not sure I will, \nbut who knows. This is a favorite subject, so I might talk all night if \nyou let me.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/29/senate-section/article/S13507-1", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13507-S13508]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 ENERGY\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am here because the distinguished \nmajority leader spoke today, and I wasn't here when he talked about the \ntwo Energy bills that are outstanding--maybe it is three. The House has \na couple of Energy bills and we have one, and they are languishing, so \nto speak, because there is no conference, no official conference. The \ndistinguished majority leader used the phrase, saying we ought to marry \nthe two bills. Now, the leader knows I have every bit of respect for \nhim, and I have talked with him about this Energy bill at least 10 \ntimes. I have even suggested in writing some ideas about how we might \nhave a conference that is not a conference but accomplishes the same \nthing. With that, I wish to say right off, Mr. Leader and fellow \nSenators, these two bills are so different, so different, that they are \nincompatible.\n  So you cannot say marry them, because that marriage cannot last. You \ncannot start it because the bills are diametrically different, with the \nexception of a few pieces that are not terribly relevant that are the \nsame. What they have, we don't have; what we have, they don't have. You \ncannot marry them. It is a hard job to work a bill when you don't have \na conference.\n  I will repeat what I have suggested. At least 2 Republican Senators \nwho were part of the big bill--maybe myself from the Energy Committee, \nand maybe Senator Stevens from Commerce--have to be part of negotiating \nevery part of the bill or it is going to be very difficult to get 60 \nvotes in the Senate. I cannot make it any clearer. That is what I have \ntold them. I still say that. I don't know where we do it, but maybe we \ncould informally agree to something like that. So don't bring up a big \npiece of the bill that has been negotiated out between some House \nMembers and Senate Members but you have not worked it with the Senators \nwho put together the basic pieces of the big bill in the Senate.\n  As a member of the Senate Energy Committee for 30 years, I have \nlearned a lot about what it takes to pass a comprehensive, bipartisan \nenergy bill and get it signed. As chairman in 2005, I shepherded \nthrough the Senate the\n\n[[Page S13508]]\n\nmost comprehensive Energy bill in decades. Over time, when fully \nimplemented, this bill will have a very positive impact across every \nsector of energy. Strengthening America's energy security doesn't have \nan overnight solution. It is not something that can be accomplished in \n5-second bites. Instead, it requires long vision and courage to make a \ndifficult decision. Both the Senate and the House have passed bills, as \nI indicated. While the Senate bill takes big, important steps to \ndiversify our fuel sources to increase our energy efficiency and \nconservation, the House bill does little more than, in a sense, \nincrease the energy cost for America.\n  The majority leader suggested that we marry these bills, as I \nindicated. However, this marriage of convenience would be an \ninconvenient burden. I would call it an incompatibility for those who \nfill up their gas tanks and heat their homes.\n  The centerpiece of our Senate efforts on energy is a mandate which \nwould require an increasing portion of our fuel to come from advanced \nbiofuels such as cellulosic ethanol. These newly advanced, clean \nbiofuels will eventually help make America less dependent upon foreign \noil. The House Energy bill contains no such provisions and, in fact, \ntakes steps that would reduce our domestic energy supply. This led a \nformer Member of the Senate to write:\n\n       unless Congress includes provisions for increasing supply, \n     this will remain an energy bill without energy.\n\n  Again, that was a former Senator. I think people could guess who it \nis. He is from down South, maybe from Louisiana.\n  The House repeals numerous provisions of the Energy Policy Act of \n2005 that are already increasing domestic energy production. Across the \ncountry, applications for drilling permits are on the rise. I know a \nlittle bit about it. That is out in my part of the country. I know that \nsounds wrong, but they are on the rise. Last year, we did produce more \noil than we did before because the activities are taking place. We will \nneed to continue this rise to keep up with our Nation's demand for \ndomestic oil and natural gas. Instead of expediting the process of \ndomestic oil and gas production, the House bill slows it down. Instead \nof decreasing domestic gas and oil exploration and production costs, \nthe House bill increases the costs.\n  I guess the answer to that is, well, everybody is making too much \nmoney, so increase costs. Frankly, we don't generally do that in the \nUnited States. That is what we have tried before when we had such \nstrange things as a tax on the rich. We tried an extra tax on oil \nbecause it was making too much money. We got in big trouble because it \nnever did work.\n  The price tag is a $16 billion tax increase on American oil and gas \nproduction--on big and small businesses alike. This is a conservative \nestimate, and I fear one that will increase behind closed doors.\n  The House bill results in a punitive fee on deep sea production or, \nin the alternative, a ban on future leasing altogether. That one is an \ninteresting one. People look at that and say it is good, we ought to do \nit. Incidentally, that is so anti-American, you cannot believe it. I \nbelieve it is also unconstitutional as an ex post facto law. But that \nis not the issue. That is one of the things we are not going to marry \nup because plenty of Members in the Senate--at least on our side of the \naisle--think that because a mistake was made--not made by a Republican \nPresident, it was made during the Presidency of our last Democratic \nPresident. A mistake was made and the royalty requirements were not \nincluded and the bids let. Those people who got those bids and didn't \npay any royalties were trying to collect from them after the fact. That \nis one of their provisions in the House bill and not in ours. You could \ntell that is in for a heavy fight.\n  I don't know whether you could pass a bill in the Senate that had the \ndivision they have. They say any of those companies in that position, \nthey pay up something they don't owe, but they pay it up anyway or they \ncannot drill for 20 years. I cannot imagine anything that looks more \nanti-American, more like a banana republic that takes over oil \ncompanies and releases them and nobody knows what is going on. These \ntypes of measures will reduce our domestic energy supply, increase our \nenergy cost and, over time, play into the hands of the large state-\nowned oil companies in unstable regions around the world.\n  The House-passed Energy bill is a gift to our global competitors in \nChina, Russia, and the Middle East. This is not just an energy issue, \nit is a national security issue. The more we increase our dependence, \nthe less secure we become. The higher prices we put on energy at home, \nthe greater the costs we place on our strategic competitiveness abroad.\n  The House Energy bill doesn't end at increasing costs for consumers \nat the pump. It also targets those of us who use electricity. By \nrequiring States that lack natural resources to meet an unachievable, \nmandatory, renewable portfolio standard, we increase costs. Those who \ncannot meet this standard will simply pay a fee. Remember, that was not \noffered in the Senate. My friend, the chairman of the committee, is for \nthat and he didn't offer it. I speculate that he didn't offer it \nbecause it might have made the bill impossible to pass. But it is in \nthe House bill, so it is not so easy to say let's go and marry them. \nSomebody has to sit down and talk seriously about whether that kind of \nprovision can stand the test of a head count as to whether we can get a \nbill through the Senate.\n\n  If I am needed, I am needed to help get a bill. If I am not needed to \nget a bill, you can marry anything to anything and bring it to the \nfloor and see what can happen.\n  I have been a long-time supporter of renewable energy in both the \nappropriations process and in the Energy Policy Act of 2005. I led \nefforts to protect an offshore wind project in unfair opposition. The \nbill I authored provided the largest and most important tax incentives \nfor renewable energy in American history. We don't need to do anything \nelse to help with wind energy. It is growing at the most rapid pace of \nany of the renewables. As a matter of fact, it is my understanding the \norders for turbines for wind energy are so far behind that you have no \nwait for 2 years. Most of them are being made overseas. You see, it \nwon't do any good--we don't need more States mandated to produce 15 \npercent of their energy through wind, and they are allowing a 4-percent \ncredit or something. We ought to increase the tax incentive, so it is \nnot going out too quickly.\n  I support sound, smart policy on increasing our domestic renewable \nenergy supply, but I oppose tax increases on the American energy \nconsumers.\n  The next 30 years will bring a massive shift in American wealth if we \ncontinue to increase our dependence on foreign oil. That is what will \nhappen. Plainly and simply, the Senate bill moves away from this trend. \nThe House bill does not; it accelerates it. I will say that again. The \nnext 30 years will bring a massive shift of American wealth if we \ncontinue to increase our dependence. That shift is at an incredible \nlevel at this point.\n  For these reasons, we cannot simply marry these two bills in the dark \nof the night. Instead, we need a bipartisan conference committee \nsimilar to the one we had in 2005. If we cannot get it in any official \nway, we are going to have to find a way to do it. It cannot be expected \nthat those on the other side of the aisle will meet with certain \nRepublicans and they will change these bills and say now we have \nmarried the bills and we can pass them. That will not happen.\n  This is a difficult bill on the Senate side but a good one. As a \nmatter of fact, I can say the bill that passed the Senate is one of the \nbest bills we have ever passed. It sort of came from three committees, \nand it is different, but it will certainly, over 10 years, do a lot for \nour country. But you don't put on top of it a tax--this tax of $16 \nbillion. They tried it here and it was defeated on the Energy bill. But \nbecause the House has it, there is talk that we have to marry it up and \ntake their tax provision. Where are you going to get the votes for \nthat? And that is so with other things that are in the House bill and \nnot in ours.\n  I thank Senator Lott for being patient. Clearly, we will discuss the \nissue more and maybe sit down at a table and talk about it among \nSenators of both parties.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/29/senate-section/article/S13509-1", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13509]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S13509]]\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of S. 294, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 294) to reauthorize Amtrak, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Lautenberg (for Carper) amendment No. 3454 (to amendment \n     No. 3452), of a perfecting nature.\n       Allard amendment No. 3455, to strike the provisions \n     repealing Amtrak's self-sufficiency requirements.\n       Bond (for DeMint) amendment No. 3467, to require Amtrak to \n     disclose the Federal subsidy of every ticket sold for \n     transportation on Amtrak.\n       Bond (for DeMint) amendment No. 3468, to increase \n     competition in the American rail system by allowing any \n     qualified rail operator or transportation company to compete \n     for passenger rail service.\n       Bond (for DeMint) amendment No. 3469, to clarify the level \n     of detail to be included in the modern financial accounting \n     and reporting system required under section 203.\n       Bond (for DeMint) amendment No. 3470, to require the \n     Performance Improvement Plan to address reaching financial \n     solvency by eliminating routes and services that do not make \n     a profit.\n       Bond amendment no. 3464, to amend section 24101 of title \n     49, United States Code, to clarify Amtrak's mission.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi is recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, regarding the Amtrak legislation, work was \ndone on Friday and it is being worked on now by our staffs. We had \nadditional amendments that were filed this afternoon and we are going \nthrough them.\n  In the meantime, we have cleared on both sides some nine amendments \nin a variety of areas. Our staffs have worked together, and we have \nreviewed these amendments. They look constructive to me. They are from \nboth sides of the aisle--from Senators Crapo, Tester, Allard, Bond, \nDeMint, Sanders, Coburn, and Hutchison. So we will, in a few moments, \noffer these amendments en bloc for acceptance.\n  I see that Senator Domenici has left the floor. I appreciate his \nremarks on the energy legislation. As on so many issues, he has been \none of our most thoughtful and committed leaders on a variety of \nsubjects. I used to call him our ``No. 1 utility player.'' Wherever you \nhad a complicated substantive issue, if you needed someone to come and \ntalk about it sensibly, whether it was budget issues, energy issues, \nappropriations, energy plants, nuclear issues, he has been such a great \nMember for many years. The Senate will truly miss him upon his \nretirement. Once again, I thought his remarks a few moments ago were \nextremely thoughtful and pointed out some of what we need to be doing \nin the energy policy of this country, and the many problems with trying \nto get to conference.\n  The biggest problem in getting to conference is that the two bills \nare almost irreconcilable. In our bill, we had some very strong \nrequirements with regard to fuel efficiency standards. We knocked out \nthe energy taxes, we refused to put in a high percentage of renewables \nmandates, and we came out with a bill that had in it something worth \nhaving, but we still had some problems.\n  The House had nothing on CAFE standards, the fuel efficiency \nstandards. They went the other direction on renewables, and they went \nthe other direction on taxes.\n  We have a real mess on our hands. We need a national energy policy, \nbut we need one that, hopefully, will create more energy for our \ncountry and not more dependence on foreign oil.\n  We will continue to see if we can find ways to work together across \nthe aisle and across the Capitol to see what can be done. We need to do \nsomething, but I fear we have created such a hodgepodge, we may not be \nable to reach agreement on how to proceed.\n\n\n Amendments Nos. 3475, 3483, 3488, 3485, 3484, 3477, 3476, 3473, 3472, \n                                En Bloc\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I have a package of amendments that have \nbeen cleared on both sides. On behalf of Senator Lautenberg and myself \nand the leadership on both sides, I ask unanimous consent that the \namendments be considered and agreed to en bloc, and the motions to \nreconsider be laid upon the table en bloc: Coburn amendment No. 3475, \nDeMint amendment No. 3483, Hutchison amendment No. 3488, Bond amendment \nNo. 3485, DeMint amendment No. 3484, Crapo amendment No. 3477, Allard \namendment No. 3476, Sanders amendment No. 3473, and Tester amendment \nNo. 3472.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments were agreed to, as follows:\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3475\n\n(Purpose: To require Amtrak to publish a comprehensive annual financial \n   report that allocates revenues and costs among each of its routes)\n\n       On page 14, line 25, strike ``and'' at the end and all that \n     follows through page 15, line 20, and insert the following:\n       (2) shall implement a modern financial accounting and \n     reporting system; and\n       (3) shall, not later than 90 days after the end of each \n     fiscal year through fiscal year 2012--\n       (A) submit to Congress a comprehensive report that \n     allocates all of Amtrak's revenues and costs to each of its \n     routes, each of its lines of business, and each major \n     activity within each route and line of business activity, \n     including--\n       (i) train operations;\n       (ii) equipment maintenance;\n       (iii) food service;\n       (iv) sleeping cars;\n       (v) ticketing; and\n       (vi) reservations;\n       (B) include the report described in subparagraph (A) in \n     Amtrak's annual report; and\n       (C) post such report on Amtrak's website.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3483\n\n   (Purpose: To encourage private sector funding of passenger trains)\n\n       On page 58, lines 3 through 5, strike ``its operation of \n     trains funded by the private sector in order to minimize its \n     need for Federal subsidies.'' and insert ``the operation of \n     trains funded by, or in partnership with, private sector \n     operators through competitive contracting to minimize the \n     need for Federal subsidies.''\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3488\n\n  (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate regarding the need to \n          maintain Amtrak as a national passenger rail system)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE NEED TO MAINTAIN \n                   AMTRAK AS A NATIONAL PASSENGER RAIL SYSTEM.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) In fiscal year 2007, 3,800,000 passengers traveled on \n     Amtrak's long distance trains, an increase of 2.4 percent \n     over fiscal year 2006.\n       (2) Amtrak long-distance routes generated $376,000,000 in \n     revenue in fiscal year 2007, an increase of 5 percent over \n     fiscal year 2006.\n       (3) Amtrak operates 15 long-distance trains over 18,500 \n     route miles that serve 39 States and the District of \n     Columbia. These trains provide the only rail passenger \n     service to 23 States.\n       (4) Amtrak's long-distance trains provide an essential \n     transportation service for many communities and to a \n     significant percentage of the general public.\n       (5) Many long-distance trains serve small communities with \n     limited or no significant air or bus service, especially in \n     remote or isolated areas in the United States.\n       (6) As a result of airline deregulation and decisions by \n     national bus carriers to leave many communities, rail \n     transportation may provide the only feasible common carrier \n     transportation option for a growing number of areas.\n       (7) If long-distance trains were eliminated, 23 States and \n     243 communities would be left with no intercity passenger \n     rail service and 16 other States would lose some rail \n     service. These trains provide a strong economic benefit for \n     the States and communities that they serve.\n       (8) Long-distance trains also provide transportation during \n     periods of severe weather or emergencies that stall other \n     modes of transportation.\n       (9) Amtrak provided the only reliable long-distance \n     transportation following the September 11, 2001 terrorist \n     attacks that grounded air travel.\n       (10) The majority of passengers on long-distance trains do \n     not travel between the endpoints, but rather between any \n     combination of cities along the route.\n       (11) Passenger trains provide transportation options, \n     mobility for underserved populations, congestion mitigation, \n     and jobs in the areas they serve.\n       (12) Passenger rail has a positive impact on the \n     environment compared to other modes of transportation by \n     conserving energy, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and \n     cutting down on other airborne particulate and toxic \n     emissions.\n       (13) Amtrak communities that are served use passenger rail \n     and passenger rail stations as a significant source of \n     economic development.\n\n[[Page S13510]]\n\n       (14) This Act makes meaningful and important reforms to \n     increase the efficiency, profitability and on-time \n     performance of Amtrak's long-distance routes.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) long-distance passenger rail is a vital and necessary \n     part of our national transportation system and economy; and\n       (2) Amtrak should maintain a national passenger rail \n     system, including long-distance routes, that connects the \n     continental United States from coast to coast and from border \n     to border.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3485\n\n  (Purpose: To provide a mission statement for Amtrak, and for other \n                               purposes)\n\n       On page 11, between lines 22 and 23, insert the following:\n       (e) Amtrak's Mission.--\n       (1) Section 24101 is amended--\n        (A) by striking ``purpose'' in the section heading and \n     inserting ``mission'';\n       (B) by striking subsection (b) and inserting the following:\n       ``(b) Mission.--\n       ``(1) In general.--The mission of Amtrak is to provide \n     efficient and effective intercity passenger rail mobility \n     consisting of high quality service that is trip-time \n     competitive with other intercity travel options and that is \n     consistent with the goals of subsection (d).\n       ``(2) Performance measurement.--All measurements of Amtrak \n     performance, including decisions on whether, and to what \n     extent, to provide operating subsidies, shall be based on \n     Amtrak's ability to carry out the mission described in \n     paragraph (1).''; and\n       (C) by redesignating paragraphs (9) through (11) in \n     subsection (c) as paragraphs (10) through (12), respectively, \n     and inserting after paragraph (8) the following:\n       ``(9) provide redundant or complimentary intercity \n     transportation service to ensure mobility in times of \n     national disaster or other instances where other travel \n     options are not adequately available;''.\n       (2) Conforming amendment.--The chapter analysis for chapter \n     241 is amended by striking the item relating to section 24101 \n     and inserting the following:\n\n``24101.

Without objection, the Senator may proceed.\n\n\n                          Florida and the DNC\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I have come to the Senate floor \ntoday to inform colleagues of both parties that there is a monumental \nlegal issue that has arisen between the Democratic National Committee \nand the voters of the State of Florida, specifically the 4\\1/4\\ million \nregistered Democrats. The Democratic National Committee, the DNC, has \nexacted punishment upon Florida Democrats because the State legislature \nof Florida moved its Presidential primary from March to January 29. \nBoth parties said they would bring about retribution on any one State, \nother than four privileged States--the Nevada caucus, the Iowa caucus, \nthe New Hampshire primary, and the South Carolina primary--if any other \nState moved ahead of February 5, earlier than February 5.\n  The Florida Legislature, in its wisdom last spring--last May, May of \nthis year--decided to make the move to January 29. This is a \nlegislature that is two-thirds Republican. That legislation, setting \nthe date of January 29, was signed into law by Governor Crist, who \nhimself is a Republican.\n  In the course of deliberation of the legislation, the Democratic \nleader in the State senate offered an amendment to move the primary \nlater, from January 29, 2008, to February 5, thus to comply with the \nrequest and rules of the DNC. That amendment was voted down.\n  Thus, a duly called election, pursuant to State law, is, in fact, \ngoing to be conducted by the machinery of the government of the State \nof Florida and paid for by the government of the State of Florida--\nestimated to the tune of some $18 million of taxpayer money--in order \nto have this Presidential primary. Because Florida law set the date of \nJanuary 29, municipalities have now moved all of their elections to \nconcur with January 29. Indeed, also on the ballot is expected to\n\n[[Page S13511]]\n\nbe a major constitutional amendment for the voters to decide upon \nhaving to do with a different subject matter, a matter of great import \nto the people of Florida, and that is the amount of their real estate \ntaxes. In other words, it is expected to be a big turnout on January \n29. That is Florida law.\n  But the DNC took great umbrage at the State of Florida and said: \nUnder the rules we are going to penalize you by taking away one-half of \nyour delegates. Concurrently, the Republican National Committee \nlikewise took away one-half of the delegates at the quadrennial \nnominating conventions to be held later this year. Then the DNC decided \nit was going to exact additional punishment and took the punitive \nmeasure of taking away all of Florida's delegates.\n  But that is not all. The DNC then further decided that it would \npenalize Florida further by prohibiting the Presidential candidates \nfrom coming into the State and campaigning. Campaigning was defined \nunder the rules of the DNC as talking with voters, having any kind of \ncommunication, hiring staff, opening an office, having any kind of \nadvertising, whether in print or electronically, or holding press \nconferences; in other words, to muzzle the Presidential candidates so \nthey could not go into the State of Florida--with one huge exception: \nthat they could go into the State of Florida to raise money. They \ncouldn't campaign, couldn't talk to ordinary voters, but they could \ncome in to raise money.\n  The net effect is the only way a Florida Democrat could have \ninteraction with a Presidential candidate one on one is to have to pay \nfor that participation.\n  This was further enhanced by the four States that I mentioned that \nwant to go first--the Iowa caucus, the Nevada caucus, the New Hampshire \nprimary, and the South Carolina primary--those four States exacting a \npledge in writing from the Presidential candidates who said they would \nnot have any campaigning in a State that moved its primary earlier than \nFebruary 5--except those four States.\n  This is a little sensitive for us in Florida, naturally, as I have \njust come from the State Democratic Convention where not any of the \nmajor Presidential candidates have appeared. But, of course, they come \nand go from time to time into Florida to raise money. Of course, what a \ncontrast that is, since the only penalty by the Republican National \nCommittee was to take away half of Florida's Republican delegates. They \ndid not stop their candidates from coming in. Indeed, 1 week ago--a \nsignificant contrast with the State Republican Convention--all of the \nPresidential candidates were there, and indeed they ended up, the State \nRepublican Convention, with a televised debate of all the Republican \nPresidential candidates.\n  This should concern not only Floridians, and it should concern not \nonly Democrats, it ought to concern all voters because it is the \nprinciple of one person, one vote. That is a principle that has long \nbeen established in law and established by the Supreme Court of the \nUnited States. In order to enforce that principle, I, along with \nothers, including the chairman of our Florida Democratic delegation, \nCongressman Alcee Hastings, have filed a federal lawsuit in Federal \nDistrict Court against the political party bosses in Washington. Our \nlawsuit is about the right of every American to have access to the \nballot box and to have their ballot counted and to have their ballot \ncounted as intended.\n  In this lawsuit we are fighting for every person who takes time to \nstand in line in the rain or in the cold, at the local church or the \nprecinct house, to vote and to come outside from that precinct house \nfeeling as if they did their part in this grand American process.\n  Those of us who filed this lawsuit believe there is no reason that \ncan excuse the denial of this fundamental right to vote. Certainly, as \nwe see by this fracas that has erupted by members of the DNC saying: Go \non and have your Presidential primary vote, Florida, on January 29, but \njust make it a beauty contest because it is not going to count--it \ncertainly points to the fact that this Presidential primary system is \nbroken, and it desperately needs to be reformed. But the answer is not \nto deny people the right to vote and to have that vote count.\n  For 2008, there is an easy, short-term fix. This Senator suggested \nthis fix last summer to Howard Dean in writing, in person, and over the \ntelephone; that is, if you had the States that want to go early to move \nup a little early, then everyone has the same order, and the law of \nFlorida is complied with since there is nothing we can do about it. It \nis the law. The election in the Presidential primary process is going \nto be January 29 in Florida.\n  No one would pay any attention to that easy, short-term fix, but that \nis in effect what is happening right now because, as of yesterday, Iowa \nDemocrats joined Iowa Republicans and moved the Presidential caucus up \nto January 3. It is expected that the New Hampshire secretary of \nState--who has sole authority to set the date of New Hampshire's \nprimary election--will move the date of the primary in New Hampshire to \nsomething within a week of Iowa's January 3 caucus. What was suggested \nas a compromise last summer, without all of this punishment that has \nbeen levied, in effect is starting to happen.\n  For the long term we can fashion a solution that takes into account \nthe larger States as well as the small States. Let all of them have a \nfair say in a system rotating regional primaries, similar to the ones \nSenator Levin and I have introduced in the Senate. But in the process \nof exacting this punishment on Florida, it is equally troubling that \nthe average citizen in Florida can no longer see their candidates for \nPresident because, as I explained, the party bosses have barred them \nfrom campaigning in Florida--except for the private fundraisers.\n  This is unacceptable. Paying for political participation is \nunacceptable, and in a bygone era--one that we do not want to return \nto--that was called a poll tax.\n  Just recently we saw a measure of Florida voters overwhelmingly \nagree, regardless of their party affiliation, that they do not think \nthis is right. A just-released Quinnipiac Poll says by a margin of 62 \nto 16 Florida voters--that is, Republicans, Independents, and \nDemocrats--believe it is wrong to strip us of the delegates to the \nnominating convention. That same poll also shows the delegate ban may \nbe hurting our own Presidential candidates.\n  In this latest Quinnipiac Poll, it has been basically neck and neck \nbetween Presidential candidate Giuliani and Presidential candidate \nClinton. As Clinton was in the lead, now Giuliani has suddenly gone \ninto the lead. Very significantly, in that same Quinnipiac Poll of \nindependent voters, 22 percent of those independent voters said they \nare less likely to consider voting for the Democrat for President in \nthe general election because of the DNC's shenanigans.\n  Mr. Chairman, Howard Dean, I hope you are listening to our plea. If \nyou are not going to listen on the merits of the case, that polling \ndata is certainly why, Mr. Chairman Dean, you should lift the ban \nbecause you are giving an additional opportunity, an advantage to the \nRepublicans in the general election in the State of Florida.\n  I have today formulated a motion for summary judgment to be offered \nin the next couple of days in the Federal District Court where the \nlawsuit has been filed. Today is the last day upon which the defendant, \nChairman Howard Dean, and the defendants, the members of the Democratic \nNational Committee, have to answer the lawsuit. Upon the basis of their \nanswer, it is my intention and the intention of the other plaintiffs to \nthis lawsuit of filing a motion for summary judgment that sets out the \nlegal and constitutional arguments of why the judge should, in fact, \nstop this travesty of taking away votes from more than 4.25 million \nregistered Democratic voters in the State of Florida.\n  It does not have to be this way. If, in fact, the DNC recognizes that \nall these other States are moving forward to earlier dates, then the \nsequence is preserved for those who wanted to be first. Whether that is \njustified, their sequence is preserved, and we can go on about getting \nour eye focused on the November 2008 election, instead of going through \nall of this rhubarb that is now engulfing the election apparatus.\n  It is my hope that now the other States are jumping to an earlier \ndate, the DNC will see the wisdom of putting\n\n[[Page S13512]]\n\nthis all behind us, of joining together as the family we are, stop the \nfamily squabbles, unite, and then start focusing later on the 2008 \nNovember election.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill.)

The Ethics Committee recently issued guidance to \nthe Rules Committee that making more than one reservation for official \ntravel with a participating airline would not constitute a gift under \nSenate rule XXXV, the Gift Rule. Consistent with the Ethics Committee's \nguidance, the transportation expenses section of the U.S. Senate Travel \nRegulations has been updated to address the issue of making more than \none reservation on scheduled flights.\n  The following statement has been added to I.B of the transportation \nexpenses section, found on page IV-64 of the U.S. Senate Handbook:\n\n       3. A Member shall be permitted to make more than one \n     reservation on scheduled flights with participating airlines \n     when such action assists the Member in conducting his/her \n     official business.\n\n  This change is effective immediately.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the updated U.S. Senate \nTravel Regulations be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nAuthority of the Committee on Rules and Administration to Issue Senate \n                           Travel Regulations\n\n       The travel regulations herein have been promulgated by the \n     Committee on Rules and Administration pursuant to the \n     authority vested in it by paragraph 1(n)(1)8 of Rule XXV of \n     the Standing Rules of the Senate and by section 68 of Title 2 \n     of the United States Code, the pertinent portions of which \n     provisions are as follows:\n\n\n                      Standing Rules of the Senate\n\n                                Rule XXV\n\n                           Paragraph 1(n)(1)8\n\n       (n)(1) Committee on Rules and Administration, to which \n     committee shall be referred . . . matters relating to the \n     following subjects: . . .\n       8.

The \n     administrative approval of the voucher will constitute the \n     approvals required. It is expected that ordinarily the \n     authority will be issued prior to the expenses being incurred \n     and will specify the travel to be performed as such possible \n     unless circumstances in a particular case prevent such \n     action.\n       E. Official Travel Authorizations: The General Services \n     Administration, on behalf of the Committee on Rules and \n     Administration, has contracted with several air carriers to \n     provide discount air fares for Members, Officers, and \n     employees of the Senate only when traveling on official \n     business. This status is identifiable to the contracting air \n     carriers by one of the following ways:\n       1. The use of a government issued travel charge card.\n       2. The use of an ``Official Travel Authorization'' form \n     which must be submitted to the air carrier prior to \n     purchasing a ticket. These forms must be personally approved \n     by the Senator, chairman, or Officer of the Senate under \n     whose authority the travel for official business is taking \n     place. Payment must be made in advance by cash, credit card, \n     check, or money order. The Official Travel Authorization \n     forms are available in the Senate Disbursing Office.\n       II. Funds for Traveling Expenses\n       A. Individuals traveling on official business for the \n     Senate will provide themselves with sufficient funds for all \n     current expenses, and are expected to exercise the same care \n     in incurring expenses that a prudent person would exercise if \n     traveling on personal business.\n       1. Travel Advances\n       (a) Advances to Committees (P.L. 81-118)\n       (1) Chairmen of joint committees operating from the \n     contingent fund of the Senate, and chairmen of standing, \n     special, select, policy, or conference committees of the \n     Senate, may requisition an advance of the funds authorized \n     for their respective committees.\n       (a) When any duty is imposed upon a committee involving \n     expenses that are ordered to be paid out of the contingent \n     fund of the Senate, upon vouchers to be approved by the \n     chairman of the committee charged with such duty, the receipt \n     of such chairman for any sum advanced to him[her] or his[her] \n     order out of said contingent fund by the Secretary of the \n     Senate for committee expenses not involving personal services \n     shall be taken and passed by the accounting officers of the \n     Government as a full and sufficient voucher; but it shall be \n     the duty of such chairman, as soon as practicable, to furnish \n     to the Secretary of the Senate vouchers in detail for the \n     expenses so incurred.\n       (2) Upon presentation of the properly signed statutory \n     advance voucher, the Disbursing Office will make the original \n     advance to the chairman or his/her representative. This \n     advance may be in the form of a check, or in cash, receipted \n     for on the voucher by the person receiving the advance. Under \n     no circumstances are advances to be used for the payment of \n     salaries or obligations, other than petty cash transactions \n     of the committee.\n       (3) In no case shall a cash advance be paid more than seven \n     (7) calendar days prior to the commencement of official \n     travel.

Requests for advances in the \n     form of a check should be received by the Senate Disbursing \n     Office no less than five (5) calendar days prior to the \n     commencement of official travel. The amount of the advance \n     then becomes the responsibility of the individual receiving \n     the advance, in that he/she must return the amount advanced \n     before or shortly after the expiration of the authority under \n     which these funds were obtained.\n       (Regulations Governing Cash Advances for Official Senate \n     Travel adopted by the Committee on Rules and Administration, \n     effective July 23, 1987, pursuant to S.

For purposes of this provision, ``usual place of \n     residence'' in the home state shall encompass the area within \n     thirty-five (35) miles of the residence (by the most direct \n     route). If a Member has no ``usual place of residence'' in \n     his/her home state, he/she may designate a ``voting \n     residence,'' or any other ``legal residence,'' pursuant to \n     state law (including the area within thirty-five (35) miles \n     of such residence), as his/her duty station.\n       B. Officer and Employee Duty Station\n       1. In the case of an officer or employee, reimbursement for \n     official travel expenses other than interdepartmental \n     transportation shall be made only for trips which begin and \n     end in Washington, D.C., or, in the case of an employee \n     assigned to an office of a Senator in the Senator's home \n     state, on trips which begin and end at the place where such \n     office is located.\n       2. Travel may begin and/or end at the Senate traveler's \n     residence when such deviation from the duty station locale is \n     more advantageous to the government.\n       3. For purposes of these regulations, the ``duty station'' \n     shall encompass the area within thirty-five (35) miles from \n     where the Senator's home state office or designated duty \n     station is located.\n       C. No employee of the Senate, relative or supervisor of the \n     employee may directly benefit monetarily from the expenditure \n     of appropriated funds which reimburse expenses associated \n     with official Senate travel. Therefore, reimbursements are \n     not permitted for mortgage payments, or rental fees \n     associated with any type of leasehold interest.\n       D. A duty station for employees, other than Washington, \n     D.C., may be designated by\n\n[[Page S13515]]\n\n     Members, Committee Chairmen, and Officers of the Senate upon \n     written designation of such station to the Senate Disbursing \n     Office. Such designation shall include a statement that the \n     Member or Officer has read and agrees to the pertinent travel \n     regulations on permissible reimbursements. The duty station \n     may be the city of the office location or the city of \n     residence.\n       E. For purposes of these regulations, the metropolitan area \n     of Washington, D.C., shall be defined as follows:\n       1. The District of Columbia\n       2. Maryland Counties of\n       a) Charles\n       b) Montgomery\n       c) Prince Georges\n       3. Virginia Counties of\n       a) Arlington\n       b) Fairfax\n       c) Loudoun\n       d) Prince William\n       4. Virginia Cities of\n       a) Alexandria\n       b) Fairfax\n       c) Falls Church\n       d) Manassas\n       e) Manassas Park\n       5. Airport locations of\n       (a) Baltimore/Washington International Thurgood Marshall \n     Airport\n       (b) Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport\n       (c) Washington Dulles International Airport\n       F. When the legislative business of the Senate requires \n     that a Member be present, then the round trip actual \n     transportation expenses incurred in traveling from the city \n     within the United States where the Member is located to \n     Washington, D.C., may be reimbursed from official Senate \n     funds.\n       G. Any deviation from this policy will be considered on a \n     case by case basis upon the written request to, and approval \n     from, the Committee on Rules and Administration.\n       V. Travel Expense Reimbursement Vouchers\n       A. All persons authorized to travel on official business \n     for the Senate should keep a memorandum of expenditures \n     properly chargeable to the Senate, noting each item at the \n     time the expense is incurred, together with the date, and the \n     information thus accumulated should be made available for the \n     proper preparation of travel vouchers which must be itemized \n     on an official expense summary report and stated in \n     accordance with these regulations. The official expense \n     summary report form is available at the Senate Disbursing \n     Office or through the Senate Intranet.\n       B. Computer generated vouchers should be submitted with a \n     signed original. Every travel voucher must show in the space \n     provided for such information on the voucher form the dates \n     of travel, the official travel itinerary, the value of the \n     transportation, per diem expenses, incidental expenses, and \n     conference/training fees incurred.\n       C. Travel vouchers must be supported by receipts for \n     expenses in excess of $50. In addition, the Committee on \n     Rules and Administration reserves the right to request \n     additional clarification and/or certification upon the audit \n     of any expense seeking reimbursement from the contingent fund \n     of the Senate regardless of the expense amount.\n       D. When presented independently, credit card receipts such \n     as Visa, Master Charge, or Diners Club, etc. are not \n     acceptable documentation for lodging. If a hotel bill is lost \n     or misplaced, then the credit card receipt accompanied by a \n     certifying letter from the traveler to the Financial Clerk of \n     the Senate will be considered necessary documentation. Such \n     letter must itemize the total expenses in support of the \n     credit card receipt.\n\n                        Transportation Expenses\n\n       I. Common Carrier Transportation and Accommodations\n       A. Transportation includes all necessary official travel on \n     railroads, airlines, helicopters, buses, streetcars, \n     taxicabs, and other usual means of conveyance. Transportation \n     may include fares and such expenses incidental to \n     transportation such as but not limited to baggage transfer. \n     When a claim is made for common carrier transportation \n     obtained with cash, the travel voucher must show the amount \n     spent, including Federal transportation tax, and the mode of \n     transportation used.\n       1. Train Accommodations\n       (a) Sleeping-car accommodations: The lowest first class \n     sleeping accommodations available shall be allowed when night \n     travel is involved. When practicable, through sleeping \n     accommodations should be obtained in all cases where more \n     economical to the Senate.\n       (b) Parlor-car and coach accommodations: One seat in a \n     sleeping or parlor car will be allowed. Where adequate coach \n     accommodations are available, coach accommodations should be \n     used to the maximum extent possible, on the basis of \n     advantage to the Senate, suitability and convenience to the \n     traveler, and nature of the business involved.\n       2. Airplane Accommodations\n       (a) First-class and air-coach accommodations: It is the \n     policy of the Senate that persons who use commercial air \n     carriers for transportation on official business shall use \n     less than first-class accommodations instead of those \n     designated first-class with due regard to efficient conduct \n     of Senate business and the travelers' convenience, safety, \n     and comfort.\n       (b) Use of United States-flag air carriers: All official \n     air travel shall be performed on United States-flag air \n     carriers except where travel on other aircraft (1) is \n     essential to the official business concerned, or (2) is \n     necessary to avoid unreasonable delay, expense, or \n     inconvenience.\n       B. Change in Travel Plans: When a traveler finds he/she \n     will not use accommodations which have been reserved for him/\n     her, he/she must release them within the time limits \n     specified by the carriers. Likewise, where transportation \n     service furnished is inferior to that called for by a ticket \n     or where a journey is terminated short of the destination \n     specified, the traveler must report such facts to the proper \n     official. Failure of travelers to take such action may \n     subject them to liability for any resulting losses.\n       1. ``No show'' charges, if incurred by Members or staff \n     personnel in connection with official Senate travel, shall \n     not be considered payable or reimbursable from the contingent \n     fund of the Senate.\n       2. Senate travelers exercising proper prudence can make \n     timely cancellations when necessary in order to avoid ``no \n     show'' assessments.\n       3. A Member shall be permitted to make more than one \n     reservation on scheduled flights with participating airlines \n     when such action assists the Member in conducting his/her \n     official business.\n       C. Compensation Packages: In the event that a Senate \n     traveler is denied passage or gives up his/her reservation \n     due to overbooking on transportation for which he/she held a \n     reservation and this results in a payment of any rebate, this \n     payment shall not be considered as a personal receipt by the \n     traveler, but rather as a payment to the Senate, the agency \n     for which and at whose expense the travel is being performed.\n       1. Such payments shall be submitted to the appropriate \n     individual for the proper disposition when the traveler \n     submits his/her expense account.\n       2. Through fares, special fares, commutation fares, \n     excursion, and reduced-rate round trip fares should be used \n     for official travel when it can be determined prior to the \n     start of a trip that any such type of service is practical \n     and economical to the Senate.\n       3. Round-trip tickets should be secured only when, on the \n     basis of the journey as planned, it is known or can be \n     reasonably anticipated that such tickets will be utilized.\n       D. Ticket Preparation Fees: Each Chairman, Senator, or \n     Officer of the Senate may, at his/her discretion, authorize \n     in extenuating circumstances the reimbursement of penalty \n     fees associated with the cancellation of through fares, \n     special fares, commutation fares, excursion, reduced-rate \n     round trip fares and fees for travel arrangements, provided \n     that reimbursement of such fees offers the best value and \n     does not exceed $30.\n       E. Frequent Flyer Miles: Travel promotional awards (e.g. \n     free travel, travel discounts, upgrade certificates, coupons, \n     frequent flyer miles, access to carrier club facilities, and \n     other similar travel promotional items) obtained by a Member, \n     officer or employee of the Senate while on official travel \n     may be utilized for personal use at the discretion of the \n     Member or officer pursuant to this section.\n       1. Travel Awards may be retained and used at the sole \n     discretion of the Member or officer only if the Travel Awards \n     are obtained under the same terms and conditions as those \n     offered to the general public and no favorable treatment is \n     extended on the basis of the Member, officer or employee's \n     position with the Federal Government.\n       2. Members, officers and employees may only retain Travel \n     Awards for personal use when such Travel Awards have been \n     obtained at no additional cost to the Federal Government. It \n     should be noted that any fees assessed in connection with the \n     use of Travel Awards shall be considered a personal expense \n     of the Member, officer or employee and under no circumstances \n     shall be paid for or reimbursed from official funds.\n       3. Although this section permits Members, officers and \n     employees of the Senate to use Travel Awards at the \n     discretion of the Member or officer, the Committee encourages \n     the use of such Travel Awards (whenever practicable) to \n     offset the cost of future official travel.\n       F. Indirect Travel: In case a person, for his/her own \n     convenience, travels by an indirect route or interrupts \n     travel by direct route, the extra expense will be borne by \n     the traveler. Reimbursement for expenses shall be allowed \n     only on such charges as would have been incurred by the \n     official direct route. Personal travel should be noted on the \n     traveler's expense summary report when it interrupts official \n     travel.\n       G. Public Transportation During Official Travel: \n     Transportation by bus, streetcar, subway, or taxicab, when \n     used in connection with official travel, will be allowed as \n     an official transportation expense.\n       H. Dual Purpose Travel: Dual purpose travel occurs when a \n     Senator, staffer, or other official traveler conducts both \n     Senatorial office business and Committee office business \n     during the same trip. The initial point at which official \n     business is conducted will determine the fund which will be \n     charged for travel expenses from and to Washington, D.C. \n     Examples include:\n       1. If committee business is conducted at the first stop in \n     the trip, travel expenses from Washington, D.C., to said \n     point and return will be chargeable to the committee's funds. \n     Additional travel expenses from said point to other points in \n     the United States, incurred by reason of conducting \n     senatorial business, will be charged to the Senators' \n     Official Personnel and Office Expense Account.\n\n[[Page S13516]]\n\n       2. If senatorial business is conducted at the first stop in \n     the trip, travel expenses from Washington, D.C., to said \n     point and return will be chargeable to the Senators' Official \n     Personnel and Office Expense Account. Committee funds will be \n     charged with any additional travel expenses incurred for the \n     purpose of performing committee business.\n       I. Interrupted Travel: If a traveler interrupts official \n     travel for personal business, the traveler may be reimbursed \n     for transportation expenses incurred which are less than or \n     equal to the amount the traveler would have been reimbursed \n     had he/she not interrupted travel for personal business. \n     Likewise, if a traveler departs from or returns to a city \n     other than the traveler's duty station or residence for \n     personal business, then the traveler may be reimbursed for \n     transportation expenses incurred which are less than or equal \n     to the amount the traveler would have been reimbursed had the \n     witness departed from and returned to his/her duty station or \n     residence.\n       II. Baggage\n       A. The term ``baggage'' as used in these regulations means \n     Senate property and personal property of the traveler \n     necessary for the purposes of the official travel.\n       B. Baggage in excess of the weight or of size greater than \n     carried free by transportation companies will be classed as \n     excess baggage. Where air-coach or air-tourist accommodations \n     are used, transportation of baggage up to the weight carried \n     free on first-class service is authorized without charge to \n     the traveler; otherwise excess baggage charges will be an \n     allowable expense.\n       C. Necessary charges for the transfer of baggage will be \n     allowed. Charges for the storage of baggage will be allowed \n     when such storage was solely on account of official business. \n     Charges for porters and checking baggage at transportation \n     terminals will be allowed.\n       III. Use of Conveyances: When authorized by the employing \n     Senator, Chairman, or Officer of the Senate, certain \n     conveyances may be used when traveling on official Senate \n     business. Specific types of conveyances are privately owned, \n     special, and private airplane.\n       A. Privately Owned\n       1. Chairmen of committees, Senators, Officers of the \n     Senate, and employees, regardless of subsistence status and \n     hours of travel, shall, whenever such mode of transportation \n     is authorized or approved as more advantageous to the Senate, \n     be paid the appropriate mileage allowance in lieu of actual \n     expenses of transportation. This amount should not exceed the \n     maximum amount authorized by statute for use of privately \n     owned motorcycles, automobiles, or airplanes, when engaged in \n     official business within or outside their designated duty \n     stations. It is the responsibility of the office to fix such \n     rates, within the maximum, as will most nearly compensate the \n     traveler for necessary expenses.\n       2. In addition to the mileage allowance there may be \n     allowed reimbursement for the actual cost of automobile \n     parking fees (except parking fees associated with commuting); \n     ferry fees; bridge, road, and tunnel costs; and airplane \n     landing and tie-down fees.\n       3. When transportation is authorized or approved for \n     motorcycles or automobiles, mileage between points traveled \n     shall be certified by the traveler. Such mileage should be in \n     accordance with the Standard Highway Mileage Guide. Any \n     substantial deviations shall be explained on the \n     reimbursement voucher.\n       4. In lieu of the use of taxicab, payment on a mileage \n     basis at a rate not to exceed the maximum amount authorized \n     by statute will be allowed for the round-trip mileage of a \n     privately owned vehicle used in connection with an employee \n     going from either his/her place of abode or place of business \n     to a terminal or from a terminal to either his/her place of \n     abode or place of business: Provided, that the amount of \n     reimbursement for round-trip mileage shall not in either \n     instance exceed the taxicab fare for a one-way trip between \n     such applicable points, notwithstanding the obligations of \n     reasonable schedules.\n       5. Parking Fees: Parking fees for privately owned vehicles \n     may be incurred in the duty station when the traveler is \n     engaged in interdepartmental transportation or when the \n     traveler is leaving their duty station and entering into a \n     travel status. The fee for parking a vehicle at a common \n     carrier terminal, or other parking area, while the traveler \n     is away from his/her official station, will be allowed only \n     to the extent that the fee, plus the allowable mileage \n     reimbursement, to and from the terminal or other parking \n     area, does not exceed the estimated cost for use of a taxicab \n     to and from the terminal.\n       6. Mileage for use of privately owned airplanes shall be \n     certified from airway charts issued by the National Oceanic \n     and Atmospheric Administration, Department of Commerce, and \n     will be reported on the reimbursement voucher and used in \n     computing payment. If a detour was necessary due to adverse \n     weather, mechanical difficulty, or other unusual conditions, \n     the additional air mileage may be included in the mileage \n     reported on the reimbursement voucher and, if included, it \n     must be explained.\n       7. Mileage shall be payable to only one of two or more \n     employees traveling together on the same trip and in the same \n     vehicle, but no deduction shall be made from the mileage \n     otherwise payable to the employee entitled thereto by reason \n     of the fact that other passengers (whether or not Senate \n     employees) may travel with him/her and contribute in \n     defraying the operating expenses. The names of Senate Members \n     or employees accompanying the traveler must be stated on the \n     travel voucher.\n       8. When damages to a privately owned vehicle occur due to \n     the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any Member, \n     Officer, or employee of the Senate while acting within the \n     scope of his/her employment, relief may be sought under the \n     Federal Tort Claims Act. Information on who to contact will \n     go here.\n       B. Special\n       1. General:\n       (a) The hire of boat, automobile, aircraft, or other \n     conveyance will be allowed if authorized or approved as \n     advantageous to the Senate whenever the Member or employee is \n     engaged on official business outside his/her designated duty \n     station.\n       (b) Where two or more persons travel together by means of \n     such special conveyance, that fact, together with the names \n     of those accompanying him/her, must be stated by each \n     traveler on his/her travel voucher and the aggregate cost \n     reimbursable will be subject to the limitation stated above.\n       (c) If the hire of a special conveyance includes payment by \n     the traveler of the incidental expenses of gasoline or oil, \n     rent of garage, hangar, or boathouse, subsistence of \n     operator, ferriage, tolls, operator waiting time, charges for \n     returning conveyances to the original point of hire, etc., \n     the same should be first paid, if practicable, by the person \n     furnishing the accommodation, or his/her operator, and \n     itemized in the bill.\n       2. Rental Cars:\n       (a) In no case may automobiles be hired for use in the \n     metropolitan area of Washington, D.C., by anyone whose duty \n     station is Washington, D.C.\n       (b) Reimbursements for rental of special conveyances will \n     be limited to the cost applicable to a conveyance of a size \n     necessary for a single traveler regardless of the number of \n     authorized travelers transported by said vehicle, unless the \n     use of a larger class vehicle on a shared cost basis is \n     specifically approved in advance by the Committee on Rules \n     and Administration, or the form `Request for a Waiver of the \n     Travel Regulations' is submitted with the voucher, and found \n     in order upon audit by the Rules Committee.\n       (c) For administrative purposes, reimbursement may be \n     payable to only one of two or more Senate travelers traveling \n     together on the same trip and in the same vehicle.\n       (d) Government Rate: In connection with the hire of an \n     automobile for the use in conducting Senate business outside \n     of Washington, D.C., it should be noted that the Military \n     Traffic Management Command (MTMC), a division of the \n     Department of Defense, arranges all rental car agreements for \n     the government.\n       (1) These negotiated car rental rates are for federal \n     employees traveling on official business and include \n     unlimited mileage, plus full comprehensive and collision \n     coverage (CDW) on rented vehicles at no cost to the traveler.\n       (2) For guidance on rate structure and the companies \n     participating in these rate agreements, call the approved \n     Senate vendor (currently the Combined Airline Ticket Office \n     (CATO)).\n       (3) Individuals traveling on behalf of the United States \n     Senate should use these companies to the maximum extent \n     possible since these agreements provide full coverage with no \n     extra fee. The Senate will not pay for separate insurance \n     charges; therefore, any individuals who choose to use non-\n     participatory car rental agencies may be personally \n     responsible for any damages or liability accrued while on \n     official Senate business.\n       (e) Insurance: In connection with the rental of vehicles \n     from commercial sources, the Senate will not pay or reimburse \n     for the cost of the loss/damage waiver (LDW), collision \n     damage waiver (CDW) or collision damage insurance available \n     in commercial rental contracts for an extra fee.\n       (1) The waiver or insurance referred to is the type offered \n     a renter to release him/her from liability for damage to the \n     rented vehicle in amounts up to the amount deductible on the \n     insurance included as part of the rental contract without \n     additional charge.\n       (2) The cost of personal accident insurance is a personal \n     expense and is not reimbursable.\n       (3) Accidents While On Official Travel: Collision damage to \n     a rented vehicle, for which the traveler is liable while on \n     official business, will be considered an official travel \n     expense of the Senate up to the deductible amount contained \n     in the rental contract. Such claims shall be considered by \n     the Sergeant at Arms of the Senate on a case by case basis \n     and, when authorized, settled from the contingent fund of the \n     Senate under the line item--Reserve for Contingencies. This \n     is consistent with the long-standing policy of the government \n     to self-insure its own risks of loss or damage to government \n     property and the liability of government employees for \n     actions within the scope of their official duties.\n       (4) However, when damages to a rented vehicle occurs due to \n     the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any Member, \n     Officer, or employee of the Senate while acting within the \n     scope of his/her employment, relief may be sought under the \n     Federal Tort Claims Act.\n       3. Charter Aircraft:\n       (a) Reimbursements for charter aircraft will be limited to \n     the charges for a twin-engine, six seat plane, or comparable \n     aircraft.\n\n[[Page S13517]]\n\n     Charter of aircraft may be allowed notwithstanding the \n     availability of commercial facilities, if such commercial \n     facilities are not such that reasonable schedules may be \n     kept. When charter aircraft is used, an explanation and \n     detail of the size of the aircraft, i.e., seating capacity \n     and number of engines, shall be provided on the face of the \n     voucher.\n       (b) In the event charter facilities are not available at \n     the point of departure, reimbursement for charter from \n     nearest point of such availability to the destination and \n     return may be allowed.\n       (c) When a charter aircraft larger than a twin-engine, six \n     seat plane is used, the form ``Request for a Waiver of the \n     Travel Regulations'' is submitted with the voucher.\n       C. Private Airplane: Interpretative Ruling of the Select \n     Committee on Ethics, No. 412, issued August 11, 1986\n       ``In some circumstances, a Member who uses a private \n     airplane is required to reimburse the provider of the \n     aircraft to avoid either a prohibited gift under the Senate \n     Gift Rule or a prohibited in-kind contribution to an \n     unofficial office account. Senate Rule 38 (Prohibition of \n     Unofficial Office Accounts), generally prohibits private \n     sources from providing funds or services to defray a Member's \n     officially related expenses. Thus, if a friend offers to loan \n     a Member an aircraft to attend town meetings across the \n     Member's home state, the Member must reimburse for the use of \n     the aircraft to comply with Rule 38. Senate Rule 35 (Gifts) \n     prohibits Members from accepting from an individual or \n     organization with a direct interest in legislation, gifts \n     aggregating over $100 in a calendar year (The rule also \n     prohibits gifts aggregating $300 per calendar year from \n     anyone who is not a relative). Thus, if a lobbyist offers a \n     Member the use of his airplane to fly the Member on a \n     vacation trip, and if the value of the use of the airplane is \n     over $100, the member must provide reimbursement to comply \n     with Rule 35.\n       ``In most circumstances, where reimbursement is not \n     required, the Member will still need to determine the value \n     of the use of the aircraft because, if the value is $250 or \n     more, the use of the aircraft must be disclosed on the \n     Member's annual financial disclosure forms.\n       ``In determining the value of an item for both \n     reimbursement and disclosure purposes, the Committee has \n     consistently stated that the applicable standard is the value \n     of the item to the recipient. In the use of private aircraft, \n     the Committee concluded that the value to a Member would be \n     the cost he would have to incur to purchase the same level of \n     service in the open market. The Committee felt that the level \n     of service generally provided in using private aircraft is \n     most nearly equivalent to first-class service provided by \n     commercial carriers where such commercial service is \n     available. Where no regularly scheduled commercial service is \n     available, to obtain the same service provided by the use of \n     a private aircraft, a Member would be required to charter an \n     airplane.\n       ``Ruling: The Committee has agreed on the following method \n     for calculating the value of the use of an aircraft for both \n     reimbursement and disclosure:\n       ``1. If the cities between which the Member is flying have \n     regularly scheduled air service, regardless of whether such \n     service is direct, then the value of the use of the aircraft \n     is the cost of a first-class ticket from the point of \n     departure to the destination.\n       ``2. If the cities have regularly scheduled air service, \n     but only standard (coach) rate, then the value of the use of \n     the aircraft is the coach rate.\n       ``3. If either the city from which the Member flies or his \n     destination does not have regularly scheduled air service, \n     then the value of the use of the aircraft is the cost of \n     chartering the same or a similar aircraft for that flight.\n       ``The Committee notes that its ruling is generally \n     consistent with Federal Election Commission regulations \n     pertaining to the use of private aircraft by candidates for \n     Federal office.\n       ``The Committee further notes that the Committee on Rules \n     and Administration has adopted travel regulations pertaining \n     to the level of reimbursement to be provided from official \n     funds to Members who seek such reimbursement for air \n     transportation costs they have paid. Our ruling addresses \n     only the reimbursement which Members must make to the \n     individual or organization whose aircraft he uses, not the \n     level of reimbursement Members may receive from official \n     funds.\n       ``Note: The Gifts Rule limit discussed in this ruling has \n     changed. But the method of calculating the value of the use \n     of an aircraft remains the same.''\n       IV. Interdepartmental Transportation\n       A. The reimbursement for interdepartmental transportation \n     is authorized as a travel expense pursuant to 2 U.S.C. 58(e) \n     but only for the incidental transportation expenses incurred \n     within the duty station in the course of conducting official \n     Senate business. Such reimbursement would include the \n     following expenses:\n       1. Mileage when using a privately owned vehicle\n       2. Bus, subway, taxi-cab, parking, and auto rental. \n     (However, reimbursement is prohibited for auto rental \n     expenses within the Washington D.C., metropolitan area duty \n     station.)\n       B. Pursuant to S. Res. 294, agreed to April 29, 1980, \n     section 2.(1), reimbursements and payments shall not be made \n     for commuting expenses, including parking fees incurred in \n     commuting.\n\n                          Subsistence Expenses\n\n       1. Per Diem Expenses\n       A. Allowance\n       1. Per diem expenses include all charges for meals, \n     lodging, personal use of room during daytime, baths, all fees \n     and tips to waiters, porters, baggagemen, bell boys, hotel \n     servants, dining room stewards and others on vessels, \n     laundry, cleaning and pressing of clothing, and fans in \n     rooms. The term ``lodging'' does not include accommodations \n     on airplanes or trains, and these expenses are not \n     subsistence expenses.\n       (a) Laundry: Laundry expenses must be incurred during the \n     mid-way point of a trip. Reimbursable laundry expenses are \n     for the refreshing of clothing during a trip, but not the \n     maintenance of the clothing.\n       (b) Meals: Reimbursable expenses incurred for meals while \n     on official travel include meals and tips for the traveler \n     only and may not include alcohol.\n       2. Per diem expenses will not be allowed an employee at \n     his/her permanent duty station and will be allowed only when \n     associated with round trip travel outside his/her permanent \n     duty station.\n       (a) Training: Meals in the duty station are only \n     reimbursable when they are incurred during a training \n     session. If the cost of the meal is included in the training \n     session, then a meal certification form should be included \n     with the voucher. The Committee on Rules and Administration \n     will consider these on a case by case basis. Meal \n     certification forms are available at the Disbursing Office or \n     on the Senate intranet.\n       (1) Training is defined as a planned, prepared, and \n     coordinated program, course, curriculum, subject, system, or \n     routine of instruction or education, in scientific, \n     professional or technical fields which are or will be \n     directly related to the performance by the employee of \n     official duties for the Senate, in order to increase the \n     knowledge, proficiency, ability, skill and qualifications of \n     the employee in the performance of official duties.\n       (2) Meetings in the duty station where meals are served, \n     such as but not limited to Chamber of Commerce monthly \n     meetings do not constitute training. Therefore, the meals \n     associated with these meetings are not an authorized \n     reimbursable expense.\n       3. In any case where the employee's tour of travel requires \n     more than two months' stay at a temporary duty station, \n     consideration should be given to either a change in official \n     station or a reduction in the per diem allowance.\n       4. Where for a traveler's personal convenience/business \n     there is an interruption of travel or deviation from the \n     direct route, the per diem expenses allowed will not exceed \n     that which would have been incurred on uninterrupted travel \n     by a usually traveled route and the time of departure from \n     and return to official business shall be stated on the \n     voucher.\n       5. Per diem expenses will be allowed through the time the \n     traveler departs on personal business and will be recommenced \n     at the time he/she returns to official business. Such dates \n     and times shall be stated on the voucher.\n       B. Rates\n       1. The per diem allowances provided in these regulations \n     represent the maximum allowance, not the minimum. It is the \n     responsibility of each office to see that travelers are \n     reimbursed only such per diem expenses as are justified by \n     the circumstances affecting the travel. Maximum rates for \n     subsistence expenses are established by the General Services \n     Administration and are published in the Federal Register. \n     Maximum per diem rates for Alaska, Hawaii, the Commonwealth \n     of Puerto Rico, and possessions of the United States are \n     established by the Department of Defense and are also \n     published in the Federal Register. In addition, per diem \n     rates for foreign countries are established by the \n     Department of State and are published in the document \n     titled, ``Maximum Travel Per Diem for Foreign Areas.''\n       (a) Per diem expenses reimbursable to a Member or employee \n     of the Senate in connection with official travel within the \n     continental United States shall be made on the basis of \n     actual expenses incurred, but not to exceed the maximum rate \n     prescribed by the Committee on Rules and Administration for \n     each day spent in a travel status. Any portion of a day while \n     in a travel status shall be considered a full day for \n     purposes of per diem entitlement.\n       (b) When travel begins or ends at a point in the \n     continental United States, the maximum per diem rate \n     allowable for the portion of travel between such place and \n     the place of entry or exit in the continental United States \n     shall be the maximum rate prescribed by the Committee on \n     Rules and Administration for travel within the continental \n     United States. However, the quarter day in which travel \n     begins, in coming from, or ends, in going to, a point outside \n     the continental United States may be paid at the rate \n     applicable to said point, if higher.\n       (c) In traveling between localities outside the continental \n     United States, the per diem rate allowed at the locality from \n     which travel is performed shall continue through the quarter \n     day in which the traveler arrives at his/her destination: \n     Provided, that if such rate is not commensurate with the \n     expenses incurred, the per diem rate of the destination \n     locality may be allowed for the quarter day of arrival.\n       (d) Ship travel time shall be allowed at not to exceed the \n     maximum per diem rate prescribed by the Committee on Rules \n     and Administration for travel within the continental United \n     States.\n       C. Computations\n       1. The date of departure from, and arrival at, the official \n     station or other point where official travel begins and ends, \n     must be shown on the travel voucher. Other points visited \n     should be shown on the voucher but\n\n[[Page S13518]]\n\n     date of arrival and departure at these points need not be \n     shown.\n       2. For computing per diem allowances official travel begins \n     at the time the traveler leaves his/her home, office, or \n     other point of departure and ends when the traveler returns \n     to his/her home, office, or other point at the conclusion of \n     his/her trip.\n       (a) The maximum allowable per diem for an official trip is \n     computed by multiplying the number of days on official \n     travel, beginning with the departure date, by the maximum \n     daily rate as prescribed by the Committee on Rules and \n     Administration. If the maximum daily rate for a traveler's \n     destination is higher than the prescribed daily rate, then \n     the form ``Request for a Waiver of the Travel Regulations'' \n     must be submitted with the voucher showing the maximum daily \n     rate for that location and found in order upon audit by the \n     Rules Committee.\n       (b) Total per diem for an official trip includes lodging \n     expenses (excluding taxes), meals (including taxes and tips), \n     and other per diem expenses as defined by these regulations.\n\n                          Incidental Expenses\n\n       I. Periodicals: Periodicals purchased while in a travel \n     status should be limited to newspapers and news magazines \n     necessary to stay informed on issues directly related to \n     Senate business.\n       II. Traveler's Checks/Money Orders: The service fee for \n     preparation of traveler's checks or money orders for use \n     during official travel is allowable.\n       III. Communications\n       A. Communication services such as telephone, telegraph, and \n     faxes, may be used on official business when such expeditious \n     means of communications is essential. Government-owned \n     facilities should be used, if practical. If not available, \n     the cheapest practical class of commercial service should be \n     used.\n       B. Additionally, one personal telephone call will be \n     reimbursed for each day that a Senator or staff member is in \n     a travel status. The calls may not exceed an average of five \n     minutes a day, and cannot be reimbursed at a rate higher than \n     $5.00 without itemized documentation.\n       IV. Stationery: Stationery items such as pens, paper, \n     batteries, etc. which are necessary to conduct official \n     Senate business while in a travel status are authorized.\n       V. Conference Center/Meeting Room Reservations: The fee for \n     the reservation of a meeting room, conference room, or \n     business center while on official travel is allowable.\n       VI. Other: This category would be used (with full \n     explanation on the Expense Summary Report for Travel) to \n     disclose any expense which would occur incidentally while on \n     official travel, and for which there is no other expense \n     category, i.e., interpreting services, hotel taxes, baggage \n     cart rental, etc.\n\n                      Conference and Training Fees\n\n       Training of Senators' Office Staff: The Senators' Official \n     Personnel and Office Expense Account is available to defray \n     the fees associated with the attendance by the Senator or the \n     Senator's employees at conferences, seminars, briefings, or \n     classes which are or will be directly related to the \n     performance of official duties.\n       A. When such fees (actual or reduced) are less than or \n     equal to $500, have a time duration of not more than five (5) \n     days, and have been asked to be waived or reduced for \n     Government participation, reimbursement shall be made as an \n     official travel expense. However, if the fee or time duration \n     for meetings is in excess of the aforementioned, \n     reimbursement shall be made as a non-travel expense.\n       B. Reimbursement shall not be allowed for tuition or fees \n     associated with classes attended to earn credits towards an \n     advanced degree or certification.\n       C. The costs of meals that are considered an integral, \n     mandatory and non-separable element of the conference, \n     seminar, briefing, or class will be allowed as part of the \n     attendance fee when certified by the registrant. The meal \n     certification form, which must accompany the reimbursement \n     voucher, is available in the Disbursing Office or through the \n     Senate Intranet.\n       II. Training of Committee Employees: Section 202 (j) of the \n     Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946 provides for the \n     expenditure of funds available to standing committees of the \n     Senate for the training of professional staff personnel under \n     certain conditions. It is the responsibility of each \n     committee to set aside funds within its annual funding \n     resolution to cover the expenses of such training.\n       A. Prior approval for attendance by professional staff at \n     seminars, briefings, conferences, etc., as well as committee \n     funds earmarked for training, will not be required when all \n     of the following conditions are met:\n       1. The sponsoring organization has been asked to waive or \n     reduce the fee for Government participation.\n       2. The fee involved (actual or reduced) is not in excess of \n     $500.\n       3. The duration of the meeting does not exceed five (5) \n     days.\n       B. When such fees are less than or equal to $500, have a \n     time duration of not more than five (5) days, and have been \n     requested to be waived or reduced for Government \n     participation, reimbursement shall be made as a non-training, \n     official travel expense. However, if the fee or time duration \n     for meetings is in excess of the aforementioned, \n     reimbursement shall be made as an official training expense. \n     Reimbursement shall not be allowed for tuition or fees \n     associated with classes attended to earn credits towards an \n     advanced degree or certification.\n       C. If the fee or time duration for meetings is in excess of \n     the aforementioned, advance approval by the Committee on \n     Rules and Administration must be sought. Training requests \n     should be received sufficiently in advance of the training to \n     permit appropriate consideration by the Committee on Rules \n     and Administration.\n       D. The costs of meals that are considered an integral, \n     mandatory, and non-separable element of the conference, \n     seminar, briefing, or class will be allowed as part of the \n     attendance fee when certified by the registrant. The meal \n     certification forms which must accompany the reimbursement \n     voucher are available in the Disbursing Office or through the \n     Senate Intranet.\n       III. Training of Administrative Offices Staff: The \n     administrative approval of the voucher is the only approval \n     required by the Committee on Rules and Administration. \n     Training expenses of staff shall be limited to those fees \n     associated with the attendance by staff at conferences, \n     seminars, briefings, or classes which are or will be directly \n     related to the performance of official duties. However, \n     reimbursement shall not be allowed for tuition or fees \n     associated with classes attended to earn credits towards an \n     advanced degree or certification.\n\n                             Special Events\n\n       Retreats: Reimbursement of official travel expenses for \n     office staff retreats is allowable from the contingent fund \n     provided they follow the restrictions and authorizations in \n     these regulations. Reimbursement of expenses for meeting \n     rooms and equipment used during the retreat also is \n     allowable. The vouchers for retreat expenses should be \n     noted as retreat vouchers.\n       A. Discussion of Interpretative Ruling of the Select \n     Committee on Ethics, No. 444, issued February 14, 2002\n       ``An office retreat may be paid for with either or both \n     official funds (with Rules Committee approval) or principal \n     campaign committee funds. Private parties may not pay \n     expenses incurred in connection with an office retreat. \n     Campaign workers may attend, at campaign expense, office \n     retreats if their purpose in attending is to engage in \n     official activities, such as providing feedback from \n     constituents on legislative or representational matters.''\n       B. When processing direct pay vouchers payable either to \n     each individual traveler or to the vendor providing the \n     retreat accommodations, prior approval by the Committee on \n     Rules and Administration is not required. Retreat expenses, \n     including but not limited to per diem, may be charged to the \n     office's official centrally billed government travel charge \n     card and paid on direct vouchers to the charge card vendor. \n     Any deviation from this policy will be considered on a case \n     by case basis upon the written request to, and approval from, \n     the Committee on Rules and Administration.\n       C. Spreadsheet of Expenses\n       1. The Member office, Committee, or Administrative office, \n     must attach to the retreat voucher(s) a spreadsheet detailing \n     each day of the retreat broken out by breakfast, lunch, \n     dinner, and lodging for each traveler attending the retreat.\n       2. For each traveler, the spreadsheet should list his/her \n     duty station, additional per diem expenses incurred outside \n     of the retreat, and any other retreat attendee the traveler \n     shared a room with during the retreat. Any non-staff members \n     attending the retreat also should be detailed on the \n     spreadsheet. The ``Waiver of the Travel Regulations'' form \n     does not need to be attached to retreat voucher(s) for the \n     sharing of rooms.\n       3. The per diem expenses for staff members attending a \n     retreat within their duty station are not reimbursable but \n     should be detailed on the spreadsheet. All expenses for non-\n     staff members attending the retreat are not reimbursable, but \n     their attendance at the retreat must be taken into account \n     when computing a per traveler cost on the spreadsheet.\n       II. Funerals: 2 USC 68-2 restricts reimbursement from the \n     contingent fund of the Senate to those expenses that are \n     intimately and directly connected with the routine \n     legislative process of the Senate. Pursuant to S. Res. 458, \n     agreed to October 4, 1984 and S. Res. 263, agreed to July 30, \n     1998, reimbursement for travel expenses incurred for \n     attendance at funerals of individuals other than current or \n     retired Senators by a Member, officer, or employee of the \n     Senate is not authorized.\n\n                         Senators' Office Staff\n\n       Legislative Authority (2 U.S.C. 58(e), as amended)\n       (e) Subject to and in accordance with regulations \n     promulgated by the Committee on Rules and Administration of \n     the Senate, a Senator and the employees in his office shall \n     be reimbursed under this section for travel expenses \n     incurred by the Senator or employee while traveling on \n     official business within the United States. The term \n     ``travel expenses'' includes actual transportation \n     expenses, essential travel-related expenses, and, where \n     applicable, per diem expenses (but not in excess of actual \n     expenses). A Senator or an employee of the Senator shall \n     not be reimbursed for any travel expenses (other than \n     actual transportation expenses) for any travel occurring \n     during the sixty days immediately before the date of any \n     primary or general election (whether regular, special, or \n     runoff) in which the Senator is a candidate for public \n     office (within the meaning of section 301(b) of the \n     Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971), unless his \n     candidacy in such election is\n\n[[Page S13519]]\n\n     uncontested. For purposes of this subsection and \n     subsection 2(a)(6) of this section, an employee in the \n     Office of the President Pro Tempore, Deputy President Pro \n     Tempore, Majority Leader, Minority Leader, Majority Whip, \n     Minority Whip, Secretary of the Conference of the \n     Majority, or Secretary of the Conference of the Minority \n     shall be considered to be an employee in the office of the \n     Senator holding such office.\n       II. Regulations Governing Senators' Official Personnel and \n     Office Expense Accounts Adopted by the Committee on Rules and \n     Administration Pursuant to Senate Resolution 170 agreed to \n     September 19, 1979, as amended.\n       Section 1. For the purposes of these regulations, the \n     following definitions shall apply:\n       (a) Documentation means invoices, bills, statements, \n     receipts, or other evidence of expenses incurred, approved by \n     the Committee on Rules and Administration.\n       (b) Official expenses means ordinary and necessary business \n     expenses in support of the Senators' official and \n     representational duties.\n       Section 2. No reimbursement will be made from the \n     contingent fund of the Senate for any official expenses \n     incurred under a Senator's Official Personnel and Office \n     Expense Account, in excess of $50, unless the voucher \n     submitted for such expenses is accompanied by documentation, \n     and the voucher is personally signed by the Senator.\n       Section 3. Official expenses of $50 or less must either be \n     documented or must be itemized in sufficient detail so as to \n     leave no doubt of the identity of, and the amount spent for, \n     each item. Items of a similar nature may be grouped together \n     in one total on a voucher, but must be itemized individually \n     on a supporting itemization sheet.\n       Section 4. Travel expenses shall be subject to the same \n     documentation requirements as other official expenses, with \n     the following exceptions:\n       (a) Hotel bills or other evidence of lodging costs will be \n     considered necessary in support of per diem.\n       (b) Documentation will not be required for reimbursement of \n     official travel in a privately owned vehicle.\n       Section 5. No documentation will be required for \n     reimbursement of the following classes of expenses, as these \n     are billed and paid directly through the Sergeant at Arms and \n     Doorkeeper:\n       (a) official telegrams and long distance calls and related \n     services;\n       (b) stationery and other office supplies procured through \n     the Senate Stationery Room for use for official business.\n       Section 6. The Committee on Rules and Administration may \n     require documentation for expenses incurred of $50 or less, \n     or authorize payment of expenses incurred in excess of $50 \n     without documentation, in special circumstances.\n\n               Committee and Administrative Office Staff\n\n       (Includes all committees of the Senate, the Office of the \n     Secretary of the Senate, and the Office of the Sergeant at \n     Arms and Doorkeeper of the Senate)\n       I. Legislative Authority (2 U.S.C. 68b)\n       ``No part of the appropriations made under the heading \n     `Contingent Expenses of the Senate' may be expended for per \n     diem and subsistence expenses (as defined in section 5701 of \n     Title 5) at rates in excess of the rates prescribed by the \n     Committee on Rules and Administration; except that (1) higher \n     rates may be established by the Committee on Rules and \n     Administration for travel beyond the limits of the \n     continental United States, and (2) in accordance with \n     regulations prescribed by the Committee on Rules and \n     Administration of the Senate, reimbursement for such expenses \n     may be made on an actual expense basis of not to exceed the \n     daily rate prescribed by the Committee on Rules and \n     Administration in the case of travel within the continental \n     limits of the United States.''\n       II. Incidental Expenses: The following items may be \n     authorized or approved when related to official travel:\n       1. Commissions for conversion of currency in foreign \n     countries.\n       2. Fees in connection with the issuance of passports, visa \n     fees; costs of photographs for passports and visas; costs of \n     certificates of birth, health, identity; and affidavits; and \n     charges for inoculations which cannot be obtained through a \n     federal dispensary when required for official travel outside \n     the limits of the United States.\n       III. Hearing Expenses (committees only)\n       A. In connection with hearings held outside of Washington, \n     D.C., committees are authorized to pay the travel expenses of \n     official reporters having company offices in Washington, \n     D.C., or in other locations, for traveling to points outside \n     the District of Columbia or outside such other locations, \n     provided:\n       1. Said hearings are of such a classified or security \n     nature that their transcripts can be accomplished only by \n     reporters having the necessary clearance from the proper \n     federal agencies;\n       2. Extreme difficulty is experienced in the procurement of \n     local reporters; or\n       3. The demands of economy make the use of Washington, D.C., \n     reporters or traveling reporters in another area highly \n     advantageous to the Senate; and further provided, that should \n     such hearings exceed five days in duration, prior approval \n     (for the payment of reporters' travel expenses) must be \n     obtained from the Committee on Rules and Administration.\n       IV. Witnesses Appearing Before the Senate (committees only)\n       A.

In special circumstances, the Committee on Rules \n     and Administration may require documentation for expenses \n     incurred of $50 or less, or authorize payment of expenses \n     incurred in excess of $50 without documentation.\n       Section 7.

The individual receiving the cash \n     advance will be personally liable. The Committee on Rules and \n     Administration may, in special instances, increase these non-\n     statutory limits upon written request by the Chairman of that \n     committee and proper justification.\n       Section 8.

Madam President, today I wish to celebrate the \nQuilts of Valor Foundation. In a time when thousands of American \nfamilies are sending their loved ones around the world to fight for the \nsafety and security of all of us here at home, the Quilts of Valor \nFoundation has stepped forward to give something back to our wounded \nheroes. This foundation has pledged to sew and donate a Quilt of Valor \nto every servicemember wounded in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. Their \nmission is to offer comfort and support to our wounded heroes.\n  An organization not about politics, but about people, the Quilts of \nValor Foundation was established in November 2003 by Catherine Roberts \nof Seaford, DE, Since that time, thousands of volunteers from all over \nthe United States have created over 13,000 quilts for our injured \nservice men and women. With the help of military chaplains at medical \ncenters throughout the United States, Europe and in Iraq and \nAfghanistan, the Quilts of Valor Foundation locates wounded soldiers \nand presents them with a hand-made quilt. That quilt is a symbol of the \nrespect and honor that we as a country hold for them and their \nsacrifice.\n  The organization has two main missions which frame their important \nservice to our country. First and foremost, the Quilts of Valor \nFoundation is dedicated to honoring those men and women who have been \nwounded, whether physically or psychologically, in Iraq and Afghanistan \nwith a Quilt of Valor. Second, the Quilts of Valor Foundation hopes \nthat by teaching young people to quilt and by spreading a culture of \nvolunteerism, a new generation of Americans will become more civically \ninvolved and dedicated to bettering our Nation in whatever way they \ncan.\n  I would like to acknowledge and sincerely thank Catherine Roberts, \nthe Quilts of Valor Foundation, and all the volunteers, especially \nthose in Delaware, who put so much time, money, effort, and love into \nevery quilt to comfort our servicemembers and let them know how much we \nat home value their sacrifices.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/29/senate-section/article/S13520-3", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13520]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    MEASURES PLACED ON THE CALENDAR\n\n  The following bill was read the second time, and placed on the \ncalendar:\n\n       S. 2247.

A bill to impose sanctions on officials of the State Peace \nand Development Council in Burma, to amend the Burmese Freedom and \nDemocracy Act of 2003 to prohibit the importation of gemstones and \nhardwoods from Burma, to promote a coordinated international effort to \nrestore civilian democratic rule to Burma, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, today, I rise to introduce a bipartisan \nbill to promote the restoration of civilian, democratic rule to the \ntroubled state of Burma. The goal of the Burma Democracy Promotion Act \nis to help create the right conditions for the peaceful, negotiated \ntransfer of power from\n\n[[Page S13522]]\n\nthe generals who have ruled Burma for almost 2 decades to a newly-\nconstituted civilian, democratic government.\n  In order to do this, we need to bring pressure to bear on the Burmese \ngenerals directly responsible for the bloody crackdown on peaceful \nprotestors last month. This bill imposes new financial sanctions and \ntravel restrictions on the leaders of the junta and their associates \nand tightens the economic sanctions imposed by the Congress in 2003 by \noutlawing the importation of Burmese gems and timber to the U.S. \nCarefully targeted sanctions can support our diplomacy. In this case, \nthe sanctions are designed to provide leverage on the generals, who \nseem largely indifferent to the suffering of ordinary people. Until \nnow, the generals have managed largely to avoid the bite of existing \neconomic sanctions, enjoying their shopping trips abroad and stashing \ntheir riches outside of Burma. We hope to change that.\n  But unilateral pressure alone will not get the job done. We need a \ndiplomatic offensive. Importantly, this bill creates a new position of \nSpecial Representative and Policy Coordinator for Burma. The Special \nRepresentative will work with Burma's neighbors and other interested \ncountries, including the members of the EU and the Association of \nSoutheast Asian Nations, to develop a comprehensive approach to the \nproblem, including sanctions, dialogue, and support for non-\ngovernmental organizations providing humanitarian relief to the Burmese \npeople. We need China, India, and Thailand, among others, to join with \nus to convince the generals that it is time for change.\n  While we work for a negotiated solution to the current crisis, we \nmust not forget the Burmese people. This bill authorizes new assistance \nfor the hundreds of thousands of Burmese who have been forced from \ntheir homes and are now refugees or who continue to suffer inside the \ncountry because of the mismanagement and brutality of the military \nregime.\n  It is time for Burma to begin a new day in which all of the people, \nincluding Burma's many minority groups, work together to rebuild what \nnearly 20 years of disastrous military rule have destroyed. With the \nsupport of the international community, a new government can build a \nmore prosperous and democratic state, one that is at peace with its \nneighbors and that respects the human rights of all of its people. The \nBurmese Army should be, and can be, a part of this new Burma. The \nsanctions called for in this measure will be lifted provided only that \nthe generals release all of their political prisoners, engage in a \nsubstantive dialogue with the advocates of democracy in Burma, and \nafford non-governmental organizations access to address the \nhumanitarian needs of the Burmese people. These are reasonable, modest, \nobjectives, and if met, would brighten the prospects for Burma's \nfuture.\n  Mr. President, others in this body have a long record of leadership \non Burma policy, including the Minority Leader, Senator McConnell, who \nI am proud to have as a cosponsor on this bill, and Senator McCain. \nThis bill was drafted in consultation with the staff of Senator McCain, \nand includes some portions of a bill he introduced earlier this month. \nI want to thank Senator McCain for his initiative and commend him for \nhis strong voice on this issue. I have also relied on the wisdom of my \nold friend Congressman Lantos, who has already introduced legislation \non Burma in the House. Finally, I want to thank the Senator from \nCalifornia, Senator Boxer, for cosponsoring this legislation and for \nchairing an important Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing on \nBurma that helped to shape this bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no ojection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2257\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Burma Democracy Promotion \n     Act of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Beginning on August 19, 2007, hundreds of thousands of \n     citizens of Burma, including thousands of Buddhist monks and \n     students, participated in peaceful demonstrations against \n     rapidly deteriorating living conditions and the violent and \n     repressive policies of the State Peace and Development \n     Council, the ruling military regime in Burma--\n       (A) to demand the release of all political prisoners, \n     including 1991 Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi; and\n       (B) to urge the SPDC to engage in meaningful dialogue to \n     pursue national reconciliation.\n       (2) The SPDC violently confronted unarmed demonstrators, \n     killing, injuring, and imprisoning citizens, including \n     several thousand Buddhist monks, and continues to forcefully \n     restrict peaceful forms of public expression.\n       (3) The Department of State's 2006 Country Reports on Human \n     Rights Practices found that the SPDC--\n       (A) routinely restricts freedoms of speech, press, \n     assembly, association, religion, and movement;\n       (B) traffics in persons;\n       (C) discriminates against women and ethnic minorities;\n       (D) forcibly recruits child soldiers and child labor; and\n       (E) commits other serious violations of human rights, \n     including extrajudicial killings, custodial deaths, \n     disappearances, rape, torture, abuse of prisoners and \n     detainees, and the imprisonment of citizens arbitrarily for \n     political motives.\n       (4) Aung San Suu Kyi has been arbitrarily imprisoned or \n     held under house arrest for more than 12 years.\n       (5) On September 25, 2007, President Bush announced that \n     the United States would--\n       (A) tighten economic sanctions against Burma, and block \n     property and interests in property of--\n       (i) certain senior leaders of the SPDC;\n       (ii) individuals who provide financial backing for the \n     SPDC; and\n       (iii) individuals responsible for violations of human \n     rights and for impeding the transition to democracy in Burma; \n     and\n       (B) impose an expanded visa ban on individuals--\n       (i) responsible for violations of human rights; and\n       (ii) who aid, abet, or benefit from the efforts of the SPDC \n     to impede the efforts of the people of Burma to transition to \n     democracy and ensure respect for human dignity.\n       (6) The Burmese regime and its supporters finance their \n     ongoing violations of human rights, undemocratic policies, \n     and military activities through financial transactions, \n     travel, and trade involving the United States, including the \n     sale of gemstones and hardwoods.\n       (7) The SPDC seeks to evade the sanctions imposed in the \n     Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act of 2003. Millions of \n     dollars in gemstones that are exported from Burma ultimately \n     enter the United States, but the Burmese regime attempts to \n     conceal the origin of the gemstones in an effort to evade \n     sanctions. For example, over 90 percent of the world's ruby \n     supply originates in Burma but only 3 percent of the rubies \n     entering the United States are claimed to be of Burmese \n     origin. The value of Burmese gemstones is predominantly based \n     on their original quality and geological origin, rather than \n     the labor involved in cutting and polishing the gemstones.\n       (8) Burma is home to approximately 60 percent of the \n     world's native teak reserves. More than \\1/4\\ of the world's \n     internationally traded teak originates from Burma, and \n     hardwood sales, mainly of teak, represent more than 11 \n     percent of Burma's official foreign exchange earnings.\n       (9) Burma officially exports tens of millions of dollars \n     worth of rubies, sapphires, pearls, jade, and other precious \n     stones each year and the SPDC owns a majority stake in all \n     mining operations within the borders of Burma.\n       (10) On October 11, 2007, the United Nations Security \n     Council, with the consent of the People's Republic of China, \n     issued a statement condemning the violence in Burma, urging \n     the release of all political prisoners, and calling on the \n     SPDC to enter into a United Nations-mediated dialogue with \n     its political opposition.\n       (11) The United Nations special envoy Ibrahim Gambari \n     traveled to Burma from September 29, 2007 through October 2, \n     2007, holding meetings with SPDC leader General Than Shwe and \n     democracy advocate Aung San Suu Kyi in an effort to promote \n     dialogue between the SPDC and democracy advocates.\n       (12) The leaders of the SPDC will have a greater incentive \n     to cooperate with diplomatic efforts by the United Nations, \n     the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, and the People's \n     Republic of China if they come under targeted economic \n     pressure that denies them access to personal wealth and \n     sources of revenue.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, today marks the 84th anniversary of the \nfounding of the Republic of Turkey. It is an auspicious occasion to \ncommemorate the abiding and enduring partnership between two great \nnations.\n  In 1923, following the collapse of the 600-year-old Ottoman Empire \nand a 3-year war of independence, a Turkish World War I hero, Mustafa \nKemal, helped found the Republic of Turkey. Kemal, who was later given \nthe name Ataturk, meaning ``father of the Turks,'' rejected the \ncrumbling structures and outdated modes of empire and embraced instead \na platform of reform and modernization, a legacy that continues in \nTurkey to this day and to this hour.\n  Today Turkey is the most successful example in the Muslim world of a \nsecular representative democracy. Turkey's economy has grown at a \nrecord pace in recent years to become the world's 19th largest. \nLiteracy and education rates continue to climb, as life expectancy has \nimproved and poverty rates have declined. Turkey stands as an \ninspiration to reformers in the greater Middle East and throughout the \nworld.\n  Turkey has been a consistent and loyal ally of the people of the \nUnited States. From World War II, when Turkey entered the fight on the \nside of the allies, to the cementing of the United States-Turkish \nalliance in the 1947 Truman doctrine to Turkey's accession to the North \nAmerican Treaty Organization in 1952, Turkey has been a friend of the \nAmerican people.\n  During the long Cold War, Turkey was a bulwark on the edge of the \nIron Curtain, and it was a critical ally. Turkey later helped the \nUnited States to\n\n[[Page S13525]]\n\npatrol the no-fly zones over Iraq after the first Persian Gulf war and \naided the U.S. Armed Forces in Afghanistan after the September 11 \nattacks.\n  Turkey, which has the second largest army in NATO, commanded the \nInternational Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan twice, in 2002 \nand 2005, and Turkish troops continue to contribute to security efforts \nthere.\n  It is difficult to overstate the critical importance of Turkey's \ncooperation with United States missions in the region. United States \nDefense Secretary Robert Gates recently estimated that 70 percent--let \nme say that again, 70 percent--of the air cargo deployed into Iraq to \nsupport United States troops there transits through airbases in Turkey.\n  I perhaps should say that again. It is difficult to overstate the \ncritical importance of Turkey's cooperation with United States missions \nin the region. United States Defense Secretary Robert Gates recently \nestimated that 70 percent of the air cargo deployed into Iraq to \nsupport United States troops there transits through airbases in Turkey.\n  Turkey, as a predominantly Muslim country with an important bilateral \nrelationship with Israel, seeks to play a constructive role in Middle \nEast peace negotiations and continues to be an important ally in a \ndangerous and turbulent region. Turkey occupies a strategically \ncritical territory between Europe and Asia, bordering such challenging \nneighbors as Iran, Syria, and Iraq.\n  Furthermore, I say, as the United States increasingly looks to \ndiversify its sources of energy, it is important for us to remember \nthat Turkey forms a crucial energy corridor to the West, capable of \nbringing oil and natural gas from the steppes of Eurasia to the shores \nof the Mediterranean Sea.\n  Turkey is, in short, central to the interests of the United States. \nNow is a good time to be reminded of that fact, as tensions build in \nthe Kurdish region and tempers flare over the proper words to use to \ndescribe a century-old tragedy. Whatever one's views may be about that \ntragedy--politically, economically, geographically, strategically, and \nmilitarily--as our soldiers--our soldiers, U.S. soldiers, American \nsoldiers--are in harm's way in Iraq and Afghanistan, the United States \ncan ill-afford to lose such an important friend and ally as Turkey.\n  This is a critical moment for Turkey. The Turkish people recently \nelected a new government, led by Prime Minister Erdogan and President \nAbdullah Gul. Let me say that once more. This time I think I can say \nthat better. This is a critical moment for Turkey. The Turkish people \nrecently elected a new government led by Prime Minister Erdogan and \nPresident Abdullah Gul. These decisive elections demonstrated the \nvibrant and healthy spirit of Turkey's democracy and the commitment of \nTurkey's people to the democratic process. However, the young \ngovernment is facing a number of serious challenges as it \nsimultaneously seeks to guard against a very real threat from Kurdish \nterrorists, assuage Turkish nationalists and the military, and maintain \nthe secular character of the State, all while continuing Turkey's bid \nfor European Union membership. We should offer the Turkish Government \nall the support we can give in these noble endeavors.\n  Much like the United States, Turkey continues to struggle with the \ndarker moments of its history. The terrible treatment of Armenians \nprior to and during the first World War, as well as the treatment of \nother minorities, including Greeks, Alevis, and Kurds, is a matter that \ncontinues to haunt the people of Turkey. In recent years, however, \nthere have been encouraging signs: historians conferences, attempts to \nimprove relations with Armenia, and growing acceptance of the Kurdish \nlanguage.\n  This is what free people and open democracies do. They debate and \nthey examine their history and the conscience of their people. Given \ntime and patience, their past can be confronted in a truthful and \ncandid way. Many of us would like to see more progress from Turkey in \nthis area. There continue to be issues about which our two countries \ndisagree. This should be no surprise. Members of the same family \ndisagree at times, and our best friends are often those who criticize \nus most openly. But there is a time for criticism and a time for \npraise, and criticism can be constructive. Today is a day to celebrate \nthe great Turkish nation and its people and to acknowledge the strong \nties that bind our countries together. That is the reason I am \ncosponsoring a resolution with my colleague, Senator Gordon Smith--to \naffirm the friendship and the alliance of the American and Turkish \npeoples. May our ties continue to grow stronger with the passage of \ntime.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/29/senate-section/article/S13525-1", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13525-S13526]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 359--CONGRATULATING THE BOSTON RED SOX ON WINNING THE \n                           2007 WORLD SERIES\n\n   Mr. KENNEDY (for himself, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Reed, Mr. Whitehouse, Mr. \nDodd, Mr. Lieberman, Ms. Snowe, Ms. Collins, Mr. Leahy, and Mr. Sununu) \nsubmitted the following resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                               S.

SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE NEED TO MAINTAIN \n                   AMTRAK AS A NATIONAL PASSENGER RAIL SYSTEM.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) In fiscal year 2007, 3,800,000 passengers traveled on \n     Amtrak's long distance trains, an increase of 2.4 percent \n     over fiscal year 2006.\n       (2) Amtrak long-distance routes generated $376,000,000 in \n     revenue in fiscal year 2007, an increase of 5 percent over \n     fiscal year 2006.\n       (3) Amtrak operates 15 long-distance trains over 18,500 \n     route miles that serve 39 States and the District of \n     Columbia. These trains provide the only rail passenger \n     service to 23 States.\n       (4) Amtrak's long-distance trains provide an essential \n     transportation service for many communities and to a \n     significant percentage of the general public.\n       (5) Many long-distance trains serve small communities with \n     limited or no significant air or bus service, especially in \n     remote or isolated areas in the United States.\n       (6) As a result of airline deregulation and decisions by \n     national bus carriers to leave many communities, rail \n     transportation may provide the only feasible common carrier \n     transportation option for a growing number of areas.\n       (7) If long-distance trains were eliminated, 23 States and \n     243 communities would be left with no intercity passenger \n     rail service and 16 other States would lose some rail \n     service. These trains provide a strong economic benefit for \n     the States and communities that they serve.\n       (8) Long-distance trains also provide transportation during \n     periods of severe weather or emergencies that stall other \n     modes of transportation.\n       (9) Amtrak provided the only reliable long-distance \n     transportation following the September 11, 2001 terrorist \n     attacks that grounded air travel.\n       (10) The majority of passengers on long-distance trains do \n     not travel between the endpoints, but rather between any \n     combination of cities along the route.\n       (11) Passenger trains provide transportation options, \n     mobility for underserved populations, congestion mitigation, \n     and jobs in the areas they serve.\n       (12) Passenger rail has a positive impact on the \n     environment compared to other modes of transportation by \n     conserving energy, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and \n     cutting down on other airborne particulate and toxic \n     emissions.\n       (13) Amtrak communities that are served use passenger rail \n     and passenger rail stations as a significant source of \n     economic development.\n       (14) This Act makes meaningful and important reforms to \n     increase the efficiency, profitability and on-time \n     performance of Amtrak's long-distance routes.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) long-distance passenger rail is a vital and necessary \n     part of our national transportation system and economy; and\n       (2) Amtrak should maintain a national passenger rail \n     system, including long-distance routes, that connects the \n     continental United States from coast to coast and from border \n     to border.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 3489. Mr. SCHUMER submitted an amendment intended to be proposed \nby him to the bill S. 294, to reauthorize Amtrak, and for other \npurposes; which was ordered to lie on the table; as follows:\n\n       On page 60, after line 22, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 224. PASSENGER RAIL COST STUDY.\n\n       (a) In General.--The National Railroad Passenger \n     Corporation shall conduct a study to determine the potential \n     cost and economic impact of passenger rail service between \n     Scranton, Pennsylvania and Binghamton, New York.\n       (b) Submission.--Not later than 1 year after the date of \n     the enactment of this Act, Amtrak shall submit a report \n     containing the results of the study conducted under this \n     section to--\n       (1) the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation \n     of the Senate; and\n       (2) the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure of \n     the House of Representatives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/29/senate-section/article/S13528-1", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13528]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     SEQUENTIAL REFERRAL EXTENSION\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL.
