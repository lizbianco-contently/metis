Mr. President, this morning, the Senate will be in a period \nfor morning business until 11:30 a.m., with Republicans controlling the \nfirst half of the time, the majority controlling the final portion. I \nask that be a full 90 minutes because both Republicans and Democrats \nhave indicated a desire to speak. So whatever time Senator McConnell \nand I take we will not count against that time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, at approximately 11:30 a.m., the Senate will \nresume consideration of the Military Construction and Veterans \nappropriations measure. This, of course, is an extremely critical \nproposal for current members of the Armed Forces and those who have \npreviously served, our veterans.\n  We got word yesterday from the comanager of this bill, Senator Kay \nBailey Hutchison, that the President said he would sign the bill in its \npresent state, which is a good message. Therefore, I think we should \nproceed posthaste to complete this legislation as quickly as we can \ntoday. We have business, as I already indicated, we have to finish this \nweek. We will do our best to complete this legislation. I hope we don't \nhave to file cloture on it. I hope we can complete the bill. There was \nno indication yesterday there would be a lot of amendments. I don't \nknow if there will be any.\n  When we finish the bill, then we go to the Foreign Operations \nappropriations bill. That bill is $700 million less than what the \nPresident requested. There certainly should be something we can work \nout in that regard.\n  Then we have to complete education reconciliation. There is a \nstatutory 10 hours on that legislation.\n  We can complete all that business very quickly this week or, if \nnecessary, we will work on Friday and Saturday, hopefully not on \nSunday.\n  Monday morning, there will be votes. As I have indicated to the \nRepublican leader, we will have no votes after about 5:30 or 6 p.m. on \nMonday. On Tuesday, we will have a full day. We might have to work into \nthe night because we hope to be on Transportation appropriations. We \nwill have our last vote about 12:30 or 1 p.m. on Wednesday in relation \nto the Jewish holiday. We may work past that time, but there will be no \nvotes after midday.\n  I hope Members will cooperate. Today, we have our weekly recess for \nparty conferences. We are going to come back at 2:15. In the history of \nthe Senate, this is an important day. Someone who has stood for \nbipartisanship his entire career as a Member of the House of \nRepresentatives and as a Senator is coming back. Tim Johnson has been \nextremely ill. He was about as sick as a person can get. He is back. \nHis brain is 100 percent. The right side of his body is not back. His \nspeaking, as he said last week when he announced his coming back in \nSouth Dakota--he hoped all Senators would follow his example because \nhis mind works faster than his mouth. The doctor said his speech will \nreturn totally.\n\n[[Page S11084]]\n\nRight now, it is not, but it is still very good. So I hope Senators \nwill come to the floor at 2:15 p.m. to hear his speech upon his return. \nSenator McConnell and I are going to submit a resolution welcoming him \nback. So I encourage Members to be here at that time.\n  We will have some rollcall votes later today, maybe even into this \nevening. Senator Reed and Senator Hutchison are the ones managing the \nMilitary Construction and Veterans bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/05/senate-section/article/S11084-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11084]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        MEASURES PLACED ON THE CALENDAR--H.R. 2419 AND H.R. 3221\n\n  Mr. REID.

We look forward to welcoming him back after the \npolicy luncheons today. It is a remarkable example of grit and \ndetermination to fight his way back.

The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I may say also--I said this personally to \nthe distinguished Republican leader--Senator McConnell and the entire \nRepublican caucus have been so thoughtful regarding Senator Johnson's \nillness. There were things the Republican minority could have done to \nhave taken advantage of the situation of his being ill. That was never \ndone, not on one occasion. I appreciate that very much. I know Senator \nJohnson does. It speaks well for the Senate.\n  I don't think I need to say more on that issue other than it is the \nright thing to do, but sometimes we try to take advantage of a \nsituation politically. The Republican Senators did not do that, even \nthough there would have been times it would have been to their \nadvantage.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, I spent the month of August on our break \ntraveling the State of Georgia and did it for a specific reason. I knew \nthat September 15 would be the report period for Ambassador Crocker and \nfor General Petraeus. I knew it was very important for me as a Senator \nto go to the people of Georgia and find out what was on their minds.\n  As I introduced myself in every speech I made, I said: As a Member of \nthe Senate, and with our men and women deployed in harm's way, it is \nabsolutely incumbent upon me, first and foremost, to address the Iraq \nwar, to address my votes, and to hear from the people of Georgia on \nwhat they feel.\n  When I returned to the Senate last night and I was on the floor, I \nhad the occasion to listen to a speech by the Senator from New York, \nquestioning, again, our involvement in Iraq and, even in advance of the \nPetraeus report, taking a position that whatever it was, it would not \nbe good enough and the United States of America should withdraw. So I \nthought today I would come to the floor and speak not only my mind but \nI think the consensus of the people of Georgia regarding where we are \nnow and where we may be in the months ahead.\n  I visited civic clubs, chambers of commerce, garden clubs, the State \nchamber of commerce and sat for a meaningful hour with Lucy and Rick \nHarris, the parents of LT Noah Harris, who died 2 years ago fighting \nfor the United States of America in Iraq. I tried to get every \nperspective. I even spent half a day with new recruits at Fort Benning \nat the Third ID on their fourth day of basic training.\n  Next week is an important week for the United States of America, and \nthe report by General Petraeus is an important report. There are some \nMembers of the Senate who are invested in, whatever it says, staying \nthe course, there are some who are invested in coming home no matter \nwhat it says, when, in fact our actions should lie between. We should \nwait and hear what the general says. We should wait and hear what \nAmbassador Crocker says. But also it is time for us to start thinking \nabout defining what victory is rather than declaring, as some have \ndone, that we have lost.\n  We all know there are positive words coming back from Iraq. We know \nsome positive things have happened. But we know it is not done, and we \nknow it is not over. But I think, in defining what victory is, it is \nimportant to remember the speech the President of the United States \nmade the day before we all voted to authorize the engagement in Iraq \nand enforcement of U.N. Resolution 1441.\n  The President established three precise goals for our involvement in \nIraq. No. 1 was to depose Saddam Hussein and find, if they existed, the \nweapons of mass destruction that every nation in the world thought \nSaddam Hussein had and U.N. Resolution 1441 delineated; second, to \nallow the Iraqi people to hold free elections and establish a \ngovernment of their choosing; and the third goal was to adequately \ntrain the Iraqi military so it could successfully defend and protect \nthat fledgling new Government.\n  On goal No. 1, Saddam Hussein was captured, he was deposed, he was \ntried by the people of Iraq, and he was executed.\n  On the weapons of mass destruction, there are those who say we didn't \nfind them. We found all the components. The problem when you find a \nweapon of mass destruction, when you have a smoking gun, it has already \ngone off. So sometimes finding the components\n\n[[Page S11085]]\n\nis better. We did find Scud missiles buried in the sand between \nDamascus and Baghdad in Iraq, we found traces of sarin gas, we found \nmobile biological laboratories dismantled, and we found mass graves \nwhere hundreds of thousands of Iraqis had been killed. The evidence was \nthere.\n  Second, in terms of the Government and establishing elections, the \nIraqi people in 18 months held three elections, wrote a constitution, \nand established a government. Goal 2 accomplished.\n  Goal 3, to adequately train the Iraqi Army so it could defend the \npeople of Iraq and that fledgling government. I think it is very \ninstructive to recognize what has happened in recent days and in past \nmonths. Yesterday, the British left Basra, and as they left Basra and \ntheir post, who replaced them? Not the American military but the Iraqi \nmilitary, a clear and distinct sign that the Iraqi military is gaining \nthe ability to defend this fledgling country on their own.\n  Second, what happened 3 weeks ago. We finally captured and killed the \nbomber who set off the mosque bombing that set off the sectarian \nviolence about a year and a half ago. Who captured him? Mr. President, \n1,000 Iraqi troops with close air support by America, but the ground \naction was the Iraqis. On the ``clear and hold and secure'' of the \nsurge, we have Americans and Iraqi soldiers embedded, side by side, \nholding those parts of Baghdad that we have secured, holding them so \nreconstruction can take place.\n\n  We are making positive steps, and we are on the cusp of the third \ngoal being accomplished. We are not there yet, but we are on the cusp \nof it.\n  Where are we? We need to listen to what General Petraeus comes back \nand recommends, and Ambassador Crocker. I will not prejudge what the \nreport will say because I have not seen it yet, but I think we all know \nthere is enough evidence that we are coming close that it is very \nimportant we pay attention to the months ahead, which will be the most \ncritical in our engagement in Iraq.\n  To that end, I want to share a little bit of the advice of a good \nfriend to me, Lucy Harris, in Ellijay, GA. Lucy and I and her husband \nRick and her late son Noah's fiancee--he was killed in Iraq--sat with a \nreporter and photographer from the Washington Post, and they recorded \nour conversation that particular day for an article they wrote \nrecently. But I want to share with the Members the Senate some of the \nadvice Lucy gave to me. She lost her only son. Her only son was a \ncheerleader at the University of Georgia on 9/11/2001 who, upon that \ntragic day, walked up to the military ROTC on campus as a junior and \nsaid: I want to join and get a commission.\n  They said: You can't because you don't have enough time. You have to \nhave 2 years.\n  He said: I will make up the time.\n  Finally, the Army reluctantly agreed, and sure enough, in 18 months \nNoah Harris got his commission in ROTC and became a second lieutenant \nin the U.S. military. He volunteered because he wanted to confront the \nevil and terror he saw on that particular day.\n  He was known as the Beanie Baby soldier in Iraq. He led a platoon in \nIraq, and he carried, in one big pocket on his right leg, bullets, and \nin another big pocket on his left leg he carried Beanie Babies, and he \nshared them with the Iraqi kids as he would go through securing and \npatrolling areas of Baghdad. His unit started carrying Beanie Babies \nand other good things for the Iraqi kids. While defending freedom and \nhopefully securing that country, he was also winning the minds of those \nchildren.\n  Tragically, he was lost in the explosion of an IED in Iraq. I \nattended his funeral and saw the outpouring of love from a thousand \npeople in his community. So when Lucy sat down last week in Ellijay, \nGA, her advice to me was important and her advice to me was what \nappears on their car's license plate: IDWIC, those letters, because her \nson, Noah, who e-mailed back and forth with me before his tragic \npassing, always said: IDWIC--I do what I can. That was his motto. That \nis why he went to Iraq, to do what he could for freedom and democracy, \nfor peace and to end terror.\n  That is what his mom Lucy and Rick do today--they do what they can. \nIn their comments to the reporter, when asked what they think about all \nthe debate going on in Washington about Iraq, Lucy said: I think the \ndebate is healthy. I watch it. I think it is important. I think we \nshould all do what we can, but we need to make sure that my son Noah \ndid not die in vain.\n  To that end, as I approach the votes we will take--I don't know on \nwhat, but I know it will be about Iraq--in the months and weeks ahead \nfollowing the Petraeus report, I will do what I can to give us a chance \nto finish the job, win the victory the President outlined at the outset \n5 years ago on our entering Iraq, and honor and pay tribute to the \nsacrifice of the 3,700 or more Americans who have given their lives in \nthe effort of the overall war on terror and in particular the securing \nof Iraq and the opportunity for a fledgling democracy to take hold in \nthe Middle East.\n  These are difficult times but not nearly as difficult for us as for \nthe men and women who voluntarily go because they believe in our cause. \nI stand here today in the Senate hoping that all of us will not \nprejudge what Ambassador Crocker will say, or General Petraeus, nor \nshould we declare defeat when we have victory within reach, nor should \nwe declare victory if it is not there. But we should move forward in \norder to honor the sacrifice of the men and women who fight for our \ncountry voluntarily every day.\n  For me, I am going to do what I can. I am going to take Lucy Harris \nand Rick Harris and Ashley's advice. I am going to honor the life of \nNoah by listening closely to the report, by recognizing why we went in \nthe first place, and see to it we give ourselves a chance to declare \nthe victory that has been so bravely fought for by the men and women of \nthe U.S. military.\n  I hope we will all have open minds and open hearts and give thanks \nfor the sacrifices taking place and recognize again why we went in the \nfirst place and recognize again how close we are to achieving our \ngoals.\n  I yield the remainder of my time and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). The Senator from South \nCarolina is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/05/senate-section/article/S11085-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11085-S11087]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  IRAQ\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I wish to take this opportunity to talk a \nlittle bit about what I think is a very important debate, and that is \nabout Iraq war policy. Next week, I believe, General Petraeus and \nAmbassador Crocker will be coming to the Congress to brief us about the \nsituation as they see it. I think most of us in the Senate are very \nanxious to hear what our Ambassador has to say and our leading general \nin Iraq. There are GAO reports about benchmarks. The idea that we are \ntrying to evaluate performance and progress in Iraq is a good thing. \nSome of the benchmarks have not been met, apparently, some have. It \ndepends upon how you measure. The one thing I would caution my \ncolleagues to not forget is that the biggest benchmark is whether our \npresence in Iraq should be maintained in terms of our national security \ninterests or should we leave. If we do leave, how does that affect our \nlong-term security interests?\n  I think the biggest issue facing each Senator is how they view the \nwar in Iraq. This is a legitimate debate. There are two different ways \nof looking at the engagement in Iraq. Some Senators believe our \nmilitary presence in Iraq at such levels is propping up the Iraqi \nGovernment; they are relying too much upon us, they are putting off the \nhard decisions because we are doing the fighting and they can kind of \ntake their time, and that we should put more pressure on the Iraqi \nGovernment by beginning to withdraw troops.\n  There is another view that any presence in Iraq is creating more \nterrorism than it is preventing, that our presence in Iraq is creating \ninstability and problems for the Mideast as a whole, and that we should \nbasically get our eye back on the ball, Afghanistan, al-Qaida \noperations in other areas.\n\n[[Page S11086]]\n\n  Those are a couple of views. I hope I fairly summarized it. I do not \nwant to put words in people's mouths. But I think there are a couple of \nways of looking at Iraq.\n  There is another way. It is my way--it does not mean it is right, it \nis just the way I have come out on this--that Iraq, to me, is part of a \nglobal struggle, not just an isolated event.\n  Whether we should have gone into Iraq is sort of a moot question. The \nquestion for the country is: What happens in Iraq in terms of our \nnational security interests? Does it really matter? I would argue that \nthe enemy we are facing in Iraq is threefold. There is sectarian \nviolence within the country. There is Sunni-Shia violence, or people \nwithin the Shiia community using violence to try to get the upper hand \npolitically.\n  There are people, Sunni insurgents, who do not want to have a \ndemocracy. They do not want to have a representative government. They \nare trying to achieve power by the use of violence. So there is \ndefinitely some sectarian conflict between Sunni and Shias. That is \nvery real.\n  But there is also an element in Iraq called al-Qaida. Their goal is \nnot to dominate the Shiia population in Iraq. Their goal is much \nbroader. It is to make sure that representative government does not \ntake hold in the Mideast in a way that would allow religious tolerance. \nTheir goal is to make sure no representative government would spring up \nwhere a woman would have a say about her children.\n  You know, we are all over the world militarily. You can see what is \ngoing on in Germany today. But al-Qaida chose to come to Iraq, I \nbelieve not because of what we are doing there or the fact that we are \nthere, but because of what the Iraqi people may try to do. I do believe \nal-Qaida's international leadership has gone to Iraq to organize \nextremist forces within that country, religious extremists, because \nthey fear more than anything else another Muslim nation, Islamic \nnation, Arab nation, being able to come together and live through \nrepresentative democracy. That is why they are there.\n  If they can defeat this effort at moderation, destabilize this \ngovernment and drive us out, I think our worst days lie ahead. No \nmatter how we wish to view Iraq, there is no doubt in my mind what that \nenemy would say, al-Qaida international would say: They beat America in \nthe Land of the Two Rivers. Bin Ladin has called on all of those who \nbelieve as he does: Go to Iraq, join the fight, because now is the time \nto win a battle in the third world war and America must be defeated, \nnot the Iraqi Shiia population but America.\n  Now the Iranian involvement in Iraq. I have been on an 11-day tour \nover there as a Reserve lawyer. That was a wonderful experience, a very \nsmall contribution on my part. I learned how hard people work and how \nsmart they are. I am awed by our military. I think every Senator shares \nthat view. But one of the things I have learned from working on rule-\nof-law programs is how deeply involved the Iranian Quds force and other \norganizations are in funding militia groups.\n  The question for us all is why should Iran be involved in trying to \nfund groups dedicated to killing Americans? The Lieberman amendment \nthat passed without objection in the authorization debate in July was a \ndamning indictment of the Iranian involvement in Iraq. The question \nmust be asked and answered: Why? Why does Iran want to destabilize this \ngovernment? Why are they supporting extremist groups, mostly in the \nShia community but not exclusively, designed to kill Americans? Why are \nthey providing aid and comfort to those groups who wish to destroy our \nforces?\n  I argue they view Iraq as a threat, just as al-Qaida does, if the \nIraqi Government is able to stabilize itself. The Sunni and Shia Arabs \ncoming together, along with their Kurdish colleagues, to form a \nrepresentative government that will allow the people to elect their \nleaders is the biggest threat to Iranian theocracy. They are involved \nin Iraq from their own self-interest, not the interests of the Iranian \npeople, but the self-interest of the radical leadership within Iran. \nThey understand clearly if Iraq is able to stabilize itself and create \na moderate form of government, representative in nature, their \nnightmare just begins. That is why they are trying to drive us out.\n  The President of Iran, a questionable character at best, said, I \nthink, last week, they stand ready to fill the vacuum created when we \nleave. I argue that we need not leave a vacuum that Iran can fill.\n  There are three enemies: al-Qaida, sectarian violence, and the \nIranian elements trying to destabilize the Iraqi Government. One of the \nbiggest problems we have had since the fall of Baghdad is we didn't \nhave enough troops to provide security. After about five or six visits, \nit was clear to me that the situation was deteriorating in Iraq. Before \nthe surge, I came back more depressed after each visit. The level of \nviolence grew and the secure environment deteriorated.\n  Now we have a new strategy. We have put more combat power in place. \nIt has made a real difference on the security front. Anbar Province, \nthe western part of Iraq where the Sunnis dominated 6 months ago, was \ndeclared lost. It was an al-Qaida safe haven. We have heard the story \ntime and time again. The news of Anbar is not so much that we beat al-\nQaida military, not so much that the Sunni Arabs turned on al-Qaida, \njoined the fight with us against al-Qaida. That is understandable given \nthe way that al-Qaida treated the population in Anbar. What is the most \nexciting and encouraging is that in 2007 over 12,000 people have joined \nthe local police force in Anbar. The sons of Anbar were called upon by \nthe sheiks to take up arms by joining the police. This new police \npresence, once it is trained and equipped, will allow Anbar Province to \nbe held by Iraqis.\n  More encouraging than that, not only are people in Anbar beginning to \njoin institutions that would allow al-Qaida to be defeated in a \npermanent fashion, they are beginning to reach out to Baghdad, and \nthere is a movement going on between the Maliki government and \nleadership in Anbar to try to find a relationship where Baghdad is seen \nby the people of Anbar as a place you can do business. There is a lot \nof money being spent now by the central government on rule-of-law \nprojects in Anbar. There is an old palace of one of the sons of Saddam \nthat is going to be converted into a legal center where you can have \nterrorism courts, basic civil trials. You will have housing for judges \nthat will be secure so they won't be assassinated. You will have a \npolice training center there. There is a lot going on in terms of a \nrelationship between Baghdad and Anbar that could lead to \nreconciliation.\n  It is very true the political progress we had hoped for at the \nnational level has not yet transpired. But what has astounded me is the \namount of local reconciliation going on. Better security has led to \nbetter choices. People now feel more secure. They are telling us where \nal-Qaida operatives are hiding. They are giving us more information \nthan we have ever received before about how al-Qaida operates, and \nother extremist groups. People are getting more confident to speak out. \nMore than anything else, they are just war weary.\n  The one thing I have learned on this trip that was more abundant than \nany other is that Iraqis at the local level, in provinces all over the \ncountry, are very war weary. They are trying to bring the country \ntogether, their local communities together. They are tired of the \nkilling and the dying.\n  So as we listen to what Ambassador Crocker has to say, and General \nPetraeus, we should be mindful of the challenges. To me, the successes \nare obvious, but the challenges are equally obvious. I never said, for \nthe last 3\\1/2\\ years before the surge, that things were going great in \nIraq because, to me, they weren't. Things were getting worse. It was \nobvious they were. But I do see a turnaround. I think the surge has \naccomplished some things militarily that have led to better choices, \nand there is an effort to reconcile the country from the bottom up. It \nis very real.\n  The big pressure being applied to Baghdad is not what Senator Graham \nsays or what any other Senator from the United States may say about the \nMaliki government. The pressure I see on the ground is coming from the \npeople themselves. The people are war weary. They would like their \nrepresentatives in Baghdad to come together and create a stability that \nthey haven't known for 4 years.\n\n[[Page S11087]]\n\n  I am hopeful there will be political breakthroughs. Sunday a week ago \nthe five major players in Iraq recommitted themselves to a plan to come \nback together, reform the government, and reconcile the Iraqi people, \npassing major legislation. Debaathification, the ability of Sunnis to \nhold jobs in the government, is a big piece of legislation that would \ntransform Iraq. Local elections, allowing local people to pick their \ngovernors and representatives rather than Baghdad politicians making \nthose appointments, if there were local elections, the Sunnis would \nparticipate in large numbers. In 2005, they boycotted the election. Now \nthey are ready to engage in politics.\n  I predict that based on the success of the surge militarily, the \nefforts of local reconciliation are real, that they are going to move \nup to the national level, and soon, very soon, we will have some \nbreakthroughs in Baghdad in terms of political benchmarks that will \ntransform the country. That is my hope, my desire. The way we can \nachieve that is to pour it on, continue the surge, let it run its \ncourse. It has been in place now, I think, since April. Let's keep \npouring it on militarily, politically, and economically. We have the \nenemy on the mat. Let's don't let them up. Morale is sky high. Now is \nthe time for America to exercise good judgment, long-term thinking, and \nreinforce Iraq instead of withdrawal.\n  The message to withdraw, no matter how well intended, will not push \nIraqi politicians to do anything faster. It will encourage an \ninsurgency that is not being diminished.\n  Those are the issues that face the Senate as we await news from Iraq. \nLet's concentrate on the long term. The year 2008 will be here before \nwe know it, but the decisions we make about Iraq will have consequences \nlong after the election of 2008.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tester). The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Am I recognized for 20 minutes under morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/05/senate-section/article/S11087-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11087-S11088]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           NATIONAL SECURITY\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me talk for a moment about the issue \nof what is our national security. This morning, as I was getting ready \nfor work, I saw another television advertisement put together by people \nwho have accumulated some money and put ads on television. The \nadvertisement is one that says: We have to stay in Iraq. We can't \nsurrender in Iraq. We have to finish the job in Iraq. It says they \nattacked us on 9/11. The whole implication of the ad is, we are in Iraq \nbecause we are fighting the people who attacked us on 9/11. It is the \nsame dishonesty we have heard for a long time.\n  Let me describe again our national security interests and who \nattacked us on 9/11. We know who did because they bragged about it. \nThey boasted about attacking America. It was Osama bin Laden, al-\nZawahiri, and others, the leadership of al-Qaida. And where are they? \nAre they in Iraq? No, they are in Pakistan, we believe, somewhere \nbetween Afghanistan and Pakistan. Let me describe the connection of all \nof this and our national security interests.\n  This morning in the newspaper we see that in Copenhagen, Denmark, the \npolice have arrested some terrorists engaged in a terrorist plot with \nlinks to al-Qaida. They say these terrorists had traveled to Pakistan \nfor training, and the case against them involves links to militants in \nPakistan. Separately, last night a German Federal prosecutor had three \nsuspects picked up and arrested late Tuesday. The suspects were members \nof a terrorist organization, presumably with connections to al-Qaida. \nThere is evidence the men had trained in camps in Pakistan.\n  So let's understand, whether this is a surprise to any of us. Here is \nwhat we learned in February of this year. Senior leaders of al-Qaida \noperating from Pakistan over the past year have set up a band of \ntraining camps in the tribal region near the Afghan border, according \nto American intelligence and counterterrorism officials. There was \nmounting evidence that Osama bin Laden, and his deputy, al-Zawahiri, \nhad been steadily building an operations hub in the mountainous \nPakistani tribal area of northern Waziristan. That is from the New York \nTimes, quoting top intelligence sources.\n  In June: Al-Qaida regroups in new sanctuary on Pakistan border. While \nthe U.S. presses its war against an insurgency linked to al-Qaida in \nIraq, Osama bin Laden's group is recruiting, regrouping, and rebuilding \nin a sanctuary along the border between Afghanistan and Pakistan, \naccording to senior U.S. military and intelligence officials. The \nthreat from the radical Islamic enclave in Waziristan is more dangerous \nthan from Iraq, which President Bush and his aides call the ``central \nfront'' of the war on terrorism, according to some current and former \nU.S. officials and experts.\n  The National Intelligence Estimate from July of this year says: Al-\nQaida is and will remain the most serious terrorist threat to our \nhomeland. We assess the group has protected or regenerated key elements \nof its homeland attack capability, including a safe haven in Pakistan's \nfederally administrated tribal areas.\n  Is it a surprise that we pick up the newspaper this morning and see \nterrorists picked up in Germany, threatening to launch attacks against \nthe largest U.S. base in Europe, and that we read that they trained in \nPakistan, likely at an al-Qaida reconstituted training camp? Is that a \nsurprise to us?\n  We are engaged in a war in Iraq. The television commercial this \nmorning, my colleague this morning, and others, continue to say that is \nthe central fight of the war against terrorism. It is not. It is a \ncivil war. There is widespread sectarian violence. Yes, there are some \nterrorists there. Yes, al-Qaida is there. But that is not the central \npart of what al-Qaida has been about.\n  Al-Qaida did not have a presence in Iraq prior to 9/11. The \ntelevision commercial this morning says they attacked us on 9/11. \nImplying that this is why we are in Iraq fighting that war ignores a \nwhole body of truth, the body of truth I have just described. Those who \nattacked us and boasted of killing innocent Americans on 9/11 are now \nin a secure hideaway or a safe haven somewhere in Pakistan, not in \nIraq.\n  I ask this question of the President and the Congress: Why should \nthere be any square inch on the face of this planet that is safe or \nsecure for the leaders of the organization that boasted about attacking \nAmerica? Why should there be any place on this Earth that is safe or \nsecure for those who the intelligence estimate now tells us are \nplotting new attacks against our country? Why are they safe and secure? \nBecause this country is engaging door to door in Baghdad in the middle \nof a civil war. That is a fact.\n  We have people say: You can't surrender. If you try to redeploy, you \nare surrendering. I say this: What we ought to do is redeploy and \nunderstand that our policy is to fight the terrorists first. When we \ntalk about redeploying, we are not talking about not being able to \nfight terrorists, even in Iraq, to the extent they exist there. We are \ntalking about leaving enough troops for training of Iraqi forces, about \nfighting terrorists who exist in Iraq, and about force protection. But \nyou redeploy the troops to fight the terrorists first. Why on Earth \nshould we be debating in the Senate, and the President be in Australia \ntoday talking to his counterpart in that country about continuing the \nfight in Iraq, when Osama bin Laden, al-Zawahiri, and others are \nplanning additional attacks against this country? While, at the same \ntime, bin Laden and his henchmen are ``safe'' and ``secure'' in or near \nPakistan? That is unbelievable.\n  We need to change tactics. We need a change in course. When we pick \nup the paper this morning and read about terrorists being picked up in \nGermany, plotting attacks against the largest American military base in \nEurope, and they are trained in Pakistan, likely at an al-Qaida \ntraining camp, we are experiencing the fruits of bad policy and \ndishonest representation about where the fight exists. The central \nfight against terrorism, it seems to me, is to eliminate the leadership \nof al-Qaida, the very leadership who boasted about killing innocent \nAmericans on 9/11 and the very leadership who our National Intelligence \nEstimate now tells us are planning additional attacks against our \nhomeland.\n  We need a change in course. If we stand here and debate this question\n\n[[Page S11088]]\n\nabout, well, if you redeploy, change course here or there, you are \nsurrendering, that is not looking truth in the eye at all. The \ntelevision commercial I saw this morning--put together, I am sure, by \nsome big money interests that are suggesting somehow we are in Iraq \nbecause they attacked us on 9/11--is the perpetration of the same \ndishonesty we have seen for years.\n  We have had soldiers in Iraq longer than we were fighting in the \nSecond World War. I want Iraqis to be free. Saddam Hussein is gone. He \nis dead. He was executed. They now have a new Constitution and a new \nGovernment. Now the question is, Will the Iraqi people have the will to \nprovide for their own security?\n  We are going to leave Iraq. The question is not whether; it is when. \nWe cannot keep 160,000 American troops in the middle of a civil war in \nIraq for any lengthy period of time, especially while Osama bin Laden \nand al-Zawahiri are in the mountains training additional terrorists \nwhom they then send to Germany and perhaps to our country. We have to \nchange course. That is a fact. I am not giving you my opinion. I am \ntelling you what the National Intelligence Estimate tells us about the \ngreatest threat to our country.\n  The greatest threat to our homeland, according to the National \nIntelligence Estimate, is the leadership of al-Qaida, and they are in a \nsafe and secure haven, and they are planning additional attacks against \nour country. If one does not understand that by reading that which we \nshould read, go back to just prior to 2001 and take a look at the \nheadline on the PDF briefing given to the President in August 2001: \n``Bin Laden determined to strike in the U.S.'' It is time we read and \nit is time we understand. Regrettably, that has not been the case \nrecently. I hope it will as we turn to this debate in a serious way.\n  The change in course has to be, in my judgment: Fight the terrorists \nfirst. That ought to be this country's policy.\n  That was not why I came to the floor of the Senate today, but I was \ninspired to remember the television commercial I saw the first thing \nthis morning and then inspired by my colleague's statement about Iraq, \nonce again.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/05/senate-section/article/S11088-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11088-S11090]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRADE AND CONSUMER SAFETY\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. If I might, in a separate part of the Record, I wish to \ntalk about something that showed up in the newspapers this morning as \nwell. I wish to tell you first--this was not in the papers this \nmorning--about something that was a while back. I wish to tell you \nabout a 4-year-old boy named Jarnell Brown. Jarnell Brown was from \nMinnesota. Jarnell is now dead. Jarnell is dead because he was visiting \na friend's house, and he swallowed a small heart-shaped charm that came \non a bracelet that came with a pair of Reebok tennis shoes. It turns \nout that little charm, that little jewelry charm contained 99 percent \nlead, and it killed Jarnell Brown. It was 99 percent lead.\n  It came from China, which probably should not surprise us. It \nsuggests, once again, in this global economy--in which we decide we are \ngoing to produce elsewhere and ship here, after we spent a century \ndeveloping standards to protect workers, protect consumers, the kinds \nof things Americans basically expect to be protected for and from--we \ndecide we are going to outsource all that so we will have all these \nproducts made elsewhere and shipped into our country.\n  So we get tennis shoes, and we get a charm bracelet, and we get a \nheart attached to the end of the bracelet that is 99 percent lead, and \nthe young boy accidentally swallows that little heart and dies from \nlead poisoning.\n  Now, let me talk a bit about this morning's news. Mattel is \nannouncing this morning a product recall. They are recalling 848,000 \nChinese-made Barbie and Fisher-Price toys that have excessive amounts \nof lead. Toys are being pulled from store shelves, including Barbie \nkitchen and furniture items, Fisher-Price train toys, and Bongo Band \ndrums.\n  These are innocent enough looking products. But the surface paint on \nthese products contains excessive levels of lead, prohibited under our \nFederal laws because of the serious threat they pose to human health, \nparticularly the health of young children.\n  I do not suggest that Mattel has any response this morning other than \nbeing heartsick and heartbroken over this situation. Mattel is a good \ncompany. But what has happened to Mattel has happened to many other \ncompanies. They outsource production and then ship the product into \nthis country, and there is no determination of whether those products \nare produced under the same conditions we would require in this \ncountry.\n  We only inspect 1 percent of the products that come into this \ncountry. So whether it is food or toys or jewelry or other things we \nrequire certain kinds of standards with respect to its production here, \nyet there are no such standards required with respect to production \nelsewhere. Oh, I know the people who outsource these contracts will \nsay: Well, we require this and that of them. But there is no \nenforcement, and everyone knows that.\n  Let me describe a few of the circumstances. I talk about the lead \npaint. As we know, lead paint is used because it is bright, durable, \nflexible, fast drying, and, above all, it is cheap. So the Chinese, we \nnow know from products that are being pulled from the shelves, have \nused lead paint. They mass produce lead paint and coloring agents such \nas lead chromate that are generally cheaper than other pigments, so we \nare now seeing the effect of that on store shelves.\n  This poor 4-year-old boy felt the effect in the most extreme way. He \ndied.\n  It is not just China, and it is not just toys. FDA inspectors \nrecently intercepted shipments of black pepper with salmonella from \nIndia, intercepted crab meat from Mexico too filthy to eat, and produce \nfrom the Dominican Republic was stopped 813 times last year for \ncontaining traces of illegal pesticides--this is a country with whom we \njust signed a trade agreement.\n  Now let me describe--even as we have galloped globally to outsource \nproduction but not to develop and maintain the protections for the \nAmerican consumers on the products coming in--the Food and Drug \nAdministration. Under the Bush administration, the FDA's safety mission \nI think has been substantially reduced. In fact, the FDA is planning to \nclose 7 of its 13 drug safety labs, and it would close or consolidate a \nnumber of its 20 regional offices.\n  The trend has been to inspect fewer, not more, imports into this \ncountry under the administration. The FDA tests, we are told, about 1 \npercent of imported food. Last year, the FDA took 50 percent fewer \nsamples for testing from imported seafood than it did in the year \nprevious.\n  The issue is not just China, but China has been in the news more than \nany other country. Let me describe the circumstance of China because \nthat has become the most notorious offshore platform. Toys, dolls, \ngames, for all of these products China ranks as our No. 1 source of \nimports; fish, seafood, China is No. 1. Tires, China is No. 1; also for \npet food, and toothpaste; and the list goes on. In fact, we have such a \ngiant trade deficit with China--this chart shows what is happening with \nour trade relationship with China, which I think demonstrates an \nincompetence that is almost breathtaking for this country, an \nincompetence with respect to the negotiating of trade agreements and an \nincompetence with respect to enforcing trade agreements. But aside from \nthat, I describe a circumstance here, and we are seeing it now every \nday in the newspapers, of the danger to U.S. consumers.\n\n  Well, pet food--how many Americans had their pets die as a result of \ncontaminated pet food coming into this country? It was discovered that \nanimal food, pet food from China contained substances that are \ndangerous to pets. Sixty million packages of pet food under 150 brands \nwere recalled after it was found that ingredients in pet food could be \ndangerous to pets.\n  Seafood--the U.S. FDA banned the import of five types of farm-raised \nfish and shrimp from China after they were found to contain unsafe \ndrugs, some of which cause cancer.\n  Now, I am telling you what they have found and banned, and I am \ntelling you they have only inspected 1 percent.\n  Toothpaste, Chinese-made toothpaste sold in dollar stores--the FDA \nhas warned consumers to throw out any toothpaste made in China. In \nfact, they not only found some of the toothpaste was contaminated with \na dangerous ingredient, they found other toothpaste\n\n[[Page S11089]]\n\nthat was contaminated with the ingredient and did not list the \ningredient on the toothpaste box.\n  Toys and jewelry--I mentioned Mattel. There are others. Mattel has \nhad three very substantial recalls of Chinese-made toys in the last 5 \nmonths. Again, my guess is the executives of that company are heartsick \nabout what is happening. But it is a result of exporting manufacturing \nand not having the protections with respect to the conditions under \nwhich that product is manufactured--the protections for American \nconsumers that we have always come to expect.\n  I did not mention with respect to toys, the RC2 Corporation recalled \n1.5 million of these little toys, Thomas & Friends from its Wooden \nRailway product line, made by Hansheng Wood Products Factory in China \nusing lead paint.\n  According to a spot check recently, it was announced 20 percent of \nChinese-made jewelry contains potentially poisonous chemicals, \nincluding lead.\n  Automobile tires--a tire importer called Foreign Tire Sales recalled \n255,000 Chinese-made tires in August because they lacked a safety \nfeature that prevents tread separation.\n  I do not need to go through much more but only to say this: These are \nreal serious issues. I started by talking about a young 4-year-old boy \nnamed Jarnell Brown. He died. There are real consequences to these \nissues. We spent a century developing standards in this country to \nprotect workers, to protect consumers, and we built something very \nspecial and very important in this country.\n  Now, under a galloping global economy, in which the rules have not \nkept pace, we are told: Well--do you know what?--we are going to \noutsource manufacturing because we can pay people 30 cents an hour in \nsweatshops somewhere around the world, and we can have it manufactured \nfor less money.\n  Well, if that cheap product is unsafe for your health, if that \nproduct--whether it is food or vegetables or toys or jewelry--if that \nproduct is harmful to your health, we need to rethink the standards by \nwhich we engage in this global economy. Yes, it is a global economy, \nand I do not suggest we are going to retreat from the global economy. I \ndo suggest this: We should participate in the global economy on our \nterms. We should describe what kind of participation we will have with \nrespect to this economy in a way that is fair to our workers, that \nearns a decent wage in this country, and in a way that protects our \nconsumers for whom we have established certain consumer protections.\n  I know someone will say that is regulation. Yes, it is regulation. I \nspoke on the floor of the Senate one day, when I held up a package of \nbeef. I asked consent to do that. You have to have consent to hold up a \npackage of beef on the floor of the Senate because it is an object to \nshow. I said: I do not think anybody can tell me where this beef came \nfrom. I know they could not because it is not labeled.\n  So then I read the description of what the investigator found, the \ninspector found when he went to a plant in Hermosillo, Mexico, and \ninspected a plant that was processing beef, slaughtering cattle, \nprocessing beef and shipping it to the United States. He found \ncarcasses hanging under a hot roof, with flies and feces all over the \ncarcasses. He described horrendous things that I read on the floor of \nthe Senate and led me to ask: Does anybody want to buy beef from that \ncircumstance?\n  Well, guess what. It was the only time that plant had ever been \ninspected--the only time. As a result, the plant lost its license. It \nthen was sold, then changed its name, and was relicensed. It is now \nselling beef to the United States and has never again been inspected.\n  I use that only to say it is exactly the same coin--the flip side of \nthe same coin, of lead paint coming in a heart-shaped toy from China \nthat a young child swallows and, as a result, dies.\n  I have introduced legislation dealing with the other side of this as \nwell with respect to workers' rights, dealing with sweatshop labor and \nconditions under which people are working in sweatshops in other parts \nof the world; working in sweatshops and, in some cases, producing these \nkinds of products. Why? Because it is cheap. Cheap labor, cheap \nproducts. Use lead; it is cheap. The problem is it is harmful to your \nhealth and especially harmful to children. The legislation I have \nintroduced dealing with the issue of sweatshops and being fair to \nAmerican workers would ban the product of sweatshop labor coming into \nthis country. That bill, which is S. 367, has 12 bipartisan cosponsors.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add Senator Clinton today \nas a cosponsor to that piece of legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, if we look at these issues in the context \nnot of trying to destroy the advantages of a global economy but in the \ncontext of trying to make certain the protections we have developed for \nour country--protections that have allowed us to create a wonderful \nplace in which to work and consume--if we can, with respect to our \nparticipation in the global economy, raise standards rather than lower \nours--if we can do that, then we will have done something significant. \nBut that is not what has been happening. What has been happening in \nthis country is a race to the bottom, and a rush to embrace the refrain \nby some who want to produce where it is cheap and sell here and run \ntheir income through the Cayman Islands to avoid paying taxes, and they \nsay, You know, we don't want any more regulations. I understand that. \nThey want to avoid regulations. They want to avoid paying a decent \nwage. They want to go to offshore manufacturing platforms some place \nand produce little bracelets with little hearts that are made with 99 \npercent lead to ship into this country. That doesn't work. It won't \nwork anymore. Somehow, as a country, we have to find a way to stop it.\n  My colleague Senator Durbin has a piece of legislation on the safety \nof food imports, which I am working on with him. I have also described \nthe sweatshop labor bill I have introduced, and it is a bipartisan \nbill, and my hope is we can move and begin to address these issues.\n  I know there are others who are going to want to speak in morning \nbusiness, and as soon as they come I will discontinue mine, but I do \nwant to make a couple of other points about this country's economy.\n  When one looks at the last century or so, we created a place that is \npretty unusual on this Earth and we did that because we cared about \nAmerican workers, and we created a manufacturing base that was the \nstrongest in the world. You cannot long remain a world economic power \nwithout a first-rate manufacturing base, and we are now seeing that \nsome don't care about a manufacturing base. Let's outsource to wherever \nwe can find the cheapest labor. Let's outsource to not only where we \ncan find the cheapest labor, but also where we can combine that with \nthe lack of regulations. We can allow that to exist in circumstances \nwhere those who produce and pump chemicals into the air, chemicals into \nthe water. Well, the problem with that is you are not only confronted \nwith what is called ``the China price,'' the China price with respect \nto goods--you have to compete with the China price--you also now \nunderstand the term ``the China haze,'' because we are breathing \npollutants that come from China. We all live in the same fishbowl. \nThings we long ago abandoned in this country because we understand it \ncauses cancer, causes terrible danger to human health, we are now \nbreathing again in this country because of a phenomenon called the \nChina haze.\n  I know I have described China at some length today. It is not only \nChina we need to be concerned about with respect to what are fair rules \nand fair requirements with respect to our participation in the global \neconomy. But I don't think we should any longer ignore the consequences \nabout what we read in the paper this morning: the recall of hundreds of \nthousands of additional toys that are shipped into this country to be \nsold on store shelves and to be played with by American children when, \nin fact, they contain amounts of lead that are harmful or dangerous to \nour children. We can't ignore that.\n  I congratulate the companies that are recalling those products, but \nwe shouldn't have had a reason to recall them in the first place. They \nshould have been produced under conditions that we would have known in \nthis country to be safe, that represent the\n\n[[Page S11090]]\n\nstandards we long ago have required in this country. That has not been \nthe case, and I think that because it is not the case, it raises a \ngreat many questions. I also, as I indicated earlier, believe at the \nvery time we are seeing all of these products coming into this country \nthat can cause serious problems for human health, at the very time we \nsee that, to see this administration decide to retract on those issues \nand begin to actually inspect fewer rather than more products, at a \ntime when we are inspecting only 1 percent of all of that which comes \nin, I think that is a serious step in exactly the wrong direction.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and make a point of order that a \nquorum is not present.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the situation in \nIraq and the continuing efforts of this administration to paint a rosy \npicture and to cling to straws when the situation on the ground and \ncommon sense suggest just the opposite.\n  Some have argued that the surge in Iraq is working, but all you have \nto do is look at the facts to know that is not the case. The President \nwent to Anbar Province, which at the moment he is touting as a place of \nsuccess, but we all know what is happening in Iraq. Many other \nprovinces are in terrible shape. In Iraq, in a certain sense, when you \npush on one end of the balloon and make things a little better, \nsomething pops out at another end.\n  The fallacy of the President's new policy is amazing. Are we placing \nour faith in the future of Iraq in the hands of some warlords, some \ntribal leaders who at the moment dislike al-Qaida more than they \ndislike us? Make no mistake about it: They are no friends of Americans. \nIs this the vaunted clarion cry for democracy in the Middle East that \nthe President announced when he started the buildup in Iraq? Obviously \nnot. This is a policy of last resort. This is a policy of desperation. \nTo say at the moment that some warlords in one province in Iraq happen \nto be shooting at al-Qaida when 6 months from now they could easily \nturn around and resume shooting at Americans, which they did in the \npast, is nothing to base a policy on. What kind of policy is it? What \nare the odds that 6 months from now, the fragile and perilous situation \nin Anbar will reverse itself and collapse? We have heard of success \nstories every 6 or 8 months: This province, this town, this city--they \nare clear, they are safe. Then, because of the basic facts on the \nground, we revert to the old situation.\n  Let me be clear. The violence in Anbar has gone down despite the \nsurge, not because of the surge. The inability of American soldiers to \nprotect these tribes from al-Qaida said to these tribes: we have to \nfight al-Qaida ourselves. It wasn't that the surge brought peace here; \nit was that the warlords took peace here, created a temporary peace \nhere, and that is because there was no one else there protecting them.\n  As I said, we have heard about successes in the past. They are \ntemporary. They are not based on any permanent structural change or any \npermanent change in the views of Iraqi citizens. We have heard about \nsuccess in Baghdad. We have heard about success in Fallujah. We have \nheard about success in this province and that province, and it vanishes \nlike the wind. So now, at a time when the people of America are crying \nout for a change in course, are some going to base a temporary \nsituation in one province--Anbar--based on a few warlords who don't \nbelieve in democracy and who don't like America, as a way to continue \nthe present misguided policy? It makes no sense.\n  It makes no sense because the fundamentals in Iraq stay the same. \nThere is no central government that has any viability. The Shiites, the \nKurds, and the Sunnis dislike one another far more than they like or \nwant any central government, and these two facts doom the \nadministration's policy to failure. Only 7 or 8 months ago when the \nPresident began the surge, he said it was to give the present \nGovernment breathing room, to strengthen the Maliki government. Today, \nwe have more troops, more military patrols, more death, and the Iraqi \nGovernment grows weaker. How can we regard the Bush-Petraeus surge as a \nsuccess when its central goal--to strengthen the Government--has \nfailed? Again, more troops, more American deaths this summer than any \nother, and yet the Government is weaker, when the very purpose of the \nsurge was to strengthen the Government and, in the President's words, \nto give it breathing room. By the President's own words, the Government \nis suffocating while the surge goes on. It doesn't have breathing room.\n  Why isn't it apparent to the President? Why isn't it apparent to my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle that the stated goal of the \nsurge is failing? Strengthening the central government has not \nhappened. As the surge and the number of troops goes up, the strength \nof the central government goes down. That equation says failure in the \nBush-Petraeus surge.\n  The goal is not a military goal. In the President's own words, it is \nto give the Government of Iraq greater stability, greater breathing \nroom, and that Government, by just about every standard, is worse off \nthan it was before. Again, because a few warlords and tribal leaders \nare now temporarily on our side for the moment, even though they are \nnot loyal to us, they don't like us and they dislike the central \ngovernment, that is why we should continue the present course in Iraq? \nIt makes no sense.\n  Then those on the other side of the President say, give us a chance; \nyou are already declaring defeat. If this were 2003 or 2004 or 2005 or \nmaybe even 2006, maybe those words would have some resonance with the \nAmerican people. But there has been new plan after new plan, new hope \nafter new hope, and they all are dashed within months. Why? Why? Again, \nbecause the fundamentals on the ground don't change. The Kurds, the \nShiites, the Sunnis dislike one another more than they like any central \ngovernment.\n  If you look at the benchmarks, they show that. The independent GAO \nreport showed little progress being made in meeting the 18 military and \npolitical benchmarks set out by Congress. The draft report from last \nweek showed only three of the benchmarks had been met. However, over \nthe weekend, the Pentagon revised the report and now miraculously an \nadditional four benchmarks were ``partially met.'' Despite the apparent \nefforts by the Pentagon to edit this independent report, it will sadly \ntake much more than a red pen to correct the failures of the \nPresident's Iraq policy.\n  So the surge, by the President's own stated goal, has failed. The \ncentral government is weaker. The fundamentals on the ground continue \nto deteriorate. There continues to be no loyalty to a central \ngovernment in Iraq and no loyalty to Maliki, who seems to almost revel \nin his incompetence. The bottom line is very simple: We are worse off, \nnot better off, not even the same, in Iraq today than we were 6 months \nago. The position of America, the position of democracy, the position \nof stability, continues to erode.\n  If there was ever a need for a change of course in Iraq, it is now. I \nplead with my colleagues from the other side of the aisle. You know we \nhave to change course. The President has thrown you this magical sort \nof temporary solution--Anbar Province. Don't be fooled. It is no \ndifferent than Fallujah was a few years ago, or Baghdad, or all of \nthese other ``successes.'' They are not successes because the facts on \nthe ground are the same.\n  The American people--three-quarters--cry out for a change of course \nin Iraq. The President doesn't hear them. The President doesn't look at \nthe facts on the ground. The very same fallacies that led us into this \nwar--that there were weapons of mass destruction and Iraq was at the \ncenter of a nexus of terrorism--are now blinding my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle from changing course in Iraq--the same types of \nfalse statements and pretenses. It is time to change course for the \nsake of the soldiers who are valiantly defending us; for the sake of \nmoving on and having America focus\n\n[[Page S11091]]\n\non other international problems and not have them be exacerbated by the \nwar in Iraq; for the sake of the $500 billion to $600 billion we spent \nthat could be spent here on education and health care and \ninfrastructure; for the sake, ultimately, of the greatness of this \ngreat country of ours, we must change course in Iraq. We must do it \nnow.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, over the August recess, my wife and I were \ninvited to a friend's house for a barbeque. A number of young couples \nwere there with their toddlers. It was a lot of fun watching these kids \ntake their first steps and laughing as they played with one another. \nOne of the fathers turned to me during the course of the barbecue and \nsaid, ``Well, it looks like it is going to be a Christmas without toys; \nthere is nothing safe that we can buy anymore.'' I thought to myself \nthat many of the headlines that occupy our attention here in the \nCongress are headlines ordinary families are not watching closely. But \nwhen it comes to something as basic as the toys they buy for their kids \nand whether they are safe, a lot of families are tuned in.\n  All across America, there is a growing concern. What this father said \nto me was, ``Dick, I thought if they put the stuff on the shelf, it had \nto be safe, right?'' I wish I could answer yes. The honest answer is \nno. What is put on the shelf across America isn't necessarily safe. We \nare learning that over and over again. It comes down to some basic \nconcepts of whether Government has an important role to play when it \ncomes to toys and other parts of our lives. We can certainly ask the \npeople who live, or used to live, in New Orleans, whether Government is \nimportant. When Hurricane Katrina hit and the levees broke and they \nlost their homes, families had to move hundreds of miles away. They \nunderstand that when Government fails you, as it did in New Orleans, \nlife can be very difficult. Or, of course, you can go to Minneapolis \nnow and see what is left of an interstate highway bridge built to \nGovernment standards, subject to Government inspection, which \ncollapsed, killing innocent people and causing havoc all across that \ngreat part of our Midwest.\n  The same thing, unfortunately, is true when it comes to the Consumer \nProduct Safety Commission. This is a commission created back in the \n1970s when people started asking hard questions about things they were \nbuying and driving, whether they were safe. A movement started that led \nto passage of legislation creating this watchdog agency. There was a \nhuge mandate we gave them: Make sure the things we put on the shelf for \nAmericans are safe, that the products are not defective or unsafe. That \nmay be too big a task for any one agency.\n  Over the years, what has happened is that this agency, instead of \ngrowing to meet the challenge, has been shrinking as the challenge \ngrows. Today, there are 401 people working at this agency, responsible \nfor reviewing trillions of dollars worth of products made in the United \nStates and imported into the United States to make certain they are \nsafe. I am familiar a little with this agency because I recently became \nchairman of a subcommittee that handles its appropriation. When you \nlook at the amount of money we are spending there, the President asked \nfor about $63 million for the Consumer Product Safety Commission. This \nagency has been limping along for years with hardly any money being \ninfused into it and very few employees being added to the payroll. So, \nas a result today, the 401 employees have a huge mandate. I am hoping, \nin the next appropriation cycle, to improve and include additional \nmoney for this commission. In fact, our full committee reported $70 \nmillion, which is about a 10-percent or more increase in the \nappropriation for this agency. Seventy million dollars is still not \nenough, but it is significant at a time when we are spending $12 \nbillion a month in Iraq--$12 billion a month. Here we are arguing about \nwhat is small change--what is lost with single-bid contractors in Iraq \nevery day. We are worrying about whether we can come up with $10 \nmillion for an agency that is responsible for the safety of products we \nbuy.\n  The Consumer Product Safety Commission finds that of the defective \nand unsafe products sold to Americans, two-thirds of them are imported, \nand two-thirds of those come from one country, which is China. Over and \nover again, month after month, year after year, China continues to send \nus defective products. This isn't a new thing. It reflects what is \ngoing on as the Chinese economy moves from the Dark Ages into the 21st \ncentury global economy and tries to accommodate differences in culture \nand taste and consumer appetite around the world. So we see a lot of \nproblems. The problems didn't come to our attention until earlier this \nyear. It is interesting how that happened. The first thing that caught \nour attention was pet food, the dog and cat food we were giving to our \npets. Families across America found out it was unsafe, and these \nhelpless animals were dying. A little investigation found out it was \ntraced back to a food product sent from China that was injected with \nthe chemical called melamine for the purpose of making it appear to be \nmore valuable. It was economic fraud. Somebody in China put this \nmelamine chemical into this protein product to make more money, even \nthough melamine is unfit for human or animal consumption. Well, all \nacross America, millions of pet owners went into a panic. They pulled \npet foods from the shelves and worried about whether there was more in \nthe chain and whether more animals were going to die. It was an \ninteresting psychology there. We knew all along that the Chinese were \nsending us suspect products. But at this point in time animal owners \nacross America, feeling a special responsibility to that helpless pet \nthey loved and is a member of their family, were up in arms. Why are we \nletting the Chinese do this, send these products to America?\n\n  Then do you know what came next? Toothpaste. This was a good one. We \ndiscovered antifreeze in toothpaste made in China. Antifreeze. It turns \nout that they used, instead of glycerin, a form of glycol--close \nenough, I guess--which is a component of antifreeze. When the Chinese \nwere confronted with toothpaste with antifreeze in it being sold around \nthe world, they had an ingenious response. They said: As we understand \nit, you are not supposed to swallow toothpaste. What a great defense \nthat was.\n  Then more scandals followed. Along came the toy scandal, which we are \nin the middle of right now. The Chicago Tribune ran a lengthy series \nabout a toy that caught my attention because I bought one for my \ngrandson, called Magnetix. It is kind of cool. It looked like old \nerector sets with magnets. My grandson jumped on it, making elaborate \ncreations because the magnets stuck to one another. The tiny magnets \nwere about the size of a little pill. If you looked at them, you might \nmistake them as something you could eat if you are a 1- or 2-year-old. \nYou might pop them in your mouth. If you swallow one, no problem. If \nyou swallow two, it is a big problem because the magnets would adhere \nin your intestines, requiring surgery and, in some cases, cause death. \nIt turned out to be a design flaw in the product. I know my kids and \ngrandson are pretty tough on their toys. If you were tough on the \nMagnetix toys, these magnets would pop out, and toddlers, not knowing \nbetter, would stick them in their mouths and swallow them like candy, \nnot knowing the dire consequences that could follow.\n  The Consumer Product Safety Commission was called into the case and \nthe Chicago Tribune story tells us that what happened was not \nencouraging because the laws are so weak in America, and the commission \nhad to sit down and negotiate with the company that made this deadly \ntoy on a press release announcing that the toy should be recalled. The \nlawyers for the commission sat down with the lawyers for the toy \ncompany and got into this long battle about what exactly they would say \nin the press release to recall the toy. Meanwhile, of course, it is \nstill being sold in America while the debate continues. So the laws \nfundamentally, when it comes to the protection of American consumers, \nare not strong enough. They don't require the kind of notification of \ndefect and danger we should expect as consumers. They don't put the \nburden on the manufacturer of a defective product to recall it \nimmediately. They give that manufacturer\n\n[[Page S11092]]\n\ntoo much leeway when it comes to even taking a product off the shelf or \nputting a warning label on the shelf. It turns out that with this \nadministration, the Bush administration, they have appointed people to \nthe Consumer Product Safety Commission who have been leaning more \ntoward the makers of toys and products and away from protecting \nconsumers. There was a gentleman--a former attorney general of New \nMexico named Harold Stratton. He came on and, frankly, reassured the \nNational Association of Manufacturers that they didn't have to worry \nabout this Consumer Product Safety Commission getting out of hand. He \nappointed a Mr. Mullan as the agency's general counsel, who time and \nagain seemed to find reasons not to recall defective products and give \nthose making them a little more time to make more money off of \nsomething that may be a little dangerous. The commission didn't do too \nmuch in terms of helping consumers.\n  Today, it is a commission that limps along because it doesn't have \nthe three commissioners it needs to operate. It only has two. \nPromulgating new rules and coming up with new initiatives is hampered \nbecause they don't have enough people to do it. Had the Bush \nadministration tried to fill the vacancy? Who did they send? A person \nwho, unfortunately, had a resume that showed he was following on in the \ntradition of Mr. Stratton and Mr. Mullan. He was a person with a \nbackground on the manufacturing side and not the consumer side.\n  This is an agency for consumers that we have to count on. So when the \nadministration doesn't fill the vacancy, it creates a problem in the \nadministration. I have been disappointed by the Consumer Product Safety \nCommission recently. Mattel today has a third toy recall. They are \nrecalling millions of toys because of lead paint and other dangers. Bob \nEckert, the CEO of Mattel, made a special trip to meet with me in \nChicago over the break. I respect him. He understands that if his \ncompany is going to succeed, parents have to trust the products they \nbuy with the name Mattel on the box. He gave me his assurance--proven \nby today's press release--that they are going to pull every unsafe and \ndangerous toy off of the shelf that his company had anything to do \nwith.\n  You might ask yourself, why do we have lead paint coming in on toys \nfrom China? Let's get down to basics. It is not because lead paint is \ncheaper in China. No. It is because the workers who are making the toys \nare paid about $75 or $80 a month. It is because those workers have no \nidea what those toys are all about. They never see these in the world \nthey live in. They don't have any idea what America is about. They may \nnot have any concept of what we consider to be safe and healthy. They \nare being told to make this toy, paint it, and move it down the line. \nThe companies have a responsibility to watch these workers and have \ncertain standards, but the bottom line is this: When we go to the \nlowest cost workers in the world to make our products, we should not be \nsurprised when oftentimes those products are unsafe, unhealthy, and \ndefective. With the Chinese, the list of products they send to us that \nare unsafe goes far beyond those that are the jurisdiction of the \nConsumer Product Safety Commission.\n  The Food and Drug Administration looks at food products, such as pet \nfood and other food products, imported from all over the world, and \neach month they report to Americans which countries are sending the \nmost dangerous food products to America. Guess which country ranks No. \n1 or No. 2 every single month? China. Same issue. Time and again, we \nfind that the Chinese are not living up to standards we expect in \nAmerica.\n  When I think back to this barbecue I attended, most American families \nthink the Senate and the House, Congress and the President are \nprotecting them, that we are doing our job. When 1 out of every 100 \nshipments coming into this country is inspected, when we have some \nports where the volume of imports overwhelm the one or two inspectors \non the job, then, frankly, we are not keeping faith with the American \npeople, and that is the reality.\n  I say to my colleagues in the Senate that we have voted for expanding \nglobal trade, and I think we must. America cannot get rich doing \nbusiness just among ourselves and doing one another's laundry, but we \nnever voted to compromise the health and safety of American families, \nand we shouldn't now.\n  The Consumer Product Safety Commission has to accept its \nresponsibility to be more forward thinking, to use their statutory \nauthority to protect people, particularly children. Families who walk \ninto toy stores in America should not have to play Chinese roulette \nwhen they are buying toys for Christmas, and that is the reality today. \nIt is time for the Consumer Product Safety Commission to use their \nstatutory authority effectively. It is time for the President to fill \nthe vacancy on that Commission with a person who is truly a consumer \nadvocate. It is time for Congress to put the resources into the \nConsumer Product Safety Commission so it can start doing the job it \npromised it would do when it was created almost 40 years ago. Until \nthen, we are going to have to rely on importers, manufacturers, and \nretailers in America to restore the confidence of American families in \nthe toys they will buy for this holiday season.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/05/senate-section/article/S11092-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11092]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey).

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of H.R. 2642, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 2642) making appropriations for military \n     construction, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and related \n     agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2008, and \n     for other purposes.\n\n  The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I am pleased to resume consideration of the \nfiscal year 2008 Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and related \nagencies appropriations bill.\n  To recap the essentials which I discussed yesterday, the bill \nprovides $109.2 billion in funding, including $44.5 billion in \nmandatory spending and $43 billion in discretionary funding for the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs. Overall discretionary funding in the \nbill totals $64.7 billion. That is a $4 billion increase over the \nPresident's budget request. Most of the increased funding is targeted \nat expanding and improving veterans health care, which is an essential \nrequirement for our obligation to the veterans, and also it recognizes \nthat as generations of veterans are aging, those veterans from Korea \nand World War II and the Vietnam conflict, we also have a new era of \nveterans from Afghanistan and Iraq, and this money is essential.\n  This bill represents a landmark commitment to our troops and their \nfamilies and our Nation's veterans by investing in urgently needed \nmilitary construction projects and in expanding health care services to \nour veterans.\n  For the Department of Veterans Affairs, the bill includes $29 billion \nfor direct medical services for veterans. This level of funding is \nequal to the amount requested by the veterans service organizations in \nthe independent budget. Each year, our veterans service organizations \nprepare an independent budget, not based upon what the administration \nthinks they can afford but what veterans need. This is one of the few \ntimes we have been able to meet that objective of the veterans service \norganizations within their independent budget. It will allow the \nDepartment to increase its resources for both physical and mental \nhealth care for veterans, and it will give the Department the resources \nit needs to expand research and treatment of traumatic brain injury and \npost-traumatic stress disorders. At a time when scores of veterans are \nreturning from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan with these often \ninvisible wounds, this increased funding in this regard is urgently \nneeded. It has been estimated that perhaps 30 percent of those who have \nserved in Iraq or Afghanistan have received either traumatic brain \ninjuries or have post-traumatic stress or both, and we have to be able \nto respond to those concerns.\n  The bill also includes needed funding for military construction of \nfacilities\n\n[[Page S11093]]\n\nand housing for our troops and their families. We are a nation at war, \nand our military forces need the best possible facilities to work, \ntrain, and to hone their skills, and their families need the best \npossible housing and quality-of-life facilities, such as chapels and \nchildcare centers, to see them through the strain and hardship of \nrepeated and lengthy deployments.\n  As I have said before, this bill is supported by the Department of \nVeterans Affairs and the veterans service organizations. The President, \nin his Statement of Administration Policy released yesterday, signaled \nhis intention to sign the bill as reported out of the committee, and I \nhope that intention is carried through.\n  There is no reason the Senate cannot complete work on this bill at a \nreasonable hour today. In fact, I have spoken with the majority leader, \nand he has indicated to me that it is his desire to move this bill \ntoday, to complete work on it today, and to be able to have a vote on \nfinal passage we hope sometime today. I urge my colleagues, if they \nhave amendments they wish to offer, to bring them to the floor as soon \nas possible. It takes a long time to deal with some of these issues, to \nvet them, to clear the amendments, and the slower the amendments are \npresented to us, the longer it will take to complete action on this \nbill. But the majority leader is committed to finishing this bill \ntoday, and I share that commitment. The Senate cannot afford to drag \nits feet on this bill. Our men and women in uniform, our Nation's \nveterans are depending on us to provide the resources they so urgently \nneed. I urge my colleagues to move quickly to pass this bill.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, in Iraq and Afghanistan, like so many \nconflicts before, our servicemembers have done absolutely everything \nthat has been asked of them. They have answered the President's call to \nwar with honor and a sense of duty we have come to expect from our \nNation's bravest men and women. They have performed under enormous \npressure in the middle of a civil war, they have left behind loved ones \nwho count on them, and they have continued to put their lives on the \nline every day.\n  Unfortunately, at home, their commitment to service has not been met \nyet by an administration that is committed to care for them. From poor \nconditions at VA facilities around the country, lack of PTSD \ncounselors, benefits claims backlogs that keep our veterans waiting for \nmonths and months and months and sometimes years, it is very clear that \nso far this administration has failed to account for our Nation's \nveterans and to count them as a cost of this war. It is unacceptable \nthat servicemembers who fought overseas are returning home and being \nforced to fight their own Government for the care and services they \nneed.\n\n  Today, with the bill that is in front of us, the VA bill, we take a \nmajor step toward reversing that trend and the Bush administration's \nfailure to care for our heroes. The funding for our veterans included \nin the VA bill is more than $3.6 billion over the President's request. \nAfter years of cutting corners on caring for our heroes, we are finally \nputting forth an honest assessment of what these men and women need.\n  This bill takes into account the additional strains on the VA system \nthat simultaneous wars and new battlefield realities present. It is an \ninvestment that represents nearly all of the independent budget, which \nis the recommendation of the funds needed to care for our veterans and \nis compiled by our veterans service organization.\n  This bill invests in improving health care, expanding mental health \nservices, and constructing new facilities that are really needed. It is \ngoing to mean, when this bill is passed and signed by the President, \nmore qualified health care workers, better prosthetics that our \nservicemembers are asking for, and more accessible veterans facilities. \nIt is also going to mean, importantly, thousands of new VA case workers \nwho will help us reduce that unacceptable delay that we have heard \nabout from so many of our veterans when they come home and try to \naccess their benefits.\n  It will improve conditions at our VA facilities. It will add an \nincreased investment in polytrauma and mental health care facilities \nthat will drastically improve treatment for PTSD and traumatic brain \ninjury and catastrophic injuries as well. Most of all, this bill means \nafter years of neglect our Government is again going to honor our \nveterans' sacrifices.\n  This bill and all it provides could not come at a more crucial time. \nAs a member myself of both the appropriations subcommittee that is \nresponsible for this bill and the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, I \nhave heard numerous times firsthand about the VA's shortcomings in \ncaring for our veterans. In fact, last month on the August break I held \na Senate Veterans' Affairs field hearing in Takoma, WA, to specifically \nexamine the challenges that men and women are facing when they come \nhome. At that hearing I spoke with Brandon Jacobs. He is a veteran of \nthe Army and National Guard, and he served in Iraq. He said a lot more \nhas to be done to raise awareness of post-traumatic stress syndrome and \ncombat-related stresses. He talked about how we needed to not only \nincrease access for him and his fellow servicemembers, but also for the \nfamilies that struggle when a loved one returns home with an invisible \nwound.\n  I also heard from a young man, Dan Purcell. He is an Iraq veteran who \nsaid he didn't ``want to be treated as a tool that could be casually \ndiscarded when broken or found to be no longer useful.'' What a tragic \nstatement from someone who served us overseas, that when he comes home \nhe feels like a discarded tool because he has been broken. That is not \nhow we should be treating our veterans, and that is not how this VA/HUD \nbill treats our veterans.\n  This bill that is before us finally takes the important steps that \nare necessary to recognize Brandon and Dan and so many others who are \npart of the costs of this war. We also have to make sure our troops are \nready and that they receive the training they need before we send them \noverseas. I am very pleased that within this bill, the military \nconstruction investments that are made will help our country do a \nbetter job in training the men and women we asked to serve us in our \nmilitary. In my home State of Washington, our military facilities play \na very important role in our Nation's security. We have Fort Lewis in \nTacoma, where we are training the Stryker Brigades at the center of the \nfighting in Iraq, we have Fairchild Air Force Base in Spokane that \nplays a major role in our air defense, and we have the Naval Air \nStation Whidbey Island that helps patrol the Pacific shores. It is \nextremely critical that these bases, which serve such vital roles, \nreceive the funding they need.\n  The bill that is in front of us today does just that and provides \nmore than $635 million in improvements for Washington State military \ninstallations. I thank Senators Reed and Hutchison for their special \nattention and recognition of the needs of our bases in my home State of \nWashington and across the country. Their leadership on this bill has \nbeen outstanding.\n  I know the chair and ranking member will be on the Senate floor \nthroughout today. The leader has told us that he wants this bill \nfinished by this evening. I urge all Members who have any amendments to \ncome this afternoon to get their amendments offered because we do have \nto wrap up this bill. We are very aware of the timelines that are \napproaching, the very short amount of time that is left to get our \nnumerous appropriations bills through. We intend to move them through. \nIn order to do that we ask Members to come to the floor today, offer \ntheir amendments, let's work through them and get this bill passed so \nwe can get it sent to the President.\n  It is important to pass this bill because this bill recognizes that \nany time we invest in building our military and improving training for \nour troops we invest in their care. I remind my colleagues what George \nWashington famously observed one time:\n\n       The willingness with which our young people are likely to \n     serve in any way war, no\n\n[[Page S11094]]\n\n     matter how justified, shall be directly proportional to how \n     they perceive the veterans of earlier wars were treated and \n     appreciated by their country.\n\n  The bill in front of us reverses President Bush's failures and \ncarries through on the commitment that our very first President \ndiscussed. It keeps our military strong by honoring the sacrifices of \nour heroes with the funding that meets their needs.\n  I note this bill has been endorsed by the Disabled Americans, \nVeterans of Foreign Wars, American Legion, Paralyzed Veterans of \nAmerica, AMVETS, and the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, \namong many other veterans service organizations that take so much time \nout of their own lives to fight for our veterans and recognize the \ncritical funding for this bill.\n  I note an AP article from this morning that says the Secretary of the \nVA, Secretary Nickolson, has said in a letter to key lawmakers they do \nnot need additional funding, they just need this bill passed. I note we \nhave heard that song before, and that song was wrong.\n  We have to do the right thing. This bill is critical. The additional \nfunding in this bill, I think every Member knows is needed. Every one \nof us has been out there and talked to the men and women who have come \nhome from Iraq, to their families, and heard from PTSD counselors on \ndown the line who have visited facilities or Walter Reed or seen \nfacilities in their own States. They know this funding is needed. I \nencourage my colleagues to come to the Senate floor, offer their \namendments, get this bill expeditiously to conference and sent to the \nPresident. I encourage the President and Secretary not to challenge us \non the need for funding but to do the right thing; recognize the care \nof our service men and women is part of the cost of war. It is an \nobligation we have to meet.\n  We are meeting it with this bill, and I hope we can get it done \nquickly so our veterans, many men and women who have served us, will \nknow this country is doing right by them.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                H.R. 327\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I wanted to spend a few minutes noting \nsome things in the press about H.R. 327 and my hold on that bill. This \nis a bill which is very well intended. It is to help prevent suicide \namong our veterans.\n  I have been in the medical field since 1978--1979, that is. \nApproximately 6 to 10 percent of my practice has been associated with \ndepression, treating clinical depression, suicidal ideation, post-\ntraumatic stress disorder, and other issues.\n  We need to offer our veterans whatever we can offer them in terms of \nhelping them deal with what they have been through and also helping our \nveterans who have no connection with their war experience in terms of \ntreatment of depression.\n  Our veterans have the right to expect the legislation we craft to \ndeliver on good intentions. H.R. 327, frankly, does not do that. One of \nthe serious flaws with H.R. 327 is that every veteran is preconditioned \nwith a mental status exam. So if you are a World War II vet and you \nhave a sore throat and you go to the VA clinic in Muskogee, under 327 \nyou have to undergo a thorough mental status exam before you can have \nyour sore throat treated. That is Congress hitting a gnat with a cinder \nblock. It is wasteful of our dollars. It portends to have Congress \npracticing medicine, when, in fact, we do not know how to practice \nmedicine, and you cannot.\n  What this bill sets up is that Congress is going to mandate the \ndoctor-patient relationship or the patient-PA or the patient-nurse \npractitioner or the patient-social service or licensed medical social \nservice masters. What we have decided is to interject, because of the \ntragedies that we have seen in the last couple of years, a mandated \nform of treating suicide, depression, and risk of harm.\n  I have reached out to Senator Harkin on this bill. I offered to make \nsome simple changes. We were rebuffed. Then what we saw in the press is \nthat I wanted to hold this only because of how somebody might not be \nable to have their second amendment rights guaranteed. That is hardly \nthe situation at all. What I really am holding this bill for is \nbecause, first of all, it is bad medicine. No. 2, it duplicates and \nmandates things we should not be doing. It takes away from the \nprofessions within the VA who know what they are doing. It steps on and \nit interrupts what the VA is already implementing to a good extent and \nto a great degree.\n  There is another very serious concern with this, which is that it \nmandates the tracking of veterans who have mental health issues. The \nvast majority of our veterans do not have mental health issues, but the \nassumption under this bill is they all have to be screened for it. That \nwould be like me, with every patient that I ever see in my practice, \nthe first thing I have to do is make sure, because they were in the \nmilitary, that they do not have some type of mental health disturbance \ncoming back. It is insulting to our military men and women who have \ngiven their lives, given their blood, given their time, given their \nhonor, and given their sacrifice to assume they cannot do that without \nhaving some disruption in their capability to function in this society. \nSo it is highly insulting to the vast majority of our veterans.\n  Now, the question is, How do we solve the problem of depression and \npost-traumatic stress disorder that leads to suicidal thought, \nideation, and behavior? That is what we ought to be doing. And what we \nare doing is creating a set of circumstances that may have an impact \nprobably not any greater than what the VA is doing now but will, in \nfact, take away great resources from other mental health issues as well \nas other health issues within the VA.\n  Let me give you some statistics, if I may. The VA is 3 years into a \nmental health strategic plan that has been markedly successful in \nimproving the quality of care and ensuring that high-risk factors such \nas suicidal ideation are considered when veterans are assessed or \nimpact or enter the VA system. The VA has suicide prevention \ncoordinators in every VA facility in this country. They have a hotline \n24/7. They have hired over 3,000 mental health staffers just since the \nend of 2005. So they have recognized what was the problem. They are \nresponding to it. They have two suicide prevention centers of \nexcellence that are geared up and working on the very specific issues \nassociated with our military and post-traumatic stress disorder from \ncombat.\n  Between 2002 and 2007, the VA spent 2\\1/2\\ times the percentage of \ntheir budget as we spend in all other health care on mental health. So \nthey are already addressing the issue.\n  The other thing that is disturbing is this tracking of what they will \ndo. They are not going to be tracking the data, they are going to be \ntracking individual veterans under this bill. That violates their own \ncivil liberties. If, in fact, you have encountered the VA and because \nyou were screened, not of your choice and not because you had signs or \nsymptoms, because of that, that becomes a part of your record. You \nautomatically are limited in lots of things that you cannot do in this \ncountry because you served your country. Now you have a mental health \nscreening, an indication on your VA chart that would forbid you from \nbecoming a police officer, an airline pilot, or an EMS, many other \nprofessions within this country. The idea that we are going to track \nindividual veterans and their mental health status rather than the \ndata--this bill specifically states that we are going to track the \nveterans, not the data--is wrong.\n\n  Finally, this bill sets out a peer counseling provision that has \nalready been proven in the literature to not be effective. Yet it is \nmandated in this bill. So what this bill is about is the Senate \npracticing medicine and mandating ways to do things that the VA itself \nhas already started. It is 3 years into a program of which they are \nusing experts in the field to guide them, and we are using emotion and \nresponse.\n  I am going to continue to hold this bill until we work on the issues \nto guarantee freedom of veterans in terms of tracking of their data and \nthem individually, in terms of securing the data\n\n[[Page S11095]]\n\nabout them--the VA has had two serious leaks on veterans health care \ndata in the last 7 years--and also working to make sure we use a mental \nstatus exam when it is indicated and not create a system that is an \naffront to all the people who have served the country.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/05/senate-section/article/S11095-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11095]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to join my colleagues \nin welcoming a colleague and a friend, Senator Tim Johnson, back to the \nSenate.\n  Senator Johnson's return today to this illustrious Chamber marks an \nincredible journey that took him from normal daily life, to near death, \nto a remarkable recovery.\n  For the last 8 months, people from all walks of life, both Democrats \nand Republicans, have approached me wanting to know how Senator Johnson \nwas doing, and nearly every single one of those individuals told me \nthey were praying for him.\n  Shortly after this happened, I was traveling in Iraq and Afghanistan \nand I ran into military personnel, members of the diplomatic corps, \nother civilians, all asking how Senator Johnson was doing, all offering \nup their prayers and support.\n  I happen to believe it was those prayers from across South Dakota, \nacross the United States, and from around the world that brought \nSenator Johnson back from his life-threatening condition.\n  Since being released from the hospital, Senator Johnson has learned \nhow to walk and talk again. His doctors have been amazed at his \nprogress. For some of us, it is no surprise. Having faced him in a \nclosely fought campaign, I know how tough this man is. After all, \nSenator Johnson has a strong Scandinavian background, something we both \nshare. Without question, today marks an important milestone in Senator \nJohnson's recovery.\n  Many of us will never know the struggles Senator Johnson and his \nfamily have been through. In fact, most of us take for granted our \nhealth, and we take for granted our time with family and friends, \nbirthdays and holidays.\n  For me, Senator Johnson's experience has made me pause and appreciate \nthe little things that make life so precious. Senator Johnson turned 60 \nin December, and the party, obviously, had to be delayed. Upon \nreturning to South Dakota last week, Senator Johnson and his family \ncelebrated both his 60th birthday and Christmas. I am guessing it was \nhis best birthday and Christmas ever.\n  While Senator Johnson and I come from different political \nbackgrounds, we have worked to put our differences aside as we \nrepresent the people of South Dakota. In fact, since I was elected to \nthe Senate in 2004, we have worked closely on a number of issues of \nimportance to South Dakota--everything from a highway bill, to an \nenergy bill, to drought relief, water projects, and, of course, saving \nEllsworth Air Force Base from closure under the BRAC process.\n  I firmly believe that because he and I worked to put our differences \naside, our offices were able to coordinate easily to serve the State of \nSouth Dakota during his hospitalization and recovery.\n  The Senate is a very close-knit body, and it is noticeable when a \nSenator is absent for any length of time. Today, however, that absence \nno longer exists. By the grace of God, through the prayers of thousands \nupon thousands of Americans, by the support of an amazing wife Barbara \nand family, and network of friends, and by his sheer will and \ndetermination, Senator Johnson is back.\n  Tim, I know today means a great deal to you and to your family, and \nit is good to see you back in the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now proceed to \nthe consideration of S. Res. 306, which was submitted earlier today.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report the \nresolution.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 306) concerning the return of Senator \n     Tim Johnson:\n\n       Whereas Tim Johnson is returning to the United States \n     Senate after an absence to recuperate from an intracranial \n     hemorrhage suffered on December 13, 2006: Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved, That, as Senator Tim Johnson returns to the \n     Senate, his fellow Members of the Senate extend their warmest \n     welcome and express their personal happiness at his return, \n     and offer their very best wishes for his continued good \n     health.\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nbe agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motion to reconsider \nbe laid upon the table.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 306) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  Mr. THUNE. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  (Applause, Senators rising.)\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from South Dakota is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, thank you. It sure does feel good to be \nback here again.\n  I wish to thank Senators Thune, Reid, and McConnell, as well as all \nmy colleagues, for their warm welcome back. In so many ways, the words \nand prayers from you and your spouses, on both sides of the aisle, \nsupported both Barbara and me and gave us strength. You will never know \nwhat that meant to us.\n  I also wish to thank Representative Herseth Sandlin for her \nincredible support throughout these tough times.\n  The MILCON appropriations bill is now on the floor, and I must also \nthank Senator Jack Reed for working with my staff and for his \nleadership on the bill.\n  Before I get too far along in my remarks, it must already be clear to \nyou that my speech is not 100 percent. My doctors tell me it will get \nthere.\n  But my thoughts are clear and my mind is sharp, and I am here to be a \nvoice for South Dakota in the Senate. With patience, persistence, and \nfaith I have come back, and my will to keep fighting for South Dakota \nis strong.\n  My ability to think is paramount, so I hope now, as I return to my \noffice, people focus on my work more than how quickly I walk these \ndays.\n  Last week, I went home to South Dakota. Today, I come home to the \nSenate.\n  This has been a long and humbling journey--a journey that has taken \nlonger than some people have liked, and I count myself among them.\n  But I return to work today to this great body with a renewed spirit \nand a sharper focus. I better appreciate today what individuals and \nfamilies go through when they face crippling hardship--whether that \nhardship be the consequence of catastrophic health issues, economic \nhardship, or lack of an opportunity to reach one's full potential in \nlife. I believe I have been given a second chance at life. I vow to \ntake that second chance and work harder than ever to be the best I can \nbe for my State and for my Nation; to be a voice for those individuals \nand families who so often are ignored or forgotten; and to fight to \nlive up to the ideals that have made this Nation great. That is my \nfocus and that is my commitment to my constituents back home in South \nDakota and to the people of this great Nation, and to my colleagues \nhere in Washington.\n\n  It has been the greatest honor of my life to stand for and by the \npeople of South Dakota. I cannot thank them, as well as the Members of \nthis Chamber, enough for your patience and support. Today, my work \nbegins anew. I relish the task. It is great to be home.\n\n[[Page S11096]]\n\n  Thank you and, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  (Applause, Senators rising.)\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, before my Republican colleagues leave the \nfloor, I want to repeat what I said this morning when the Senate \nopened--the only person here was Senator McConnell--and that is what \nthe Republicans have done during the illness of Senator Johnson has \nbeen exemplary. There have been occasions when, for partisan advantage, \nthe minority could have taken advantage of the majority as a result of \nTim being incapacitated. That was never done, even though there were \nopportunities to do that. As I said this morning, I personally \nappreciate that. I know the Johnson family does. More importantly, Mr. \nPresident, the American people do. This is the Senate, and I will \nalways remember during the past 8 months as we have waited for Tim to \nreturn how--I repeat--the Republicans never once tried to take \nadvantage of his illness. Thank you very much.\n  (Applause.)\n  Mr. President, Tim Johnson is a fourth generation South Dakotan. I \nwant to underline the fact that John Thune and Tim Johnson remind me of \nHarry Reid and John Ensign, because we too had a very difficult race \nfor the Senate, and it ended up very similar to the Thune-Johnson race. \nBut we have set those differences aside and now are friends. Above all, \nI say to my friend John Thune, I admire and appreciate what you have \ndone in helping Tim in his absence and for being the person who would \nnot allow anything to be done that would in any way harm Tim Johnson on \na partisan basis. Thank you very much, John.\n  I have learned a lot about Tim Johnson in the past 8 months. I know \nhe went to school at the University of South Dakota, that it is there \nhe met Barbara, his wife. It is in a town called Vermillion that he \nstarted his law practice, and it is there that he saw success in the \nlegal field. He served 4 years, starting in 1982, in the House of \nRepresentatives in the State of South Dakota. He has received many \nawards: Outstanding Citizen of the State of South Dakota, first \nrecipient of the Billy Sutton Award for legislative achievement. He was \nelected to the House in 1986. During that year he was responsible for \npassing more legislation than any of the other 50 first-term Members.\n  He has now been in the Senate doing outstanding work. I noticed on \nhis resume, of course, he listed the Appropriations Committee, the \nBudget Committee, the Banking Committee, the Energy Committee, the \nIndian Affairs Committee, but he left off the Ethics Committee. He was \nchosen on that committee to be the chair of that committee, because he \nis the example of an ethical, honest legislator and person.\n  Tim and Barbara still have their home in Vermilion, but I have gotten \nto know that family so well. Brooks served and is serving in the U.S. \nArmy, having been a combat veteran in Bosnia, Kosovo, Afghanistan, and \nIraq. He is now an Army recruiter. Brendan is a lawyer and has a law \npractice and is doing excellent work. Kelsey and I--during her father's \nillness--spent lots of time together, especially waiting for her \nbrothers to come. It took a couple of days for them to get here from \naround the country, as air travel out of South Dakota is not that easy.\n  As you proceed through life, you find people that you have such \nadmiration for. Of course, we all admire Tim. But there is a person in \nthis Chamber--and I know the Senate rules. We are not to refer to \npeople in this Chamber, but I hope people will forgive me today in \nrecognizing someone I will never forget, and that is his loving wife \nBarbara.\n  (Applause, Senators rising.)\n  I think Barbara and I will never forget--Tim was unconscious at the \ntime--the first night Tim got sick. The reason I mention this is there \nwas a doctor--and I don't want to in any way embarrass Tim or his \nfamily, but I think the man deserves recognition. I was asked to be \nwith Barbara, and I was happy to be there with the children coming that \nfirst terrible afternoon. Things weren't going well. Barbara recognized \nit at first that he wasn't doing well. The doctor came and said, We are \ngoing to have to relieve the pressure. I am going to have to go into \nhis skull. I said to this doctor, How many times have you done that? He \nsaid, Innumerable times. He was not an old man, but he was surrounded \nby old neurologists and neurosurgeons.\n  He came back a while later, an hour and a half, maybe, and he said, I \nam going to have to do an angiogram; I don't know what is going on in \nhis brain. So they put something in to look at his brain. I said, How \nmany times have you done that? He said over a thousand times. Then he \ncomes back about an hour and a half or 2 hours later and tells us they \nare going to have to operate on Tim. It is going to take a long time, \nprobably about 7 hours. After he worked all of this time, I said to \nhim, Who is going to do this, because he had to be getting tired by \nthen. He looked at Barbara with these piercing eyes, and said, I am \ngoing to do it. That is what I do. He said, I am not only a \nneurosurgeon, I have a subspecialty in the blood supply to the brain. \nHe walked out of that room, and we had so much confidence in his \nability that we felt Tim was going to make it. That man's name is Dr. \nVivek Deshmukh. I haven't had the opportunity--I wanted to make sure \nTim came back here--but some day I am going to be able to express to \nhim on a personal basis how he handled this man's illness. Tim wasn't \nthere, only in spirit, but this doctor deserves recognition, and I hope \nthat is what I do with my little speech here today.\n\n  Amidst the daily scuffles that take place here in the Senate, we have \nthe press, but many Americans may not realize we are a family. We \nsometimes joke about it, but we are, and this proves it. Sometimes \npeople say this Senate family is dysfunctional, and maybe sometimes it \nis. But despite our quarrels on policy and politics, the 100 men and \nwomen who serve in this Chamber have the deepest respect and admiration \nfor each other. We care about each other's health, families, and all \nthe things that go on outside the walls of this Capitol building. I \nhave dear friends, and we all do in this Chamber, but my admiration and \nrespect for Tim Johnson is difficult to calculate.\n  When he fell ill in December of last year, we were all touched by \nthis unfortunate incident. But as we look at what happened, we have \nheard this overused term: Maybe it was a blessing in disguise, because \nTim Johnson was taken immediately to George Washington Hospital where \nthey have a team of physicians as good as any place in the world to \ntake care of his injury--maybe not of other injuries, not other \nillnesses, but for this one it is as good as any place in the country. \nHad it happened the next day, he would have been on an airplane going \nto South Dakota. Had it happened the next day, he would have been on an \nIndian reservation in South Dakota. So maybe, maybe his misfortune was \na blessing. Maybe it was a blessing.\n  We all prayed for him. We all hoped for his recovery. We couldn't \nwatch his recovery because he was away from us most of the time. We all \nprayed for his recovery with hope for his strength. Tim's wonderful \nwife Barbara, whom I have already mentioned, said last month:\n\n       I have learned a lot about Tim Johnson during the last \n     months. I have learned that he is extremely determined. How \n     he has gotten through this and maintained an even balance I \n     will never understand. His sense of humor and just the: OK, I \n     know what I have to do, I am going to go ahead and do it, and \n     he does it.\n\n  So these past months, with humor and determination that Barbara \nmentioned, we all in the Senate now know what she is talking about.\n  Tim, I am so glad you are back. I am so happy that your mind is 100 \npercent. We have all been told your speech shortly will be 100 percent, \nand you should know it is 95 percent right now. We throw words around \nlike we are happy to have you back, but I have to say in front of the \nwhole world, Tim, we love you. I love you.\n  (Applause, Senators rising.)\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, on behalf of the entire U.S. Senate \nRepublican Conference, let me say as well, we welcome back to the \nSenate our good friend, the senior Senator from South Dakota. The \nentire Senate family was\n\n[[Page S11097]]\n\nthrown into a state of shock and worry when Tim Johnson was rushed to \nthe hospital for emergency brain surgery last December. The person who \nseemed most calm was the woman we just recognized up in the gallery: \nhis wife Barbara. She struck an early note of hope. She said she and \nthe rest of the Johnson family were ``encouraged and optimistic.'' \nThose aren't the words most of us would choose in a moment such as \nthat, but the Johnsons had been there before, and they seemed to know \nTim would be back, back here, before all was said and done; they would \nmake sure of it.\n  Tim credits Barbara with helping him overcome prostate cancer in \n2004, and it was his support that helped her through a couple of \nserious illnesses of her own. They always overcame the obstacles, \nworking as a team, determined to push through. They are real fighters. \nFor many, this seemed as if it would be the fight of their lives.\n  But just 2 months after surgery, Barbara and the Johnson children, \nBrooks, Brenda, and Kelsey, were telling people, ``We've got our Tim \nback.''\n  Tim was completely focused on recovery. He went through weeks and \nweeks of intense rehab. And soon enough, he started to get back to the \nclips and do the office work from his hospital bed.\n  When they released him from rehab, this gritty great-grandson of a \nSouth Dakota homesteader made a bold decision--actually a prediction--\nsaying he was absolutely ``determined to get back in the saddle.''\n  Thanks to the committed care of doctors and therapists, the prayers \nof constituents and colleagues, and, above all, the loving care of \nBarbara and their children, Tim's Senate colleagues can also say, with \na real sense of joy, that they too ``have their Tim back.''\n  I yield the floor.\n  (Applause.)\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Illinois is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I join in this chorus to say how \nprivileged and humbled I am to stand before this body and welcome back \nmy friend and fellow colleague, Senator Tim Johnson. Tim and I served \nin the House together. We came to the Senate in the same year. I went \nup to campaign in South Dakota, and he has been a great friend to \nIllinois. I have known him more than 20 years.\n  I remember when I heard he had been stricken. I was stunned, as \neverybody was across America. As has been said before, the prayers of \nmillions reached out to Tim and his family in their hour of need.\n  For those who don't know Tim Johnson, he is not a typical politician. \nHe doesn't really struggle for media attention, as some of us might; \nbut he got a lot more attention than he ever thought he would because \nthe whole world watched anxiously during those moments of surgery and \nrecovery and rehabilitation. There wasn't a place you would go anywhere \nin America that Tim Johnson wasn't asked about. ``How is he doing?'' \n``What is the latest?'' ``When is he coming back?''\n  Those of us who knew Tim and what he had done in the Senate and \nHouse, those of us who know his great family knew he would be back. He \nis one of those tough Scandinavians--not really flashy but solid. You \njust knew he was going to make it. I thought to myself, of all of us \nwho could have suffered this terrible illness, this is one man who will \nbe able to make it back. I also knew something that has already been \nalluded to. When Tim and Barbara took those vows to stand by one \nanother in sickness and in health, they really meant it because they \nhave proved it over and over again to one another. Loretta and I went \nby the hospital one day and it wasn't a good day to visit, so we left a \nnote. We have come to know how close they are and supportive of one \nanother.\n  It wasn't just Barbara's strength but the strength of the whole \nfamily that came through in Tim's recovery. He has done such a \nremarkable job today. He has brought out the humanity of the united \nstates Senate. We can put aside the issues and the bickering, the \nfighting and the party labels, and really show that, when it gets down \nto it, we are part of a family that really cares about one another on a \npersonal basis.\n  We are so glad to have you back, Tim. We wish you the best. We will \nbe back in the Appropriations Committee fighting for South Dakota and \nIllinois real soon. Thank you.\n  (Applause.)\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/05/senate-section/article/S11097-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11097-S11101]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  JOSHUA OMVIG SUICIDE PREVENTION ACT\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I come to the floor at this Time to \nrespond a little to the comments made prior to the recess for our \nRepublican and Democratic caucuses today, made on the floor by the \nSenator from Oklahoma, Mr. Coburn, regarding the bill called the Joshua \nOmvig Suicide Prevention Act. I want to lay out what the bill does, \nwhere we are on it, and respond to some of the objections that the \nSenator from Oklahoma raised.\n  Shortly before the Senate adjourned for the August recess, we sought \nunanimous consent to pass this bill, the Joshua Omvig Suicide \nPrevention Act, and send it to the President for his signature. \nUnfortunately, an objection was lodged on the other side of the aisle \nby--as we know from this morning--the Senator from Oklahoma. I am \nsaddened by the objection to this legislation.\n  My staff and I have spent a great deal of Time trying to understand \nthe reasons behind this objection and respond to the concerns that have \nbeen raised. I thought it would be helpful for my fellow Senators, and \nanyone who is watching, if I took some Time to review why I believe the \nSenate needs to act now to pass this important bill, and why I find it \nso puzzling that one Senator would object.\n  Let me give a little bit of history. I introduced this legislation, \nalong with my colleague from Iowa, Senator Grassley, after learning \nabout the case of a young Iowan--his name was Joshua Omvig--who \ntragically took his own life shortly after returning home from an 11-\nmonth deployment in Iraq. Joshua was a member of the U.S. Army Reserve, \n339th MP Company, based in Davenport, IA. Before leaving for Iraq, he \nwas a member of the Grundy Center Volunteer Fire Department and the \nGrundy Center Police Reserves. He was honored to serve his country in \nthe Reserves and hoped to return to his community to serve as a police \nofficer. Please remember what I just said. He was honored to serve his \ncountry in the Reserves, and he hoped to return to his community to \nserve as a police officer. Keep that in mind. I will return to it \nlater.\n  His family is convinced that if the Veterans' Administration had more \nservices for veterans in place, Joshua would have received the help he \nneeded and he would still be alive. But rather than withdrawing into \ntheir grief, Joshua's parents have dedicated themselves to ensuring no \nother family has to suffer this way. Ellen and Randy Omvig, Joshua's \nparents, have assisted countless veterans and their families in \nnavigating the VA system. They have been outspoken advocates of \nimproved mental health services for servicemembers and veterans. In \nApril, the Omvigs testified before the Senate Veterans Affairs \nCommittee on the importance of appropriate suicide prevention, early \ndetection, and treatment programs for our veterans. The goal of the \nJoshua Omvig Act is simple: to improve suicide prevention and early \ndetection and to improve assistance to veterans in crisis in order to \nprevent suicides among those who have so bravely served our country.\n  We know there is an urgent, overwhelming need for this bill. A study \nin last month's issue of the Journal of Epidemiology and Community \nHealth found that those who have been in combat are twice as likely to \ncommit suicide as those who have never served in a war.\n  The Veterans' Administration estimates that more than 5,000 veterans \ntake their lives each year. These numbers are certain to increase \ndramatically, given the growing number of soldiers returning from \ncombat in Iraq and Afghanistan. Suicide rates are 35\n\n[[Page S11098]]\n\npercent higher for Iraq veterans than for the general population. Let \nme repeat that statement. Suicide rates are 35 percent higher for Iraq \nwar veterans than for the general population. The Department of Defense \nrecently reported that the Army is seeing the highest rate of suicide \nin 28 years.\n  So what does the Joshua Omvig Veterans Suicide Prevention Act do? It \ndirects the Department of Veterans Affairs to create a comprehensive \nprogram to address the troubling rate of suicide among veterans \nreturning from combat. The legislation takes a multifaceted approach \ntoward the prevention of suicide. It emphasizes the importance of \nsocial support, family involvement, readjustment services, as well as \nfurther research to decrease the number of suicides among our veterans. \nIt also boosts training for all Department of Veterans Affairs staff, \ncontractors, and medical personnel who interact with veterans, teaching \nthem to identify risk factors\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is my understanding the Senator from Iowa \nis speaking on veteran suicide; is that right?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. I spoke briefly yesterday morning. A 19-year-old--as the \nSenator knows, my dad killed himself, so I understand something about \nsuicide--a 19-year-old soldier from Las Vegas came back to Las Vegas. \nHe told his parents and everybody else he didn't want to go back to \nIraq. I think they said they gave him medicine--Prozac, whatever it \nwas--and sent him back. In a matter of a few days, he killed himself.\n  Suicide is a devastating problem. It is a problem in the civilian \npopulation. Mr. President, 31,000 people kill themselves every year. We \ndon't understand the issue at all. We haven't studied it enough. What \nis going on in the civilian side is a mere shadow of what is going on \nin the military.\n  Mr. HARKIN. That is true.\n  Mr. REID. We have had hundreds of soldiers who have killed themselves \nin Iraq. A lot of them are not suicide reported.\n  I so admire and appreciate what the Senator from Iowa is doing with \nregard to this legislation. It is so very important. Suicide is a \nnational problem, and with the emotional and mental problems our troops \nare having coming back, we have to get to the bottom of this issue and \nsee what we can do to prevent further deaths.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank my leader for joining with me on \nthis issue. I respond to him, I just said--I don't know if the leader \nwas on the floor at the time--that suicide rates for Iraq veterans--\nIraq veterans--is 35 percent higher than the general population. The \nDepartment of Defense has said their suicide rate in the Regular Army \nis at the highest rate in 28 years.\n  I say to the distinguished Senator from Nevada, this bill I am \ntalking about was introduced in the House earlier this year. There were \n154 cosponsors on both sides of the aisle. This bill, the Joshua Omvig \nsuicide prevention bill, passed the House in March 423 to 0--423 to 0. \nWe can't get much better than that.\n  It came to the Senate. The Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee had \nthree hearings on it and the House had two hearings, for a total of \nfive hearings. Every veterans group, every veterans support group, \ndisabled veterans, everyone came to testify on the need for this \nlegislation.\n  We went through the committee process, had the hearings, and had all \nthe testimony. Joshua's parents testified. We brought it out on the \nfloor for a unanimous consent agreement before we left on the August \nbreak. It passed the House 423 to 0. Then I found there was an \nobjection raised.\n  I started to nose around to find out who raised the objection. It was \nSenator Coburn from Oklahoma. I talked with the Senator from Oklahoma. \nHe said, first of all, he was upset that there were not any hearings. \nHe told me that right out in the back of the lobby. I said: Senator, we \nhad hearings. We had three in the Senate, two in the House. Well, he \nhad to go check on it.\n  Then he raised other objections and came on the floor this morning to \nsay why he has objections. Now I am going to respond to those \nobjections in kind to let the Senator know his objections are \nunfathomable.\n\n  So here we are faced with a dire situation among our veterans, with \nthe highest suicide rates ever, and we are trying to pass legislation \nto direct the Department of Veterans Affairs to do certain things to \nset up processes and procedures so that our veterans will have the kind \nof counseling and the kind of medical intervention so they do not \ncommit suicide, and yet we have one objection raised.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I could direct another question to my \nfriend. We have so much to do in the Senate. Certain measures expire at \nthe end of the fiscal year. But I say to my friend, I feel very \nstrongly about this issue, for obvious reasons. Everyone should \nunderstand, if people want to stop us from moving forward on this \nlegislation, they are going to have to vote accordingly. We are not \ngoing to let one or two Senators stop us from moving forward on this \nbill.\n  I have the greatest respect for Dr. Coburn, the junior Senator from \nOklahoma. I hope the Senator's conversations with him will bear fruit \nand we can move forward tonight. But if they don't, we are going to \nfigure our way past this before we leave here this year, OK?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I appreciate it.\n  Mr. REID. Every day we wait is another person calling--as I remember \nit, and it has been a long time ago now, I say to my friend, a long \ntime ago. My dad was a lot younger than I am right now when he killed \nhimself. I can remember that phone call. I can remember that phone \ncall. I had a wonderful morning. I had been out to watch Muhammad Ali \nwork out. I spent many hours with Muhammad Ali. I got back to the \noffice and Joan Shea, the receptionist, said: Your mother is on the \nline. I said: Hi. She said: Your pop killed himself. What is this \nabout?\n  So anyway, 31,000 people get phone calls such as that every year on \nthe civilian side, and we have probably thousands of other people who \ncommit suicide who are not listed as suicides. And then we have the \nsituation the Senator from Iowa just indicated. The people who are \ncoming home are 35 percent higher, in a ratio of killing themselves, \nthan the people in the civilian population. That is scary.\n  The other problem, I say to my friend, is Active-Duty soldiers, \ntroops also have problems. Every day we don't do this bill is another \nday someone is going to kill themselves.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank the leader. I ask the leader, if \nwe can, if the objection is not withdrawn, I hope we can bring the bill \nup and move the bill legislatively on the floor.\n  Mr. REID. I have indicated to the Senator, we are going to do that. \nWe, of course, have to see what is ahead of us, but it is something \nabout which I feel strongly. The floor staff is watching Senator Harkin \nand me talk today. We will figure out a way to do it.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I appreciate the sensitivity of the \nSenator from Nevada, our distinguished majority leader, on this issue.\n  Basically, what the bill does, again as I said, is to boost training \nfor all Department of Veterans Affairs staff, contractors, and medical \npersonnel, teaching them to identify risk factors for suicide and refer \nveterans to the appropriate mental health counseling and mental health \ncenters.\n  As I said at the outset, this has been the most bipartisan piece of \nlegislation I can imagine. Senator Grassley and I introduced it in the \nSenate, appropriately since Joshua Omvig was from Iowa. We have 30 \ndifferent cosponsors from both sides of the aisle. It was introduced in \nthe other body by Congressman Leonard Boswell of Iowa, who is the \nCongressman from the district in which Joshua Omvig lived. In fact, it \nis that version of the bill we are trying to pass today.\n  I may have misspoke earlier. He secured 152 bipartisan cosponsors of \nthe bill. It passed the House in March by a vote of 423 to 0. No \nRepublican objected over there. No one; 423, not a single dissenting \nvote. That is why I was so surprised and, quite frankly, dismayed when \nan objection was raised on the other side of the aisle preventing \npassage of the bill before the August recess.\n  How many more veterans have committed suicide since that time who \nmight have been, through counseling,\n\n[[Page S11099]]\n\nthrough outreach, through some way given the appropriate support \nservices so they wouldn't have to commit suicide?\n  This morning, the Senator from Oklahoma, Mr. Coburn, offered several \nreasons for his objection. That is what I would like to respond to now.\n  He mentioned that the bill is duplicative of the VA's plans to \nprevent suicide and that veterans' receipt of benefits would be \ncontingent on the screening. He also raised concerns about the validity \nof the peer counseling provisions of the bill. Finally, he expressed \nconcern that if the VA asked veterans about their mental health, this \ninformation might be used to inhibit their ability to purchase \nhandguns. All of these concerns are unfounded, and I want to explain.\n  In 2004, the VA developed a series of suicide prevention initiatives \nas part of a comprehensive mental health strategic plan. All well and \ngood. Unfortunately, very few of the initiatives have been implemented. \nDuring the first 2 years following development of the plan, a \nGovernment Accountability Office report found that the VA did not even \nspend $100 million of the $300 million that was specifically allocated \nfor this initiative. One-third of the money specifically allocated was \nnot spent.\n  I think our veterans have paid a steep price, a tragic price for this \nfoot dragging. When the VA has announced plans to undertake suicide \nprevention initiatives, usually it is in response to some highly \npublicized incident. They usually announce the plans and then they do \nnot follow through.\n  For example, in February the VA finally announced it would put \nsuicide prevention crisis counselors in VA facilities. That was only \nafter the tragic, high-profile suicide of Jonathan Schulze, a marine \nwho received two Purple Hearts for his service in Iraq. When Schulze \ninformed his local VA facility that he was thinking about killing \nhimself, he was told he was 26th on the local VA's waiting list for VA \nmental health services. He went home and killed himself that night. In \nresponse to that, the VA said: We are going to put VA suicide \nprevention crisis counselors in all VA facilities.\n  Although they announced it, 7 months later they have still not fully \nimplemented this initiative. Yes, if there is a tragic case like that, \nthe VA will come out and say they are going to do things. Seven months \nlater they still have not implemented the initiative.\n  What would our bill do, the Omvig Act? The Omvig Act would require \nthe Veterans' Administration to designate a suicide prevention \ncounselor at each medical facility. No more foot dragging; it would \nrequire them to do that right now.\n  In late July, the VA announced the implementation of a 24-hour \nsuicide prevention hotline. That is also in the Joshua Omvig bill. That \nVA plan has been around since 2004. Three years later they say they are \nfinally going to put it into effect. I suppose that is some kind of \nprogress. But by writing this very sensible provision into law, we will \nensure that the VA does not backslide on this either. As part of its \n2004 strategic plan, the VA set a plan to train all front-line staff on \nsuicide prevention. In 2004, they said that. They still have failed to \nprovide this training. Maybe that is what the Senator from Oklahoma is \nsaying is duplicative. Yes, we say you have to have a 24-hour suicide \nhotline. The VA said they were going to do that in 2004. They said they \nwere finally going to implement it in July. It still isn't manned, and \nthe counselors they said they were going to have do that in February, 7 \nmonths later they haven't done that. We say you have to do it. Is that \nduplicative? No, it is putting into law and mandating that the VA has \nto do this.\n  The Omvig Act directs the Secretary to ensure that staff members have \nthe training necessary to identify risk factors for suicide and to make \nappropriate referrals for assistance. Is that too much to ask? Is that \ntoo burdensome for veterans who put their lives on the line in \nAfghanistan and Iraq and other places? It just says the staffs have to \nhave the training necessary to identify risk factors for suicide to \nmake appropriate referrals for assistance.\n  The VA said they were going to do that in 2004, but they never have. \nBecause they have not done this, many Armed Forces personnel who have \nbeen discharged and have VA benefits are not receiving these services. \nThe Omvig family and numerous veterans support groups testified during \nour hearings about the importance of outreach to reduce the stigma \nassociated with mental health issues and to assist veterans and their \nfamilies in transitioning to civilian life. This legislation, the Omvig \nbill, would establish a program to provide education and outreach to \nfamilies to help them identify symptoms of mental health problems and \nto encourage families to seek assistance.\n  The VA inspector general issued a report this May, confirming that \nthe VA is falling short of the necessary system-wide implementation of \nsuicide prevention programs--their own inspector general. They found \nthat many VA clinics lacked properly trained staff. Need I repeat \nmyself? They did not provide 24-hour services and provided inadequate \nmental health screening. That is their own inspector general.\n  The inspector general also found that the VA had not established best \npractices research to ensure a standard of suicide prevention.\n  The Omvig bill addresses all these issues. The aim of the bill is to \nimprove early detection and intervention, provide access to services \nfor veterans in crisis and thereby prevent suicide among those who have \nput their lives on the line to defend our Nation.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma objected. He expressed concern that the \nreceipt of benefits would be contingent on the screening, and that \nthere is no opt-out provision. Let's look at this. The fact is, the \nDepartment of Defense already requires soldiers returning from \ndeployment to complete a checklist of symptoms such as anxiety, \ndifficulty sleeping, suicidal thoughts. There are no opt-outs for this \nmental health screening because these programs are critical to ensure \nthat those with mental health concerns receive the assistance they \nneed.\n  The DOD, the Department of Defense, says if you are going to be \nredeployed, you have to have mental health screening--no opt-out. We \nare saying the screening provision in the Omvig bill does not mandate a \nformal checklist of mental health symptoms. It just ensures that \nmedical professionals incorporate questions about veterans' mental \nhealth into primary care visits. In other words, what we are trying to \nsay is mental health care should be integrated into primary health \ncare. That is all we are saying.\n  Just as a medical professional would ask questions about risk factors \nfor heart disease, it is responsible medicine to ask about risk factors \nfor suicide, especially among this group since the data show how high \nit is, how high the incidence is of suicide.\n  Doctors ask their patients all the time if they are getting enough \nexercise and eating healthy. They should also ask if a veteran is \nsleeping well and if they have been anxious. These questions are \ncritical in order for doctors to get a full picture of the veteran's \nhealth and well-being.\n  I want to make it very clear, the bill does not make the receipt of \nbenefits contingent on veterans undergoing a separate mental health \nscreening. Rather, it merely seeks to incorporate into their screening \nprocess, into their primary health care process, this process, that the \nhealth professionals are incorporating appropriate questions about \nsuicide risk into their practice. Not to do this is totally \nirresponsible.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma also mentioned his concern that the peer \ncounseling provisions in the bill are not effective. Again, I am \nsurprised by this as there is a large body of research that peer \nsupport programs are effective in alleviating post-traumatic stress \nsymptoms, PTSD symptoms and depression, reducing the likelihood of \nhospitalization and increasing social support. President Bush's New \nFreedom Commission on Mental Health recognizes peer support approaches \nas an emerging best practice in helping people to recover from \ntraumatic events.\n\n  Who better to counsel with a soldier who has served in Iraq and had a \nlot of trauma, or from Afghanistan who had a lot of trauma, than a \npeer, one of their own peers to talk to them about it, or their \nfamilies? Peer support approaches offer a low-cost and effective \nsupplement to traditional services in which\n\n[[Page S11100]]\n\ntransitioning veterans can talk to someone who had similar experiences \nand understands what they are going through. This is well-recognized, \nevidence-based service that allows veterans to talk to someone who had \nsimilar experiences and, as I said, understands what they are going \nthrough. How can there be an objection to that?\n  Finally, regarding the concern of the Senator about veterans' ability \nto access firearms, I am very puzzled. This bill ensures that the VA \ntakes appropriate measures to follow up with veterans who are at risk \nfor suicide. OK. There are strict privacy laws that govern the doctor-\npatient relationship. Privacy laws prevent the release of information \nabout any patient. There is an exception if the patient is a serious \nthreat to himself or others, but no medical professional can refer an \nindividual to the background check system that would limit access to \nfirearms.\n  Let me repeat that: No medical professional can refer an individual \nto the background check system that would limit access to firearms. \nThis can only be done through the judicial process. In other words, \nbefore an individual can be placed on the NICS list where they can't \npurchase a handgun--and this prevents an individual who is mentally ill \nfrom purchasing a firearm--a judge must make a determination that the \nindividual belongs on that list.\n  As many of my colleagues are aware, there is legislation that has \npassed the House and was recently approved by the Judiciary Committee \nthat would encourage States to do a better job reporting to the NICS \nsystem in the wake of the tragic shootings at Virginia Tech. If \nSenators have concerns about how the NICS system operates, it seems to \nme that legislation is the appropriate venue for those concerns. But to \nhold up the Omvig suicide prevention bill that delivers critical \nsuicide prevention services to veterans based on concerns related to an \nunrelated pending bill is very troubling.\n  There is an editorial that appeared in the New York Times on August \n30. Let me read from that. Here is what the editorial in the New York \nTimes said on August 30:\n\n       As the Army's suicide rate hits record levels in the Iraq \n     war, there's small wonder practically everyone in Congress \n     wants to deal with the parallel emerging crisis of depressed \n     veterans tempted to take their own lives. Everyone, that is, \n     except Senator Tom Coburn, Republican of Oklahoma. He stands \n     alone in blocking final passage of a suicide prevention bill \n     in fear that the government's record-keeping on troubled vets \n     might somehow crimp their ability to purchase handguns.\n       Even the craven gun lobby should manage some shame at this \n     example of Second Amendment idolatry. The House has \n     unanimously approved a measure mandating the screening of all \n     veterans for suicide risk, but Senator Coburn worries that \n     veterans' medical data might be appropriated by other \n     agencies to deny that all-encompassing right to wield arms on \n     the domestic front.\n\n  Again, the editorial goes on.\n\n       The Senator's office points to another bill near passage--\n     prompted by the Virginia Tech gun massacre--that would \n     encourage states to do a better job of listing mentally \n     troubled individuals on the Federal roll of risky gun \n     purchasers. But tying these two measures together is itself \n     evidence of defective reasoning, or at least scurrilous \n     politicking. The Virginia Tech measure has nothing to do with \n     veterans and affects only those Americans formally judged by \n     a court to be mentally disturbed.\n       It is an eminently good thing that the anti-suicide \n     measures would require medical specialists to keep track of \n     veterans found to be high risks for suicide. But that's to \n     care for them as human beings, under that other \n     constitutional right to life--liberty and the pursuit of \n     happiness. Respect for the grave sacrifices by veterans \n     requires the Senate to strike down the Coburn ploy and hurry \n     this vital measure to President Bush.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full editorial be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Aug. 30, 2007]\n\n                       Locked, Loaded and Looney\n\n       As the Army's suicide rate hits record levels in the Iraq \n     war, there's small wonder practically everyone in Congress \n     wants to deal with the parallel emerging crisis of depressed \n     veterans tempted to take their own lives. Everyone that is, \n     except Senator Tom Coburn, Republican of Oklahoma. He stands \n     alone in blocking final passage of a suicide prevention bill \n     in fear that the government's record-keeping on troubled vets \n     might somehow crimp their ability to purchase handguns. Even \n     the craven gun lobby should manage some shame over this \n     absurd example of Second Amendment idolatry.\n       The House has unanimously approved a measure mandating the \n     screening of all veterans for suicide risk, but Senator \n     Coburn worries that veterans' medical data might be \n     appropriated by other agencies to deny that all-encompassing \n     right to wield arms on the domestic front. The senator's \n     office points to another bill near passage--prompted by the \n     Virginia Tech gun massacre--that would encourage states to do \n     a better job of listing mentally troubled individuals on the \n     federal roll of risky gun purchasers. But tying these two \n     measures together is itself evidence of defective reasoning \n     or at least scurrilous politicking. The Virginia Tech measure \n     has nothing to do with veterans and affects only those \n     Americans formally judged by a court to be mentally \n     disturbed. It is an eminently good thing that the anti-\n     suicide measure would require medical specialists to keep \n     track of veterans found to be high risks for suicide. But \n     that's to care for them as human beings, under that other \n     constitutional right--to life liberty and the pursuit of \n     happiness. Respect for the grave sacrifices by veterans \n     requires the Senate to strike down the Coburn ploy and hurry \n     this vital measure to President Bush.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Lastly, Mr. Coburn spoke on the floor and mentioned his \nstaff had made suggestions about the language. Again, I am very \nsurprised to hear this. Staff from my office and Senator Grassley's \noffice met with Senator Coburn's staff before the recess in an attempt \nto resolve any differences.\n  Their staff made no suggestion as to what it would take to lift \nSenator Coburn's hold. Over recess, I instructed my staff to make \nattempts to meet with his staff, but his staff was always unavailable. \nOver the last few days, we once again attempted to reach out to his \nstaff in an effort to move the bill. But, again, we have not heard \nanything back.\n  We suggested we would be willing to work with Senator Coburn on the \ntracking language he was concerned about. But we have not heard \nanything from his office until the Senator spoke on the floor this \nmorning.\n  This bill has received full consideration, as I said, in the House \nand the Senate. It passed without a single dissenting voice in the \nHouse. Is the Senator from Oklahoma saying there are 423 totally \nirresponsible people in the House? I mean, there are people in the \nHouse every bit as conservative as the Senator from Oklahoma. They did \nnot raise any objections to this. We had three hearings in the Senate \non the bill, two hearings in the House.\n  Josh Omvig's parents testified before the Senate VA Committee in \nApril. I wish to recount something they said. At the beginning of my \nremarks, I mentioned that Joshua Omvig, before he went into the \nmilitary, had been a member of the Grundy Center Volunteer Fire \nDepartment and Police Reserve.\n  He had hoped to return to serve his community as a police officer. I \nsaid: Remember that, because I am going to return to it. I now return \nto it.\n  It was his dream to one day become a police officer. As he pursued \nthat dream, he worked alongside many Grundy Center fire and policemen. \nHere is what Mr. Omvig said to the committee:\n\n       The day after Josh's suicide, the Grundy Center police \n     department and fire department had a time where a \n     professional counselor was brought in to help them cope and \n     deal with what happened that day. Do we as a nation take the \n     same measures for our troops who have served for us for \n     months in a combat area? Are we providing our military men \n     and women the appropriate services to help them assimilate to \n     civilian life? Are we providing them with what they need to \n     survive the peace? Ellen and I have to say ``No'' not at this \n     time. We can and must do more!\n\n  Now, I saw Joshua's parents at the time when they were here in \nWashington. And, you know, it is always awkward to talk to parents \nabout the death of any of their children, especially a young person \ntaking his own life. I said to both the parents: Was there any \nindication? I mean, do you have any idea why Joshua would take his own \nlife?\n  Mr. Omvig said: Yeah, I know exactly why. I said: Why? He said: Well, \nJoshua always wanted to be a police officer, all his life growing up. \nThat is why he volunteered on the police reserves, volunteer fire. He \nwent into the service thinking that would help him to become a police \nofficer. He was worried that if he sought mental health services, he \nwould never be able to become a police officer. What a shame. What a \nshame that in this country we still treat mental health like that. That \nis why we have to do a better job.\n\n[[Page S11101]]\n\n  That is why counseling, someone talking to Joshua, one of his peers \nwho has been through the same thing who may have then gone on to become \na police officer could say: You can get mental health help. You can get \nthe necessary treatment, and you can still become a police officer.\n  Well, while we delay and fail to act, we are losing more and more \nveterans to suicide. As I said, the VA plan was written 3 years ago, \nand they are still not implementing it.\n  The PTSD program treatment at Walter Reed accepts only 65 patients \neach year. Yet more than 45,000 veterans sought medical help for post-\ntraumatic stress disorder in the first 3 months of 2007; Walter Reed \naccepts 65 a year.\n  The VA must be better equipped to deal with veterans who are in \ncrisis. With this bill, we can ensure that the VA will provide \ncomprehensive and critical services, even when the issue is not in the \nheadlines because of some tragedy. We need to hold the VA accountable.\n  As I said, even their own inspector general said they were not living \nup to it, our GAO said they were not. We need to make it clear that \npreventing suicide among our veterans is a congressional and national \npriority. For our veterans who have served their country, fought for \nour country, many times they are being left to fight their own private \nmental health life wars alone, private wars they too often lose.\n  I urge the objecting Senator to reexamine this important bill, \nreconsider his objection. Lives are at stake. We need to move forward \nwith the Joshua Omvig Veterans Suicide Prevention Act as quickly as \npossible.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/05/senate-section/article/S11101-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11101-S11112]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n MILITARY CONSTRUCTION AND VETERANS AFFAIRS APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008--\n                               Continued\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, what is the matter now before the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. H.R. 2642, the Military Construction \nAppropriations Act.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, Senator Reed is in the Chamber or at least \nin the building. He and Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison have been wanting \nto move this bill.\n  I indicated, and the distinguished Republican leader agreed with me \nthis morning, we need to move this legislation.\n  If there are no amendments that are going to be offered, we should \nmove to third reading. If there are amendments that are going to be \noffered, I would hope someone would notify the cloakroom immediately, \nDemocratic or Republican cloakroom, and we will certainly be as \nconsiderate to them as necessary.\n  But unless something happens pretty soon, I think we should move to \nthird reading. If there are amendments, the two managers of the bill \nare happy to deal with those amendments. We are going to finish this \nbill tonight. I would hope on this bill I do not have to file cloture, \non Military Construction and Veterans. I do not think that would be \nappropriate.\n  But if there are no amendments and simply people let us return to \nfinal passage of this, I have no alternative. It would send a terribly \nbad message. Both the distinguished Republican leader and I think we \nshould move forward. I hope we can. We are going to finish the bill \ntonight or I will file cloture on it tonight.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. (Mrs. McCaskill). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Madam President, I rise today to speak in support of \nH.R. 2642, an act making appropriations for military construction, the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs, and related agencies for the fiscal \nyear ending September 30, 2008.\n  Let me say at the outset, the leadership of this committee has done a \ntremendous job in bringing forward legislation that hopefully will \nreceive the strong bipartisan support of this body. I am especially \nthankful for the great work of Senator Jack Reed and Senator Kay Bailey \nHutchison and Senator Tim Johnson and his staff for having moved \nforward in developing a package that, at the end of the day here, will \nhopefully receive the support of most of the Members of this Chamber.\n  This legislation is important for us as we move forward to try to \nmake sure we are doing everything we can for a strong America. This is \nimportant for us, for our military, for our men and women in uniform, \nand for our veterans. It is essential legislation which we must pass \nand which we all hope the President will sign into law.\n  With respect to military construction, the bill provides $8.9 \nbillion-plus for our Active-Duty construction efforts and $929 million \nfor the National Guard and Reserve construction. This includes key \nprojects around the country for the Army National Guard. This is a \nsignificant improvement over what the President requested for the \nNational Guard. It will be part of making sure we have a strong \nmilitary for America.\n  Second, the legislation fully funds the 2005 recommendations of the \nBRAC, the Base Realignment and Closure Account. That BRAC \nrecommendation which was approved by this Senate and by the Congress \nnow 2 years ago is an important document that charts the way forward \nfor the American military. This legislation will fully fund the \nrecommendations of that legislation.\n  Third, with respect to Veterans Affairs, I am proud that this \nlegislation will provide $87.5 billion for the VA. That is an increase \nof almost $3.6 billion over what the President requested. That increase \nwill go to veterans health care and make sure our PTSD and mental \nhealth issues and TBI issues that we are seeing in great numbers as we \nare involved in the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan--that we are \nproviding the right kind of care to our veterans.\n  I am appreciative of the national issues that are embraced in this \nlegislation that will allow the funding to move forward and to make \nthose projects a reality.\n  I wish to comment on a few provisions in this legislation that are \nimportant to my State of Colorado. I must say, as we worked on these \nmatters over the years, it has been my honor to work closely with \nSenator Allard as we worked on important projects for our veterans and \nfor our military in my State.\n  I wish to mention the Fitzsimons VA Hospital. There is $61 million in \nthis legislation for Fitzsimons. Today in Colorado, the VA hospital in \nDenver is in very rough, shoddy condition. Our veterans deserve better. \nOver the last decade, there has been an effort in Colorado to try to \nestablish a VA hospital that can become one of the crown jewels of our \nnational health care. We are fortunate today that, under the leadership \nof MAJ Andy Lobb and others, we have found a site at what is the old \nFitzsimons Army hospital which has been turned over to the city of \nAurora and to an authority that is rehabilitating that site. At that \nsite today, we have already located the health facilities and hospitals \nfor the University of Colorado. We are about ready to open a brand-new \nchildren's hospital at this center. The VA hospital is the next move in \nthe creation of what is going to be a crown jewel for health care and \nfor biotech in the Rocky Mountain West. The Fitzsimons VA Hospital is \nvery much a part of that program, but at its core it is making sure we \nin America are standing up and giving to the veterans of our country \nthe health care services they deserve.\n  Next, Fort Carson. Fort Carson is a very important military \ninstallation in my State and helps us protect our Nation. Many of the \nmen and women who serve and have trained at Fort Carson are now serving \nin Iraq and in Afghanistan. There is $470 million in military \nconstruction funds for Fort Carson. That amount of money will \naccommodate the arrival of an additional 12,000 Active-Duty and 18,360 \nActive-Duty family members who are currently moving to Fort Carson. I \nam very proud of the inclusion of that amount of money in this \nlegislation because it will allow us to warmly welcome the soldiers who \nare coming to Fort Carson, as well as their families, with the kinds of \nfacilities they deserve.\n\n[[Page S11102]]\n\n  Schriever Air Force Base is part of our national defense. As I say, \nColorado is blessed to be the crown jewel of the Nation's homeland \ndefense and national security. We do that through many of our military \ninstallations, including Schriever Air Force Base. It is part of the \nair and space integration program. It is the place where we have our \nAir Force Space Command. It will receive $24.5 million for construction \nof the facilities that are needed there.\n  The U.S. Air Force Academy, located since the 1950s in El Paso County \nin Colorado Springs, is one of our Nation's premier institutes in \ntraining the future military leaders of our country. It is an \ninstallation of which I am very proud. This legislation includes $15 \nmillion for upgrades to the academic facilities at the U.S. Air Force \nAcademy.\n  The National Guard and Reserves station at Buckley Air Force Base in \nAurora, CO, is an important part of the Army installations in our \nState. This legislation will add $7.3 million to replace the outdated \nsquadron operations facility that houses the F-16s of the 140th Air \nWing of the Colorado National Guard.\n  This is important legislation, and I am proud to be a supporter of \nthis legislation.\n  We also will be speaking at a later time this afternoon or this \nevening on several other amendments I want to bring forth which are \nimportant amendments to the future of the State of Colorado but also \nvery important to the future of our Nation's military and assuring that \nour military has the appropriate training facilities. We will be \nspeaking to an amendment I will be calling up in short order.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Menendez). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2686\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I have an amendment I would like of offer, \nbut since I do not see a manager here, I will explain the amendment \nfirst and then ask that the amendment be brought up as soon as I finish \nmy comments.\n  The amendment I will offer will strike an earmark from this bill that \ntakes $4 billion intended for America's veterans and transfers it to \nthe well-to-do citizens of Beverly Hills, CA. It is remarkable that we \nare even considering a veterans bill that contains an earmark for a \nfacility on Wilshire Boulevard--the main street through Beverly Hills--\na site barely 3 miles from the ritzy shops of Rodeo Drive.\n  This earmark prevents the Veterans' Administration from taking highly \nvaluable land in one of America's most lucrative real estate markets \nand putting it to work for our veterans. It would require that 200-plus \nacres in the middle of Beverly Hills that could be better used to \ngenerate revenue to care for America's veterans to sit empty.\n  The earmark completely undermines the results of over 3 years of \nstudy performed by nonpartisan, independent experts. It also undermines \nthe authority of the Veterans' Administration to best help veterans \naround the country, not just those in the Beverly Hills area. The \nlanguage on page 44 of the Senate substitute prohibits the Veterans' \nAdministration from taking any action to:\n\n       exchange, trade, auction, transfer, or otherwise dispose \n     of, or reduce the acreage of, Federal land and improvements \n     at the Department of Veterans Affairs West Los Angeles \n     Medical Center, California, encompassing approximately 388 \n     acres on the north and south sides of Wilshire Boulevard and \n     west of the 405 Freeway.\n\n  The Veterans' Administration estimates that reuse of this land would \nresult in approximately $4 billion in savings--that is $450 per square \nfoot for 205 acres--that would go directly to the Veterans' \nAdministration for future construction since the receipts are deposited \ninto Veterans' Administration accounts under its enhanced-use lease \nauthority. We should note that the Veterans' Administration's enhanced-\nuse lease authority specifically allows the Veterans' Administration to \nlease land and retain receipts from the lease.\n  In addition, the Veterans' Administration can place an option to buy \nin the lease, whereby the property can be sold shortly after \ncommencement of the lease, allowing the Veterans' Administration to \nretain the sale proceeds. This process was used in 2005 to sell \nproperty in downtown Chicago and the Veterans' Administration realized \n$50 million in proceeds. All can be used to better the health care of \nveterans.\n  As important, this prohibition that is written into this earmark \nwould result in voiding the Capital Assessment Realignment for Enhanced \nServices process, known as CARES, which has been agreed to by Congress \nand the administration. Much like BRAC, one exception could undermine \nthe entire process that was based on veterans' needs and not on \nearmarked interests.\n  CARES is a systemwide process to put the Veterans' Administration's \ninfrastructure to the best use for the current and future health care \nneeds of veterans. This process was completed in May of 2004, and \napproved on a bipartisan basis by Congress and the administration. All \nmedical construction budget requests since the completion of the study \nhave complied with CARES recommendations and passed by Congress; that \nis, until today, if this bill passes.\n  The study identified 18 sites which called for downsizing or disposal \nbut which were naturally very controversial. Consequently, it was \ndecided each of these sites needed ``further study and analysis.'' Some \nof these studies have been completed, and realignment has begun, but \nthe West Los Angeles study is still in process.\n  The White House recently weighed in against this earmark, saying in \nits Statement of Administration Policy:\n\n       The Administration strongly opposes the earmark provision \n     that prohibits the disposal or transfer of property at the \n     388-acre West Los Angeles Medical Center. This language \n     circumvents the recommendations in VA's nationwide \n     infrastructure study, the Capital Asset Realignment for \n     Enhanced Services (CARES). The original decision on this \n     property would have allowed VA to designate a portion of the \n     campus for disposal or leasing . . . it is likely that the \n     restrictive Senate language would eliminate more than $4 \n     billion of revenue, which would be used to improve facilities \n     around the country for our Nation's veterans.\n\n  The central concerns of those opposed to the reuse of portions of the \n388-acre facility seems to be that it will result in large commercial \ndevelopment. However, in the statement of work for the West L.A. \nproject, the Veterans' Administration has included the following:\n\n       Because of a commitment made by a previous Secretary of \n     Veterans Affairs, certain reuses of the property for \n     commercial purposes were not considered in this study. In \n     this context, the term ``commercial'' [includes] . . . uses \n     such as shopping malls, movie theaters, convenience stores, \n     fast food outlets, industrial/manufacturing activities, and \n     other like operations. . . .\n\n  So the Veterans' Administration is listening to the community and is \nconsidering their concerns.\n  In August of 2005, the Veterans' Administration issued an interim \nreport, describing several options available for reuse of the land, but \na final decision is still pending, and there is not yet a timetable as \nto when a decision will be made.\n  Two public hearings--in May and September of 2005--have taken place, \nand one is taking place tomorrow night at the VA Center in West L.A. We \nshould let the process we put in place run its course and not overrule \nthe recommendations of independent experts and the Department of \nVeterans Affairs who are looking out for the needs of America's \nveterans.\n  If every Member of this body were to begin blocking modernization of \nthe VA system every time a well-connected constituent in their State \ncomplains, America's veterans would be saddled with outdated \ninfrastructure and their health care needs would not be met.\n  I wish to put this earmark in perspective because it would be the \nmost wasteful and questionable earmark we have seen since the infamous \n``bridge to nowhere.'' The ``bridge to nowhere'' was extremely \ntroubling, but at its heart was only an egregious waste of taxpayer \ndollars. This earmark, sadly, is much worse. It takes money--$4 billion \nof money--which would be used to care for the brave men and women who \nfought for our country and turns it over to build a park for Beverly \nHills.\n\n[[Page S11103]]\n\nWe should all be able to agree that a community with an average \nhousehold income of $125,000 a year has a sufficient tax base to build \na park and does not need a $4 billion handout from the Federal \nGovernment. The men and women who wore America's uniform need the money \na lot more than the men and women who live in this part of L.A.\n  In fact, the Los Angeles Times editorialized on this situation \nrecently, citing ``the compelling demands for park space'' in Beverly \nHills as the best use of $4 billion. I disagree with the L.A. Times, as \nI often do, that $4 billion that belongs to veterans should stay with \nthe Veterans' Administration.\n  Let me repeat, according to the judgment of the L.A. Times, the best \nuse of $4 billion is a public park between Beverly Hills and Sunset \nBeach. This defies common sense, and we should all disagree with it.\n  My amendment is very simple. It would strike this language from the \nbill and preserve the VA's ability to make changes at this property \nthat could generate over $4 billion for our Nation's veterans, as well \nas create a better facility that better serves the health care needs of \nour veterans. It would also preserve the integrity of the VA's process \nfor realigning its infrastructure to meet the current and future health \ncare needs of veterans and ensure that decisions are made according to \nthe needs of our veterans, instead of the local desires of America's \nmost rich and famous citizens.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support my amendment.\n  Mr. President, I would like to move that we set aside the pending \namendment and that my amendment be sent to the desk and called up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Webb). No amendment is pending.\n  Mr. DeMint. Then, Mr. President, I send my amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Carolina [Mr. DeMint] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2686.\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To strike section 225, relating to a prohibition on the \n disposal of Department of Veterans Affairs lands and improvements at \n              West Los Angeles Medical Center, California)\n\n       Beginning on page 44, strike line 20 and all that follows \n     through page 45, line 23.\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Cantwell). The Senator from California is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I come to the floor to oppose the \namendment just presented by Senator DeMint. I worked very hard to get a \nprovision in the military construction bill regarding this major piece \nof veterans property in the center of Los Angeles. I want to begin by \nthanking Senator Reed and Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison for agreeing to \nput this legislation in the Military Construction bill. This is 388 \nacres--388 acres--in the middle of Los Angeles. It is bisected by \nWilshire Boulevard. It is near Santa Monica Boulevard. It is a large \npiece of property, and on that property is a 1,000-bed veterans \nhospital.\n  The property was deeded in 1888 following the Civil War by two \nfamilies to the Federal Government to be used specifically and \npermanently as an Old Soldiers' Home for the use of veterans. As many \nMembers know, California has the largest number of veterans in \nAmerica--over 2 million--and over 300,000 veterans are enrolled to use \nthe facilities in this State of which this facility is prime. At the \ntime, as the population of disabled and elderly veterans grew following \nthe end of the Civil War, the Government decided to respond by \nestablishing a number of national homes throughout the United States.\n  In March of 1888, Senator John P. Jones and Arcadia B. de Baker \ndonated their Santa Monica ranch lands in southern California to \nestablish the Pacific branch of the National Homes for Disabled \nVolunteer Soldiers.\n  The deed reads very specifically:\n\n       That whereas by an act of Congress approved March 2, 1887 \n     to provide for the location and erection of a branch home for \n     the disabled volunteer soldiers west of the Rocky Mountains, \n     the Board of Managers of the National Home for Disabled \n     Volunteer Soldiers were authorized, empowered, and directed \n     to locate, establish, construct, and permanently maintain a \n     branch of said National Home for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers.\n\n  The sole purpose outlined in the original deed was affirmed in 2002 \nby then Veterans Affairs Secretary Anthony Principi when he visited the \nsite and again when he issued a May 2004 decision regarding plans for \nthe modernization of VA facilities elsewhere.\n  What has happened is the administration sees this land dedicated to \nveterans and says: Aha, there is a higher and better use for this land. \nWe can make $4 billion if we lease out the unbuilt-upon parts of this \nland. That is what they have done under the radar screen. They have \nleased out to an automobile rental agency. They have leased out to a \nFox movie lot. This is veterans land. This is land that was deeded to \nveterans to be used by veterans, not to be used by Fox movies, not to \nbe used by automobile rentals. The administration admits if they do \nthis, they can raise $4 billion in commercial rentals from this land, \nthereby taking this hospital, now in its park-like setting, and \nencrusting it with high rise buildings along Wilshire Boulevard.\n  Well, let me tell my colleagues what has happened. The veterans \ncommunity has risen up in Los Angeles and said: We are the largest \nveterans community anywhere in the Nation. You are taking land deeded \nto us. You are going to lease it, rent it in any way you can for this \nhigher and best use, which is high-rise construction, and they don't \nlike it. The neighbors don't like it. The city doesn't like it. The \nBoard of Supervisors doesn't like it. Yesterday, the L.A. Times \neditorialized against it.\n  So this amendment is not an amendment just concocted out of my brain. \nThis is an amendment that has been worked on for a long time, with \nMembers of the House who represent this area and with the Military \nConstruction Subcommittee of Appropriations. We want to preserve the \nintegrity of the land that was originally granted for use as an Old \nSoldiers' Home for veterans purposes in this new modern-day era and do \nit in a way where we have access to the largest number of veterans \nanywhere in the United States.\n  I find it shocking that the Department of Veterans Affairs went ahead \nand leased parts of this land. The VA continues to this day film \nproduction on the property. It recently allowed Fox Studios to \nconstruct a set storage building there.\n  In 1996, a 65,000-seat NFL football stadium was proposed for the open \nspace on the west L.A. VA until Congress stepped in and passed a \nresolution to prohibit the action. Once again, I have asked Congress to \nstep in and prohibit the commercialization of this site. It should be \nused for veterans purposes.\n  So when I was in Los Angeles in August, I met with former Mayor Dick \nRiordan and Eli Broad to discuss various options. No decisions were \nmade, but they have a vision for this. The important thing is that it \nnot be commercialized; that for the financial problems of the \nadministration, they shouldn't commercialize this land. They shouldn't \nsell it to the highest bidder. They shouldn't go for the highest and \nbest use. They shouldn't build high-rise construction. I will tell my \ncolleagues, if it happens, there will be an uprising from the neighbors \nin the area because this land is right off of the 405 freeway, and \ncongestion and difficulties will result. I find it rather a crass \ngesture to take veterans land that is dedicated to veterans, that has a \nlarge hospital, 1,000 beds in it, that serves tens of thousands of \nenrolled veterans--no other city serves so many veterans--and go ahead \nand commercialize this site.\n  So what this does is stops that commercialization of the site. The \nCalifornia delegation is united, whether it is in the Senate or whether \nit is in the House. I can give my colleagues two\n\n[[Page S11104]]\n\npages--and I will give my colleagues some of them--of people supporting \nthis legislation: the County of Los Angeles; the City of Los Angeles; \nZev Yaroslavsky, chairman of the County Board of Supervisors; Mayor \nAntonio Villaraigosa; Representatives Henry Waxman, Berman, Harman, and \nSherman; City Council members, every one of them; State Senator Kuehl; \nAssemblyman Feuer, Assemblywoman Bass, Assemblywoman Brownlee; Santa \nMonica mayor; Santa Monica council; AMVETS Post 2; AMVETS Post 116; \nAmerican Legion Post 123; VFW Post 875; Vietnam Veterans of America \nChapter 446; the Bel-Air Association; the Beverly Glen Association; \nBlair House; the Brentwood Community Council; and on and on--the \nCoalition for Veterans Land; the Federation of Hillside and Canyon \nAssociations; Friends of Westwood; the Pacific Palisades. It is \nvirtually all of west L.A. that is saying: Don't sell this land for \ncommercial use.\n  What the Department has announced is that they intend to make $4 \nbillion by selling this land. You and I know what is going to go on \nthis land: commercial, office, high-rises because that is what you get \nthe money from. It would be a travesty.\n  One of the things we now know is that traumatic brain injury is a \nmajor injury from this war. We need to build on veterans facilities, \nnot take their land away.\n  So I would say, Senator DeMint, take back this motion. It is the \nwrong thing to do. Administration, I know you have a statement saying \nyou oppose the amendment, but the city of Los Angeles, the county of \nLos Angeles is united.\n  So, Madam President, I move to table the amendment, and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, it is just an interesting note that \nthe man who gave this land, the 300-plus acres, to veterans was a \nUnited States Senator at the time, John P. Jones. He actually was a \nRepublican from the State of Nevada, and he served 30 years in the \nSenate, from 1873 to 1903. So he was a 50-percent owner of this land, \nand it was a wonderful gift to the veterans. I think it should not be \ndestroyed. Thank you.\n  I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I withdraw my motion to table at \nthis time because I know Senator Boxer is coming to the floor and \nwishes to address this question, and Senator DeMint may wish to also \nrespond, and I will remain and propose the motion at a later time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion is withdrawn.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I have come over to the floor, and I am \na little out of breath because this amendment was somewhat of a \nsurprise to me, although Senator Feinstein was a little worried about \nit possibly coming. I am sorry Senator DeMint isn't on the floor at \nthis moment because I would like to look him in the eye and tell him \nthat his amendment is misguided. It does damage to the veterans of this \ncountry and the faith they put in us.\n  As Senator Feinstein eloquently stated, and just reiterated to me, \nthe individual who gave this land for the veterans happened to be a \nRepublican from Nevada who wanted to make a commitment to our veterans. \nSo here we have a circumstance that is so bizarre because this \namendment that Senator Feinstein wrote, which Senator DeMint is trying \nto pull out of the bill, and is now in the bill, is a very wise one. It \nis one that keeps faith with the veterans of this country at a time \nwhen they deserve that support.\n  In some ways, I say to my colleagues, we have battled many times on \nthis floor for California and for the environment and for women's \nrights and all the rest. But I remember when another administration at \nanother time tried to sell the Presidio army base for billions of \ndollars, when the people were promised it would be a park and it was \nwritten in legislation that it would be a park. That administration \nsaid we could get billions of dollars. But the fact is that certain \nthings you cannot put a price on because, in the long run, it is the \nwrong thing to do. In the long run, it is wrong in this case to harm \nour veterans.\n  Now, here we have this land. As Senator Feinstein has explained to my \ncolleagues, it is in the middle of Los Angeles. Land is a precious \ncommodity in Los Angeles. We have a huge number of veterans who need \nservices in Los Angeles--maybe the highest concentration of veterans in \nthe country. I would have to check that out, but I would not be \nsurprised; it is certainly one of the highest concentrations. Here we \nare in the middle of a war and we all know the horrors our soldiers are \nfacing. We know there are great unmet needs in the Veterans' \nAdministration all over this country, and certainly in California. For \nexample, we didn't even have a burn unit in California and this war has \nbrought so many problems with serious burns.\n  We finally were able to accommodate some beds in San Diego for that \npurpose. We finally were able to accommodate some of those who have \nlost their limbs because they were not able to get the services in \nCalifornia.\n  This, I say to my friend, Senator DeMint of South Carolina, is not \nthe time, not the place, not the moment to say to our veterans: You are \nnot important; it is more important to have a rental car agency here or \na movie studio here. This is not the time to tell that to our veterans. \nThey are sacrificing.\n  We may have to have a women's clinic there someday. We may want to \nexpand services for homeless veterans. Those of us who have lived \nthrough the Vietnam era know that homelessness followed our veterans. \nAnd still when you go on the streets of our cities, whether it is San \nFrancisco, Los Angeles, or anywhere else, you will find a third to 45 \npercent of our veterans are from that era. They are Vietnam-era \nveterans who are homeless and struggle.\n  We may need to have job training centers for these returning \nveterans. Posttraumatic stress--my senior Senator made the point that \nwe are now learning the depth of the problems we have. Is this the time \nto take this land away from the veterans? It is outrageous, and it is \nwrong.\n  Senator Feinstein has absolutely done the right thing in this bill. I \npraise all of her colleagues on the committee. I wrote to Mr. Nicholson \nabout this issue several months ago saying: Why are you doing this? I \nwill ask to place that letter in the Record in a moment.\n  Senator Feinstein is right not only for our community in southern \nCalifornia but for the veterans throughout this country.\n  I sent a letter on June 6, 2007, on this subject to the Honorable \nJames Nicholson, Department of Veterans Affairs. I ask unanimous \nconsent to have printed in the Record the letter I sent to Secretary \nNicholson.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                  Hart Senate Office Building,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 6, 2007.\n     Hon. R. James Nicholson,\n     Department of Veterans Affairs,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Secretary Nicholson: I am writing to you regarding the \n     development of the West Los Angeles VA property and to urge \n     you to ensure that its land and facilities are used by and \n     for the veterans of the Los Angeles area.\n       I believe that two important facts should serve as the \n     overriding guidelines for the discussion about the West LA VA \n     property.\n\n[[Page S11105]]\n\n     First, as has been pointed out many times, this property is \n     veterans' property--given to veterans, to be used by \n     veterans--and should not in any way be viewed as excess \n     property to be sold, leased, or used for other purposes. I \n     oppose the use of an Enhanced Use Lease for any project at \n     the West LA VA. It is for this reason that I fully support \n     Congressman Waxman's and Senator Feinstein's legislative \n     efforts to preserve the land for veterans' use.\n       The second important fact is that at least one million \n     veterans reside within a 50 mile radius of the West LA VA \n     property, more than in 42 other states combined. When we \n     consider that this number continues to grow and that the \n     recent additions to the veterans rolls are sometimes severely \n     disabled, more services rather than fewer services will be \n     needed over time. Additionally, a remarkable number of the \n     homeless population of the area are veterans, many of whom \n     suffer from substance abuse or mental health problems. In Los \n     Angeles County alone, it is estimated that at least 18,000 \n     veterans are without shelter or a place to live. A broad \n     range of services are desperately needed for them.\n       As the master plan for this property is developed, many \n     people are looking to the Department of Veterans Affairs to \n     use this property to support veterans and their needs. The \n     veterans of the Los Angeles area benefit greatly from the \n     services offered there now, and it is crucial that with the \n     increasing numbers of returning veterans it remain a facility \n     fully committed to serving them--they deserve nothing less.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Barbara Boxer,\n                                                     U.S. Senator.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I talked about the fact that at least a \nmillion veterans reside within a 50-mile radius of the west Los Angeles \nVA property, more than in 42 other States combined. When we consider \nthat this number continues to grow, this is clearly the wrong thing to \ndo.\n  Let me say that what my colleague has done in this bill is in concert \nwith everyone in our area. I don't think she or I would walk in and \noffer an amendment that was a direct blow to a community in South \nCarolina. We would never do that. That would not be the right thing to \ndo.\n  The community is opposed to what Mr. DeMint wants to have happen. \nLocal government, many veterans, from the mayor's office, to the city \ncouncil, to the board of supervisors, to the full congressional \ndelegation, there is enormous support for the provision that Senator \nFeinstein has placed in this bill. Dozens of local veterans groups are \nin support of her provision.\n  I am going to read some of these supporters because I want to give a \nsense to my colleagues that they should stick with us on this issue \nbecause Senator Feinstein's language that she got placed in this bill \nis strongly supported.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the entire \nlist.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       County of Los Angeles; City of Los Angeles; Supervisor Zev \n     Yaroslavsky, Chairman, Los Angeles County Board of \n     Supervisors; Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa \n     Representative Henry Waxman; Blair House; Brentwood Community \n     Council; Brentwood Homeowners Association; Cahuenga Pass \n     Neighborhood Association; Citizens for Veterans Rights; \n     Coalition of Homeowner Associations-Council District 5; \n     Coalition for Veterans Land; Federation of Hillside and \n     Canyon Associations; Friends of Westwood; Holmby Hills \n     Homeowners Association; Holmby Westwood Property Owners \n     Association; Mandeville Canyon Association; Pacific Palisades \n     Chamber of Commerce; Pacific Palisades Community Council; \n     Pacific Palisades Residents Association.\n       Roscomare Valley Association; Santa Monica Canyon Civic \n     Association; Save Westwood Village; St. Paul the Apostle \n     Catholic Parish; Sullivan Canyon Homeowners Association; \n     Representative Howard Berman; Representative Jane Harman; \n     Representative Brad Sherman; L.A. City Council President Eric \n     Garcetti; L.A. City Council Member Jack Weiss; L.A. City \n     Council Member Bill Rosendahl; State Senator Sheila Kuehl; \n     Assemblyman Mike Feuer; Assemblywoman Karen Bass; \n     Assemblywoman Julia Brownlee; Santa Monica Mayor Richard \n     Bloom; Santa Monica Councilman Bobby Shriver; Former Los \n     Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan; Former Assemblywoman Fran \n     Pavley; AMVETS Post 2; AMVETS Post 116.\n       American Legion Post 123; VFW Post 875; Vietnam Veterans of \n     America Chapter 446; Bel-Air Association; Beverly Glen \n     Association; Tract 7260 Homeowners Association; West L.A. \n     Chamber of Commerce; West L.A. Neighborhood Council; West of \n     Westwood Homeowners Association; Westside Neighborhood \n     Council; Veterans Park Conservancy; Westwood Gardens Civic \n     Association; Westwood Hills Property Owners Association; \n     Westwood Homeowners Association; Westwood South of Santa \n     Monica Homeowners Association.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I will name a few. The County of Los \nAngeles, the city of Los Angeles, Representative Waxman, and every \nother Representative from that area; Howard Berman, Harman, Sherman, \nthe L.A. City Council president, State Senator Sheila Kuehl, all those \nlocal folks, former Los Angeles Mayor Riordan, AMVETS Post 2, AMVETS \nPost 116, American Legion Post 123, VFW Post 875, Vietnam Veterans of \nAmerica Chapter 446, and then a slew of homeowners associations, \nincluding the Coalition of Homeowner Associations Council District 5, \nthe Coalition for Veterans Land, Friends of Westwood, and it goes on \nand on.\n  Then we have the religious community: St. Paul the Apostle Catholic \nparish. We have the chamber of commerce. We have the neighborhood \ncouncil. It just goes on. The park conservancy, the civic association. \nThe administration is wrong to take this action.\n  Senator Feinstein is right. She mentioned colleagues on the committee \nwho were very helpful to her. It is very important to note that she \nmoved in a very bipartisan way.\n  In conclusion, I thank my colleague, Senator Feinstein, for \nwithdrawing her motion to table to give me this opportunity to express \nmyself because I think what she did was so important, and certainly she \nspoke for both of us when she did it.\n  I hope she will make this motion to table at the appropriate time, \nand we can table this amendment and send a message tonight to the \nveterans across this country that we stand with them.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I join Senator Feinstein and Senator Boxer \nin their efforts to preserve this property in west Los Angeles as a VA \nfacility and not turn it over to developers. This is commensurate with \nthe deed that originally granted this property to the United States \nback in 1888. The deed reads as follows:\n\n       Whereas, by an act of Congress approved March 2, 1887, to \n     provide for the location and erection of a branch home for \n     the disabled volunteer soldiers west of the Rocky Mountains, \n     the board of managers of the National Home for Disabled \n     Volunteer Soldiers are authorized, empowered, and directed to \n     locate, establish, construct and permanently maintain a \n     branch of said National Home for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers.\n\n  The purpose of this donation and the purpose that has been preserved \nover these many years has been to provide a place where veterans can be \nhospitalized, and it has become part of not only the Veterans' \nAdministration system, it has become part of the culture of the \ncommunity of Los Angeles.\n  The purpose of the original deed has been reaffirmed numerous times. \nIt was reaffirmed in 2002 by then-VA Secretary Anthony Principi when he \nvisited the site and when he issued a May 2004 decision regarding plans \nfor the modernization of VA facilities nationwide. In fact, a document \nreleased by the VA previewing the September 6, 2005, Capital Asset \nRealignment for Enhanced Services--the CARES process--of the local \nadvisory panel meeting regarding the west L.A. VA site states the \nfollowing:\n\n       It is important that the VA preserve the integrity of the \n     land originally granted for use as an old Soldier's home.\n\n  And that is the purpose of the language included in the \nappropriations bill by Senator Feinstein.\n  The CARES process was akin to the BRAC process used for the military, \ngoing around and looking at the uses of all the Veterans' \nAdministration facilities around the country and concluding what is the \nbest and highest purpose.\n  It is terribly important that the conclusion of this panel, very \nrecently, is that it is important that the VA preserve the integrity of \nthe land originally granted for use as an Old Soldiers' Home. That is \nwhat Senator Feinstein proposes to do, and it would be undercut by the \namendment of Senator DeMint.\n  I join Senator Feinstein and Senator Boxer as they are trying not \nonly to preserve the integrity of this land but also to preserve the \nintegrity of the community of west Los Angeles.\n  I had occasion to drive by this area, and I will stand corrected by \nthe local geographic experts, but it is a place of open space and \ntranquility in a very large metropolitan area. So it is a value beyond \nthe VA system; it is a\n\n[[Page S11106]]\n\nvalue to the community of Los Angeles. That is why there is a huge \nnumber of supporters of this initiative by Senator Feinstein and \nSenator Boxer: the County of Los Angeles, the city of Los Angeles, \nSupervisor Zev Yaroslavsky, chairman of the Los Angeles County Board of \nSupervisors, Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, Representative Waxman, our \ncolleagues in the House--all these individuals are standing shoulder to \nshoulder on this issue. This is consistent with the original donation \nof the land. It is consistent with the evaluation of the Veterans' \nAdministration as to how they should use the land, and it is consistent \nwith the community of Los Angeles.\n  I applaud and commend the Senators from California for their efforts.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I particularly thank Chairman Reed \nfor putting this provision in the bill. I am very grateful. I am also \nvery grateful for his defense of it today.\n  I thank my friend and colleague, Senator Boxer, for her help on the \nfloor, for her support, and for her continuous advocacy on behalf of \nCalifornia.\n  The bottom line is, would you sell the National Mall for profit? \nWould you sell Roosevelt Island for profit? Would you sell any part of \nthe federal highway system for profit? Why would you take land that has \nbeen dedicated for veterans purposes and lease it out for profit when \nwe know, as Senator Boxer said, we have thousands of homeless veterans, \nand right now there is a proposal moving forward to possibly build some \nhomeless units for veterans on that facility?\n  This land was deeded to the Federal Government, a huge amount of \nland, for the purpose of veterans, not for Fox movie studios, not for \nEnterprise, or whatever car rental agency, but for veterans in a city \nwith the largest number of veterans in the United States, and over \n322,000 veterans enrolled to use that facility, with a hospital of \n1,000 beds on that facility. You are going to begin to lease out that \nland?\n  I think it is terrible, just terrible. The next step would be the \nNational Mall. We ought to resist this effort. There are a lot of ways \nto make money, but I think the worst way is to make money off veterans \nat this point in time.\n  I very much resist this amendment. I join with my friend and \ncolleague, Senator Boxer, in resisting the amendment. I join with the \ncommittee chairman in resisting this amendment. I join with the ranking \nmember of the committee in resisting this amendment. I hope there will \nbe a very strong vote.\n  Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays, and I move to table the \namendment.\n  Once again, I will withdraw my motion to table for the greater good \nof getting a unanimous consent agreement, I hope.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the following \nbe the only first-degree amendments remaining in order to H.R. 2642, \nthat they be subject to second-degree amendments which are relevant to \nthe amendment to which it is offered, that no other amendments be in \norder: Feingold amendment No. 2661, Obama amendment No. 2658, McCaskill \namendment No. 2660, Hutchison amendment No. 2681, Coleman amendment \nrelating to conventions, Sanders amendment No. 2664, Tester amendment \nNo. 2669, Salazar amendment No. 2662, Murray amendment No. 2677, \nLandrieu amendment No. 2679, Stabenow amendment No. 2680, Stevens/\nInouye amendment No. 2682, Allard amendment relating to VA land \ntransfer in Denver, the pending DeMint amendment, and the Brown \namendment No. 2673; that when the Senate resumes consideration of the \nbill on Thursday, the only amendments remaining for disposition be No. \n2664, No. 2662, No. 2673, and the Coleman amendment relating to \nconventions, and passage, with no further debate or motions in order \nexcept for debate specified in an order related to the vote sequence; \nthat upon disposition of all amendments, the bill be read a third time \nand the Senate proceed to vote on passage of the bill; that upon \npassage, the Senate insist on its amendment, request a conference with \nthe House on the disagreeing votes of the two Houses and the Chair be \nauthorized to appoint conferees, with the previous order relating to \npoints of order remaining in effect with respect to this bill; that \nupon disposition of H.R. 2642, the Senate then proceed to the \nconsideration of Calendar No. 265, H.R. 2764, the State, Foreign \nOperations Appropriations Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LOTT. Reserving the right to object, if I can inquire for \nclarification, what this really means, then, is that we will have one \nvote tonight on the pending DeMint issue, and the other remaining four \namendments and final passage would occur without other intervening \nbusiness tomorrow morning; is that correct?\n  Mr. REED. That is correct.\n  Mr. LOTT. Thank you very much. That is basically what you just read.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mr. LOTT. And for the sake of one other issue under my reservation, I \nwould like to ask that a quorum be put in place, just temporarily. So I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the quorum call?\n  Hearing no objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Is there objection to the unanimous consent request?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I ask that one additional amendment be added to the \nlist to be voted on tomorrow, Thursday. It would be the McConnell \namendment No. 2666.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Is there objection to the \nrequest to modify?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I move to table amendment No. 2642, \nthe DeMint amendment. If I might correct that, it is 2686, the DeMint \namendment.\n  I move to table and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise to first of all say I am sure I \nam going to be supporting this underlying bill; military construction \nis such a critical component of our overall defense programs. But there \nis a collateral issue I would like to address for a minute. I, first of \nall, ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an article \nfrom the Moody Air Force Base newspaper from February 1 of this year.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          [From the Air Force Print News Today, Feb. 1, 2007]\n\n                    Moody Opens Doors to New Housing\n\n                    (By Tech. Sgt. Parker Gyokeres)\n\n       Moody Air Force Base, GA.--Team Moody celebrated the \n     completion of the first new single family housing units with \n     a ribbon cutting ceremony Jan. 31, at the new Magnolia Grove \n     Housing area.\n       The $52 million project provides 383 three and four-bedroom \n     homes in Magnolia Grove, each with no less than 1,630 square \n     feet of space.\n       Dignitaries attending the ribbon cutting ceremony included \n     Maj. Gen. Del Eulberg, Air Force Civil Engineer, Col. Joe \n     Callahan, 23rd Wing commander, and leadership from American \n     Eagle Communities LLC.\n       ``This is a big day for the Airmen and families of Team \n     Moody,'' said Colonel Callahan. ``The Magnolia Grove homes \n     are the nicest base housing units I have ever seen in the 31 \n     years I have been living in base housing. Moody Family \n     Housing has created a community that any Airman would be \n     proud to live in.'' Moody Family Housing is a 50-year, joint \n     public-private partnership between American Eagle Communities \n     and the U.S. Air Force.\n       ``The partnership is intended to improve standards of \n     living for current and future base housing residents,'' said \n     Louis Screws, 23rd Civil Engineer Squadron housing flight \n     chief.\n       The homes are fully owned and maintained by American Eagle \n     under rules agreed to in the project's transaction documents.\n       ``The Air Force benefits because they receive quality new \n     housing without the up-front money a military construction \n     contract requires,'' said Mr. Screws. ``American Eagle can \n     use private sector financing and private resources to build \n     these homes faster, better and more economically using local \n     codes and standards.''\n       The units are built with an all-metal framing system that \n     arrives partially assembled in a kit for a single home. It \n     takes only four days for a team of eight workers to frame an \n     entire house, said Rich Safranic, Moody Family Housing \n     quality assurance director.\n       By using all-metal construction, the materials are less \n     expensive to transport, stronger than wood, will not burn and \n     can be recycled easily, said Mr. Safranic.\n       American Eagle plans to use this construction technique for \n     every home in Magnolia Grove, and with an average of five \n     homes a week arriving at the site, every time-saving measure \n     is essential, added the quality assurance inspector.\n       Moody Family Housing expects to hand over an average of one \n     house a day to Air Force inspectors for certification, said \n     Naomi Hendricks, Moody Family Housing project director. The \n     construction on Magnolia Grove housing is scheduled to be \n     completed this December.\n       The first residents of Magnolia Grove will be the 94 \n     families currently residing in the ``Courts'' townhouses of \n     the Quiet Pines housing area.These units are scheduled to be \n     demolished as the residents are relocated. MFH will then use \n     the land for new senior leadership housing, said Mr. Screws.\n       American Eagle purchased 700 acres of peanut farmland along \n     the southern edge of Moody. There will be 383 single-family \n     units built on 150 acres of this property. The American Eagle \n     Communities has permanently donated approximately 200 acres \n     to the Banks Lake Wildlife Refuge Area. The remaining 350 \n     acres are being set aside for future base-housing growth.\n       ``We are the first major installation to accomplish the \n     goal of creating a new community using a privatized \n     partnership like this,'' said Lowell Klepper, 23rd CES deputy \n     base civil engineer. ``Moody has been working towards this \n     point for more than 20 years.''\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I note for the record that after 4 years of work on a \nhousing privatization contract and the millions spent, exactly two \nhouses have been built. This article talks about a celebration at Moody \nAir Force base upon the completion of these two homes. The problem is, \nneither one of these two houses has ever been occupied, and the \nprivatization issue at Moody has developed into a real mess.\n  The Air Force entered into a real estate transaction with Carabetta \nEnterprises Inc. for privatized housing at Moody Air Force Base. The \nestimated cost of the project has exceeded available funding by $25 \nmillion, and the project lender stopped funding in March of 2007 to \nprevent all funds from being expended. At least three other Air Force \nbases--Patrick Air Force base in Florida, Little Rock Air Force base in \nArkansas, and Hanscom Air Force base in Massachusetts--have similar \ncontracting delays with privatized housing projects associated with \nthis same contractor.\n  Despite having declared bankruptcy in the 1990s and supposedly being \nembroiled in a series of previous lawsuits over Government contracts, \nthe Carabetta organization was allowed to form a new joint entity, \nAmerican Eagle Communities LLC, and has won Government contracts in \nfive States for a total $3.3 billion. American Eagle won the $50 \nmillion contract for the Moody Air Force Base Magnolia Grove privatized \nhousing project, hired one of its principals to be the general \ncontractor, and now has left dozens of local subcontractors unpaid for \nmonths, resulting in numerous liens being filed, a complete lockdown of \nthe site, and millions of dollars in unpaid bills to local \nsubcontractors.\n  There has been concern that we have 1,000 new personnel who are going \nto be coming into Moody by 2009 under the BRAC, and this housing \nproject is specifically designed to accommodate the influx. I have \nwritten two letters to the Air Force expressing my concern and \ninquiring about the delay and the intended plan of action. In response, \nthe Air Force has said that because it has no legal agreements with the \ncontractor, issues of nonpayment between the contractor and \nsubcontractors must be resolved through the legal system.\n  That is not an acceptable answer. The Air Force is a contractor. This \ndirectly affects the quality of life of Air Force personnel at Moody \nAir Force Base as well as the other bases that have contracts with this \nparticular contractor. Air Force personnel are suffering because of the \npoor performance of this contractor, and the Air Force should have been \nmore proactive to fix this problem before we got to this point.\n  I have several questions on this issue that have yet to be answered. \nI am specifically asking the Air Force to answer: First, what were the \nfactors contributing to the decision to award Carabetta Enterprises, \nInc. this contract, given their known previous defaults and bankruptcy \ndeclarations? Secondly, is the Air Force currently taking steps to \nterminate this contract and, if so, what steps are they taking and, if \nnot, why not? Thirdly, what is the plan for housing the incoming Air \nForce personnel slated to live in the new quarters at Moody Air Force \nbase as well as the other bases that are affected by the default of \nthis contractor?\n  In my opinion, this issue is also ripe for an IG investigation to \nfigure out exactly what went wrong, why this contractor was awarded a \n$3.3 billion contract for privatized housing, covering five States, \nwork on all of which has been halted.\n  I urge the Air Force's expeditious attention and resolution of this \nissue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I wish to bring up several amendments for \nconsideration. These amendments have been cleared on both sides of the \naisle.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2661\n\n  I call up amendment No. 2661 for Senator Feingold regarding a VA \nmental health GAO report.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Fort Monmouth\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I would like to take a few moments to \ndiscuss an important issue with the manager of this bill, Senator Reed, \nand with my colleague from New Jersey, Senator Menendez.\n  Mr. REED. I am happy to discuss this issue with my colleagues from \nNew Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Senator. I would like to first thank the \nSenator and Senator Hutchison for putting together a good bill. \nEveryone in this body agrees that we must support the men and women of \nthe military while they are serving overseas and when they return home, \nand I believe this appropriations bill meets that demand.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I agree and I support this legislation \nas well. It will provide critical money to make sure our veterans are \ngiven the health care they deserve.\n  Mr. REED. I thank the Senators from New Jersey. We have no greater \nresponsibility than to our veterans, and I am proud of the bill we were \nable to complete in committee and now offer on the floor.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, this bill also strengthens our \nmilitary bases, providing money for military construction efforts and \nimprovements at bases, and to support projects related to the Defense \nBase Realignment and Closure Act of 2005, known as BRAC. While I \nsupport strengthening our bases and their overall infrastructure, some \ndisturbing information has come to light about the BRAC process and the \nclosing of the Fort Monmouth Army base in New Jersey since our \nAppropriations Committee completed work on this bill that warrants our \nimmediate attention.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, fighting wars involves not just the men \nand women on the ground overseas but also dedicated workers here at \nhome. It depends on the training and research done at military bases \nlike Fort Monmouth. Fort Monmouth provides intelligence and \nreconnaissance support for our Armed Forces, making them more effective \nfighters and protecting their lives.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Fort Monmouth researchers also develop critical \ntechnology for our Armed Forces, such as ``Warlock Jammers,'' which \nwere engineered at Fort Monmouth and modified for use in Iraq. This \nequipment emits radio frequencies that interfere with the signals that \nset off improvised explosive devices known as IEDs. The military was \nable to deploy them within 60 days of their development, and they \nstarted saving American lives.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I agree that great work has been done at \nFort Monmouth to support our military and it deserves recognition. Fort \nMonmouth has played an important role in the wars in Iraq and \nAfghanistan and the men and women working there are to be commended.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. The BRAC Commission knew about that important work and \nwanted to make sure our troops in the field would not be harmed by \nclosing the base. They included a requirement that the Secretary of \nDefense issue a report to Congress proving that ``movement of \norganizations, functions, or activities from Fort Monmouth to Aberdeen \nProving Ground will be accomplished without disruption of their support \nto the Global War on Terrorism.''\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Yet more than 2 years after the BRAC Commission vote, \nthe administration has failed to produce this report. To make matters \nworse, the Army is trying to move personnel out of Fort Monmouth now, \nbefore it has even considered the effect on our Armed Forces. Before \nthe Army starts to shift work out of Fort Monmouth, we need to know \nthat it won't hurt our troops.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. When we raised concerns about this to the Army, it \nhalted the transfer and our understanding was that the Army would wait \nuntil the report required by BRAC was completed. But now the Army has \nreversed course and plans to start transferring people soon.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. This is simply unacceptable. No personnel should be \ntransferred out of Fort Monmouth until the Department of Defense has \nsubmitted the report to Congress proving that the closure of Fort \nMonmouth will not hurt troops in the field.\n  Mr. REED. I thank the Senator for his thoughts. It is my \nunderstanding that the Army plans to issue a report on Fort Monmouth by \nthe end of the year. I can also assure my colleagues from New Jersey \nthat the Senate Armed Services Committee as the authorizing committee \nwill continue its oversight of the BRAC process.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise to offer for the Record, the Budget \nCommittee's official scoring of H.R. 2642,\n\n[[Page S11111]]\n\nthe Military Construction and Department of Veterans Affairs \nAppropriations Act for fiscal year 2008.\n  The bill, as reported by the Senate Committee on Appropriations, \nprovides $64.745 billion in discretionary budget authority for fiscal \nyear 2008, which will result in new outlays of $38.327 billion. When \noutlays from prior-year budget authority are taken into account, \ndiscretionary outlays for the bill will total $55.001 billion.\n  The Senate-reported bill is at its section 302(b) allocation for \nbudget authority and $20 million below its allocation for outlays. No \npoints of order lie against the committee-reported bill.\n  I commend the distinguished chairman of the Military Construction and \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs Appropriations Subcommittee for bringing \nthis legislation before the Senate. I ask unanimous consent that the \ntable displaying the Budget Committee scoring of the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   H.R. 2642, MILITARY CONSTRUCTION AND DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS\n                          APPROPRIATIONS, 2008\n  [Spending comparisons--Senate reported bill (in millions of dollars)]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                     General\n                                          Defense    purpose     Total\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSenate-Reported Bill:\n    Budget Authority...................     21,556     43,189     64,745\n    Outlays............................     13,302     41,699     55,001\nSenate 302(b) allocation:\n    Budget Authority...................  .........  .........     64,745\n    Outlays............................  .........  .........     55,021\nHouse-passed bill:\n    Budget Authority...................     21,371     43,374     64,745\n    Outlays............................     13,259     41,573     54,832\nPresident's Request:\n    Budget Authority...................     22,071     38,672     60,743\n    Outlays............................     13,264     39,120     52,384\n \n                    Senate-Reported Bill Compared To:\n \nSenate 302(b) allocation:\n    Budget Authority...................  .........  .........          0\n    Outlays............................  .........  .........        -20\nHouse-passed bill:\n    Budget Authority...................        185       -185          0\n    Outlays............................         43        126        169\nPresident's Request:\n    Budget Authority...................       -515      4,517      4,002\n    Outlays............................         38      2,579      2,617\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I express my strong support for the level \nof funding provided for the Department of Veterans Affairs in the \npending Military Construction and Veterans Affairs appropriations bill \nfor fiscal year 2008. I also take this opportunity to congratulate \nSenators Reed, Byrd, and the other members of the committee for their \nhard work on this measure.\n  This bill truly reflects our commitment to fully fund veterans' \nhealth care and benefits. Indeed, the bill before us closely tracks the \nlevel of funding recommended by the Veterans' Affairs Committee in our \nViews and Estimates to the Budget Committee. This legislation would \nprovide a $6.5 billion increase for VA health care over last year, $3.6 \nbillion more than the President requested. This represents the largest \nincrease in funding ever for VA health care. I am very pleased that \nthere are additional funds included in this amount for the treatment of \ntraumatic brain injuries, TBI, and for VA mental health programs, to \ntreat the ``invisible wounds'' that many veterans suffer from after \nserving in combat. These are two areas of vital importance to \nservicemembers returning from Operations Iraqi and Enduring Freedom.\n  I also thank the Military Construction-VA Appropriations Subcommittee \nmembers for their support of the VA Office of Inspector General. The \n$16 million increase for the OIG will enable that office to continue \nconducting extremely valuable oversight of VA. The VA inspector general \nhas consistently been vitally important to the Veterans' Affairs \nCommittee in the execution of our oversight responsibilities. The OIG \nis the central gear in VA's internal controls and quality assurance \nmechanism.\n  I would like to take this opportunity to raise the issue of Priority \n8--so-called middle-income--veterans and their current exclusion from \nthe VA health care system. The majority members of the Veterans' \nAffairs Committee, in our Views and Estimates, endorsed re-opening \nenrollment to these veterans. That recommendation was followed. The \nomnibus health care authorization bill recently reported out by the \nVeterans' Affairs Committee contains a provision that would allow these \nveterans back into VA. We would fully allow the VA Secretary to close \nenrollment off at any time. It is my view that adequate funding to re-\nopen enrollment exists.\n  I want to also express my strong support for the $21.5 billion in \nfunding for military construction projects included in this bill. This \nbill fully funds the administration's request for BRAC and the \nPresident's Grow the Force Initiative. It also includes the much needed \nfunding necessary to repair and maintain the military facilities that \nare so critically important to the readiness and well-being of the \nArmed Forces. I am particularly in support of the bill's inclusion of \n$929 million for National Guard and Reserve construction. We have asked \nour National Guard and Reserve troops to commit significant sacrifices \nfor this Nation and we should be prepared to provide these brave men \nand women the support they need to fulfill their duties.\n  I thank Senator Reed and the other subcommittee members for their \nwork on this bill and for sending the right message to both our \nNation's veterans and those currently serving. We have made a \ncommitment to providing support both before and after active service, \nand this measure honors that commitment. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport swift passage of the legislation before us today.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about a \ncritical issue regarding Iraq and Afghanistan veterans' health care \nneeds. America's Armed Forces are sustaining attacks by rocket-\npropelled grenades, improvised explosive devices, and land mines almost \ndaily in Iraq and Afghanistan. These injured soldiers require \nspecialized care from providers experienced in treating their unique \nhealth challenges. These blast injuries result from the complex \npressure waves generated by an explosion. Air-filled organs such as the \near, lung, and other organs surrounded by fluid-filled cavities such as \nthe brain and spinal cord are especially susceptible.\n  Earlier this year, I visited with a soldier named Mack Richards who \nsustained blast wounds to his wrist and ankle in Iraq, as well as \ntraumatic brain injury, or TBI. This soldier recounted to me his \ndifficulty and frustration in receiving treatment for his brain injury. \nHe was left at an army base far from home for months before he was sent \nback to his family and finally received therapy from our local \nrehabilitation facility.\n  Congress has been assured that veterans with brain and other complex \ninjuries are able to access the specialized treatment they need. \nHowever, Mack's story is not unique, and I think the time has come to \nquestion what role the underutilized capacity in civilian rehab can \nplay. That is not to devalue VA efforts and the great facilities the VA \nhas to offer, but to ask how civilian providers can complement VA \nfacilities and improve the care afforded our veterans returning from \nIraq and Afghanistan.\n  The large numbers of traumatic brain injury survivors returning home \nfrom war highlights the need to leverage all of the resources available \nto us for the successful treatment and rehabilitation of our injured \ntroops. Tapping into existing civilian TBI research and treatment \ncapacity can help improve outcomes and supplement the care systems \nbeing developed at both the Department of Defense and the Department of \nVeterans Affairs.\n  This is an issue which I know can stir up sensitivities given the \ndiversity of our veteran population. I want to make it clear that I am \nfully committed, as are many of my colleagues, to ensuring the VA has \nthe resources and strength to offer sustainable and top quality care \nfor every American veteran. That said, the public and civilian sectors \nmust come together to meet the needs of our newest generation of \nwounded warriors. This is not unprecedented. In the past, the \nDepartment of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs have \ncontracted with civilian clinicians and providers to make up the TBI \ncontinuum of care.\n  The VA has shown tremendous effort in addressing the needs of our \nreturning troops, given the enormous challenges we face. However, I \nbelieve the large volume of returning veterans with increasingly \ncomplex health care needs require an increasingly dynamic approach to \nbetter serve those who have given so much for our country. The need for \ntimely treatment and immediate rehabilitation expertise and capacity \nrequires additional resources and flexibility for the VA to form \npartnerships to ensure top notch care for\n\n[[Page S11112]]\n\nour service personnel. And, if this care can be provided closer to \nveterans' community and family support networks, then it is a win-win \nas families can be kept together and servicemembers can more easily \ntransition back into their daily routines.\n  I have included language in this bill requesting the Department of \nVeterans Affairs to report to Congress on the conditions and criteria \nused for contracting with civilian rehabilitation providers, and \noutreach efforts being conducted to inform veterans and those who \nadvocate on their behalf about such treatment options. I look forward \nto working with the VA and my colleagues to make sure our veterans have \naccess to the care their sacrifices and personal injuries require.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/05/senate-section/article/S11112-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11112]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REED.

Mr. President, I speak today with great sorrow as we \nhave lost a great American. A Fort Dodge native, Marine Sergeant Jon \n``J.J.'' Bonnell died while serving his country in Iraq on August 7, \n2007. Sergeant Bonnell stepped on a roadside bomb while on duty between \nBaghdad and Fallujah. He was part of the 1st Battalion, 11th Marine \nRegiment, based in Camp Pendleton CA. My prayers and deepest sympathy \ngo out to J.J.'s parents, Jon Bonnell, Sr., and Denise Roark, as well \nas to his three sisters and all his family and friends. I also wish to \nexpress my sympathy to the community of Fort Dodge, who not only lost a \nfine young man, but an exemplary soldier.\n  J.J. will be remembered fondly and missed dearly. Only 22 years old, \nmultiple students at Fort Dodge Senior High School referred to J.J. as \na ``hero,'' a label he greatly deserves. Making the ultimate sacrifice, \nJ.J. deserves the gratitude of every American. An uncle described J.J. \nby saying ``He loved doing what he did, and he gave the ultimate \nsacrifice. He said he was ready for the ultimate sacrifice.'' This \nspeaks volumes for J.J.'s character, and we as Iowans and Americans are \nfortunate and honored to have a man with J.J.'s devotion and dedication \nserving our Nation.\n  J.J. enlisted in the Marine Corps as a senior in high school in 2003. \nHe assisted victims of the 2004 tsunami in Southeast Asia after his \nfirst tour in Iraq. A deeply dedicated marine, his grandmother \nrecounted that J.J. ``thought all the marines were heroes.'' On behalf \nof all Iowans, I offer my most sincere appreciation for J.J.'s service \nto our Nation. I ask my colleagues in the Senate, and every American, \nto take a moment and remember with honor and gratitude the ultimate \nsacrifice of a true patriot, Sgt. Jon Bonnell, Jr.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/05/senate-section/article/S11112-3", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11112]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   TRIBUTE TO THE EASTERN KENTUCKY CONCENTRATED EMPLOYMENT PROGRAM, \n                              INCORPORATED\n\n Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to the Eastern \nKentucky Concentrated Employment Program, Incorporated, EKCEP, for \ntheir recent accomplishments at the 2007 Workforce Innovations \nConference.\n  The 2007 Workforce Innovations Conference provides the opportunity \nfor State and local government officials, workforce and economic \ndevelopment officials, as well as private sector representatives to \nassemble and discuss new ideas about workforce development issues. \nDuring this conference, Eastern Kentucky Concentrated Employment \nProgram's Coal Services Program was awarded the U.S. Department of \nLabor's Recognition of Excellence Award for ``Leveraging the Power of \ne3 Partnerships.'' The U.S. Labor Department's Employee and Training \nAdministration presents Recognition of Excellence honors in five \ndifferent categories.

Mr. President, today I congratulate Mr. Alex \nSoto as he nears the end of his term as the 102nd president of the \nNation's largest insurance association, the Independent Insurance \nAgents & Brokers of America, IIABA. Mr. Soto was elected to the IIABA's \nexecutive committee in 2001 and was installed as the association's \npresident last September.\n  Founded in 1896, IIABA, or the Big ``I'' as it is better known, is \nthe Nation's oldest and largest association of independent insurance \nagents and brokers, representing a network of more than 300,000 agents, \nbrokers, and their employees. During his term as president of the Big \n``I,'' Alex Soto has been a leader on a number of issues for the \nassociation including natural disaster insurance, regulatory reform, \nand producer compensation. He is a national leader on enhancement and \nenforcement of building codes, which is an important issue in our home \nState of Florida. Notably, as chairman of the National Branding \nCommittee and president of the IIABA, Alex devoted significant time and \nenergy to the development and promotion of the ``Trusted Choice'' brand \nfor independent agents. Thanks to his leadership, the Trusted Choice \ninitiative has successfully created a distinctive mark that conveys the \nvirtues of the independent agent insurance delivery system.\n  Alex Soto is also a great American success story. He came to the \nUnited States as a political refugee after fleeing communist Cuba in \n1960 at the age of 11. When he arrived in this country, he did not \nspeak any English and had to completely start over, learning the \nlanguage, customs, and assimilating. Alex has gone on to achieve \nnumerous accomplishments and is now the president of InSource, Inc., a \nsuccessful and growing independent agency in Miami. He holds a degree \nin international affairs from Florida State University, the Chartered \nProperty and Casualty Underwriter, CPCU, designation, and the Associate \nin Risk Management, ARM, designation. Alex has served as the chairman \nof the Florida Association of Insurance Agents, FAIA, and before that, \nas president of the Independent Insurance Agents of Dade County. He was \nvice chairman of the Florida Property Casualty Joint Underwriting \nAssociation, FPCJUA, in 1995-1996, as well as a member of the \nGovernor's Commission on the Florida Insurance Crisis in 1993, and the \nInsurance Fraud Task Force in 1997.\n  In addition, Alex is active in his community. He has taught numerous \ninsurance courses with the FAIA and at the University of Miami. He also \nserves as a trustee of the Archdiocese of Miami Trust. He was a member \nof St. Hugh Catholic Church Parish Council and a member of the Grove \nOutreach Center.\n  I sincerely thank Alex Soto for his work with the IIABA over the \nyears and for his commitment to his profession, his community, and our \nState of Florida. His efforts are greatly appreciated. I am proud to \ncount Alex as both a constituent and a friend. I wish him, his wife \nPatt, and their family all the best in their future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/05/senate-section/article/S11112-5", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11112-S11113]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 TRIBUTE IN HONOR OF MacDONALD GALLION\n\n Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to MacDonald \nGallion, who passed away on Saturday, August 11,\n\n[[Page S11113]]\n\n2007. For 13 years, MacDonald Gallion served as Alabama's attorney \ngeneral. He was a personal friend of mine and along with the entire \nState of Alabama, I mourn his passing.\n  Born in Montgomery and raised in Birmingham, MacDonald Gallion moved \nto Tuscaloosa in the 1930s to attend the University of Alabama. While \nat the university, MacDonald Gallion studied law and subsequently \nreceived his bachelor of law degree in 1937. That same year, he \nreturned to Birmingham where he began his law practice.\n  In 1941, following the start of World War II, MacDonald Gallion took \na leave of absence from his law practice to enlist in the U.S. Marine \nCorps. He served his country with great valor, witnessing extreme \ncombat in the South Pacific. While serving abroad, he was wounded at \nSaipan and was later awarded a Purple Heart. He received several other \nhonors for courage and returned to the United States as first \nlieutenant.\n  Upon his return from war, MacDonald Gallion relocated to Montgomery \nto serve as assistant attorney general for the State of Alabama. \nHowever, after several years, he resigned to return to private \npractice.\n  Later, MacDonald Gallion would again be called to serve his State. He \nwas appointed special counsel to Governor Gordon Persons during the \nhistoric Phenix City Trials and was asked in 1955 to serve as chief \nassistant attorney general to Attorney General John M. Patterson. In \n1958, MacDonald Gallion was elected to serve as attorney general for \nthe State of Alabama. He would again be elected to this position in \n1966.\n  MacDonald Gallion served two terms as Alabama's attorney general. \nDuring his tenure, MacDonald Gallion led successful litigation in \nseveral significant cases including one that established Alabama's \noffshore oil and gas rights. This historic ruling would later pave the \nway for the State's multimillion-dollar trust fund. He also led the \nsuccessful litigation against loansharks. At the time, this was the \nlargest litigation of its kind in the United States.\n  Active in his community, MacDonald Gallion was a member of many civic \norganizations and legal associations. He held the position of assistant \neditor at the Alabama Lawyer and was listed among the ``Who's Who in \nAmerica.'' He was instrumental in the founding of the Alabama District \nAttorney's Association. For his many accomplishments and contributions \nto Alabama, MacDonald Gallion was inducted into the Alabama Senior \nCitizens Hall of Fame.\n  MacDonald Gallion will be missed by his son Thomas Travis Gallion \nIII, and his daughter Mallory Gallion Bear. He will be remembered for \nhis dedication and decades of service to the State of Alabama. I ask \nthe entire Senate to join me in recognition of the life of MacDonald \nGallion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/05/senate-section/article/S11113-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11113]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:49 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House \nagrees to the amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. 2358) to \nrequire the Secretary of the Treasury to mint and issue coins in \ncommemoration of Native Americans and the important contributions made \nby Indian tribes and individual Native Americans to the development of \nthe United States and the history of the United States, and for other \npurposes.\n  The message also announced that the House disagrees to the amendment \nof the Senate to the bill (H.R. 2669) to provide for reconciliation \npursuant to section 601 of the concurrent resolution on the budget for \nfiscal year 2008, and agree to the conference asked by the Senate on \nthe disagreeing votes of the two Houses thereon.\n  Ordered, that Messrs.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now \nproceed to the consideration of S. Res. 308, which was submitted \nearlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 308) congratulating the Warner Robins \n     American Little League team of Warner Robins, Georgia, for \n     winning the championship game of the Little League World \n     Series.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise to encourage my colleagues to \njoin Senator Isakson and myself in support of a resolution \ncongratulating the 2007 Little League World Series champions, the \nWarner Robins American Little League team of Warner Robins, GA. Warner \nRobins and Houston County, where Warner Robins is located, have a very \nproud athletic tradition. Warner Robins High School and Houston County \nHigh School have been in the same region as my home high school over \nthe last several years and I have seen my high school win and lose \nagainst teams coming out of Houston County. The tradition in Houston \nCounty goes way back.\n  There is also a town in Houston County called Perry, and Perry, GA is \nthe home of a former all-State basketball player by the name of Sam \nNunn who served in this great institution for a period of 24 years.\n  Success in Houston County and Warner Robins from an athletic \nstandpoint is nothing new. But on August 26, 2007, the Warner Robins \nAmerican Little League team defeated the Tokyo Kitasuna Little League \nteam of Tokyo, Japan by a score of 3-2 after Dalton Carriker hit a solo \nwalk-off home run in the bottom of the eighth inning. This victory \nconcluded their impressive season with a record of 20 wins and only 1 \nloss. Considering the fact that more than 7,000 Little League All-Star \nteams took the field in July, this accomplishment is extremely \nimpressive.\n  Their talent, hard work, and sportsmanship allowed them to become the \nthird team from the State of Georgia to win the Little League World \nSeries and, in doing so, they captured the hearts of people all across \nGeorgia and in many parts of the Nation who love the game of baseball.\n  As a former Little League coach myself, during the years when my \nwife, Julianne, and I were raising our children in Moultrie, GA, I was \nproud to\n\n[[Page S11126]]\n\nparticipate in the longstanding tradition of Little League baseball as \na coach for my son's team, the Destiny Dawgs. I have seen firsthand the \nuncontested confidence, determination, and hard work that Little League \nbaseball instills in our youth.\n  I wish to recognize the 12 young men of the Warner Robins American \nteam individually for their great accomplishment: Keaton Allen, Dalton \nCarriker, Zane Conlon, Hunter Jackson, Taylor Lay, Nick Martens, Payton \nPurvis, Kendall Scott, Hunt Smith, David Umphreyville, Micah Wells, and \nClint Wynn. Their manager Mickey Lay and coaches Mike Conlon, Tommy \nMorris, and Mike Smith each deserve strong recognition for guiding \nthese young men to victory.\n  Moreover, I would be remiss if I did not recognize the teachers and \nstudents of these young men's schools, the fans who represented their \ncommunity, and the State of Georgia, for their enthusiasm and their \nsupport for this team's efforts. It is with great pride that I extend \nmy heartfelt congratulations to the Warner Robins American Little \nLeague team and their families. I am extremely proud of each of them \nand their accomplishments. I wish them great success in the future and \nurge my colleagues to support this resolution.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I thank Senator Chambliss for this \nopportunity. I am pleased to join him in paying tribute to the Warner \nRobins Little League. I associate myself with all his remarks.\n  Dalton Carriker's walk-off home run in extra innings was a thrill. \nKendall Scott's great relief pitching was a thrill. But what was the \nmost thrilling thing of all, because I got home in time to watch the \nend of that game, were the actions of those kids in response to the \ndespair of the Japanese kids. In fact, I want to quote from a news \narticle. A reporter interviewed Kendall Scott, the winning pitcher, \nafter the end of the game when he gazed across the field and saw the \nJapanese players all on their knees in tears, disappointed in their \nloss. Kendall Scott said the following:\n\n       They don't disrespect, they're very disciplined and they're \n     some of the nicest kids you'll ever meet in your entire life. \n     Just seeing them fall down and cry, you just couldn't let \n     them do that--you gotta pick them up.\n\n  Having had two boys who went through Little League, having worked in \nbaseball as a youngster myself, I know one of the goals of Little \nLeague is to instill good sportsmanship and teamwork on behalf of \nplayers. I commend manager Mickey Lay and coaches Mike Conlon, Tommy \nMorris, and Mike Smith for the discipline, the teamwork, and the \nrespect they instilled in these young men, because at the height of \ntheir victory, zenith of their young careers, they stopped their \ncelebration to console those they had defeated on the field. That shows \nthat Little League and its goals of teaching teamwork and sportsmanship \nare alive and well, not just in Warner Robins, GA but throughout the \nUnited States. I am pleased to join my colleague and commend the Warner \nRobins Little League on their victory and remind everyone, that is back \nto back for Georgia. Columbus, GA won last year. Warner Robins won this \nyear. We will try for a trifecta next year.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nbe agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motion to reconsider \nbe laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 308) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 308\n\n       Whereas, on August 26, 2007, the Warner Robins American \n     Little League team defeated the Tokyo Kitasuna Little League \n     team of Tokyo, Japan, by 3 runs to 2 runs to win the 61st \n     annual Little League Baseball World Series;\n       Whereas the Warner Robins American Little League team had \n     an impressive record of 20 wins and only 1 loss;\n       Whereas the success of the Warner Robins American Little \n     League team depended on the tremendous dedication and \n     sportsmanship of the team, including--\n       (1) Keaton Allen, who played outfield and pitched for the \n     team;\n       (2) Dalton Carriker, who played shortstop and pitched for \n     the team;\n       (3) Zane Conlon, who played 2nd base, shortstop, outfield, \n     and pitched for the team;\n       (4) Hunter Jackson, who played 3rd base;\n       (5) Taylor Lay, who played 2nd base and outfield;\n       (6) Nick Martens, who played 2nd base and outfield;\n       (7) Payton Purvis, who played outfield;\n       (8) Kendall Scott, who pitched and caught for the team;\n       (9) Hunt Smith, who played 1st base and outfield;\n       (10) David Umphreyville, who played outfield and caught for \n     the team;\n       (11) Micah Wells, who played 1st base; and\n       (12) Clint Wynn, who played outfield and pitched for the \n     team;\n       Whereas the Warner Robins American Little League team was \n     managed by Mickey Lay and coached by Mike Conlon, Tommy \n     Morris, and Mike Smith, each of whom demonstrated leadership, \n     professionalism, and respect for the players they led and the \n     game of baseball;\n       Whereas the fans of the Warner Robins American Little \n     League team showed enthusiasm, support, and courtesy for the \n     game of baseball and all of the players and coaches;\n       Whereas the performance of the Warner Robins American \n     Little League team demonstrated to parents and communities \n     throughout the United States that athletic participation \n     builds character and leadership in children;\n       Whereas the Warner Robins American Little League team \n     became the second consecutive team from the State of Georgia \n     to win the Little League World Series, following the win by \n     the Columbus Northern Little League team in 2006;\n       Whereas Georgia is only the 4th State to produce back-to-\n     back champions in the 61-year history of the Little League \n     World Series and the first State to win back-to-back titles \n     since 1992-1993;\n       Whereas every team from the State of Georgia that has \n     participated in the Little League World Series has won the \n     Championship; and\n       Whereas the Warner Robins American Little League team \n     brought pride and honor to the State of Georgia and the \n     United States: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) congratulates and honors the Warner Robins American \n     Little League team and the loyal fans who supported the team \n     on winning the 61st annual Little League Baseball World \n     Series;\n       (2) recognizes and commends the hard work, dedication, \n     determination, and commitment to excellence of the members, \n     parents, coaches, and managers of the Warner Robins American \n     Little League team;\n       (3) recognizes and commends the people of Warner Robins, \n     Georgia, for the outstanding loyalty and support that they \n     displayed for the Warner Robins American Little League team \n     throughout the season;\n       (4) commends Little League Baseball for continuing the \n     tradition of encouraging the development of sportsmanship and \n     confidence in youth by sponsoring world-class baseball; and\n       (5) respectfully requests--\n       (A) that the American people recognize the achievements of \n     the Warner Robins American Little League team; and\n       (B) that the Secretary of the Senate transmit an enrolled \n     copy of this resolution to--\n       (i) the City of Warner Robins; and\n       (ii) the Warner Robins American Little League Baseball team \n     for appropriate display.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/05/senate-section/article/S11126-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11126-S11127]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ORDERS FOR THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 6, 2007\n\n  Mr. REED.
