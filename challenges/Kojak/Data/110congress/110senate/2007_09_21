I also ask unanimous consent that the time of the quorum \nbe equally divided and that apply retroactively.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Rhode \nIsland.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Rhode Island is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, Senator Levin, for \nyielding time and also for being the principal author of the Levin-Reed \namendment, the amendment we are considering today. There will be a vote \nshortly. The amendment recognizes that we have responsibilities in \nIraq, but it also recognizes the constraints we face in Iraq.\n  The first principal constraint is a lack of sufficient forces to \nmaintain the current force level there. That alone must drive a change \nin mission for our military forces in Iraq. But it also recognizes the \nfundamental dynamic in Iraq, which is a political dynamic. It is a \npolitical dynamic that must be achieved, not by the United States but \nby Iraqi political leaders. When the President announced the surge in \nJanuary, he made it very clear that the whole purpose was to provide \nthese leaders with the political space and the climate to make tough \ndecisions. Frankly, those decisions have not been made.\n  What we have gained on the ground has been tactical momentum. Any \ntime you insert the greatest Army and Marine Corps and Air Force and \nNavy in the world into a situation, you are going to make progress--and \nwe have. But the real question there is, Will that progress last when \nwe inevitably begin to draw our forces down, as General Petraeus has \nannounced? I think most people would suggest probably not.\n  So we are left with the reality on the ground and the reality here at \nhome--waning support for a policy that the American people believe is \nmisguided and has been incompetently executed by the administration. We \nhave to change the mission, and the core of the Levin-Reed amendment is \nto change that mission, to go away from an open-ended ``we will do \nanything you want, Mr. Maliki, even if you don't do anything we want'' \nto focused counterterrorism, training Iraqi security forces, and \nprotecting our forces. It also recognizes that we have to have a \ntimeframe in which to do those things.\n  I am encouraged and I think all should be encouraged that a year ago \nwhen we started talking about initiating withdrawal of forces from \nIraq, that was an item which was not only hotly debated on the floor \nbut severely criticized.\n  General Petraeus has told us he will propose and will probably \nimplement a withdrawal of forces before the end of this year. That is \npart 1 of the Levin-Reed approach. The second is to begin a transition \nto these missions, and we hope that can be accomplished in a very short \nperiod of time. Finally, we would like to see these missions fully \nvetted, fully set out and implemented on the ground, moving away from \nthe open-ended approach within a fixed period of time. This approach, \ntogether with a very aggressive diplomatic approach, we believe is the \nkey to contributing not just to the stability of Iraq but to the long-\nterm interests of the United States in the region and the world.\n  I hope we are able to agree to this amendment, to pick up support. We \nhave listened to General Petraeus. Frankly, he has in part agreed with \nus, in terms of beginning withdrawal. He has suggested, but not \ndefinitively, that some transition sometime down the road must take \nplace. But I think--surprisingly to me, at least--when asked what \nshould we do in the next year, he essentially said: I can't tell you \nuntil next March, and then I will tell you. We have to have a plan, a \nstrategy for this country that certainly goes beyond next March. The \nworld and our strategic interests will not start and stop in March. \nThey are continuous, they are challenging, and we have to face the best \ncourse of action going forward. We believe--I believe strongly--this is \nthe best course of action.\n  This war in Iraq has cost billions of dollars. More profoundly and \nmore fundamentally, it has taken the lives of over 3,700 American \nservice men and women. It has injured countless. I think the American \npublic is genuinely not only concerned but in a literal sense \nheartbroken about what is going on. They are asking us--indeed, \ndemanding of us--if the President is unwilling to act, that we act to \nchange the course, to provide a strategy and a policy that is \nconsistent with our interests, with our resources, and with our ideals \nthat will help us move forward.\n  I hope in the next several minutes as this vote comes to the floor \nthat the message of the American people will be heard and heeded and \nthat we will adopt the Levin-Reed amendment.\n  I yield my time.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I suggest the absence of a quorum and equally divide the \ntime.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I yield myself 4 minutes.\n  There is a lot of disagreement about Iraq policy, how we got into the \nquagmire we are in there, the failure to plan properly, the disbanding \nof the Iraqi Army, the lack of a plan for the aftermath and a number of \nother issues which have been the subject of great debate.\n  There is a consensus on a number of issues. It is that consensus \nwhich drives the Levin-Reed amendment. There is a consensus that we \nhave an important stake in a stable and independent Iraq. Everyone \nagrees on that. The opponents of this amendment like to suggest that \nsomehow or other the proponents are not interested in a stable and \nindependent Iraq. It is exactly the opposite. We are as interested in \nthat as are the opponents.\n  The question is, Are we moving in that direction? Is the current \npolicy working or do we need to change course? Do we need to find a way \nto put pressure on the Iraqi leaders to reach political settlement as \nthe only hope of achieving an independent and stable Iraq?\n  That is not the proponents of this amendment who are saying a \npolitical settlement is not the only hope of ending the violence and \nachieving stability, that is not just the proponents, that is a \nconsensus point. General Petraeus acknowledges that very openly. The \nIraq Study Group says that. General Jones and his group say that.\n  There is no solution that ends the violence that is not based on a \npolitical coming together of the Iraqi leaders. They have to accept \nresponsibility for their own country. They have to meet the benchmarks \nthey themselves have set for themselves. They have missed those \nbenchmarks and the timelines that were set out by themselves for those \nbenchmarks.\n  We have to change course because we have been through now longer than \nwe fought World War II, we have been there longer than we fought the \nKorean\n\n[[Page S11921]]\n\nwar, we have spent half a trillion dollars or more, we have lost almost \n4,000 of our brightest and bravest men and women, seven times that many \nwounded, $10 billion a month.\n  We have to change the dynamic in Iraq, and that dynamic can only be \nchanged when those Iraqi leaders realize the open-ended commitment is \nover. If we simply say, as the President says: Well, we will take \nanother look in March, we will see what direction we are going to go in \nMarch, whether we are going to reduce our presence below the presurge \nlevel, but we will do that in March, that is a continuation of the \nmessage which this administration has been delivering to the Iraqi \nleaders year after year: We are going to be patient. We are going to be \npatient. The President has, a dozen times, said the American people \nneed to be patient.\n  It is the opposite message that has a chance of working for the Iraqi \nleaders, that we are mighty inpatient here in America, with the \ndawdling of the political leaders in Iraq, who are the only ones who \ncan achieve a political settlement. We cannot impose that on them, only \nthey can reach it.\n  If they keep thinking we are not going to put the pressure on them, \nwe are going to be their security blanket, we are going to protect them \nin the Green Zone, we are going to continue to lose our lives and \nsquander our resources while they dawdle, they are making the major \nfundamental mistake which is going to keep the violence going.\n  We have to correct that. We have to change that. We have to force \nthose leaders to accept the responsibility for their own country.\n  Now, the Iraq Study Group pointed to the relationship between putting \npressure on the Iraqi leaders and having them reach an agreement. This \nis what the Iraq Study Group pointed out now almost a year ago: That an \nopen-ended commitment of American forces would not provide the Iraqi \nGovernment the incentive it needs--the incentive it needs--to take the \npolitical actions that give Iraq the best chance of quelling sectarian \nviolence.\n  I yield myself 1 additional minute. In the absence of such an \nincentive, the Iraq Study Group said, the Iraqi Government might \ncontinue to delay taking those actions.\n  That is the connection this amendment makes. What Levin-Reed says is: \nWe are not going to withdraw precipitously, we are not going to totally \nwithdraw, we have interests there that require us to keep some troops \nthere. But we have the need to change that mission.\n  The President talks about the possibility, but he does not do it now. \nHe does not say: we are announcing we are going to change our mission \nto a support mission, out of the middle of a civil war. We are going to \nchange our mission to supporting our own people. We are going to change \nour mission to going after terrorists, a targeted counterterrorism \nmission, we are going to change our mission so that we are going to, \nyes, continue to support the Iraqi Army, to supply the Iraqi Army, but \nwe are getting out of the middle of a sectarian battle for our sake and \nfor the sake of the Iraqi people, to force those leaders to take \nresponsibility for their own nation.\n  So it is not precipitous. We provide a reasonable timeline. We say \nthe troops that need to be withdrawn as part of that transition to \nthose new missions will be withdrawn within 9 months.\n  Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, how much time is remaining on our side?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Twelve minutes.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to Senator Inhofe from \nOklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I think we need to be real clear what we \nare talking about. What we are talking about is telling the enemy what \nwe are going to do. If there is one thing they have said, our military \nhas said we cannot do, is to leave precipitously and let them know when \nwe are going to do it. But that is what we are talking about.\n  You know, when General Petraeus came a couple of weeks ago, I knew \nexactly what he was going to say because I was over there--I have been \nover there actually 15 times in the AOR of Iraq, not always in Iraq, \nsometimes Afghanistan, Djibouti and all of that.\n  But I have watched very carefully, from time to time when I have been \nthere, what progress has been made. I was in shock the last two trips \nwe took. The last two trips, it was so evident in that one area, \nstarting with Anbar, where most of the problems were. And I was in \nAnbar Province, in Fallujah, during all the elections that took place, \nand it was chaos up there. We remember our marines going door to door \nWorld War II style and all the things that were going on there. It is \nnow totally secure. It is not secure under us, it is secure under the \nIraqi security forces.\n  We remember only a year ago the terrorists said Ramadi was going to \nbe the terrorist capital of world. It is now secure. All of the way \nthrough down there, south of Baghdad, the same thing is happening.\n  What has happened with this surge are three different things: No. 1, \nthe surge itself. That is more people. No. 2, we had General Petraeus \ngoing in. No. 3, they did get the message from some of these surrender \nand cut-and-run resolutions that there was the threat that we would \npull out, and, consequently, the Iraqi security forces have done things \nthey have never done before.\n  I learned something when I was over there, and that was it is not the \npolitical leaders, it is the religious leaders who are calling the \nshots. Our intelligence goes to all the weekly mosque meetings. Prior \nto the surge, 85 percent of the mosque meetings were anti-American \nmessages. Since the surge, since April, there hasn't been one.\n  So this is the kind of progress that is being made. We now have \nvolunteers going out there with spray cans, putting circles around the \nundetonated IEDs, doing this on their own, risking their own lives to \nhelp Americans.\n  We have this imbedded program, where they actually go in joint \nsecurity stations and live with the Iraqis. It is something that has \nbeen very successful in developing close relationships. So this is the \nkind of success we are having.\n  I was up in Tikrit the other day. Remember, that is Saddam Hussein's \nhometown. Even up there, in that home territory up there, with the \nexception of Diyala, it all looks real good. That is the bottom line. \nWe have success.\n  If we pass something now that tells them, in a period of time you can \nexpect us to leave, and this is what we are going to do, we are giving \nthem our playbook. If you look and see what some of our top leaders \nhave said about that, General Petraeus said: We cannot leave without \njeopardying the gains we have started to achieve.\n  Those are the gains I talked about. Secretary Gates said: If we were \nto withdraw, leaving Iraq in chaos, al-Qaida most certainly would use \nAnbar Province as another base from which to plan operations.\n  This is the type of thing we would be doing. I cannot imagine anyone \nwould vote for any type of amendment that would tell the enemy \nspecifically what we were going to do and when we were going to do it.\n  Ambassador Crocker says: I cannot guarantee success in Iraq. I do \nbelieve, as I have described, it is attainable. I am certain that \nabandoning or drastically curtailing our efforts will bring failure, \nand the consequences of such failure must be clearly understood by us \nall.\n  What are those consequences? It would be a vacuum. We have heard \nloudly and clearly from such people as President Ahmadi-Nejad who said:\n\n       I can tell you there will be a power vacuum in the region. \n     [This is if we leave precipitously.] We are ready with other \n     regional countries such as Saudi Arabia, and the people of \n     Iraq to fill that vacuum.\n\n  In other words, we leave, Iran comes in, al-Qaida comes in, all the \nadvances, all the sacrifices, all the lives that have been lost will \nhave been lost in vain.\n  I cannot imagine anyone would vote for this amendment. I encourage my \nfellow Senators to oppose it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is 7 minutes 10 seconds.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, this has been a very spirited and \nmeaningful debate. The amendment that has\n\n[[Page S11922]]\n\nbeen offered by two people I respect greatly. I do not question their \nmotives about loving our country anymore than I do. They are trying to \nfind out what is best for Iraq and a very difficult situation. We have \nan honest disagreement.\n  I think it has been a very healthy debate of reaching the same goal; \nthat is, a successful outcome in Iraq. But make no mistake about it, \nfrom my point of view, the reason I oppose this resolution, it is a \nchange in military strategy.\n  Senator Reed talked about similarities between what General Petraeus \nsaid and what this resolution would do. There are some similarities, \nbut it is a fundamental change in military strategy. After General \nPetraeus testified, is that wise for us to do that? Is it wise for the \nCongress to basically take operational control of this war from General \nPetraeus?\n  Because that is what this resolution would do, it restructures our \nforces in a way he did not recommend. It would be a very overt \nrejection of General Petraeus's leadership, his strategy, his vision, \nand his recommendations. I think we need to understand that would be \nthe consequence of passing this resolution.\n  It would be saying, respectfully, no to General Petraeus and yes to \nthe Congress in terms of how to run a war. I think that is not wise. It \nis the de facto return to the old strategy. For 3\\1/2\\ years, we had \nthe strategy on the ground in Iraq that did not produce results that \nwere beneficial.\n  I am a military lawyer, and I have no expertise about how to invade a \ncountry or manage a population once the invasion is over. But I can \ntell you this based on common sense and 3\\1/2\\ years of experience. The \nold strategy was not working. The first trip to Baghdad after the fall \nof the capital, you were able to move around, it was a bit chaotic, but \nyou were able to go downtown and do some things you have a hard time \neven doing today.\n  But by the third trip to Baghdad after the fall, we were in a \nsecurity environment, almost in a tank. So it was clear to me, training \nthe Iraqi troops, having a small military footprint, was not achieving \nthe security we needed for reconciliation. And the few ``dead-enders'' \nwere the most resilient people in the world. If the insurgency was in \nits last throes, it was a deep throe.\n  Every time I asked the people coming back who were running the old \nstrategy and testifying to Congress, what is the general number of \ninsurgents, about 5,000 hard-core insurgents. It is the most resilient \n5,000 in the world. They were able, certainly, to do a lot of havoc. \nThank goodness we changed strategies.\n  Senators Levin and Reed and others have been arguing for a very long \ntime to change course and change strategies. The President heard that \ncall. He sat down with military leaders and put a new commander in the \nfield. We have, in fact, changed strategies. What did we do? We went a \ndifferent way. Instead of withdrawing troops and doing more of the \nsame, we added troops. As Senator Inhofe said, it is the best thing we \nhave done. These additional 30,000 combat troops being interjected into \nthe battlefield have paid off in security gains we have never seen \nbefore.\n  Hats off to the surge. To those who are part of the surge, those who \nhave been in Iraq for a very long time, I acknowledge and respect your \nsuccess because the success has been undeniable. The challenges are \nalso undeniable. But without the surge, there would have been no \nturnaround in Anbar. The people in Anbar had had enough of al-Qaida. We \ncan't take credit for that. Al-Qaida overplayed its hand, and we had \nadditional combat power in place to take advantage of a population that \nwas ready to make a choice, a choice for the good. Their rejection of \nal-Qaida is not national political reconciliation, it is not embracing \ndemocracy. But it is good news because you have Sunni Arabs rejecting \nthe al-Qaida agenda, and that is great news.\n  This resolution not only is a rejection of General Petraeus's \nstrategy, his vision for how to be successful, it has an impractical \neffect. The rules of engagement one would have to draft around \nimplementing this strategy are almost impossible from my point of view. \nJust to train and fight al-Qaida, how do you do that, when you have all \nkinds of enemies running around Iraq, including Iran, including \nsectarian violence? The idea that we are going to change missions and \nadopt this resolution as a new mission and have such a limited military \nability is unwise and impractical.\n  It is a dangerous precedent for the Congress to set to withdraw from \na military commander who has been successful the power to implement a \nstrategy that has proven to be successful.\n  The basic premise of the resolution is, if we change strategies, \nreject General Petraeus and go to the old strategy, which is, in \nessence, what we would be doing, it would bring about better \nreconciliation. My fundamental belief is that we will never have \npolitical reconciliation until we have better security. The new \nstrategy, the surge, has brought about better security than we have \never had before in Iraq. Even though it is still a very dangerous \nplace, there is no evidence to suggest that reconciliation would be \nenhanced by rejecting Petraeus and adopting the Congress's plan for \nIraq. Quite the opposite. I think all of the evidence we have before us \nis that a smaller military footprint, when you are training and \nfighting behind walls, empowers the enemy. If we adopted this \nresolution, the security gains we have achieved would be lost. We would \nbe abandoning people who have come forward to help us. We wouldn't have \nthe military power to seize the momentum that has been gained from the \nsurge. We would actually roll back the momentum that has been gained. \nWe would put people at risk who have come forward to help us. For \nexample, 12,000 people have joined the police force in Anbar in 2007. \nIn 2006, only 1,000 people joined the police in Anbar. There is local \nreconciliation going on. There is a realization by the Iraqi people \nthat now is the time to step forward. Their politicians are lagging \nbehind the local population, but it will not be long before Baghdad \nunderstands that they have to reconcile their country through the \npolitical process. They will only do that with better security.\n  When you reach across the aisle in America, you can pay a heavy price \nin terms of your political future. When you reach across the aisle in \nBaghdad, your family can be killed. Better security will breed more \npolitical reconciliation, not less. To abandon this strategy now, to \nsubstitute the Congress's judgment for General Petraeus's judgment, is \nill-advised and unwarranted. Quite frankly, General Petraeus and the \ntroops serving under him deserve our support and our respect, and they \nhave earned the ability to carry on their mission. They have earned, \nbased on success on the battlefield, the right to move forward as they \ndeem to be militarily sound.\n  The Congress is at 11 percent. Part of the reason we are at 11 \npercent is that we don't seem to be able to come together and solve \nhard problems. Why do we believe we have a better insight into how to \nwin this war than a battlefield commander who has produced results \nnever known before? I don't think we do.\n  I will end this debate in a respectful manner. We have the same goal, \nand that is to bring about political reconciliation and success in \nIraq. Unfortunately, this goes backwards at a time when we need to go \nforward.\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today I am necessarily absent to \nattend a funeral, and therefore will miss rollcall vote No. 346 on the \nLevin-Reed amendment to provide for a reduction and transition of U.S. \nforces in Iraq. As a cosponsor of this amendment, had I been present, I \nwould have voted ``yea.''\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I support passage of the Levin-Reed \namendment and a new course of action in Iraq.\n  This amendment makes three significant and important changes in our \ninvolvement in Iraq that to this point the administration has been \nunwilling to make, even though the American people have been demanding \nchange for over a year.\n  First, it removes our troops from the civil war they are now policing \nand gives them three achievable missions:\n\n[[Page S11923]]\n\nto conduct targeted counterterrorism operations against al-Qaida and \naffiliated terrorist organizations; to train and equip Iraqi Security \nForces; and, to provide security for U.S. personnel and infrastructure.\n  Second, the amendment calls for the safe redeployment of those troops \nnot required for these three missions beginning in 3 months and to be \ncompleted within 9 months of this bill's passage.\n  And finally this amendment acknowledges what we have known all along \nthat there is no military solution to this conflict. It calls for the \nimplementation of a comprehensive diplomatic, political, and economic \nstrategy to jump start the process of reconciliation and stability. \nThis strategy would include sustained engagement with Iraq's neighbors \nand the international community and the appointment of an international \nmediator in Iraq under the United Nations Security Council. The \nmediator would have the authority to engage the political, religious, \nethnic, and tribal leaders in a political process that aims to avoid no \none wants--regional civil war.\n  For nearly 5 years, our troops have done everything asked of them. It \nis time for Iraqis to provide the security for their own country. I \nurge adoption of the Levin-Reed amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the time \nbetween 9:50 and 10 a.m. will be equally divided between the two \nleaders or their designees, with the majority leader or his designee \ncontrolling the final 5 minutes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, with this vote, the Senate faces, once \nagain, a simple choice: whether to build on the successes of our new \nstrategy and give General Petraeus and the troops under his command the \ntime and support needed to carry out their mission, or to ignore the \nrealities on the ground and legislate a premature end to our efforts in \nIraq, accepting thereby the terrible consequences that will ensue.\n  Many Senators wished to postpone this choice, preferring to await the \ntestimony of General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker. Last week these \ntwo career officers reported unambiguously that the new strategy is \nsucceeding in Iraq. After nearly 4 years of mismanaged war, the \nsituation on the ground in Iraq shows demonstrable signs of progress. \nUnderstanding what we now know--that our military is making progress on \nthe ground, and that their commanders request from us the time and \nsupport necessary to succeed in Iraq--it is inconceivable that we in \nCongress would end this strategy just as it is beginning to show real \nresults.\n  General Petraeus reported in detail on these gains during his \ntestimony in both Houses and in countless interviews. The No. 2 U.S. \ncommander in Iraq, LTG Ray Odierno, said yesterday that the 7-month-old \nsecurity operation has reduced violence in Baghdad by some 50 percent, \nthat car bombs and suicide attacks in Baghdad have fallen to their \nlowest level in a year, and that civilian casualties have dropped from \na high of 32 per day to 12 per day. His comments were echoed by LTG \nAbboud Qanbar, the Iraqi commander, who said that before the surge \nbegan, one third of Baghdad's 507 districts were under insurgent \ncontrol. Today, he said, ``only five to six districts can be called hot \nareas.'' Anyone who has traveled recently to Anbar, or Diyala, or \nBaghdad, can see the improvements that have taken place over the past \nmonths. With violence down, commerce has risen and the bottom-up \nefforts to forge counterterrorism alliances are bearing tangible fruit.\n  None of this is to argue that Baghdad or other regions have suddenly \nbecome safe, or that violence has come down to acceptable levels. As \nGeneral Odierno pointed out, violence is still too high and there are \nmany unsafe areas. Nevertheless, such positive developments illustrate \nGeneral Petraeus's contention last week that American and Iraqi forces \nhave achieved substantial progress under their new strategy.\n  No one can guarantee success or be certain about its prospects. We \ncan be sure, however, that should the United States Congress succeed in \nterminating the strategy by legislating an abrupt withdrawal and a \ntransition to a new, less effective and more dangerous course--should \nwe do that, then we will fail for certain.\n  Let us make no mistake about the costs of such an American failure in \nIraq. Many of my colleagues would like to believe that, should the \namendment we are currently considering become law, it would mark the \nend of this long effort. They are wrong. Should the Congress force a \nprecipitous withdrawal from Iraq, it would mark a new beginning, the \nstart of a new, more dangerous effort to contain the forces unleashed \nby our disengagement. If we leave, we will be back--in Iraq and \nelsewhere--in many more desperate fights to protect our security and at \nan even greater cost in American lives and treasure.\n  We cannot set a date for withdrawal without setting a date for \nsurrender. Should we leave Iraq before there is a basic level of \nstability, we invite chaos, genocide, terrorist safehavens and regional \nwar. We invite further Iranian influence at a time when Iranian \noperatives are already moving weapons, training fighters, providing \nresources, and helping plan operations to kill American soldiers and \ndamage our efforts to bring stability to Iraq. If any of my colleagues \nremain unsure of Iran's intentions in the region, may I direct them to \nthe recent remarks of the Iranian president, who said: ``The political \npower of the occupiers is collapsing rapidly . . . Soon, we will see a \nhuge power vacuum in the region. Of course, we are prepared to fill the \ngap.'' If our notions of national security have any meaning, they \ncannot include permitting the establishment of an Iranian dominated \nMiddle East that is roiled by wider regional war and riddled with \nterrorist safehavens.\n  The hour is indeed late in Iraq. How we have arrived at this critical \nand desperate moment has been well chronicled, and history's judgment \nabout the long catalogue of mistakes in the prosecution of this war \nwill be stern and unforgiving. But history will revere the honor and \nthe sacrifice of those Americans, who despite the mistakes and failures \nof both civilian and military leaders, shouldered a rifle and risked \neverything--everything--so that the country they love so well might not \nsuffer the many dangerous consequences of defeat.\n  That is what General Petraeus, and the Americans he has the honor to \ncommand, are trying to do--to fight smarter and better, in a way that \naddresses and doesn't strengthen the tactics of the enemy, and to give \nthe Iraqis the security and opportunity to make the necessary political \ndecisions to save their country from the abyss of genocide and a \npermanent and spreading war. Now is not the time for us to lose our \nresolve. We must remain steadfast in our mission, for we do not fight \nonly for the interests of Iraqis, Mr. President, we fight for ours as \nwell.\n  In this moment of serious peril for America, we must all of us \nremember to who and what we owe our first allegiance--to the security \nof the American people and to the ideals upon which we our Nation was \nfounded. That responsibility is our dearest privilege and to be judged \nby history to have discharged it honorably will, in the end, matter so \nmuch more to all of us than any fleeting glory of popular acclaim, \nelectoral advantage or office. I hope we might all have good reason to \nexpect a kinder judgment of our flaws and follies because when it \nmattered most we chose to put the interests of this great and good \nNation before our own, and helped, in our own small way, preserve for \nall humanity the magnificent and inspiring example of an assured, \nsuccessful and ever advancing America and the ideals that make us still \nthe greatest Nation on Earth.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I don't believe Senator McConnell is \ncoming.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is morning here in Washington. It is dusk \nin Baghdad. As we debate this war yet again at home, another day draws \nto a close for our troops in Iraq. Tonight they will sleep on foreign \nsand. Tomorrow they will draw yet again from an endless well of courage \nto face another day of war. Some will likely die. Many will surely be \nwounded. They will face hatred they did not create and violence they \ncannot resolve.\n  One soldier described the average day as ``being ordered into houses \nwithout knowing what was behind strangers' doors . . . walking along \nroadsides fearing the next step could trigger lethal explosives.''\n\n[[Page S11924]]\n\n  The soldier who told that story tragically took his own life while on \nhis second deployment. His name was PFC Travis Virgadamo of Las Vegas. \nTravis was 19 years old when he took his life.\n  As our troops rise in the morning, so will millions of innocent Iraqi \ncitizens. Today thousands of Iraqis will abandon their homes and \nneighborhoods to flee as refugees to Iran, Jordan, Syria, and other \ncountries. Those Iraqis who remain will face what has become the daily \nnorm of life in Iraq--water shortages, no electricity, the constant \nthreat of violence, and, as we learned today, cholera, an ancient \ndisease that has now hit the ancient land of Iraq. Remember, 1.2 \nmillion Iraqis have been killed since our military invasion. Our \n160,000 or 170,000 courageous troops and those innocent Iraqi men, \nwomen, and children will wake on the 1,646th day of this war, 1,646 \ndays and nights of war. I repeat, 1.2 million Iraqis have been killed \nsince our military invasion.\n  Here in Washington, DC, we have a choice to make minutes from now. If \nwe reject this amendment before us, this war will rage on and on, with \nno end in sight. Our troops will remain caught in the crossfire of \nanother country's civil war. Our Armed Forces will continue to be \nstrained to the breaking point. But there is a choice. There can be \nlight at the end of this long, dark tunnel. If we stand together and \nadopt this amendment, today can be known as the first day of the end of \nthis war, the first day Congress fulfills its constitutional duty to \nhave a plan to bring our soldiers and marines home. We can begin to \nreturn our troops to safety and give them the hero's welcome that has \nbeen earned and so long in coming. We can refocus our efforts on \nreaching the political solution that all experts, even the President's \nown generals, agree must be achieved. And we can return our focus to \nthe grave and growing threat we face from Osama bin Laden and his al-\nQaida network, and others, who have the will and capability to do us \nharm.\n  I stand today with my colleagues, Senators Levin and Reed, in support \nof this amendment. This is a terrific piece of legislation, legislation \nthat recognizes the duties of this separate and equal branch of \nGovernment, the legislative branch. I am grateful for the few \nRepublicans who have shown the courage to join us in a quest to end \nsuffering, sorrow, and terror. Countless words, reams of paper, and so \nmuch ink have been spent on the Iraq debate in the Senate and in the \ncountry. So let me add this morning that this amendment is a reasonable \nand responsible way forward. This amendment sets a binding path well \nwithin our constitutional authority and without compromising our \nnational security interests. This vote will come down to a question of \ncourage and wisdom.\n  President John Kennedy said:\n\n       A man does what he must--in spite of personal consequences, \n     in spite of obstacles and dangers and pressures--and that is \n     the basis of all human morality.\n\n  In just a few hours it will be sundown, beginning the holiest day of \nthe year for those of the Jewish faith, Yom Kippur. Reflecting on that, \none needs only to look at the Old Testament, the book of Job, where Job \nasks: ``But where shall wisdom be found?''\n  I say wisdom lies with the American people, a strong majority of \nDemocrats, Republicans, and Independents who so oppose this war. I hope \nwisdom is found on the Senate floor today as well; that we follow the \nwishes, the demands, the hopes, and the prayers of the American people. \nWhen our grandchildren and generations to come study this war and this \nGovernment, I pray they will be able to say this was a turning point in \na war that has cost us so much. I ask my Republican colleagues for the \ncourage and wisdom to join the American people and bring our troops \nhome. Courage and wisdom demands that we do such.\n  I ask unanimous consent to start the vote. We will make sure that \neveryone has ample time to vote. We will vote as if it started at 10.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 2898.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from California (Mrs. Boxer), \nthe Senator from Illinois (Mr. Durbin), and the Senator from Vermont \n(Mr. Sanders) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the \nSenator from Utah (Mr. Bennett), the Senator from New Mexico (Mr. \nDomenici), and the Senator from Mississippi (Mr. Lott).\n  Further, if present and voting, the Senator from New Mexico (Mr. \nDomenici), and the Senator from Mississippi (Mr. Lott) would have voted \n``nay.''\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Are there any other Senators in the \nChamber desiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 47, nays 47, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 346 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--47\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Brown\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Cardin\n     Carper\n     Casey\n     Clinton\n     Conrad\n     Dorgan\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Inouye\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Klobuchar\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lincoln\n     McCaskill\n     Menendez\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Obama\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Salazar\n     Schumer\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Stabenow\n     Tester\n     Webb\n     Whitehouse\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--47\n\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Barrasso\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burr\n     Chambliss\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Corker\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeMint\n     Dodd\n     Dole\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Isakson\n     Kyl\n     Lieberman\n     Lugar\n     Martinez\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Pryor\n     Roberts\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Thune\n     Vitter\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n\n                             NOT VOTING--6\n\n     Bennett\n     Boxer\n     Domenici\n     Durbin\n     Lott\n     Sanders\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. On this vote, the yeas are 47, the \nnays are 47. Under the previous order requiring 60 votes for the \nadoption of this amendment, the amendment is withdrawn.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote, and I move to \nlay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, Senator McCain and I have had discussions \nwith our leader, and I assume on their side, and this course of action \nhas been cleared. Here is what we are proposing to do: The Biden \namendment is going to be laid down today. There will be perhaps an hour \nor so on that amendment--perhaps more; there is no time limit on debate \ntoday. There will be no more votes today, as the leaders announced. But \non Monday, we will make an effort--let me go back. On Tuesday at 10 \no'clock, we are going to have a unanimous consent agreement that the \nBiden amendment will be voted on at 10 o'clock on Tuesday. That is \ngoing to be part of a unanimous consent agreement that is being \nprepared.\n  In addition, in terms of the Lieberman-Kyl amendment, there will be \nsome debate on that today, and on Monday, and we will make an effort to \nsee if we can't agree on a time certain on Tuesday, after the Biden \namendment is disposed of on Tuesday. But we can't commit to that now. \nWe will make a good-faith effort on Monday to set up that time on \nTuesday, after the Biden amendment is disposed of.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I think we are headed in the right \ndirection. We may have to drag that vote--not drag it but set it for \n10:15. We usually don't come in on Tuesdays until 10 o'clock, so would \n10:15 be OK?\n  Mr. BIDEN. I know this is unusual. Mr. President, if we could start \nthat at\n\n[[Page S11925]]\n\n10 and we didn't drag it, it would be better.\n  Mr. REID. I would say to my friend, on Tuesdays we don't come into \nsession until 10 o'clock. There are meetings going on in the Capitol \nand people can't be here until 10, but we could set the vote for \nshortly thereafter, 10 after or something like that, but it takes a \nlittle while.\n  Mr. BIDEN. OK. That is not a very senatorial response, but OK.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, could I say I thank Senator Levin, Senator \nReid, and Senator Biden. Senator Lieberman and Senator Kyl will be \ndiscussing their amendment, which is a very important amendment \nconcerning Iran so that everybody will have a good idea, and they will \nbe discussing it again on Monday--or debating it. I would hope, as the \ndistinguished chairman has said, that we could probably vote on the \nKyl-Lieberman amendment very shortly after the vote on the Biden \namendment, yet we are unable to put that in concrete. There may be a \nside by side, there may not be.\n  I wish to remind my colleagues again, if I could, this is the 13th \nday of debate now, and we have had 79 hours of debate on this bill. The \nWounded Warriors legislation is still waiting, the pay raise, so many \nother things that are vital to, I believe, the men and women who are \nserving and the security of this Nation. What I hope--and I know \nSenator Levin who is managing this bill would agree--is that once we \nfinish the Iraq issue, we should be able to move through the other \namendments rather quickly. We are obviously running out of time. The \nfirst of October is upon us. So I hope we can finish the Iraq \namendments as quickly as possible and move on to the 100 or so \namendments we have on the bill itself. I thank the chairman for all of \nthe cooperation and hard work he has done on this bill.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I agree with my good friend from Arizona on \nthe need to move forward. We have literally hundreds of amendments we \nare working on. At some point next week we are going to have to find a \nway to end this. We have made efforts with unanimous consent proposals \nto cut off on amendments, but they have been objected to, and then more \nflood in. We have to get to an end point.\n  However, in reference to the Wounded Warriors legislation, there is a \nseparate bill on which I think appointing conferees has been cleared on \nthis side. I am wondering if the Senator from Arizona might check with \nhis side to see whether the appointment of conferees could be cleared. \nI think it will be part of this bill at the end. It is important that \nwe move this bill for a lot of reasons, including that one.\n  But we have a fallback. We have a safety valve. We also have a \nseparate bill which we would like to get to conference, and if the \nranking member could check on the Republican side and see if we can get \nthe clearance for the appointment of conferees, it may give us some \nmomentum.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank the chairman. I agree. I will make \nevery effort to do that. I am confident that no one on this side would \nobject. It has to be done. Everyplace I go, I hear concern and the \ncontinued outrage about the situation that existed at Walter Reed, and \nthe American people are not confident that we have taken the necessary \nmeasures to provide for the care of our veterans.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Delaware is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, before I send an amendment to the desk, I \ndo not want to in any way disagree with anything that was said but \nexpand on it slightly. There is a Biden-Brownback amendment. Senator \nBrownback is a major sponsor of this amendment, and I will yield to him \nin a moment because he has a difficult scheduling dilemma. I will let \nhim go first. I also want to make it clear that Senators Boxer, Kerry, \nSpecter, probably Hutchison, and others are going to want to speak to \nthis amendment.\n  I am assuming that on Monday this will still be the pending business \nand that we will be able to continue to discuss and debate this issue, \nso Senators have time. This is an important weekend in the Jewish \nfaith, so a lot of people are not here. But I assume, notwithstanding \nthe fact that we are going to vote shortly after we convene on Tuesday \nmorning, that we will have an opportunity to speak to this on Monday as \nwell.\n  Now, today I will offer an amendment to the Defense authorization \nbill concerning U.S. policy in Iraq. As I said, I am joined by a \nbipartisan group of colleagues, including Senators Brownback, Boxer, \nSpecter, Kerry, and, I believe, Senator Hutchison. Our amendment says \nit should be the policy of the United States to support a political \nsettlement in Iraq based on the principles of federalism. I have much \nmore to say about this. Again, I thank my friend from Kansas who has \nbeen a major proponent of this approach for some time. We joined forces \ntogether months ago. He has a very tight schedule, so he will speak \nfirst. I see Senator Hutchison standing also.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I just ask the Senator, if he will \nyield briefly, is it possible that I may make a 2-minute statement \nafter Senator Brownback, and then I will come back on Monday as well?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Possibly, Senator Brownback would let the Senator from \nTexas proceed for 2 minutes now.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Yes, I will yield to the Senator from Texas before I \nspeak.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas is \nrecognized for 2 minutes.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, thank you. Monday, I will make longer \ncomments. I am a cosponsor of this amendment. I have said for a long \ntime it is my belief that if we could allow the sectors of Iraq to have \ntheir own semiautonomous government, like is now in the northern part \nwith the Kurds--and the southern part is mostly Shia--I think we could \nreally begin to see economic stability, as well as political stability.\n  Of course, we all know we should have oil revenue that would go to \nall of the people of Iraq, fairly allocated. But I think we have seen \nin Bosnia a lessening of tensions when there is a capability for the \nsecurity forces, the educational and the religious sects to have their \nown ability to govern within themselves. If we can get economic \nstability, which is largely untalked about in the United States, I \nthink that would bring the political stability along.\n  So I commend Senator Biden. I have written on this as well. Senator \nBrownback and I have talked about this in many forums. It is important \nthat we look at not only the great success we are having, which General \nPetraeus reported on, we are stabilizing the country on the security \nside. We are keeping our commitments. We are going to be able to do it \nwith fewer Americans and bring the Iraqi troops forward, but it will \nnot stabilize Iraq. We must have economic and political security. So I \nthank the chairman, and I thank Senator Brownback. I will speak again \nMonday. It is the most important sense of the Senate that we can have \non this bill. Thank you.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2997 to amendment No. 2011\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 2997.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Delaware [Mr. Biden], for himself, Mr. \n     Brownback, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Specter, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Smith, Mr. \n     Nelson of Florida, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. Schumer, Ms. Mikulski, \n     and Mrs. Lincoln, proposes an amendment number 2997.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To express the sense of Congress on federalism in Iraq)\n\n       At the end of subtitle C of title XV, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 1535. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON FEDERALISM IN IRAQ.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Iraq continues to experience a self-sustaining cycle of \n     sectarian violence.\n       (2) The ongoing sectarian violence presents a threat to \n     regional and world peace, and the long-term security \n     interests of the United States are best served by an Iraq \n     that is stable, not a haven for terrorists, and not a threat \n     to its neighbors.\n       (3) Iraqis must reach a comprehensive and sustainable \n     political settlement in order to\n\n[[Page S11926]]\n\n     achieve stability, and the failure of the Iraqis to reach \n     such a settlement is a primary cause of increasing violence \n     in Iraq.\n       (4) The Key Judgments of the January 2007 National \n     Intelligence Estimate entitled ``Prospects for Iraq's \n     Stability: A Challenging Road Ahead'' state, ``A number of \n     identifiable developments could help to reverse the negative \n     trends driving Iraq's current trajectory. They include: \n     Broader Sunni acceptance of the current political structure \n     and federalism to begin to reduce one of the major sources of \n     Iraq's instability . . . Significant concessions by Shia and \n     Kurds to create space for Sunni acceptance of federalism''.\n       (5) Article One of the Constitution of Iraq declares Iraq \n     to be a ``single, independent federal state''.\n       (6) Section Five of the Constitution of Iraq declares that \n     the ``federal system in the Republic of Iraq is made up of a \n     decentralized capital, regions, and governorates, and local \n     administrations'' and enumerates the expansive powers of \n     regions and the limited powers of the central government and \n     establishes the mechanisms for the creation of new federal \n     regions.\n       (7) The federal system created by the Constitution of Iraq \n     would give Iraqis local control over their police and certain \n     laws, including those related to employment, education, \n     religion, and marriage.\n       (8) The Constitution of Iraq recognizes the administrative \n     role of the Kurdistan Regional Government in 3 northern Iraqi \n     provinces, known also as the Kurdistan Region.\n       (9) The Kurdistan region, recognized by the Constitution of \n     Iraq, is largely stable and peaceful.\n       (10) The Iraqi Parliament approved a federalism law on \n     October 11th, 2006, which establishes procedures for the \n     creation of new federal regions and will go into effect 18 \n     months after approval.\n       (11) Iraqis recognize Baghdad as the capital of Iraq, and \n     the Constitution of Iraq stipulates that Baghdad may not \n     merge with any federal region.\n       (12) Despite their differences, Iraq's sectarian and ethnic \n     groups support the unity and territorial integrity of Iraq.\n       (13) Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki stated on \n     November 27, 2006, ``The crisis is political, and the ones \n     who can stop the cycle of aggravation and bloodletting of \n     innocents are the politicians''.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the United States should actively support a political \n     settlement among Iraq's major factions based upon the \n     provisions of the Constitution of Iraq that create a federal \n     system of government and allow for the creation of federal \n     regions;\n       (2) the active support referred to in paragraph (1) should \n     include--\n       (A) calling on the international community, including \n     countries with troops in Iraq, the permanent 5 members of the \n     United Nations Security Council, members of the Gulf \n     Cooperation Council, and Iraq's neighbors--\n       (i) to support an Iraqi political settlement based on \n     federalism;\n       (ii) to acknowledge the sovereignty and territorial \n     integrity of Iraq; and\n       (iii) to fulfill commitments for the urgent delivery of \n     significant assistance and debt relief to Iraq, especially \n     those made by the member states of the Gulf Cooperation \n     Council;\n       (B) further calling on Iraq's neighbors to pledge not to \n     intervene in or destabilize Iraq and to agree to related \n     verification mechanisms; and\n       (C) convening a conference for Iraqis to reach an agreement \n     on a comprehensive political settlement based on the creation \n     of federal regions within a united Iraq;\n       (3) the United States should urge the Government of Iraq to \n     quickly agree upon and implement a law providing for the \n     equitable distribution of oil revenues, which is a critical \n     component of a comprehensive political settlement based upon \n     federalism; and\n       (4) the steps described in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) \n     could lead to an Iraq that is stable, not a haven for \n     terrorists, and not a threat to its neighbors.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I yield to my friend from Kansas, Senator \nBrownback.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Kansas is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for that, for this \namendment, and for his insight and prophetic view of what is really \ntaking place. Senator Biden has mentioned for over a year that the \nlikely outcome in Iraq is going to be a federalism model where you have \nmost of your power in the states--the Kurdish north, the Sunni west, \nthe Shia south, and Baghdad as the federal city.\n  I think we have had, hopefully now, enough debate about the military \nsituation in Iraq. It is an important one, but we have not had much, if \nany, discussion about the political situation in Iraq. Last week, all \nthe focus was on General Petraeus, and there was another individual who \ntestified, Ambassador Crocker. General Petraeus talked about the \nmilitary situation, and Ambassador Crocker talked about the political \nsituation.\n  Regarding the military situation, I think we have seen incredible \nprogress by the dedicated men and women in uniform, but we have seen \nlittle to no political progress. This discussion is about a ``political \nsurge.'' We have had the military surge. It is moving forward and \ngetting things done and stabilizing. All it can do is provide space for \na political solution. It cannot put forward a solution that will last. \nYou have to have that politically. So what we are going to talk about \nwith this resolution is a political surge. Those are not my words; they \nare Thomas Friedman's. I think it is apt and its timing is right. I \nurge my colleagues to look at this resolution and support what this \nis--that we need a political surge, and we need to recognize the \ndemographics on the ground.\n  This resolution simply calls for the following things: A conference \nwhere Iraqis reach a political settlement based on federalism; in \neffect, an agreement on new and already constitutionally recognized \nfederal regions. This doesn't require a change in the Iraqi \nConstitution. It is already there. They allow the Kurdish north as a \nstate. This would be allowing other states within Iraq.\n  No. 2, it calls on the international community to respect the results \nof that conference and to support federalism in Iraq, which is a \nconcept we are very familiar with in the United States. I think that is \nreally the key for it to work in Iraq.\n  No. 3, it calls on the Iraqi Government to resolve the issue of \ndistributing oil revenues, which is crucial to any federal solution in \nIraq. It is the oil that will keep the whole place together.\n  I show my colleagues a map that I think is kind of interesting. It is \na map of Iraq under the Ottoman Empire. It is prior to the World War I \ndivisions in Iraq. I think we ought to study history to keep from \nrepeating past mistakes. I think we are repeating history now because \nwe have not studied it sufficiently. So here is a map from 1914. This \nis fascinating. You have the north Ottoman, which were called vilayets. \nThis is in the State of Mosul, the Kurdish north. You had the vilayet \nof Baghdad, the Sunni area in Iraq. You had the vilayet of Basra, the \nShia State. Baghdad was the federal city--a very effective city at that \nparticular time.\n  As much as a third of the population there was Jewish at that point \nin time. Those were the governing bodies within this region. The \nOttoman Empire was concerned about whether the Basra region and the \nShia there would stay with them or go with the Persians at that time. \nIt is a similar discussion we are hearing today.\n  My reason for saying this is, if you can put it in a certain term, \nthis is natural in Iraq. Instead of us trying to force together a \ncountry under Shia domination--and under the current setup all you are \never going to get is a Shia government, but it is going to be a weak \none because the Kurds are not going to agree with a strong Shia \ngovernment, nor are the Sunnis. All you can ever get is a weak Shia \ngovernment that has a lot of question marks in it from the Sunnis. They \ndon't trust the Shia, and the Shia don't trust the Sunnis. The Sunnis \nthink they ought to run the whole country, as they have for the past \ncentury. They think the Sunnis are going to come back.\n  I was in Iraq in January. I went to the north, and I was in Baghdad. \nThe Kurds are prospering, stable, growing, and investment is taking \nplace. I will show you a map later of people moving from Baghdad to the \nnorthern portion because it is stable. I was meeting with the Sunni and \nShia leaders in Baghdad. The Shia said: We could get this solved if it \nwasn't for the Sunni. The Sunni leaders would say: We could get this \nsolved if it wasn't for the Shia. The Shia leaders were saying: We \ncould get this solved if it wasn't for the Sunnis.\n  I submit to this body that we have a flawed political design that we \nare pushing currently in Baghdad. That is why we have not seen the \npolitical progress that we need to see taking place. We have done the \nmilitary surge, which has been successful. Now we need a political \nsurge. We need to send in a Jim Baker or a Condoleezza Rice to get \nthese people in a room to cut the deal to get different states, where \nyou have the power mostly residing in the states. Right now, in the \nKurdish north, they run their own military, their own police, and they \nare stable. So you allow that and you even encourage that to take \nplace. It is in the Iraqi\n\n[[Page S11927]]\n\nConstitution to allow that. That is how the Kurds got their region in \nthe first place. That is a political design that can lead to political \nstability on the ground so that we can pull our troops back.\n  This amendment says nothing about the troops. We have debated that a \nlong time--the military side. This is all about the political side \nwhere we have failed to see the progress. But it does say, if we can \nget that political solution, we should push it forward. I submit that \non the military side, if we can get some political stability in Iraq, \nwe can start to pull our troops back from patrolling.\n  Ultimately, I think you are going to see long-term U.S. military \nbases in the north, probably in the west, and around Baghdad. But they \ncan be bases where we can operate without our people being killed every \nday. As everybody in this body knows, we are still in South Korea 60 \nyears after that conflict. We are still in Bosnia 15 years after that \nconflict. We can stay--and we usually do stay--in a place a long period \nof time to provide stability, as long as our people are not getting \nkilled. Here is the design where you can stay for a long period of \ntime--because I believe we will need to stay for a long time--without \nour men and women being killed. It reflects a demographic reality on \nthe ground and the historic reality on the ground. It also recognizes \nthat Iraq needs to have a strong state, weak federal form of government \nto reflect the different groups. Iraq, in many respects, is less a \ncountry than it is three groups held together by exterior forces. The \nTurks don't want the Kurds to be a separate country in the north. The \nKurds already voted 90 percent that they want to have a separate \ncountry, but they are not pushing it today because they know they \ncannot do it at this point. So they are willing to stay within this \nsituation.\n  The Sunnis believe they should run Iraq, but they are less than 20 \npercent of the population. That is not going to happen. The Shia lack a \ncomfort that they can control the country, but they are certainly \ndominant in a particular region.\n  I wish to show an ancient map of this very same situation to give an \nanother flavor and context. Of course, under the Ottomans, it was \ncalled Mesopotamia during that period of time. Again, here is a three-\nstate solution that the Ottoman Empire put in place as a way of \nmanaging these different groups who do not agree with one another, who \ndo not get along.\n  One can say: Wait a minute, there is a lot of intermarrying, there \nare a lot of Sunni-Shia relations that are taking place and have taken \nplace over the years of being together as one country. You are trying \nto go back rather than go forward.\n  I wish to show a map of the former Yugoslavia right after Tito left \nand before some of the civil wars started in Yugoslavia because I think \nit is instructive. Here is a map of the ethnic composition before the \nwar in 1991. It is an ethnic map that shows where the Croats, the \nBosnians, and the Serbs were in this area in 1991. The reason I point \nthis out is, I was in this country in 1991. I was there the week after \nthe Slovenians voted to secede from the rest of Yugoslavia. I was in a \nconference with groups from all over the country. I couldn't tell the \ndifference between the various ethnic groups.\n  When I would look, I couldn't tell if this person was a Croat or a \nSerb or a Macedonian, this, that. I couldn't tell the difference. It \nmade no sense to me. These guys had been in a country together for \ndecades. Why wouldn't they stay together? They knew the differences. \nThey knew what happened. They knew the history. They had intermarried \nto where they had different ethnic groups who were married into the \nsame families and spread, splotched all over the country. There were \nconcentrations in different places, but over a period of, I think, 70 \nyears, under a hard dictatorial rule, under Tito, with a tough military \nand a tough intelligence apparatus, if someone got out of control, they \nwere dead or in jail--similar to Saddam Hussein in Iraq, who ran \nroughshod and people intermingled.\n  Then we started to see political leadership come forward and say: We \nSerbs have been mistreated by this group and you know what they did to \nus a century ago and you know what they did to us in this war and you \nknow what they did to us 500 years ago, and we shouldn't be treated \nthat way. We had a leader come up that hit this visceral inside note \nand started a bunch of wars, to where they sorted themselves out.\n  This is what happens after you get a group of leaders standing up and \nsaying they shouldn't treat the Croats this way, they shouldn't treat \nthe Serbs this way. We can see the purity of the map--Bosnians, Serbs, \nCroats--and by 1995--this is the Dayton peace accords--you can see what \ntakes place after that. That leader touched that visceral note about \nthis is who we are and they shouldn't treat us that way and there were \na bunch of people killed in the process as well.\n  Finally, there was enough fighting and we got a political surge in \nthe Dayton accords and made the leaders come together. We drew a line, \nBosnia-Herzegovina, in the Dayton peace agreement. We still have troops \nin this area enforcing this accord, but they are not fighting and \nkilling each other. There are still problems that take place. But this \nwas a two-state solution in one country, with the United States pushing \na political surge to take place and the United States still having \ntroops there to make sure people do not get out of line.\n  I went to Sarajevo when it started to stabilize. The place was still \nshellshocked about what had taken place. People were still saying: We \nused to live in peace; what happened here? What happened was somebody \npushed the ethnic button and it worked, and it works in too many places \nin the world, and it works in Iraq, unfortunately.\n  I wish to show a chart of what happened in Baghdad on ethnic splits \nand the movements taking place in Baghdad. This is a military chart. It \nis too busy of a chart, and there are some who dispute some of the \nmovements. I am willing to grant them that there may be others with a \nslightly different factual variation.\n  Basically, the Tigris River is in the middle. We see the Sunnis \nmoving and purifying west of the Tigris River and the Shia moving and \npurifying east of the Tigris River. These diagonal lines show \ncommunities that are going more Shia and the diagonal lines in the \nopposite direction are communities going more Sunni, and we see small \nethnic groups, small Christian populations who are either going into \nsmaller, tighter communities or going north into the Kurdish region of \nthe country.\n  This is happening now. This is what is happening now. We have heard \nabout the death squads, threats, and families forced to move taking \nplace in Baghdad. When a number of leaders push the ethnic sectarian \nbutton, it hits this inside visceral note. It is a strange concept to \nus as Americans. They come from everywhere, and we say: Can't you guys \nget along? Believe me, this is a reality in the world, and it is a big \nreality in Iraq, particularly in a place that is more three groups than \nit is one country.\n  I wish to give a caveat. The New York Times on Monday questioned the \npurity of this information, saying there are some Shia moving into \nSunni areas and there are some Sunni moving into Shia areas, and I am \nwilling to give that taking place. These are the megatrends that are \nhappening, and I don't think there is any question about it.\n  There has been a lot of death, killing with this taking place. It is \nthe same with Bosnia-Herzegovina. What I am saying is rather than \nhaving a whole bunch of people get killed from this point forward, why \ndon't we recognize the demographic realities on the ground and put this \nin a series of states where the ethnic group is running it and stop the \nkilling or certainly reduce it substantially. That is what this \namendment calls for.\n  I wish to show my colleagues some of the maps of current Iraq, to \ngive an idea. I have shown the Ottoman Empire maps. This is modern \nIraq, as far as the populations are going. We have the Sunni Kurds in \nthe north. Again, this is the most stable, growing area. When I was \nthere, there were cranes and building and investment taking place. It \nis moving forward. We have the Sunni area in the west and the Shia area \nin the south. There are areas of Sunni Arab and Shia Arab. There is a \nmix of Shia-Sunni with Baghdad in the\n\n[[Page S11928]]\n\ncenter. Again, we have three blocs who have pretty much split up. This \nis modern Iraq.\n\n  This is not a perfect solution by any means. As an American, I look \nat it as a subpar solution altogether because I think they would be \nmuch better off if they could get along and form one country and \noperate it as one country without having to give decentralization so \nmuch of the power.\n  The problem is it does not reflect the realities on the ground. The \nproblem is, too--think about Ambassador Crocker's testimony, think \nabout the GAO report on political progress and the benchmarks that the \nCongress set. Think about those because militarily--I think \n``militarily'' we have done a great job and that is where all the focus \nis. But politically we are not getting it done because we are trying to \nput a square peg in a round hole. It doesn't work. We can push a long \ntime on it and we can get some artificial setting to take place and we \ncan enforce it with our military power, but as soon as we pull back, \nthen we are going to have the same problems taking place in the region. \nThis amendment recognizes we should put a round peg in a round hole, \nand it is something we can do.\n  There was a gentleman who said something to me years ago that stuck \nwith me: If you see a straight-line border in the Middle East or \nAfrica, you ought to raise a question as to whether it reflects \ndemographic reality.\n  In the past, when different groups went into a region, whether the \nOttomans, the British, the French, or others, they were trying to \nbalance interests. They were trying to balance Hutus versus Tutsis. \nThey were trying to balance previously the Armenians and Azerbaijanis. \nSo they were always trying to get a balance of power because they \ndidn't have enough troops to maintain the country, but if it kept these \nguys off center and not after each other, they could maintain the \ncountry.\n  When you pull the colonial power off or when you pull the dictator \noff who is ruthlessness, who is willing to use military and to use his \nintelligence operation to kill people, when you pull that off, what are \nyou left with? You are left with these same groups, and they still \ndon't like each other. That is why we have to look at it this way.\n  Look at Sudan today. I can give another example: The north Arab \nMuslims with a radicalized government started by Osama bin Laden. The \nsouth is Black, primarily Christian--long conflict, 20 years of civil \nwar, millions killed. Finally, the Bush administration, to their \ncredit, was able to negotiate a Sudan peace agreement, and the southern \nSudanese will vote whether to secede. I believe they will in large \nnumbers. It will pass big, and there will be a second Sudan.\n  We now have a second genocide in Darfur. I have been to many of these \nplaces. I have worked with many of these people. The west is Black \nMuslim. The capital is Arab Muslim. They don't get along. One is a \ngroup of herders and another is a group of farmers--farmers and \nranchers not getting along. I think we are going to see ultimately that \nDarfur will break away.\n  Sudan is the biggest country in Africa landmasswise, but when the \nBrits put it together, they put several groups together who don't agree \nwith each other and don't get along and the Government favors one. They \nfavor the herders in Darfur; the jingaweit, the Arab Muslims. They are \ntrying to drive the farmers off the land, and they are in their second \ngenocide, with 400,000 people killed, because somebody, again, hit the \nethnic-sectarian button, and it is very effective. One can motivate a \nlot of people by hitting that button.\n  Why do we have to kill all the people to get to a political solution? \nWhy do so many people have to die? It is past time--the military \ndiscussion has been a good discussion, but it is time for us to look at \nthe political situation in Iraq and get on a model that can actually \nproduce long-term stability so we can pull our military back into \nbases. We are going to need to be there for a long period of time. This \nresolution does nothing on the military side, but I think we are going \nto need to be there for some period of time. We need to be in the north \nto assure the Turks that the Kurds are not going to try to separate \ninto a separate country, and I think we need to be there to protect the \nKurds from Iran, and somewhat from the Turks, and the Sunnis will ask \nus for a long-term military presence in the west to protect them from \nthe Shia. I think the Saudis are going to push for that to take place.\n  Again, Iraq is a lot more three groups held together by exterior \nforces than it is a country. But that is the reality. The Shia area has \nto sort out who is going to be the leaders in that country, and they \nare fighting amongst themselves. It may be more than three states. It \nmay be a couple of Shia states will evolve. We shouldn't stop that from \ntaking place if that is the natural reality.\n  We can fight against these things in nature or we can recognize them \nand try to build political systems around them. This resolution urges \nus to build the political solutions around them.\n  Again, the political surge, led by Jim Baker, of stature, or \nCondoleezza Rice--cut the deal, get us into a political solution that \ncan produce the benchmarks we want so we can pull our troops back and \nstop getting killed.\n  I urge my colleagues to look at this amendment. I urge my colleagues \nto look at the history of what we are dealing with. There are many \npapers that have been written on this issue. O'Hanlon is one of the \nlead authors on it who got back recently. This is something that can \nwork, can make progress and move us forward.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, as my friend from Kansas leaves, let me \njust thank him for his leadership here and his insight. I think he and \nI would agree that this is forming critical mass. Every once in a while \nin American politics, on a major issue, there is an idea that \ntranscends both sides of this aisle and transcends from the experts to \nthe average people because there is a commonsense ingredient to it as \nwell as a deeper insightful notion of how that part of the world works. \nThis is one of those issues.\n  I just wanted to say I am honored to be joined by Senator Brownback \nin this effort because he and I both have other agendas in terms of our \npolitical careers, but I think we both agree getting this right is more \nimportant than who is President of the United States of America. This \nis about life and death and about whether we are going to have a \ngeneration of difficulty for America in that part of the world or \nwhether we are going to be able to ultimately leave and not leave chaos \nbehind.\n  So I thank my friend for doing what I am sure was not an easy thing \nto do as a Presidential candidate on the Republican side--to join with \na Democrat to move what at the time we moved it was still a very \ncontroversial idea.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, if my colleague will yield, I wish to \nthank my colleague also for working on this and for leading when it was \na lonely battle. He was talking about this over a year ago, and I was \nhearing him saying it and thinking, he is probably right, but that is \nnot the way we are headed. And it probably doesn't help him, running \nfor President, to be associated with me, and it doesn't particularly \nhelp me, Senator Biden, to be associated with you. But that is exactly \nwhy the country gets mad, because they do not see us doing things like \nthis on something that really makes sense.\n  I talk a lot about this on the campaign trail, running for President \non the Republican side, and people look at it, and I don't think I have \nhad even one or two people come up to me and say they disagree with it. \nMost people say: OK, that makes sense. And when you talk with the \nSunnis and Shias and particularly with the Kurds, they all say yes, and \nparticularly the Kurds do. The Sunnis are coming more and more around \nto it, and I think the Shias are recognizing it as well.\n  But my best successes on this floor have come when I have associated \nwith somebody on the other side who disagrees with me on a lot of \npolitical\n\n[[Page S11929]]\n\nissues but we look at this one together and we say: This is something \nwhich can work. We did that with Senator Wellstone on human \ntrafficking. We were as different as could be on different issues, but \nwe got that one done, and today there are fewer people being \ntrafficked.\n  This is something which can work, and I appreciate my colleague for \nleading on it, and I really hope the rest of the body can look at this \nand say: This is where we have not seen progress, is politically, and \nlet's get this moving forward. I am delighted at the Senator's \nleadership on it.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following my remarks, \nSenator Lugar be recognized for up to 30 minutes and that Senator \nKennedy then be recognized to speak as in morning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, to alert my colleagues, I will take \nsomewhere between 20 and 30 minutes to speak on this issue this \nmorning, and I will speak on it again prior to our finally voting on it \non Tuesday.\n  Look, as I said, I have been a Senator since I was 29 years old. I \nhave been here for seven Presidents, and I have observed that \nsometimes, on issues relating to national crises, whether it be \ndomestic or foreign, events conspire to generate the kind of support \nfor an idea that when it was first offered had few adherents. I think \nwe are approaching that now.\n  The amendment Senators Brownback, Boxer, Specter, Kerry, and I, as \nwell as Senator Hutchison and others have says that U.S. policy should \nsupport a political settlement in Iraq based on the principles of \nfederalism. Look, for all the division in Washington and across the \ncountry over the policy in Iraq, one thing just about everyone accepts, \nliterally--left, right, center, the President, the Congress, the \nAmerican people, and the so-called experts--is that there is no \nmilitary solution in Iraq. Let me say that again. There is no military \nsolution in Iraq.\n  I, along with Senator McCain--in fact, shortly after the war began--\nsaid that I thought it was foolish to start this war. But once we \nstarted it, I thought: My Lord, we should have more American forces \nthere. I argued for up to 100,000 more American forces in the first \nyear so things would not get out of hand. I argued we needed 5,900 \nGendarme paramilitary police from the international community. The \nEuropeans were prepared to participate to literally restore order--make \nsure people didn't run the traffic lights or break into museums or \nengage in thuggery and robbery and crimes of ordinary violence, having \nnothing to do with sectarian divides. But we have passed that point.\n  To paraphrase General Petraeus, although he doesn't seem to be as \nadherent to his original comment, and he was paraphrasing someone \nelse--I believe it was 3 or 4 years ago when we were in Iraq with him, \nand I am looking over my shoulder at my staff generally; at the time I \nthink it was 3 years ago--he said, and I am paraphrasing, there comes a \npoint in every liberation where it becomes an occupation. There comes a \npoint in every liberation effort where it becomes an occupation. And we \nhave reached that point. We reached that point 3 years ago. I argued we \nreached that point when we went in.\n\n  We had one brief, brief moment where, having mistakenly moved when we \ndid, in my view, had we acted more responsibly instead of out of the \narrogance and hubris that existed, we might, we might have been able to \nchange the dynamic drastically. But that has long passed. That has long \npassed.\n  I guess the point I want to make, again, and the end result of all I \nam saying here is you will not find a single person who thinks that a \nmilitary solution will work alone. So what we are all about here today \nis what everybody says: OK, there has to be a political solution, but \nliterally, I say to you, Mr. President, up to this moment no one on the \nfloor of the Senate has offered a political solution. I mean, it is \nreally fundamental. There is nobody who has said: We all acknowledge \nthere is no military solution. And by the way, I am not claiming I am \nthe only one. I have many cosponsors. We have a lot of people now \nsaying: OK, we acknowledge there is a need for a political solution, \nembedded in the notion I have been pushing for a couple of years now \nand in detail for the last year and a half or so with Les Gelb.\n  I have to recognize Les Gelb, a former administration official in a \nDemocratic administration, in the Carter administration, the president \nemeritus of the New York Council on Foreign Relations, an incredibly \nrespected voice in American foreign policy, and thought of as a genuine \nscholar. Les and I started off not in full agreement of what that \npolitical solution was, but we were all on the same page. The end \nresult of all this is that the underlying premise of Les Gelb and Joe \nBiden in generating this was that the political solution we are \nproposing, which is what the Iraqi Constitution essentially calls for--\nand it is not partition--is federalism.\n  Well, guess what. It is not going to happen spontaneously. The Iraqis \naren't going to spontaneously decide in the midst of what is now a \ncivil war and sectarian strife that they know how to do it on their \nown.\n  So getting back to the political question, everyone says there is a \nneed for a political solution. But that begs the question, So what is \nyour political solution?\n  The critics, and there is legitimate criticism of the Biden-Gelb \nplan, but the critics have come along and said: I don't like your plan, \nBiden. My response has been from the outset: If you don't like mine, \nwhat is yours? Think about it. Think about, as you consider whether the \nBiden-Brownback plan, which is essentially taking Biden-Gelb and \nputting it into an amendment to the Defense authorization bill--think \nabout what it says. We say this is our political solution. This is what \nwe think is the way out.\n  So as I began this debate, my invitation to my colleagues was: I get \nit. You may not like all parts of it. You may not like it. You may \nthink it is mostly correct. You may be able to legitimately point out \nthere are weaknesses in it; things may or may not happen. I can't \nguarantee an outcome to this. But I would like you to think about it. \nIf you don't like Biden's proposal, what is your idea?\n  Up to now, a lot of us have had what we voted on just a moment ago. \nIt started off as the Biden-Hagel-Levin amendment back in January and \nFebruary. I agree with it totally. It is now Levin-Reed. I think it is \na good amendment. It is essentially the same one we voted on twice \nbefore. I was the author of it, along with my friend from Michigan, the \nleader of the Armed Services Committee. But the truth is, it is not a \npolitical solution. It is an important tactic to reach the point we all \nwant to reach.\n  And what is that? When you cut through all of this, what is it the \nAmerican people, what is it all my colleagues, all 100 of us, want? No \none wants to keep American forces there, with almost 3,800 dead, close \nto 28,000 wounded, roughly 14,000 severely wounded and who are going to \nrequire medical attention and care the rest of their lives. No one in \nhere wants that. If we could wave a wand, there is not a single Member, \nfrom the most conservative to the most liberal in this body, who \nwouldn't take every troop out if they could, tomorrow. We don't want \nour kids going. I don't want my son going, my daughter going. I don't \nwant my grandkids going, either.\n  What is recognized underneath all of this is there is a clear \nunderstanding that even though most of us on this side of the aisle \nopposed what the President did and how he did it, there is a \nrecognition that it matters what we leave behind. It matters a whole \nbunch. It matters for our grandchildren. It matters for our children.\n  Look, folks, there is an overwhelming desire. I live with a woman I \nadore. We have been married for 30 years. She is unalterably opposed to \nthis war. She, like every mother, lives in fear that her son, who is a \ncaptain in the Army, is going to be sent over, which is probable. So \nher fervent wish every time I go home is: Joe, get them out of there. \nGet them out of there. You are chairman of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee; get them out of there. Well, the truth is, the vast majority \nof the people know that getting\n\n[[Page S11930]]\n\nout of this is almost as difficult as the problems the President caused \nby getting us into it.\n  I know I am speaking colloquially here. I am not speaking in \nsenatorial tones. But this is basic stuff.\n  My two staff members sitting to my left--and I admire the devil out \nof them--have accompanied me on eight trips to Iraq. The last time \ncoming home, we were all supposed to get on an aircraft, but only one \nof them did, a C-130 that was supposed to take us home. Ambassador \nCrocker asked whether I would fly to Germany with him on his way home. \nHe was coming to testify. He thought it would give us a chance to talk. \nAnd so I did. Actually, I flew out of Iraq into Kuwait with him to \ncatch a commercial flight. The C-130 cargo plane I was supposed to get \non--we got word there were six fallen angels on that plane. Six fallen \nangels.\n  That is what these tough, courageous, brave, hard Marines, Army, \nNavy, some of whom are there, et cetera, Air Force, call a dead \nAmerican soldier whose body is coming home. They call them fallen \nangels.\n  You see these guys also who you know have been shot at and shot back, \ninjured and injured others--it is such an emotional phase, to hear them \ntalk in hushed tones, to treat every one of those coffins that gets put \non board the C-130--every one of which comes through my State in Dover, \nDelaware--to hear these people, these fighting men and women, treat \nevery single solitary death with the reverence it deserves. The \nAmerican people would be stunned. They would be proud. They would be \nsad and they would be concerned. So they put six fallen angels on a \nplane.\n  The President of the United States a couple of days later--and I was \nthere 2 weeks ago--a week ago--went on television and told the American \npeople what great military progress we are making. But what he said \nwas: I have no plan to end this war. I have no plan to win this war. I \nhave a plan, as one of the press people said--it is not my line--he \nsaid: The American people are using the American forces as a cork in \nthe bottle to keep the venom from spreading out beyond the borders in a \nregional war.\n  I am not prepared to use my son and his generation as a cork in a \nbottle. The American people are not prepared to do that either.\n  So what do we do? What do we do? Do we cut off funding? Talk about a \nhollow reed. How do you do that? How do you cut off funding for the \n166,000 troops? Even if we ordered everyone home tomorrow, they have to \nget out of that country. Do you not provide them with the mine-\nresistant vehicles that can increase their life expectancy, when hit \nwith a roadside bomb, by 80 percent? Do you not provide them with that? \nDo we cut that off? I don't know how you do that.\n  Some things are worth losing elections over. I am not going to do \nthat. So what do you do? Do you draw down troops on an orderly basis \nwhile you are protecting them? Yes. But where does that get you at the \nend of the day?\n  The good news is they are out. There are fewer fallen angels. But the \nbad news is how many angels will fall in the next 10 years or 15 years, \nif this war metastasizes into the region. Because, ironically, the \nPresident's policy, which is dead wrong, has one truism about it: Chaos \nin Iraq will have regional consequences. The irony is, it is his policy \nthat is causing the chaos.\n  Getting back to the point of the amendment, so everybody understands \nthe context in which this is being offered, it is being offered to say: \nLook, there is a way to do all of this. There is a way to reduce the \nnumber of fallen angels. There is a way to reduce the injuries and \ncasualties. There is a way to reduce the number of deaths among the \nIraqis. There is a way to keep this war from metastasizing. There is a \nway that we have, a last chance we have, to leave and not run the risk \nof having to send my grandson back. My grandson is a toddler.\n  We have been faced in this body with two false arguments. One is more \nof the same and it will get better, and the other is leave and hope for \nthe best.\n  Again, I get back to the central premise to what I have been \nproposing. There is a need for a political rationale. What is the \npolitical rationale supposed to accomplish? It is a way--nothing is \ngoing to get better. We must leave, by the way. Come hell or high \nwater, we must leave. But are we going to leave giving the Iraqis a \nchance that they can end up with a political agreement among \nthemselves? For what purpose is the political agreement? To stop the \ncivil war. That is it in a nutshell. Anybody who denies this is a \nsectarian war I think is denying reality.\n  The President--as my mother would say, God love him--keeps talking \nabout al-Qaida. Al-Qaida is a problem. I would argue it is a Bush-\nfulfilling prophecy, al-Qaida in Iraq. But there is even in the \nmilitary--as my good friend--and I admire the devil out of him, my \nfriend from Virginia--as he points out, he knows when you go to Iraq, \nthe military refers to al-Qaida of Mesopotamia; al-Qaida in Iraq. They \nare making a distinction by that, between al-Qaida in Iraq and al-Qaida \nin Afghanistan, al-Qaida in Pakistan. As I said to the President in one \nof my trips back, in a debriefing--which my friend knows we do. The \nPresident has us down and has his war cabinet and asks us--you know, we \ngive our view.\n  He was telling me about freedom being on the march. I said: With all \ndue respect, Mr. President, if every single solitary jihadi in the \nworld were killed tomorrow--I said if the Lord Almighty came down and \nsat at the middle of this table--we were in the Roosevelt Room--and \nlooked at you and said, Mr. President, I guarantee there is not one \nsingle al-Qaida person living in the world, Mr. President, you still \nhave a massive war on your hands. You have a massive war on your hands.\n  I see my friend from Virginia is standing. I will be happy to yield \nto him.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, as I have looked back on my years here, \none of the chapters I have enjoyed the most is the debates we have had \ntogether, and this is not in the nature of a debate, Mr. President, but \nI do ask the Senator who now--in your current capacity and your long \nexperience in foreign relations, you probably have a better grip than \nmost of us as to the likelihood--and you mentioned it--of the political \nreconciliation taking place in Iraq. I am talking about the top down, \nnot the smaller, but little things that happened in Al Anbar--which are \nvery positive, but I don't think you can grow political reconciliation \nall the way from the bottom up. It has to come from the top down.\n  Our good friend here, Senator Levin, and I were there in Iraq a few \nweeks ago and we could not find any basis for projecting when that \nmight come to pass. That is the very thing that underpins the entire \npolicy we are pursuing. Because we all acknowledge a military solution \nis not there. It has to be a political reconciliation from the top \ndown--albeit to get some form of unity government--maybe an adaptation \nof what the Senator is now advocating. But what is the Senator's \nprojection of the likelihood of that occurring?\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. I will be happy to respond because my friend, as usual, \ngets to the crux of the issue.\n  Here is the way I look at it. I will try to break these things out. \nMy friend Senator Lugar, whom I think is the most informed man in the \nCongress on foreign policy, is used to my colloquial ways of expressing \nthings so he will probably understand me better than most because he \nhad to deal with me for 30 years-plus. I try to devolve this, to use a \nWashington word, into sort of big chunks. You basically have two \noptions here.\n  No. 1, do you continue with a policy that was well intended by our \nGovernment, the President, the administration, of attempting to \nestablish a strong central democratic government in Baghdad that in \nfact has the capacity to gain the faith and trust of the Sunni, Shia, \nand Kurds so that they will entrust to that central government their \nwell-being, in terms of security, in terms of economic growth, and in \nterms of political reconciliation or do you have to reach a point that \nI have reached, and reached some time ago, of recognizing that is a \nbridge too far; that the only way in which you will be able to stop the \nwarring factions from killing each other is essentially give them some \nbreathing room under their federal Constitution which says--I am \nquoting from their Constitution: The Republic of Iraq is a single, \nindependent, federal state.\n  What I look back to, I say to my friend from Virginia, is this can't \nbe\n\n[[Page S11931]]\n\nbuilt up from the village up. I acknowledge the requirement that the \nleaders of the Sunnis and the Shia and the Kurds--and there are \nmultiple claimants to that leadership; I know my friend knows that--\nthose claimants have to conclude their self-interest is better realized \nin a federal system. The Kurds have clearly recognized that. The Kurds \nmade it clear when Senator Hagel and I got smuggled into Irbil, back \nbefore the war began, that they weren't in on any deal that wasn't a \nfederal system giving them pretty significant autonomy.\n  The Shia have now reached that conclusion themselves, with notable \nexceptions--Sadr being one of them. But, for example, the Vice \nPresident--the Shia Vice President of the, for lack of a phrase I will \ncall the central government the existing government--is totally \nsupportive of what I am proposing and he said so publicly and said so \nat this conference in Ramadi which I attended a few weeks ago.\n  The Sunnis up to now have been the odd folks out because they look at \nit, as my friend clearly knows, and they say: Look, we live in this \nplace called Anbar Province, the majority of us. We don't have much out \nhere but rock and shale. There is not much else out here. All the oil \nis in the north and all the oil is in the south and if you have \nregional governments and the oil is controlled by the north and the \nsouth, we don't get anything.\n  But here is what has happened. There is a bit of, as we Catholics \nsay, an epiphany occurring. I will tell my friend in confidence who it \nis but I don't want to publicly--he is an Iraqi leader who is one of \nthe leading Sunni leaders in the country, who used the following quote \nwith me in the 4 hours we were together in Ramadi.\n  He said--I am paraphrasing the first part--I initially disagreed with \nyour plan. Now I am quoting.\n\n       There has been a struggle I have had between my heart and \n     my head. My heart has told me up to now that we Sunnis could \n     play a major role in governing this country again, from the \n     center. My head tells me that will not happen anytime soon \n     and our fate lies in a regional system. But we need access to \n     resources.\n\n  He said:\n\n       But don't quote me yet, Senator, because I have to work on \n     my fellow tribal leaders out here, and others.\n\n  Look what is happening with the Turks. The Turks initially were \nabsolutely opposed to this. But as they have begun to figure it out, \nthey realize that if we continue on the path we are on, American \npatience with keeping the cork in the bottle is not going to be \nsustained for the next 2 years and that when we leave, absent a \npolitical settlement, there will be not a splitting of Iraq into three \nparts, there will be a fracture of Iraq into multiple parts. But guess \nwhat they figured out. Kurdistan will become a de facto independent \ncountry. They will be able to say in Kurdistan: Hey, we didn't do this. \nThere was nobody to deal with. And they have all of a sudden begun to \nunderstand that it is bad enough, from the Turkish standpoint to have a \nquasi-independent--and it is not even that--region called Kurdistan, \nwithin defined borders of a country called Iraq; it is a very different \nthing to have a quasi-independent Kurdistan, when you have 4 million \nKurds sitting in their eastern mountains.\n  So all of a sudden they are figuring this out. ``Figuring out'' \nsounds derogatory, and I do not mean it that way. They are looking at \ntheir alternatives and saying: OK, a federal system in an Iraq that is \nunited is a whole lot better than a de facto independent state.\n  The Iranians. The Iranians have a dilemma. The Iranians have at least \nfive major militia forces among the Shia of Iraq. Some they like, some \nthey do not like. As my friend from Indiana knows, you have a group \ndown around Basra, as the British are pulling out, who are organized \npretty well.\n  As the British two-star said to me: They are like Mafia dons waiting \nfor us to leave to see who claims the territory--who actually argued \nthat Basra should be an independent country because they have access to \nthe gulf, they have oil, and they have four provinces they can put \ntogether.\n  Well, guess what. That is not very well regarded by the Badr Brigade, \nfolks, and Sadr is going: Whoa, whoa, wait a minute.\n  So this creates a dilemma. The splintering of Iraq creates a dilemma \nfor even the Iranians who do not want to do us any favors at all. The \ngeneric point I am making is, as time has passed, and I will use Bosnia \nas an example, when we first started off talking about what, in \nessence, became of the Dayton Peace Accords, you did not have any \ntakers. And it only got to the point where you had the Croats and the \nSerbs concluding they could not dominate. They could not control \nBosnia-Herzegovina.\n  That is when they all began to think, you know, the blood and \ntreasure that was--exceedingly what has happened, once they got to the \npoint where they realized the gun was not going to get their solution, \nthey became, very reluctantly, but they became much more acclimated to \nthe notion of what the Dayton Peace Accords did.\n  The bottom line is, asking me that question a year ago, I would not \nhave said to you that internally the leaders among the Shia, the Kurds, \nand the Sunnis will be more inclined to accept this, but they are \nbecause reality has set in. The Kurds have figured out they cannot and \ndo not want to be totally independent because the Turks will take them \nout.\n  The Shia have figured out, generically, the leadership, that they may \nhave 62 percent of the population or thereabouts and control the \npolitical apparatus, but they cannot stop their mosques from being \nblown up. They cannot physically control the country. And the Sunnis \nhave figured out that they are not going to run the country again in \nthe near term. So it is a little bit like coming face to face with the \nreality of one circumstance.\n  As I said at the outset to my friend, a lot of this relates to people \narriving at this conclusion, even in Iraq, by default. The Sunnis would \nmuch rather dominate the country again. The Shia would much rather keep \nthe Sunnis out, as Maliki in his heart would like to do, but he cannot \nbecause he cannot control them.\n  The Kurds would love to be independent totally but for the fact that \nthey understand it may be their very demise. So reality is sinking in. \nThe larger point, I say to my friend from Virginia is this: The dilemma \nI hear, and I hear it from my Democratic colleagues, I imagine I will \nhear it from some of my Republican colleagues, and it is legitimate. \nThey say: Biden, we cannot force a political solution any more than we \ncan force a military solution.\n  Well, I would argue that it is true we have lost our credibility to \nbe able to do what I believe we could have done 5 years ago or 4 years \nago. But that is why part of this amendment calls for \ninternationalizing the political solution.\n  I know my friend from Indiana believes, whether it is the same \nobjective, that there is an overwhelming necessity to engage major \npowers in the world, to engage regional powers so that, as he says, \nthere are fora; every single day they are sitting down rubbing \nshoulders trying to figure out an accommodation.\n  It cannot be done in the abstract. It cannot be done by President \nLugar sitting in the White House dealing with Maliki sitting in \nBaghdad. It cannot be done by bringing in the regional players in Sharm \nEl Sheikh, with us convening it and thinking that will get it done. It \nrequires something heavier, deeper, more substantial because one of the \nthings that will get people's attention, that will get the attention of \nthe Sunni leaders and Shia leaders and Kurdish leaders, the \ninternational community led by the major five powers, is if the \nSecurity Council says: Hey, look, we are gathering up the team--Iran, \nTurkey, Saudi Arabia, et cetera, et cetera--and here is what we think \nyour constitution says, and this is what we are prepared to support.\n  What that does, that not only has implied sticks, it has significant \ncarrots. Significant carrots. That organizational structure can say: \nWe, from the outset, will be the guarantors that none of the regional \npowers will conclude they must be involved militarily or in a \ndisruptive fashion because the truth is, what I try to do is think of \nmyself as, OK, I am a real bad guy, Iranian leader who hates the United \nStates.\n  What benefits me the most? What benefits me the most is occupying 10 \nof our 12 divisions in Iraq posing no\n\n[[Page S11932]]\n\nthreat to them, seeing American blood and treasure spilled. But what I \ndo not want to see is America, notwithstanding all of the bravado of \nAhmadinejad, that: We will fill the vacuum; we, the Iranians, will fill \nthe vacuum. That is not a vacuum they are looking to fill. If they \ncould fill it, they would. But their ability to fill that vacuum is \nmarginal at best. Their influence is degraded when there is continuing \nsectarian violence. It diminishes in the context of an international \nsettlement.\n  So the truth is, it requires the national leadership to agree on a \nregional solution. A national leadership will be unable, in the \nlifetime of any one of us on this floor, to agree to a \ncentral solution; a unity government from the capital city of Baghdad, \nhaving military and police authority over the entire country.\n\n  Can anyone imagine the possibility, even the possibility, that you \nwill see a Shia-dominated police force patrolling in Fallujah? As the \nold joke goes, raise your hand if there is a remote possibility of \nthat.\n  Already you cannot send into what is now Kurdistan, three \ngovernments, you are not even allowed to fly the Iraqi flag without \npermission. You cannot send the Iraqi Army there without their \npermission. You cannot send any national police force there without \ntheir permission.\n  So what makes us think there is anything--let me make an analogy for \nyou. When Washington accepted the surrender documents signed by \nCornwallis at the end of our Revolutionary War, I say to my friends \nfrom Virginia and Massachusetts, what chance do you think there would \nhave been if we had to vote within 6 months on the Constitution that \nwas ratified in Philadelphia?\n  Do you think Massachusetts and Virginia would be in the same country? \nI respectfully suggest, from a historical standpoint, you would not be. \nSo what did we do? We did what I am proposing. You essentially set up \nArticles of Confederation.\n  You said: We are going to let Massachusetts and Delaware, the first \nState, Massachusetts, and Delaware and New Jersey and Virginia, have \nconsiderable autonomy. There was no President. There was a Continental \nCongress, a decentralized federal system.\n  It took us 13 years to get to our Philadelphia moment. Wherein does \nthe arrogance emanate from that we think by putting 160,000 troops in \nIraq, we can, over a 4-year period, in a country that was made by the \nstroke of a diplomat's pen, where France and Britain divided up the \nspoils of the Ottoman Empire, what makes us think that we can expect \nthem to do something that we were unable to do? So, folks, this is \npretty basic stuff. I know everybody knows that. I am beginning to \nsound like I am lecturing. I do not mean to do that. This is pretty \nsimplistic in a sense; it is not rocket science.\n  Mr. WARNER. If I can interrupt my good friend, the central issue is, \nwe are losing, as you pointed out, our greatest national treasure: our \nyouth, killed and wounded. How much longer? You are talking about \nindefinite periods of time. What do we do now by which to give a \ngreater measure of protection to them while this process that you \nindicated is very slow can evolve, and what pressures are we going to \nput on the greater international community, the top five, to do what \nyou have defined?\n  Mr. BIDEN. I say to my friend: Ask. Let me give you an example. I \nwill be concrete. It is like pushing an open door. I asked for a \nmeeting, I say to my friend, in the tradition of Senator Lugar when he \nwas chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee.\n  I asked for a meeting, a private meeting with the Permanent Five of \nthe Security Council, who, as my good friend knows, is: China, Russia, \nEngland, France, and the United States.\n  All five of those Ambassadors, including our own, Khalilzad, agreed \nto meet with me and two other members of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee privately 5 weeks ago--on Monday I think it was 5 weeks ago. \nWe sat in a conference room overlooking the East River for about an \nhour and a half.\n  I asked the question to all five, including our Ambassador. I said: \nWhat would you do, gentlemen--one lady; the British Ambassador is a \nwoman. I said: What would you do, gentleman and lady, if the President \nof the United States asked each of your countries to participate in \nconvening an international conference on Iraq?\n  One of the Ambassadors--since this was a private meeting I will not \nname him--said: Senator, I would ask your President: What took you so \nlong to ask?\n  Then I can refer to the French Ambassador. The French Ambassador \npointed out that there is an inevitability of us leaving. And if, in \nfact, we leave a shattered Iraq, his country is in trouble. Remember, \nlast August we were reading about automobiles being torched from \nMarseilles to Normandy. Why? Over head scarves. Between 10 and 14 \npercent of the French population is Muslim. The last thing the French \nneed is a radicalized, cannibalized Iraq. It went on from there.\n\n  My point is, the President--I promise you--has not asked. He has not \nasked. I think my friend from Indiana knows, at least indirectly--\nbecause Ambassador Khalilzad, I believe, spoke to him; he was there \nwith me--there is a consensus among many in the administration to ask, \nbut there is still this overwhelming reluctance that we don't need \nanybody's help; we can do it. Let me tell you, that is a vanity which \nis a burden, a significant burden.\n  There are three things we should be doing immediately. And I know we \nhave a disagreement on this, in my view, redefining the mission of \nAmericans who are there being killed and wounded. We are not going to \nsettle this civil war by remaining on the faultlines. It is not going \nto happen. Even to totally quell it, you know--as a military expert, I \ndefer to you--we don't have enough troops with the surge. If you have \n500,000 troops, you could sit on the faultlines. It wouldn't solve the \nproblem, but you could send it underground. But we don't. I wouldn't \neven advise it if we did because there is no underlying political \nrationale.\n  My point is, redefine the mission. Were I President today, which is a \npresumptuous thing to say, I would be doing exactly what General Jones \nrecommended. I would be pulling back to the borders. I would be dealing \nwith force protection. I would be focusing on al-Qaida of Mesopotamia. \nI would be focusing on training Iraqi forces. I would not be focused on \ngoing door to door in Sunni or Shia neighborhoods in a city of 6.2 \nmillion people. I would not have an American convoy traveling the \nstreets with roadside bombs being blown up.\n  The second thing we need to do, but it is not required to support \nthis amendment, there is an incentive to the world, to the region, and \nto the recalcitrant leadership in Baghdad to say: Hey guys, we are \ndrawing down. For the mission I just stated--and I defer to my friend--\nyou don't need 160,000 troops for the Jones mission, for lack of a \nbetter way of phrasing. You need closer to 50,000. Guess what. That is \ngoing to get the attention, as my friend Carl Levin has been saying for \nsome time, of the Iraqis. They may have their altar call. I am not \ncounting on it, but they may.\n  The third thing we should be doing is, if you look at the David \nIgnatius piece in the Post today, what Senator Lugar and I and others \nand maybe my friend from Virginia have been talking about for 4 years--\nwe talked about it before we went in. Who is talking to the tribal \nchiefs? Who is talking to the local folks? Who is engaging them? What \nare we finding out now? Just read the Ignatius piece. All of a sudden, \nit is like, my goodness, maybe we should be talking to these guys. So \nhere is the deal. When you get to this, you say: Look, here is what \nyour Constitution says, and here is what you voted on in your \nParliament to implement articles 15, 16, 17 and 18, which allows you to \nbecome a region, essentially a state like the United States. Write your \nown Constitution. It can't supersede the federal one. Allow you to own \nyour local security.\n  Why is it working in Anbar to the extent it is? It is working because \nwe said: Look, we promise you, tribal leaders, nobody is going to send \nanyone from Baghdad for you. There ain't going to be any Kurds or \nSunnis in here. You set up your own police force. Cut through all the \ndiplomatic jargon. That is what we did. That is it. Guess what. Once we \ndid that, the tribal sheiks whistled and said: Boys, you can join. They \nhad 10,000 people show up\n\n[[Page S11933]]\n\nwho wanted to be cops or police. Why? Because Sunnis were going to be \nguarding Sunnis.\n  So this stuff about political movement is a joke. Not a joke--that is \nthe wrong way to say it. It is a fiction. There is nothing unity about \nthat.\n  I sat next to Abdul Sattar for 2 hours, the guy who got blown up last \nThursday, the tribal sheikh who led the insurrection against al-Qaida \nMesopotamia, told me how safe everything was in Ramadi. They land me \nand my staff and the Senator from Arkansas in a Blackhawk helicopter \nwith two Cobra gunships. We go inside the city. We are told how safe it \nis. I can walk down the street; that is true. We have a sandstorm. I \nsay: No helicopters coming. Can you drive to Baghdad? No, no, no. It \nain't that safe. Then 7 days later I get a call from a reporter from \nthe Washington Post: Senator, didn't you spend a lot of time with the \nsame tribal chief the President was with at the airbase? I said: Yes. \nIn this safe city that he runs, with an American tank sitting in front \nof his house, with bodyguards, he got blown to smithereens.\n  The generic point I am making here is the idea that somehow we are \ngoing to be able to negotiate these faultlines is beyond our ability. \nBut it is possible, working with Sunni, Shia, Kurd, we may be able to \naugment their physical security as they make this transition.\n  What did we do in Dayton? It is not precisely analogous, but it is \nanalogous. There was more sectarian violence from Vlad the Impaler to \nMilosevic than in 5,000 years of history of what we now call Iraq. That \nis a fact. That is a historical fact. What did we do? As my friend from \nIndiana knows, I was deeply involved in pressuring President Clinton \nfrom 1993 on to take action in the Balkans. What did we finally do in \nDayton in a bipartisan way? We called in Russia, the European powers. \nWe then brought in the Serbs, Milosevic, the Croats, Tudjman--who, as \nmy friend knows, was no box of chocolates--and Izetbegovic. We got them \nall in one room. We essentially locked the door. We said: Figure it \nout, folks.\n\n  What did they figure out? Separate the parties. Even I was a little \nconcerned about the Republika Srpska within Bosnia. What did we do? We \nsaid: Your militia can now become your police force. That is, in \nessence, what we did. We said to the Croats and the Bosnians, who were \nMuslims: You have to coexist in this other place. This place called \nSarajevo is going to be a capital city, but it ain't going to govern \nthe whole country in the way in which the capital of Washington, DC, \nhas influence over the rest of America.\n  Guess what. To truncate this, the West has had an average of roughly \n20,000 troops there for 10 years. What has been the result? Knock on \nwood--not one has been killed, not one has been shot dead. The ethnic \ncleansing has stopped. What are they doing now? Attempting to amend \ntheir Constitution to become part of Europe.\n  I asked my staff to go back. I said: Tell me how the repatriation is \ngoing on. People are returning. Of the 2.2 million refugees in Bosnia, \ninternal or external, 1.1 million have returned to their homes. Almost \nhalf a million have returned as minority returns, Serbs moving back \ninto predominantly Croat neighborhoods, Croats moving back into \npredominantly Bosniak or Serb neighborhoods. It is painful. It takes \ntime. But what did we do? We got them all in a room, figuratively \nspeaking.\n  We have to get them in a room, Senator Lugar. We have to get them in \na room. Because let me tell you something, some in the administration \nprivately say to me: Joe, you are right. There is an inevitability to a \nfederal system. The difference between an inevitability and us being \nthe catalyst to bring it about may be years. That is thousands of \ndeaths, maybe tens of thousands, counting Iraqis and American. We don't \nhave that time. And look, I don't want to criticize the President. I \ndon't. God love him, I don't care whether he gets credit or blame at \nthis point. But let me tell you one thing for certain: What \nPresidential leadership is about is a change in the dynamic of \nsituations that are admittedly out of control. It requires taking \nrisks. Thus far, the only risk we have taken is the lives of our \ntroops. We have taken virtually no diplomatic risks.\n  I say to my friends, there is a reason why, although what I am \nproposing here is not ideal, I think there is a reason why so many \npeople--left, right and center--have come to this conclusion. One thing \nabout us Americans is, we have ultimately led the world as a \nconsequence of two traits we possess, in my opinion, that exceed that \nof any other country. It is not just our military power; it is our \nidealism coupled with our pragmatism. It gets down to a very pragmatic \nquestion: If you don't like Biden et al.'s political solution, what is \nyours? What is yours?\n  The world is waiting. They are literally waiting. No one has the \ncapacity, no group of nations has the capacity, absent our active \ncooperation and engagement, to do anything to better the situation. We \ndo. The potential power is in our hands. But I respectfully suggest \nthat we can't do it by ourselves. We have lost the credibility to do \nthat, rightly or wrongly.\n  So it takes me to the essence of this amendment. The amendment simply \nsays--and I will not take the time to read it; I know other people wish \nto speak. I might add, this is the first and only time in the last 3 \nmonths I have spoken on the floor. I apologize for the time, but I \nthink it is the single most critical issue we face. I know my friends \nthink that too.\n  Regardless of your political persuasion, how do you attend to the \nagenda each of us has, from the right or the left, to deal with the \nsocial ills and concerns of America until we end this war? We are going \nto spend, counting it all, $120 billion a year. How do you deal with \nthat--the Republican approach to dealing with generating economic \ngrowth or the Democratic approach? How do you deal with tax structure \nand tax policy? How do you do this?\n  Look, it is the ultimate preoccupation, with good reason, of the \nAmerican people. Again, I know no one more loyal or knowledgable about \nthe U.S. Armed Forces whom I have served with in the Senate than my \nfriend from Virginia. He knows there is only one group of Americans \nmaking a sacrifice now--it is the thousands of families, thousands, \n166,000 families. It is those families. They are the only ones. But \nguess what. It is against the Senate rules to refer to the Gallery by \npointing to them. But I will refer to previous Galleries. Everyone who \nsits in this Gallery, they get it. They get it, whether they have a \nchild, son, daughter, husband or wife there.\n\n  (Ms. KLOBUCHAR assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. BIDEN. So folks, I must tell you, I am getting frustrated with \nall the tactical--not strategic--suggestions that have been made with \nhow to deal with this war. Because if you put together a basic \nsyllogism, the basic premise is what? There is no military solution; \nonly a political solution.\n  So what yields that political solution? Can I guarantee the Senator \nfrom Minnesota, the Presiding Officer, that my solution will work? No. \nBut I can guarantee--I will rest my career on what I am about to say--\nthat there is no other political solution being proffered that has \nany--period; not one ``being offered''--and none of the tactical \nsolutions offered will, in fact, solve this problem, none.\n  I know you are all afraid. I know everybody who is running is afraid \nto sign onto a specific proposal. ``Afraid'' is the wrong word--\nreluctant. Because then you become the target. You become the target. \nYou offer a specific alternative, and it is easy to focus on whether \nyour solution can work. If it is tried and failed, then you made a \nmistake. As the old saying goes: What do they pay us the big bucks for? \nWhy are we here? Why are we here?\n  Let's stop pussyfooting around. Either vote for this political \nsolution or offer another one or say you think there is a military \nsolution or say you think it is totally hopeless, there is no \nresolution. Let's leave and hope for the best. But don't tell me you \nhave a plan if it does not fall in one of those four categories. Don't \ntell me. That is disingenuous.\n  So, again, can I guarantee this will work? No. Every single day that \ngoes by, absent an attempt to implement what I am proposing, or \nsomething similar to it, without it being attempted, makes it harder. \nLook, it is not often that Thomas Friedman, David Brooks, Charles \nKrauthammer, Henry Kissinger, Madeleine Albright, Les Gelb--I will go \ndown the list--\n\n[[Page S11934]]\n\nagree on the same principle about the most fundamental, immediate \nforeign policy issue facing the United States of America.\n  I am open--I have no pride of authorship--I am open to amending, \ntweaking, changing, but I will end where I begin. The central, \nfundamental, animating principle of this concurrent resolution is: Iraq \nwill not be governed from the center anytime soon, and I am not \nprepared for my son and his generation to continue to shed their blood \nin an effort to do that. I will not do that.\n  As we leave--and we will leave, as my friend from Virginia knows--as \nwe leave, the only honest question that any President or Senator must \nask himself or herself is: Do we have any ability to affect what we \nleave behind? If we do, we have a moral overriding, overarching \nobligation to the next generation to try to do it.\n  Because let me tell you something, I am out there, as the old saying \ngoes, on the trail. The easiest thing to say is: I wash my hands, man. \nOut. It is--let me choose my words correctly--it is not an answer. It \nis not an answer. It is not an honest answer.\n  So I ask unanimous consent that recent supporting ideas relating to \nfederalism--whether or not they use the Biden language--be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 Recent Support for Federalism in Iraq\n\n       The Kurdish autonomous zone should be our model for Iraq. \n     Does George Bush or Condi Rice have a better idea? Do they \n     have any idea? Right now, we're surging aimlessly. Iraq's \n     only hope is radical federalism--with Sunnis, Shiites and \n     Kurds each running their own affairs, and Baghdad serving as \n     an ATM, dispensing cash for all three. Let's get that on the \n     table--now.--Thomas Friedman, New York Times, August 29, 2007\n       Most American experts and policy makers wasted the past few \n     years assuming that change in Iraq would come from the center \n     and spread outward. They squandered months arguing about the \n     benchmarks that would supposedly induce the Baghdad \n     politicians to make compromises. They quibbled over whether \n     this or that prime minister was up to the job. They \n     unrealistically imagined that peace would come through some \n     grand Sunni-Shiite reconciliation.\n       Now, at long last, the smartest analysts and policy makers \n     are starting to think like sociologists. They are finally \n     acknowledging that the key Iraqi figures are not in the \n     center but in the provinces and the tribes. Peace will come \n     to the center last, not to the center first. Stability will \n     come not through some grand reconciliation but through the \n     agglomeration of order, tribe by tribe and street by street.\n       The big change in the debate has come about because the \n     surge failed, and it failed in an unexpected way. The \n     original idea behind the surge was that U.S. troops would \n     create enough calm to allow the national politicians to make \n     compromises. The surge was intended to bolster the \n     ``modern''--meaning nonsectarian and nontribal--institutions \n     in the country. But the surge is failing, at least \n     politically, because there are practically no nonsectarian \n     institutions, and there are few nonsectarian leaders to \n     create them. Security gains have not led to political \n     gains.--David Brooks, New York Times, September 4, 2007\n       A weak, partitioned Iraq is not the best outcome. We had \n     hoped for much more. Our original objective was a democratic \n     and unified post-Hussein Iraq. But it has turned out to be a \n     bridge too far. We tried to give the Iraqis a republic, but \n     their leaders turned out to be, tragically, too driven by \n     sectarian sentiment, by an absence of national identity, and \n     by the habits of suspicion and maneuver cultivated during \n     decades in the underground of Saddam Hussein's totalitarian \n     state. . . .\n       We now have to look for the second-best outcome. A \n     democratic, unified Iraq might someday emerge. Perhaps \n     today's ground-up reconciliation in the provinces will \n     translate into tomorrow's ground-up national reconciliation. \n     Possible, but highly doubtful. What is far more certain is \n     what we are getting: ground-up partition.--Charles \n     Krauthammer, Washington Post, September 7, 2007\n       It is possible that the present structure in Baghdad is \n     incapable of national reconciliation because its elected \n     constituents were elected on a sectarian basis. A wiser \n     course would be to concentrate on the three principal regions \n     and promote technocratic, efficient and humane administration \n     in each. The provision of services and personal security \n     coupled with emphasis on economic, scientific and \n     intellectual development may represent the best hope for \n     fostering a sense of community. More efficient regional \n     government leading to substantial decrease in the level of \n     violence, to progress towards the rule of law and to \n     functioning markets could then, over a period of time, give \n     the Iraqi people an opportunity for national reconciliation--\n     especially if no region is strong enough to impose its will \n     on the others by force. Failing that, the country may well \n     drift into de facto partition under the label of autonomy, \n     such as already exists in the Kurdish region.--Henry \n     Kissinger, Washington Post, September 16, 2007\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. I would assert I am confident there are some major players \nin this administration who agree with the tact I am taking, and I would \ninvite--that is not why he is on the floor, I know--I would invite any \nadvice or suggestions--not at this moment--from my friend from Indiana \nor my friend from Virginia as to how to deal with this.\n  But, ladies and gentlemen, it took us--it took us--13 years to get to \nour Philadelphia moment. It is going to take the Iraqis a lot longer. I \ndo not want to see a regional war in the meantime because every one of \nus knows, whether we are here 3 years from now, there will not be \n133,000 troops in Iraq. That will not be the case no matter who is \nPresident. The American people will not stand for it, and we will \nrespond.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I, for one, will accept the challenge to \ncarefully go back and look at the Senator's amendment and the \nfoundation documents which he has described, and I look forward to \nMonday and Tuesday, perhaps, reengaging the Senator.\n  I say to the Senator, I think it is a very heartfelt expression of \nyour own views that you have shared with us this morning. I think it is \na constructive contribution to this debate.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, I thank my friend and I appreciate his \nkind remarks.\n  Madam President, I also ask unanimous consent that the article in \nThursday's Washington Post, dated September 20, by David Ignatius, \nentitled ``Shaky Allies in Anbar'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                         Shaky Allies in Anbar\n\n                          (By David Ignatius)\n\n       The Bush administration has been so enthusiastic in touting \n     its new alliance with Sunni tribal leaders in Anbar province \n     that it's easy to overlook two basic questions: Why did it \n     take so long to reach an accommodation with the Sunnis? And \n     is Anbar really a good model for stabilizing the rest of \n     Iraq?\n       First, the what-took-so-long issue: The fact is, Sunni \n     tribal leaders have been queuing up for four years to try to \n     make the kind of alliances that have finally taken root in \n     Anbar. For most of that time, these overtures were rebuffed \n     by U.S. officials who, not inaccurately, regarded the Sunni \n     sheiks as local warlords.\n       This disdain for potential allies was a mistake, but so is \n     the recent sugarcoating of the tribal leaders. They are tough \n     Bedouin chiefs, sometimes litt1e more than smugglers and \n     gangsters. The United States should make tactical alliances \n     with them, but we shouldn't have stars in our eyes. The \n     tendency to overidealize our allies has been a consistent \n     mistake.\n       Like other journalists who follow Iraq, I began talking \n     with Sunni tribal leaders in 2003. Most of the meetings were \n     in Amman, Jordan, arranged with help from former Jordanian \n     government officials who had perfected the art of paying the \n     sheiks. One contact was a member of the Kharbit clan, which \n     had long maintained friendly (albeit secret) relations with \n     the Jordanians and the Americans. The Kharbits were eager for \n     an alliance, even after a U.S. bombing raid killed one of \n     their leaders, Malik Kharbit, in April 2003. But U.S. \n     officials were disdainful.\n       During a visit to Fallujah in September 2003, I met an \n     aging leader of the Bu Issa Tribe named Sheik Khamis. He \n     didn't want secret American payoffs--they would get him \n     killed, he said. He wanted money to rebuild schools and roads \n     and to provide jobs for members of his tribe. U.S. officials \n     made fitful efforts to help but nothing serious enough to \n     check the insurgency in Fallujah. Back then, you recall, the \n     Bush administration was playing down any talk of an \n     insurgency.\n       A Sunni tribal leader who pushed bravely for an alliance \n     with the Americans was Talal al-Gaaod, a leader of one of the \n     branches of the Dulaim tribe. Looking back through my notes, \n     I can reconstruct a series of his efforts that were \n     mishandled by senior U.S. officials: In August 2004, he \n     helped arrange a meeting in Amman between Marine commanders \n     from Anbar and tribal leaders there who wanted to assemble a \n     local militia. Senior U.S. officials learned of the \n     unauthorized dialogue and shut it down.\n       Gaaod tried again in November 2004, organizing a tribal \n     summit in Amman with the blessing of the Jordanian \n     government. Again, the official U.S. response was chilly; the \n     U.S. military launched its second assau1t on Fallujah that \n     month, and the summit had to be canceled. In the spring of \n     2005, the tireless Gaaod began framing plans for what he\n\n[[Page S11935]]\n\n     called a ``Desert Protection Force,'' a kind of tribal \n     militia that would fight al-Qaeda in Anbar. The proposal was \n     gutted by U.S. officials in Baghdad who derided it as \n     ``warlordism.''\n       A despondent Gaaod e-mailed me in July 2005: ``Believe me, \n     there is no need to waste anymore one penny of the American \n     taxpayers' money and no more one drop of blood of the \n     American boys.'' His despair roused the new American \n     ambassador to Baghdad, Zalmay Khalilzad, who began meeting \n     with Gaaod and other Iraqi Sunnis in Amman in hopes of \n     brokering a deal with the insurgents. Gaaod died of heart \n     failure in March 2006.\n       What fina1ly happened in Anbar was that Sunni tribal \n     leaders--tough guys who have guns and know how to use them--\n     began standing up to the al-Qaeda thugs who were marrying \n     their women and blocking their smuggling routes. The initial \n     American response in mid-2006, I'm told, was ho-hum. More \n     warlords. But Green Zone officials began to realize this was \n     the real deal, and a virtuous cycle began. The tragedy is \n     that it could have happened much earlier.\n       The American plan now, apparently, is to extend the Anbar \n     model and create ``bottom-up'' solutions throughout Iraq. For \n     example, I'm told that U.S. commanders met recently with the \n     Shiite political organization known as the Supreme Islamic \n     Iraqi Council and gave a green light for its Badr \n     Organization militia to control security in Nasiriyah and \n     some other areas in southern Iraq and thereby check the power \n     of Moqtada al-Sadr's Mahdi Army. We're interposing ourselves \n     here in an intra-Shiite battle we barely understand.\n       These local deals may make sense as short-term methods for \n     stabilizing the country. But we shouldn't confuse these \n     tactical alliances with nation-building. Over time, they will \n     break Iraq apart rather than pull it together. Work with \n     tribal and militia leaders, but don't forget who they are.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, I yield the floor and thank my \ncolleagues.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, expectations were high on Capitol \nHill and the rest of the Nation this month.\n  We were all hoping to hear a major new strategy on how to forge \npolitical accommodation in Iraq from General Petraeus and Ambassador \nCrocker, and most importantly from President Bush.\n  We did hear of some limited, tactical success in improving security, \nbut we learned nothing new on how the Bush administration would bridge \nthe yawning political gap between Shia and Sunni.\n  In fact, the President in his speech last week to the Nation offered \nno change in policy and no strategy for reaching the political \naccommodation that is necessary in Iraq.\n  In his eighth prime-time address on Iraq, the President again made \nthe case that his policy will bring success in Iraq.\n  We have heard ``mission accomplished,'' we have heard calls for \npatience, and innumerable claims that we are winning. We have heard \nthat more troops will lead to political progress.\n  We have heard that ``when they stand up, we stand down,'' but there \nis no clear plan to get them to stand on their own.\n  And, this time we received yet another slogan--``Return on Success'' \na new name for staying the course, keeping the status quo.\n  So, even though for months we have been told by the White House and \nmany of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to wait until \nSeptember for a new strategy, we are still told to wait--again--but for \nwhat?\n  Neither General Petraeus nor Ambassador Crocker could provide answers \nto how long a U.S. troop presence will be in Iraq. As Ambassador \nCrocker said, ``No timelines, dates, or guarantees.'' Yet we are told \nto embrace their recommendations and continue more of the same.\n  This will do nothing to force Prime Minister Maliki to take the \nnecessary actions to bring political stability to that nation.\n  Sadly, we are left with no conclusion but this--the upcoming year \nwill result in little change in the political stalemate that marks \nIraq's Government today.\n  This, I believe, is a missed opportunity for telling the American \npeople how political progress would be made in Iraq, for describing how \nand when the vast majority of our troops would come home, and for \ncharting a new strategy and finding a way out of Iraq.\n  No, this President and his military and political advisors seemed \ndetermined to keep a high level of U.S. forces in Iraq for the \nforeseeable future.\n  It was clear from the President's speech that he fully intends to \nmaintain his failed Iraq policy through the end of his administration \nand then lay the problem at the feet of his successor.\n  The President would also like to take credit for drawing down our \ntroops when the reality is that he is willing to go no further than \npresurge levels through next July. The same troop levels in Iraq 10 \nmonths from now as we had 10 months ago. This is not change; this is \nnot a plan.\n  In fact, this was always the expectation, because simply put, the \nArmy is on the verge of breaking. Troop rotation limitations make it \nimperative that we draw down troop levels by this April to avoid \nextending our soldiers' 15-month tours further.\n  Only a token contingent--about 5,000--will come home by the end of \nthis year.\n  Clearly, a choice has been made by this White House to leave the \ndifficult decisions to the next administration; that is, unless \nCongress acts. So Congress, once again, has an opportunity, an \nopportunity to do what this administration will not--to bring about \nmajor reductions in troops, and to begin the process of bringing our \ntroops home.\n  I hope Democrats and Republicans can find common ground in the coming \nweeks to transition the mission and remove our troops from the midst of \na civil war that only the Iraqis can solve.\n  We must forge a bipartisan plan to move our troops out of Iraq.\n  That is what the American people want.\n  Improvements in security are welcome, but by themselves, they do \nnothing to answer the difficult questions facing the nation. I do not \ndoubt that the surge has had a positive effect on security.\n  When you add 30,000 U.S. forces into a region, you are going to have \nan impact on the area. I would be surprised if it were otherwise.\n  And it is clear that there have been improvements in security in Al \nAnbar province. Sunni sheiks are working with U.S. forces against \nbrutal foreign fighters. But we must also acknowledge that many of \nthese improvements started to take place before the surge even began. \nAnd levels of violence in other areas of Iraq have receded from the \nDecember 2006 peak. Yet, these levels of violence, it should be noted, \nstill remain high compared with 2004 and 2005 levels.\n  Every recent report admits that the security progress has been \nuneven. In fact, the latest Pentagon Quarterly assessment released just \nthis week points out that even as Iraqi civilian deaths fell to their \nlowest level in 5 months in June, attacks against coalition forces \nreached record levels that same month.\n  Civilian casualties, in fact, rose again in July, and a telling chart \nin that Pentagon report shows the average daily casualties in Iraq--\nincluding coalition forces, civilians, and Iraqi security forces--\nincreasing to about 150 per day in July and August.\n  Moreover, we face a growing humanitarian crisis in Iraq as the number \nof displaced Iraqis is increasing by 80,000 to 100,000 a month. To \ndate, at least 2.2 million Iraqis have fled their country, and another \n2 million have been forced to leave their homes to escape the sectarian \nviolence.\n  There continue to be IED explosions, suicide bombings, sectarian \nkillings on a daily basis.\n  So violence continues, even if by some measures there have been \nindications of a decline in the last several weeks.\n  But the point is this--the surge is not an end in itself. It is not a \nstrategy. It is a tactic to achieve a purpose.\n  The purpose of the surge was meant to give politicians the breathing \nspace needed to make the tough choices necessary to forge a stable \ngovernment.\n  Yet, according to independent analysis, there has been little \nprogress in meeting the key benchmarks.\n  The Iraqi Government has met only 3 of 18 benchmarks--not including \nmajor political action on an oil law, constitutional reform, and \ndebaathification.\n  These benchmarks, by the way, were commitments made by the Iraqi \nGovernment itself, not the U.S. Congress. They were put forward to the \nNation by President Bush in January as critical indicators of political \nprogress in Iraq that would come about as part of the surge. Yet, this \ndid not happen.\n  And recent reports all raise stark doubts about the likelihood that \nwe\n\n[[Page S11936]]\n\nwill see any significant political progress on the part of the Iraqi \ngovernment in the coming months.\n  Even Ambassador Crocker showed deep pessimism that meeting these \nbenchmarks and achieving major political progress would be possible in \nthe next month or year.\n  He said, ``I frankly do not expect us to see rapid progress through \nthese benchmarks'' and suggested that progress would take months if not \nyears to achieve.\n  So the American people are being asked for more patience at a time \nwhen it is clear that we do not have a strategy in place to remedy the \nsituation in the immediate future.\n  While this administration continues to endorse an open-ended \ncommitment of our presence in Iraq, our brave service men and women are \ncaught in the middle of a situation that everyone agrees can only be \nresolved with a political solution. This is deeply troubling to me. Our \nnation has been in Iraq for 4\\1/2\\ years. We have spent $450 billion \nand the President will soon ask us for $200 billion more.\n  We have lost nearly 3,800 American troops, over 400 from my home \nState of California. Almost 28,000 have been injured in Iraq.\n  We entered the country thinking that we would be met as liberators, \nand had no contingency plans in place if we were not.\n  The borders weren't secured, leading to an inflow of foreign \nfighters.\n  Debaathification was put in place on all levels of civil society, \nleading to resentment and widespread unemployment.\n  The army was disbanded, creating a disaffected, trained insurgency.\n  The munitions dumps weren't secured, essentially arming the \ninsurgency.\n  There has never been a clear-eyed strategy to resolve the major \ndifference between Shia and Sunni.\n  In a case of truly open candor, General Petraeus even admitted that \nhe did not know if the U.S. presence in Iraq had made America \n``safer.''\n  And now the American people are being asked for more of the same.\n  More time, more patience, more of our blood and treasure--all without \na strategy. I cannot support this view.\n  I have said for a long time now that I believe that we should \ntransition the mission in Iraq and begin to move our troops home. I am \nmore convinced of that today.\n  Our forces only buttress the Maliki government and shield them from \nmaking the tough decisions.\n  If our President will not hold the Iraqis accountable, then Congress \nmust.\n  Bush's plan means a large number of American troops in Iraq for years \nto come--an undefined commitment to Iraq.\n  Is it right to ask for a commitment from our troops when the Iraqis \nwon't commit themselves? Clearly no.\n  So I believe that Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle \nshould come together in support of a plan to start bringing our troops \nhome. They should not be in the middle of an ethno-sectarian civil war.\n  We need an answer to the one question which General Petraeus famously \nasked as commander of the 101st Airborne in Iraq in 2003, ``Tell me how \nthis ends.''\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I wanted to take a moment to explain why I \nvoted against the Levin-Reed amendment on Iraq.\n  Let me say at the outset that I am second to none in this body in my \nopposition to the President's failed policy in Iraq. Yesterday I spoke \nin strong support and voted for the Feingold-Reid amendment that would \nhave set forth a clear and enforceable deadline for ending our military \ninvolvement in the unwinnable civil war in Iraq. Sadly, only 27 of our \ncolleagues joined with me in voting for the Feingold-Reid amendment.\n  I do not doubt the sincerity of Senators Levin and Reed in offering \ntheir amendment. These have been two articulate voices in the Senate \ncalling for a change in our policy in Iraq for some time now. They like \nmany of our colleagues have spoken out strongly about the failure of \nthe President's policy and highlighted the fact that this policy has \nmade our Nation less safe and has broken our military. But I believe \nthis President will not admit failure or change policy unless we force \nhim to, and the only effective instrument available to this Congress to \ndo so is to exercise its power of the purse and cut off funding for \nthis war, once our men and women in uniform have been safely withdrawn \nfrom Iraq. That is what the Feingold amendment would have accomplished, \nand that is what any amendment that I will vote for henceforth must do.\n  We all know this President doesn't understand subtlety. He has \ndemonstrated time and time again that he doesn't respect this Congress \nor even the law. How many signing statements has this President issued \nin which he outlines ways to ignore or circumvent the laws written by \nthis Congress? Too many. How many innocent Americans have been subject \nto illegal, warrantless wiretaps authorized by this President? Too \nmany. How many falsehoods and deceits have been perpetrated by this \nPresident to justify his disastrous war of choice in Iraq? Too many.\n  There is only one way to force this President to change course in \nIraq and that is to take away the money required for him to conduct \nthat war. Iraqi officials need to be convinced as well that we truly \nmean it when we say it is time for them to take responsibility for \ntheir country and not count on us indefinitely to fight their fight for \nthem.\n  If we are truly being honest with the American people when we say we \nare fighting to end this failed policy, we must do everything possible \nto do so. That is why while I respect the efforts of my colleagues \nSenators Levin and Reed, I felt compelled to vote against their \namendment.\n  I hope the next time this body debates the war in Iraq, many more of \nour colleagues will join with Senator Feingold and me in voting for a \nclear and enforceable deadline to end our military involvement in Iraq \nand set on a new course that makes our Nation more secure and allows \nour broken military to begin to rebuild.\n  Too many days have passed and too many lives have been lost while \nthis Congress has stood by and not acted. That must end.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Madam President, yesterday I offered, along with my \ncolleague Senator Webb, an amendment to the National Defense \nAuthorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 that would require the Secretary \nof the Army and the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to prepare a report \non plans to replace the monument at the Tomb of the Unknowns at \nArlington National Cemetery.\n  Our amendment seeks to clarify the plans of the Secretaries to \nreplace the monument at the Tomb of the Unknown due to cosmetic cracks \nthat have appeared over time in the facing of the monument. It would \nrequire the Secretaries to provide Congress with a description of the \ncurrent efforts to maintain and preserve the monument and an assessment \nof the feasibility and advisability of repairing rather then replacing \nit. The Secretaries would also be required to report on their plans to \nreplace the monument and, if replaced, how they intend to dispose of \nthe current monument. Our amendment would prevent the Secretaries from \ntaking action to replace the monument until 180 days after the receipt \nof the report.\n  The Army contends that the cracks in the monument diminish the \naesthetic value of the monument and that the cracks justify the \nmonument's replacement. The Army's position is that the cracks in the \nmonument cannot be fixed and that it will continue to deteriorate. The \nArmy also contends that the surface of the monument has weathered to \nthe point that, within the next 15 years, the details of the carving \nare expected to be eroded to the extent that the experience of visiting \nthe tomb will be adversely effected. They justify its replacement by \nasserting that the Tomb of the Unknowns has significance beyond it \nhistoric origins and therefore should be maintained in as perfect of a \nstate as possible.\n  This position is not shared by many civic and preservation groups who \nbelieve the monument can and should be preserved and repaired. This \nview is also shared by the preservation architects who completed the \nlast formal study of repairs to the Tomb of the Unknowns in 1990. \nSupporters of preserving the current monument view it\n\n[[Page S11937]]\n\nas something that cannot be replicated. They do not believe the \nexperience of visitors will be diminished by the weathering and \ndeterioration that come over time. They believe it is a symbol that \nshould be considered in the same vein as other imperfect symbols of our \nheritage such as the Liberty Bell and the Star Spangled Banner, the \nflag that inspired our national anthem.\n  It is important to note that the Capitol Building and the White House \nare other well-known and well-loved American icons that have developed \ncracks and other flaws in their building materials, but no one is \nsuggesting that they be torn down and replaced with replicas.\n  It is also important that, as we consider replacing the monument at \nthe Tomb of the Unknowns, we acknowledge that it is the stated position \nof our Government under Executive Order 13287, signed by President Bush \non March 3, 2003, that the Federal Government will provide leadership \nin the preservation of America's heritage.\n  Our amendment does not preclude the Secretaries from replacing the \nmonument at the Tomb of the Unknowns in the future, but seeks to ensure \nthat we move with great caution before making any decisions that would \nirrevocably affect this national treasure. I urge all of my colleagues \nto support this amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I believe our colleague from Indiana, \nunder the UC, has now some 30 minutes; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I see our colleague from Massachusetts. \nDoes he wish to put a formal request before the Chair with regard to \nhis desire to address the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The order is to recognize the Senator from \nMassachusetts following the Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Virginia. I \nsee the Senator from Indiana on his feet, as well as my friend and \ncolleague from Wyoming. I know the Senator from Indiana is eager to \ncontinue the discussion on the substance that has been raised this \nmorning. I was wondering if we might have a very brief period of time, \nSenator Enzi and myself, to describe an extremely important piece of \nlegislation that passed last evening, on a voice vote. It is very \nimportant in terms of the health of the country. We want to be able to \nspeak briefly on that issue.\n  I am wondering if the Senator from Indiana would yield 5 minutes to \nthe Senator from Wyoming and myself.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, first, we would want to consult before \nthat UC is given----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. An order already exists.\n  Mr. WARNER. With the Senator from Indiana, who I think has been \nwaiting about an hour and a half.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Madam President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nVirginia for raising the question. As a courtesy to my distinguished \ncolleagues, I will be pleased to yield for the time requirements they \nhave and then I will proceed after they have concluded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I thank the Chair's inviting comment. \nLet us make it clear that I believe the UC, as structured, would be the \nSenator from Massachusetts will have 5 minutes, the Senator from \nWyoming will have 5 minutes, and then the 30 minutes allocated to the \nSenator from Indiana will start.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is the Chair's understanding.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. First of all, Madam President, I thank my friend from \nIndiana, who is so typically gracious and understanding to his \ncolleagues. We will be very brief. If the matter was not of such \nimportance, we would not trespass on the Senator's time.\n  Madam President, I ask the Chair to let me know when I have 1 minute \nleft.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. I will, Senator.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/21/senate-section/article/S11937-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11937-S11940]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION REFORM LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, every day, families across America rely \non the Food and Drug Administration in ways they barely realize. When \nthey put dinner on the table, they are counting on FDA to see that it \nis free from contamination. When they care for a sick child, they are \ntrusting FDA to make sure the drugs prescribed are safe and effective. \nFrom pacemakers to treatments for cancer to the foods we eat, FDA \nprotects the health of millions of Americans, and oversees products \nthat account for a quarter of the U.S. economy. The agency does all \nthis on a budget that amounts to less than two cents a day for each \ncitizen.\n  An agency that does so much so well deserves to be supported and \nstrengthened. Yet too often, the opposite has been true. FDA's vital \nmission has been jeopardized by inadequate resources, occasionally \ninsufficient legal authority, and absent leadership.\n  Americans are worried about the safety of the products they use--from \nfood to toys to drugs--and they are right to be worried. Dangerous \nlapses in safety oversight have exposed American families to \nintolerable risks from lead paint in toys, to bacteria in foods, to \ndrugs that cause unreported and lethal side effects. The right response \nis comprehensive, considered and bipartisan legislation--and that is \nwhat the Senate has approved.\n  The prestigious New England Journal of Medicine editorialized earlier \nthis year that the bill was ``the most important drug-safety \nlegislation in a century.''\n  Earlier this week, the House of Representatives approved this \nbipartisan measure by a broad bipartisan margin of 405 to 7. Our House \ncolleagues from all parts of the political spectrum united to send that \nbill to the Senate with a resounding bipartisan endorsement. I am \npleased that the Senate did the same, sending that bill to the \nPresident with a unanimous voice of approval.\n  The stakes could not be higher. Funding for the FDA's vital safety \nmission has reached the breaking point. If we had not acted, the FDA \nCommissioner would have sent a letter today to over 2,000 employees \ninforming them that their jobs were slated for termination.\n  Each of those individuals is a trained and experienced professional \nwith many career options in academia or industry--yet each of them has \nmade the decision to devote themselves to public service. If those \ntalented public servants had left the agency, the consequences would \nhave been with us for years--in terms of slower access to medicines for \npatients, weaker safety oversight and loss of America's competitive \nedge in the life sciences.\n  FDA has an urgent need for these funds. Its workload has increased \nmassively in recent years but its resources have not kept pace. Since \n1990, the number of adverse events submitted to the FDA has increased \nby over 1,300 percent, but the agency's resources have increased only \n130 percent. The legislation provides over $400 million this year for \nthe review of drugs and medical devices at FDA, and over $50 million \nfor needed safety reforms to give these talented professionals the \ntools they need to do the job we are counting on them to do.\n  The bill before us is not just about resources--far from it. It is a \nstrong and comprehensive measure to improve the safety of the medicines \nwe rely on, and it takes important steps toward a safer food supply and \nless expensive prescription drugs.\n  At the heart of our proposal is a new way to oversee drug safety that \nis flexible enough to be tailored the characteristics of particular \ndrugs, yet strong enough to allow decisive action when problems are \ndiscovered. For drugs that pose little risk, these actions might be as \nsimple as a program to report side effects and a label with safety \ninformation--items that are currently required for all drugs. Drugs \nthat raise major potential safety concerns might require additional \nclinical trials, a program to train physicians in using the drug \nsafely, or a requirement that the prescribing physician have special \nskills.\n  A second major element of our legislation is a public registry of \nclinical trials and their results. A complete central clearinghouse for \nthis information will help patients, providers and\n\n[[Page S11938]]\n\nresearchers learn more and make better health care decisions. Now, the \npublic will know about each trial underway, and will be able to review \nits results.\n  Our bill recognizes that innovation is the key to medical progress by \nestablishing a new center, the Reagan-Udall Foundation, to develop new \nresearch methods to accelerate the search for medical breakthroughs. \nDuring the discussions that led to consideration of this bill, we heard \ntime and again that there was a major need for better research tools to \naid FDA in evaluating the safety of drugs and devices and help \nresearchers move through the long process of developing these products \nmore effectively.\n  If new research tools and better ways to evaluate the safety and \neffectiveness of drugs could be developed, patients will benefit from \nquicker drug development. If current procedures can be made more \neffective, then the cost of developing new drugs will drop.\n  The Reagan-Udall Foundation sets up a way to develop these new \ntools--not so they can help just one researcher or one company, but so \nthey can help the entire research enterprise.\n  The bill helps preserve the integrity of scientific review by \nimproving FDA's safeguards against conflicts of interest on its \nscientific advisory committees--not through a rigid policy that could \ndeny FDA needed expertise, but though a flexible approach that will \nreduce the number of waivers given for conflicts of interest at FDA \noverall.\n  The bill also takes action on the abuse of citizens petitions. FDA \nhas a commonsense policy to allow ordinary citizens or medical experts \nto submit petitions to the agency about drugs that it is considering \napproving. This procedure should be used to protect public health--but \ntoo often, it is subverted by those who seek only to delay the entry \nonto the market of generic drugs.\n  Even if the petitions are found to be meritless, they will have \naccomplished their mission--delaying access for consumers to safe and \nlower cost medicines. Some petitions do present legitimate public \nhealth concerns, and FDA should not ignore them. The critical test of \nany proposal on citizen petitions is that it strike a balance so that \nthe abuse of citizens petitions is prohibited, but those petitions that \nhave genuine safety information are reviewed.\n  The proposal the Senate approved strikes that balance. It rightly \nstates that the mere filing of a citizen petition should not be cause \nfor delay, but allows FDA to delay the approval of a generic \napplication if it determines that doing so is necessary to protect \npublic health. This is the right approach. It prevents abuse protects \nhealth.\n  The legislation also includes important reforms of direct to \nconsumer, or DTC, advertising. I want to thank Senator Roberts and \nSenator Harkin for working with Senator Enzi and me and with many \nmembers of the committee on this important provision.\n  Instead of the moratorium included in our original bill, the current \nproposal puts in place strong safety disclosures for DTC ads, coupled \nwith effective enforcement. Under current law, safety disclosures can \nbe an afterthought--a rushed disclaimer read by an announcer at the \nconclusion of a TV ad while distracting images help gloss over the \nimportant information provided. Our proposal requires safety \nannouncements to be presented in a manner that is clear, conspicuous \nand neutral, without distracting imagery. We also give FDA the \nauthority to require safety disclosures in DTC ads if the risk profile \nof the drug requires them.\n  Our legislation also takes important first steps toward a safer food \nsupply. These are only first steps, and our committee will work on a \ncomprehensive package of food safety legislation later in the fall--but \nthey are important steps. Consumers and FDA have too little information \nabout contaminated food. Our bill creates a registry and a requirement \nto report food safety problems. Consumers will have information about \nrecalls at their fingertips, and FDA's response will not be slowed by \nantiquated and inefficient reporting systems. Our bill also establishes \nstrong, enforceable quality standards for the food we give our pets, to \nguard against the problems of tainted pet food that we have seen in \nrecent months.\n  In this new era of the life sciences, medical advances will continue \nto bring immense benefits for our citizens. To fulfill the potential of \nthat bright future, we need not only brilliant researchers to develop \nthe drugs of tomorrow, but also strong and vigilant watchdogs for \npublic health to guarantee that new drugs and medical devices are safe \nand beneficial, and that they actually reach the patients who urgently \nneed them. Congress has ample power to restore the luster the FDA has \nlost in recent years, and this bipartisan consensus bill can do the \njob. I congratulate my colleagues on approving this legislation, and \nlook forward to working with them on its effective implementation.\n  The comprehensive legislation approved by the Senate is over 400 \npages long, and it reflects important contributions from many, many of \nour colleagues.\n  My partner in this effort from Day One has been my friend and \ncolleague from Wyoming, Senator Mike Enzi. Our work on drug safety \nbegan when he chaired our committee and I was Ranking Member--and our \nwork didn't miss a beat when our roles were reversed after last year's \nelection.\n  I also commend Senator Dodd, Senator Clinton, and Senator Alexander \nfor the important contributions they made to bring new drugs to \nchildren. I regret that several of these important provisions were not \nincluded in the bill, but I will work with them to see if those \nworthwhile proposals can be included in other legislation.\n  Senator Gregg contributed important proposals on using health \ninformation technology to improve FDA's ability to detect drug safety \nproblems. No drug is free from risk, and FDA needs the best possible \nmethods to detect unexpected risks as quickly as possible.\n  No Senator is more justly proud of the good work that FDA does than \nSenator Mikulski. Her state of Maryland has two of the great jewels of \nthe federal government--the National Institutes of Health and the Food \nand Drug Administration, and her proposals to increase the transparency \nof FDA operations were included in the bill.\n  Senator Hatch and I have worked together on the life sciences for \nmany years. Whether the issue is stem cells or biologics or the FDA \nitself, Senator Hatch is always at the forefront of the debate--and the \nbill includes important provisions he offered to accelerate the \ndevelopment of new cutting-edge drugs.\n  The proposal on citizens petitions in this legislation is a true \nbipartisan effort--uniting Senators Stabenow, Brown, Lott, Hatch and \nThune. These Senators were deeply committed to this proposal, and they \nparticipated actively in the final negotiations on the bill.\n  Senator Roberts and Senator Harkin collaborated productively to \ndevelop an effective and workable proposal on direct-to-consumer \nadvertising that both protects consumers and respects the Constitution.\n  A number of other colleagues also made major contributions to this \nbipartisan achievement. Senator Obama offered provisions on genetic \ntesting. Senator Reed contributed a proposal on the safety of tanning \nbeds. Senator Brown and Senator Brownback came up with new and \nthoughtful incentives for new treatments for neglected tropical \ndiseases. Senator Dorgan contributed provisions on counterfeit drugs. \nSenator Rockefeller added provisions to increase reporting on \nauthorized generics, and Senator Coburn contributed provisions to allow \nFDA to restrict the use of approved medicines only when the drug cannot \notherwise be prescribed safely.\n  I especially commend Senator Richard Burr. No Senator is more \ncommitted to the search for innovations in the life sciences than he \nis. Senator Burr and his staff were skillful and tireless in their \nsupport for strong measures in the bill to see that FDA has the \nresources it needs to review new drugs quickly and effectively. No \nSenator worked harder to see that our deliberations on this bill were \nsuccessful.\n  Finally, I thank our colleagues from the House of Representatives. \nChairman John Dingell of the Energy and Commerce Committee and Chairman \nFrank Pallone of the Health Subcommittee steered this legislation\n\n[[Page S11939]]\n\nthrough the House. They worked in close partnership with the Ranking \nMembers, Representative Joe Barton and Representative Nathan Deal. \nOther House members made major contributions to the bill, as well, and \nI particularly commend Representatives Henry Waxman and Ed Markey for \ntheir leadership\n  Finally, I thank the dedicated staff members who worked so long and \nhard and well on this legislation:\n  Shana Christrup, Amy Muhlberg, Keith Flanagan, and Dave Schmickel \nfrom Senator Enzi's office; Liz Wroe with Senator Gregg; Jenny Ware \nwith Senator Burr; Tamar Magarik and Jeremy Sharp with Senator Dodd; \nAnn Gavaghan with Senator Clinton; John Ford, Bobby Clark, Ryan Long \nand John Little of the House Energy and Commerce Committee; and my own \nstaff: David Dorsey, David Bowen and Michael Myers.\n  They all spent long hours over many months on the many complex \nprovisions in this bill. Our efforts could not have been successful \nwithout them, and millions of Americans will benefit from their ability \nand dedication in the years ahead.\n  I thank the Chair and thank the Senator from Indiana for his \ncourtesies.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I thank you, and I especially thank the \nSenator from Indiana who has been waiting an hour and a half to speak \nand was kind enough to let us fit into the schedule. We needed to do \nthis because so often around here, when something is done in such a \nbipartisan manner that it passes unanimously, nobody ever hears about \nit.\n  This isn't something we are trying to force through, this isn't \nsomething that there are a lot of arguments about, but it is something \nessential to the American people: their food and drug safety. We are \nthe best country in the world at doing it. We can do it better. This \nbill lets us do it better. Is it a perfect bill? That never happens \naround here. Is it a big victory for patients and children? Absolutely.\n  This actually incorporates four reauthorizations and one massive \nreform. We take care of a lot of things in this package that normally \nwould take a lot of hours on the floor, but because of the \nparticipation from both sides of the aisle, and from everybody \nintensively on the committee, we were able to put together a bill that \nsolves a lot of problems.\n  The FDA's choice before was to pull a drug off the market or to leave \nit on. If it had some kind of a problem that could be solved some \nsimple way, it wasn't an option; pull it off or leave it on. We gave \nthem a toolbox, a whole bunch of different things that they can now do \nso that drugs will be approved faster, and then when that clinical \ntrial that we call the whole population of the United States kicks in, \nthere is a mechanism for following all of those and finding small \nsamples of problems, solutions to those small samples of problems, and \nthe drug that is working for people across this Nation doesn't have to \nbe pulled off the market. It can still work for the people who aren't \naffected by an adverse reaction. That is a major change we have been \nable to make.\n  I wish to thank all the people involved, particularly the people on \nthe committee who took separate parts of this and dug into it and came \nup with solutions--not solutions that would polarize us but solutions \nthat would bring us together. The American people don't get to hear \nmuch about the solutions that bring us together. They get to hear hour \nafter hour after hour of the things that have been polarized and that \ndrive us apart. I want them to know there are things that get solved \naround here such as food and drug safety, a big thing for this country. \nIt was done, and it was done unanimously. Now that means the House's \nversion that was negotiated with the Senate's version was put together \nin such a way that we agreed with it. America needs to know that.\n  The FDA is the gold standard among public health regulators the world \nover. For the past century, the FDA has protected the public--from \nfilthy conditions in meatpacking plants to thalidomide, which caused \nthousands of birth defects in Western Europe. The FDA's constant \nvigilance is something we have come to depend on every day to protect \nus and our children.\n  Beginning in January 2005, the Senate Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor and Pensions conducted a top-to-bottom review of the FDA's drug \nsafety and approval processes. Given the limitations we identified \nduring our review of FDA, I strongly felt it was necessary to correct \nthose problems and ensure that FDA has the right tools to address drug \nsafety after the drug is on the market. New authorities were clearly \nneeded, and H.R. 3580, the Food and Drug Administration amendments of \n2007, provides those authorities.\n  The changes made in the drug safety components of this legislation \nare critical to restoring peace of mind to Americans who want to be \nassured that the drugs they take to treat illnesses and chronic medical \nconditions can be relied upon and trusted. The broad new authorities in \nthis legislation are the most significant change to FDA in at least a \ndecade. The sweeping new authorities provided by this bill will only \nstrengthen the agency's ability to safeguard the American people.\n  This bill gives FDA a full toolbox of options for dealing with \npotential safety problems, even if they are discovered after a drug is \nfirst marketed. FDA will be able to proactively react to additional \nsafety information whenever that safety information is discovered, even \nafter the drug is on the market. FDA will have the ability to identify \nside effects through active surveillance, and the authority to request \na study or clinical trial to learn more about a potential safety \nproblem. But perhaps most significantly, FDA will be able to obtain \ntimely label changes in response to that safety information.\n  The label is the most important communication mechanism for patients \nand providers about a drug's benefits and risks. Patients and doctors \nneed to know that they can rely on the drug label for accurate \ninformation. To ensure that science is the guiding principle for all \ninformation with the drug label, the FDA must be the sole arbiter of \nwhat is and is not in the label. This legislation provides one strong, \nclear pathway to update a drug label in response to new information. We \nrely on FDA to get the label right, and this bill provides broad \nauthority to do that, significantly strengthening FDA's hand in \nsecuring changes to the label. By providing this single, expedited \npathway for safety labeling changes, it is clear that Congress intends \nthere to be one standard for protecting all Americans the FDA gold \nstandard. We should not be second-guessing the FDA and its science-\nbased decisions but continuing to rely on the agency to provide \naccurate information regarding a drug's benefits and risks.\n  I thank the Senator from Indiana for letting us take a few minutes to \nvoice this so there would be some knowledge out there of something \nhappening that is good and in a bipartisan way and gets accomplished. I \nwish I had time to name all the people and the contributions they made \nto this. I hope people will take a look at the record and see all of \nthese people, not just Senators, not just House Members, but the staffs \nwho worked on this overtime, for hours at night, for hours on the \nweekend, to be able to resolve it by today. Why is today important? \nBecause if we didn't get this finished today and assure that the \ncompanies which help fund the efforts of the FDA would come in, there \nwould have had to be RIF notices to about 2,000 Federal employees today \nwho would be laid off. So we were up against a tight time deadline and \nwe met the time deadline and did it in a very bipartisan way.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I rise today to speak about the passage \nof the Food and Drug Administration Amendments of 2007. This bill \nincludes the reauthorizations of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, \nPDUFA, and the Medical Device User Fee and Modernization Act, MDUFMA, \nboth of which provide an essential source of funding to the FDA to \nensure faster review times and enhanced patient access to safe and \neffective drugs and devices.\n  The bill also reauthorizes two programs that have had a great impact \non the safety of medicines for children. I support the reauthorization \nof the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, BPCA, and the Pediatric \nResearch Equity Act, PREA, in particular the provision that maintains \nthe current 6 months of data exclusivity provided under current law to \ncreate a meaningful incentive for drug manufacturers to\n\n[[Page S11940]]\n\nperform pediatric safety studies. It is because of the great success of \nthese two programs that I am pleased that the bill requires both \nprograms to be reauthorized together in 2012. This joint sunset date \nallows for further reauthorizations to continue balancing the \nincentives and authorities that drive pediatric study.\n  Most of all, I am pleased that the drug safety portion of the bill \ncontains provisions from my Safer DATA Act. This language requires the \nFDA to establish and maintain an active surveillance infrastructure to \ncollect and analyze drug safety data from disparate sources, such as: \nadverse events reports, Medicare Part D and VA health system data, and \nprivate health insurance claims data. The private sector and many \nacademic institutions have had these capabilities for years. With this \nlegislation, the FDA will finally have access to the best information \npossible.\n  The legislation also directs the FDA to establish drug safety \ncollaborations with private and academic entities to perform advanced \nresearch and further analysis of drug safety data once the surveillance \nsystem detects a serious risk.\n  And finally, to enhance risk communication, the language establishes \na one-stop shop web portal to give patients and providers better access \nto drug safety information, including aggregate information from the \nsurveillance system.\n  I congratulate Senator Kennedy and Senator Enzi for their support of \nthe inclusion of this provision and for their efforts to get this bill \nfinalized before the September 21 deadline.\n  We have consistently heard from HHS Secretary Leavitt and \nCommissioner Von Eschenbach over the past few months that if we failed \nto complete the reauthorizations of PDUFA and MDUFMA by September 21, \nthey would be required to issue reduction-in-force--RIF--notices to FDA \ndrug and device reviewers--the key staffers who are on the front lines \nof ensuring the safety and efficacy of FDA approved products. In 1997, \nwhen Congress failed to reauthorize PDUFA on time, the 1 month delay \ncaused departures to the extent that it took 18 months for FDA to \nreturn to full staffing levels. Not only would the issuance of RIF \nnotices this year have affected nearly 2,000 FDA employees and their \nfamilies, but it would have essentially obliterated the ability of the \nagency to fulfill its public health mission.\n  So it may be surprising to some, that the key obstacle to finishing \nthis bill over the last few weeks was the House Democratic leadership's \ninsistence on a provision that they included on behalf of their most \nprecious constituents--not the FDA employees, not the scientists, not \neven the patients, but the trial lawyers.\n  Yes, included deep in section 901 of this bill is a one-sentence rule \nof construction that makes the obvious statement that, notwithstanding \nthe new authority granted to the FDA under this bill to require \nlabeling changes; it is the responsibility of the drug company to \ncomply with other regulatory requirements regarding the drug's label. \nThis so called ``gift to the trial lawyers'' merely restates current \nlaw, and is not such a gift at all. Regardless of whether or not the \ndrug company or the agency initiates a labeling change, it is the FDA \nthat continues to have the express authority to approve, reject or \nmodify the labeling of a drug.\n  Not only is this rule of construction meaningless, but it pales in \ncomparison to the expansive authority given to the FDA throughout the \nrest of the bill's 422 pages. What this bill does at the majority's \ninsistence is expand the reach of the FDA's regulatory authority over \nprescription drugs, devices, food, and even tanning beds.\n  In addition to the bill's many other provisions, section 901 gives \nthe HHS Secretary explicit authority to request certain safety labeling \nchanges. If the Secretary becomes aware of new safety information that \nthe he or she believes should be included in the labeling for a drug, \nthe Secretary may notify the drug company and begin a process to modify \nthe label.\n  Under existing preemption principles, FDA approval of labeling under \nthe Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act preempts conflicting or contrary State \nlaw. The determination of whether or not labeling revisions are \nnecessary is, in the end, squarely and solely the FDA's. Given the \ncomprehensiveness of FDA regulation of drug safety, effectiveness and \nlabeling under the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, additional \nrequirements for the disclosure of risk communication do not \nnecessarily result in positive outcomes for patients, but create \ndiffering standards that heighten confusion.\n  If we had intended through this legislation to give State courts and \nState juries the authority to second guess the scientific expertise of \nthe FDA, we would have done so. In fact, based on the totality of the \nbill's 422 pages we have done the opposite. The intent of this \nlegislation is explicitly clear. One FDA. One gold standard. One expert \nFederal agency charged by Congress with ensuring that drugs are safe \nand effective and that product labeling is truthful and not misleading.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana is recognized.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Madam President, I unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/21/senate-section/article/S11940-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11940-S11943]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     U.S. LEADERSHIP AGAINST HIV/AIDS, TUBERCULOSIS AND MALARIA ACT\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Madam President, I rise today to discuss S. 1966, a bill \nthat I introduced last month to reauthorize the U.S. Leadership Against \nHIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003--known as the \nLeadership Act. Under the Leadership Act, the American people have \ncatalyzed the world's response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic. It is not \noften that we have an opportunity to save lives on such a massive \nscale. Yet every American can be proud that we have seized this \nopportunity. My message to Senators today is a simple one: let's agree \nthat we should sustain this success, and let's move now to pass a \nreauthorization bill.\n  I believe that Congress should reauthorize the Leadership Act this \nyear, rather than wait until it expires in September 2008. Partner \ngovernments and implementing organizations in the field have indicated \nthat, without early reauthorization of the Leadership Act, they may not \nexpand their programs in 2008 to meet the goals that we set for the \nPresident's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief also known as PEPFAR. These \ngoals include providing treatment for 2 million people, preventing 7 \nmillion new infections, and caring for 10 million AIDS victims, \nincluding orphans and vulnerable children.\n  Many partners in the fight against HIV/AIDS want to expand their \nprograms. But to do so, they need assurances of a continued U.S. \ncommitment beyond 2008. We may promise that a reauthorization of an \nundetermined funding level will happen eventually--but partners need to \nmake plans now if they are to maximize their efforts. Today, they have \nonly a Presidential proposal, not an enacted reauthorization bill. This \nis an important matter of perception, similar to consumer confidence. \nIt may be intangible, but it will profoundly affect the behavior of \nindividuals, groups, and governments engaged in the fight against HIV/\nAIDS.\n  I recently received a letter from the Ministers of Health of the 12 \nAfrican focus countries receiving PEPFAR assistance. They wrote:\n\n       Without an early and clear signal of the continuity of \n     PEPFAR's support, we are concerned that partners might not \n     move as quickly as possible to fill the resource gap that \n     might be created. Therefore, services will not reach all \n     those who need them.  . . . The momentum will be much greater \n     in 2008 if we know what to expect after 2008.\n\n  I realize that a PEPFAR reauthorization bill will face a crowded \nSenate calendar this year. But maintaining the momentum of PEPFAR \nduring 2008 is a matter of life or death for many. Part of the original \nmotivation behind PEPFAR was to use American leadership to leverage \nother resources in the global community and the private sector. The \ncontinuity of our efforts to combat this disease and the impact of our \nresources on the commitments of the rest of the world will be maximized \nif we act now.\n  Although the Leadership Act is an extensive piece of legislation, I \nbelieve that Congress can reach an agreement expeditiously on its \nreauthorization. Most of its provisions are sound and do\n\n[[Page S11941]]\n\nnot require alteration. In fact, the act has provided for substantial \nflexibility of implementation that has been one of the keys to success \nof the PEPFAR program. The authorities in the original bill are \nexpansive, and they are enabling the program to succeed in diverse \nnations, each with its own unique set of cultural, economic, and public \nhealth circumstances.\n  In developing S. 1966, I have consulted extensively with American \nofficials who are implementing PEPFAR. Most believe that preserving the \nexisting provisions of the Leadership Act would give them the best \nchance at continued success. Adding new restrictions to the law can \nlimit the flexibility of those charged with implementation in 2009 and \nbeyond. We don't know who that will be, and more importantly, we don't \nknow what the challenges of 2013 will be--though we can probably say \nwith confidence that the landscape will be very different then than it \nis today.\n\n  This is not to say that Senators may not have good ideas for \nimprovement that should be adopted. But new provisions must not unduly \nlimit the flexibility of the program, and Congress should avoid \ndescending into time-consuming quarrels over provisions that are \nunnecessary or that have little to do with the core mission of the \nbill.\n  As Senators study the record of PEPFAR to date, I believe they will \nfind that the vast majority of the authorities needed for the next \nphase of our effort already are in the existing legislation. I would \nlike to outline how the existing legislation is dealing successfully \nwith several specific areas of concern.\n  The first is Strengthening Health Systems. Some have expressed the \nview that additional authorities are needed to improve health systems \nin target countries. I agree that this area is a vital one if hard-hit \nnations are to have truly sustainable programs. Yet the current \nLeadership Act already contains ample authorities to help build health \nsystems, and the United States is making extensive use of those \nauthorities. To date, the emergency plan has supported nearly 1.7 \nmillion training and retraining encounters for health care workers and \nmore than 25,000 service sites. In fiscal year 2007, PEPFAR estimates \nit will have invested nearly $640 million in network development, human \nresources, and local organizational capacity and training.\n  A recent study of PEPFAR treatment sites in four countries--Nigeria, \nEthiopia, Uganda, and Vietnam--found that PEPFAR supported 92 percent \nof the investments in health infrastructure designed to provide \ncomprehensive HIV treatment and associated care, including facility \nconstruction, lab equipment, and training. In these countries, PEPFAR \nalso supported 57 percent of personnel costs and 92 percent of training \ncosts.\n\n  In a separate study focused on Rwanda that examined 22 non-HIV/AIDS \nhealth indicators, 17 showed significant improvements as PEPFAR scaled \nup. Improvements in family planning and infant care, among other \nachievements, were deemed to have stemmed from ongoing HIV/AIDS \nprograms. According to the chairman of the Institute of Medicine \nCommittee, which recently completed a congressionally mandated study of \nthe emergency plan:\n\n       PEPFAR is contributing to make health systems stronger . . \n     . doing good to the health systems overall.\n\n  In the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, we have paid particular \nattention to the devastating toll of HIV/AIDS on females. Women, and \nyoung girls in particular, are especially vulnerable to HIV and AIDS \ndue to a combination of biological, cultural, economic, social, and \nlegal factors. The Leadership Act's authorities in this area are \nrobust. The emergency plan is already leading the world in \nincorporating gender considerations across its prevention, treatment, \nand care programs and addressing gender issues that contribute to the \nspread of HIV/AIDS. For example, in 2006, a total of $442 million \nsupported more than 830 interventions that included one or more of the \nfive priority gender strategies identified in the Leadership Act. These \nstrategies include increasing gender equity in HIV/AIDS services, \nreducing violence and coercion, addressing male norms and behaviors, \nincreasing women's legal protections, and increasing women's access to \nincome and productive resources.\n  In Namibia, PEPFAR supports the Village Health Fund Project, a micro-\ncredit program that provides vulnerable populations, such as widows and \ngrandmothers who care for orphaned grandchildren, with start-up capital \nfor income-generating projects. In South Africa, PEPFAR supports a \nproject that seeks to have men take more responsibility for preventing \nHIV infection and gender-based violence.\n\n  Another issue of special concern is food and nutrition. In 2004, I \nchaired a hearing of the Foreign Relations Committee on this subject \nthat underscored how HIV/AIDS and hunger exacerbate each other in many \nAfrican nations. The AIDS crisis has led to a food crisis for both its \nvictims and their communities. It is no coincidence that the prevalence \nof HIV/AIDS is highest in countries where food is most scarce. PEPFAR \nhas adopted guidance providing for the inclusion of nutritional \nassessment and counseling in care and treatment programs. It has also \nfacilitated food support for targeted populations and assistance to \nlong-term food security for orphans and vulnerable children. PEPFAR \nseeks to build on the comparative advantages of its partners in \naddressing food needs. These include USAID, the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture, and the United Nations World Food Program. These partners \nprovide more direct support in food commodities and food security with \na focus on overall communities. The PEPFAR approach of targeting \nindividuals complements these efforts.\n  In Kenya, for example, PEPFAR is supporting a ``food by \nprescription'' approach and is working with the Kenyan government, the \nWorld Food Program and others to ensure that broader communities, as \nwell as individuals who may fall outside of PEPFAR guidelines for \nsupport, are reached. In Haiti, PEPFAR works with partner organizations \nto support orphans and vulnerable children using a community-based \napproach. Children participate in a school nutrition program using \nUSAID-title II resources. This program is also committed to developing \nsustainable sources of food. Thus, the program aggressively supports \ncommunity gardens for children's consumption and for generating revenue \nthrough the marketing of vegetables.\n\n  On education, too, the Leadership Act's existing authorities are \nbeing put to productive use. In 2006, approximately $100 million in \nPEPFAR funding went toward programs that address barriers to school \nattendance for orphans and vulnerable children. This figure is expected \nto increase to $127 million in 2007. As it does with its nutrition \nprograms, PEPFAR seeks to leverage its resources by ``wrapping around'' \nother programs that promote access to education, such as the \nPresident's African Education Initiative, or AEI.\n  For example, in Zambia, PEPFAR and AEI fund a scholarship program \nthat helps nearly 4,000 orphans who have lost one or both parents to \nAIDS or who are HIV-positive stay in grades 10 through 12. Similar \npartnerships exist in Uganda, where PEPFAR and AEI are working together \nto strengthen life-skills and prevention curricula in schools. This \nprogram targets 4 million children and 5,000 teachers. Also in Uganda, \nthrough the AIDS Support Organization, PEPFAR helps almost 1,000 \nchildren by providing school fees and supplies for both primary and \nsecondary school.\n  The emergency plan has dedicated nearly $191.5 million to pediatric \ntreatment, prevention, and care during the last 2 years. The program \nhas made steady progress, increasing the share of those receiving \nPEPFAR-supported treatment who are children from 3 percent in 2004 to 9 \npercent in 2006. The intent is to increase this figure to 15 percent.\n  PEPFAR has focused much effort on early identification of HIV-\npositive children. In many countries, an HIV test is used that cannot \nidentify children as positive until they are 18 months old. Recognizing \nthat 50 percent of HIV-positive children will die by age two if \nuntreated, PEPFAR is working hard to introduce new diagnostic \ntechnology that can discern the HIV status of children at a much \nyounger age.\n  Along with supporting treatment for children who are already \ninfected, PEPFAR is devoting resources to ensuring that fewer children \nare infected\n\n[[Page S11942]]\n\nin the first place. To date, PEPFAR has dedicated more than $453 \nmillion to the prevention of mother-to-child transmission programs. In \nBotswana, Guyana, Namibia, Rwanda, and South Africa the percentage of \npregnant women receiving mother-to-child transmission prevention \nservices now exceeds 50 percent--the goal of the President's \nInternational Initiative to Prevent Mother and Child HIV. In the past \nfew years, nearly all of the focus countries have adopted ``opt-out'' \ntesting where pregnant women are given an HIV test during routine \nantenatal care unless they refuse the test.\n\n  Under the highly successful national program in Botswana, where \napproximately 14,000 HIV-infected women give birth annually, the \ncountry has increased the proportion of pregnant women being tested for \nHIV from 49 percent in 2002 to 96 percent in 2006. The number of infant \ninfections has declined by approximately 80 percent, to a national \ntransmission rate of less than four percent.\n  Although the authorities in the Leadership Act allow for an expansive \narray of activities, I am suggesting a few basic changes in this \nreauthorization. First, my proposal would increase to $30 billion the \nauthorization for the years 2009 through 2013--a doubling of the \ninitial U.S. commitment. Senators may wish to revisit this proposed \nfunding level, and I look forward to that discussion.\n  I believe we need to keep the bill as free of funding directives as \npossible to ensure maximum flexibility for implementation. This was \nrecommended by the Institute of Medicine. I am proposing that only two \nfunding directives be included--one modified from its current form, the \nother maintained as it is.\n  The first modification would seek to address the abstinence directive \nin current law. The administration has interpreted and implemented this \nprovision so as to include both abstinence and faithfulness programs, \nthe `AB' of `ABC,' which stands for Abstinence, Be faithful, and the \ncorrect and consistent use of Condoms. The ABC paradigm for prevention \nwas developed in Africa by Africans, to address the wide range of risks \nfaced by people within their nations. Recent evidence from a growing \nnumber of African countries shows a correlation between declining HIV \nprevalence and the adoption of all three of the ABC behaviors. PEPFAR \nimplements a program that teaches young children to respect themselves \nand others. Part of that respect is to refrain from sexual activity and \nto be faithful to a single partner. As children grow older, they learn \nabout other ways to protect themselves so that they have the \ninformation and tools they need to live healthy lives. These are not \nrevolutionary concepts. Rather they are commonsense approaches to \npublic health based on broad experience garnered from many cases and \nstudies.\n  The problem with this directive, however, is that it has applied to \nall prevention funding--not just to funding for prevention of sexual \ntransmission. This has had the effect of squeezing funding for \nprevention activities that have nothing to do with sexual prevention--\nsuch as prevention of mother-to-child transmission and blood \ntransfusion safety. The language I propose would address this by \napplying the directive only to funding for prevention of sexual \ntransmission, rather than to prevention funding as a whole. This will \nenable greater flexibility.\n  At the same time, the language would ensure the continuation of \nfunding for abstinence and faithfulness programs as part of \ncomprehensive, evidence-based ABC activities. Rather than maintaining \nthe existing directive of 33 percent of all prevention funding, the \nproposal would require that 50 percent of the sexual prevention subset \nof prevention activities be spent to support abstinence and \nfaithfulness. It also acknowledges that different strategies are needed \ndepending on the facts of the epidemic in each country--something \nPEPFAR is already doing. I think this compromise approach is one that \ncan win support from across the political spectrum and provide \nincreased flexibility while ensuring continued support for \ncomprehensive, evidence-based prevention. I look forward to working on \nthis with my colleagues.\n  The one directive in the Leadership Act that I believe must be \nmaintained holds that 10 percent of funding be devoted to programs for \norphans and vulnerable children. There were few programs focused on the \nneeds of these children before the Leadership Act, and we remain in the \nearly stages of the effort to serve them. Before the advent of PEPFAR, \nneither the United States, nor anyone else, had much experience in \nprograms to support children infected with, or affected by, HIV/AIDS. \nAfter several years of effort, we have made some progress, but our \nprograms are not yet as firmly established as they can be. This year \nPEFPAR invited proposals for orphans programs from the field--but the \nnumber of proposals that came back was far less than the available \nfunding. This indicates that we still have much work to do in this \narea, and maintaining this directive will help to ensure that we do it.\n  The AIDS orphans crisis in sub-Saharan Africa has implications for \npolitical stability, development, and human welfare that extend far \nbeyond the region. The American people strongly back this effort, and \nthe maintenance of this directive will help to ensure that we remain \nattentive to those who need our support the most. The directive will \nalso help ensure the success of the Assistance for Orphans and Other \nVulnerable Children in Developing Countries Act of 2005, a bill I \ndrafted, which was cosponsored by 11 Senators. That bill was signed \ninto law on November 8, 2005.\n\n  My bill also includes some new language regarding the Global Fund, an \norganization that enjoys wide support in Congress. The Global Fund is a \ncritically important partner in our fight against HIV/AIDS. In addition \nto our contributions, we are active on its board, and U.S. personnel \nprovide the Global Fund with extensive technical assistance. The Global \nFund is an avenue for the rest of the world to make contributions to \nantidisease initiatives. The United States is the largest supporter of \nthe Global Fund, having provided more than $2 billion so far. The \nAmerican people have contributed approximately one-third of all moneys \nreceived by the fund.\n  The fund is subject to pressures from many donors, and it is widely \nacknowledged that it would benefit from greater transparency and \naccountability. As chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee \nfrom 2003 through 2006, I oversaw the passage of legislation that \nstrengthened the transparency and accountability of international \norganizations that receive U.S. funding, including the World Bank and \nthe International Monetary Fund. My proposed language would establish \nsimilar benchmarks for U.S. funding for the Global Fund. I address such \nbenchmarks at some length in my proposed legislation--not because of \nconcerns over specific Global Fund activities--but rather to ensure \nsound practices and give members confidence that U.S. contributions are \nbeing monitored carefully. Most of these benchmarks are based on \nprovisions contained in past appropriations bills, and I do not believe \nthey will be controversial.\n  S. 1966 would maintain the limitation in the existing Leadership Act \nthat U.S. contributions to the Global Fund may not exceed 33 percent of \nits funding from all sources. This limitation has proven to be a \nvaluable tool for increasing contributions to the fund from other \nfunding sources, including other governments, and I believe there is \nwide agreement that this provision should be maintained.\n  Lastly, let me turn from the details of the proposed legislation to \nadd some perspective to this reauthorization effort. The U.S. National \nIntelligence Council and innumerable top officials, including President \nBush, have stated that the HIV/AIDS pandemic is a threat to national \nand international security.\n  The pandemic is rending the socio-economic fabric of communities, \nnations, and an entire continent, creating a potential breeding ground \nfor instability and terrorism. Communities are being hobbled by the \ndisability and loss of consumers and workers at the peak of their \nproductive, reproductive, and care-giving years. In the most heavily \naffected areas, communities are losing a whole generation of parents, \nteachers, laborers, health care workers, peacekeepers, and police.\n\n  United Nations projections indicate that by 2020, HIV/AIDS will have \ndepressed GDP by more than 20 percent in the hardest-hit countries. The \nWorld\n\n[[Page S11943]]\n\nBank recently warned that, while the global economy is expected to more \nthan double over the next 25 years, Africa is at risk of being ``left \nbehind.''\n  Many children who have lost parents to HIV/AIDS are left entirely on \ntheir own, leading to an epidemic of orphan-headed households. When \nthey drop out of school to fend for themselves and their siblings, they \nlose the potential for economic empowerment that an education can \nprovide. Alone and desperate, they sometimes resort to transactional \nsex or prostitution to survive, and risk becoming infected with HIV \nthemselves.\n  I believe that in addition to our own national security concerns, we \nhave a humanitarian duty to take action. Five years ago, HIV was a \ndeath sentence for most individuals in the developing world who \ncontracted the disease. Now there is hope. We should never forget that \nbehind each number is a person--a life the United States can touch or \neven save.\n  At the time the Leadership Act was announced, only 50,000 people in \nall of sub-Saharan Africa were receiving antiretroviral treatment. \nThrough March of this year, the act has supported treatment for more \nthan 1.1 million men, women, and children in 15 PEPFAR focus countries. \nDuring the first three and a half years of the act, U.S. bilateral \nprograms have supported services for more than 6 million pregnancies. \nIn more than 533,000 of those pregnancies, the women were found to be \nHIV-positive and received antiretroviral drugs, preventing an estimated \n101,000 infant infections through March 2007.\n  Before the advent of PEPFAR, there was little concerted effort to \nmeet the needs of those orphaned by AIDS, or of other children made \nvulnerable by it. We have now supported care for more than 2 million \norphans and vulnerable children, as well as 2.5 million people living \nwith HIV/AIDS, through September 2006.\n  Effective prevention, treatment, and care depend to a large extent on \npeople knowing their HIV status, so they can take the necessary steps \nto stay healthy. The United States has supported 18.7 million HIV \ncounseling and testing sessions for men, women and children.\n  Our financial investment in this fight has been critical to our \nsuccess, and thanks in large part to the flexibility of the Leadership \nAct, we have been able to obligate more than 94 percent of its \navailable $12.3 billion appropriated through this fiscal year.\n  PEPFAR, led by its coordinator, Ambassador Mark Dybul, has utilized \nthe existing Leadership Act authorities well and has listened to the \nCongress and many other stakeholders. We should maintain the \nflexibility to respond to the changing dynamics of the epidemic, rather \nthan locking in particular approaches that might be appropriate for \n2007, but that might prove problematic for future years. As the \nInstitute of Medicine said, the Global Leadership Act is a ``learning \norganization.'' We should pass a bill now that allows PEPFAR to expand \nand evolve its program implementation utilizing the experience of these \npast 3\\1/2\\ years.\n  I believe that we will save more lives and prevent more infections if \nwe reauthorize this remarkable program this year.

Now, all of us have access to \nthis. There is a classified version, a top-secret version, and a \nnonclassified version, but all of us have access to this information. \nHere is what it says in the context of protecting this country and \nproviding security and safety for this country.

We assess the group has protected or \n     regenerated key elements of its homeland attack capability, \n     including: a safe haven in the Pakistan federally \n     administered tribal areas, operational lieutenants, and its \n     top leadership.\n\n  Here is what it says. It says the greatest terrorist threat to our \nhomeland is al-Qaida and its leadership, who even now are plotting \nattacks against our country and who have a safe haven in the Pakistan \nregion. Now, if that is the case, it is quite clear that the central \nfight on terrorism is not going door to door in Baghdad in the middle \nof a civil war. Yet that is what we are doing.\n  I have asked this question, and I have repeatedly asked it: Why \nshould there be 1 square inch on the planet Earth that is secure or \nsafe for Osama bin Laden and the leadership of al-Qaida? Yet our \nNational Intelligence Estimate says they are in a safe haven. A ``safe \nhaven.'' These are the people who boasted of killing Americans on 9/11. \nThey boasted about engineering 19 terrorists aboard airplanes full of \nfuel and passengers, and they ran them into buildings, killing innocent \nAmericans. And 6 years later, our National Intelligence Estimate tells \nus that those who engineered that attack have regrouped, are developing \nnew training camps for terrorists, and are in a safe haven and \ndeveloping new plans to attack America. That is unbelievable to me.\n  We are debating the war in Iraq, which our National Intelligence \nEstimate also says is largely sectarian violence, or a civil war. Yes, \nthere is some al-Qaida in Iraq, but that is not the central front, and \nthat is not the central war on terrorism. If, in fact, our role as a \nresponsible country is to protect our citizens, then it seems to me we \nwould change course and change strategy so that we are taking the fight \nto the terrorists and fighting the terrorists first.\n  We have been bogged down--longer now than in the Second World War--in \nwhat has become a civil war in Iraq. Meanwhile, the greatest terrorist \nthreat to our homeland is in a safe haven. Osama bin Laden, al-\nZawahiri, and others, the leadership of al-Qaida, in a safe haven.\n  What are the consequences of that safe haven? Let me show a newspaper \nreport from last week. All of us understand this because we heard about \nit. They picked up terrorists in Denmark, they picked up terrorists in \nGermany. The terrorists in Germany were plotting attacks against the \nlargest U.S. military base in Europe. Where did those terrorists train? \nIn Pakistan. In terrorist training camps in Pakistan.\n  We are now seeing the fruit of what has been allowed to happen--the \nleadership of al-Qaida in a safe or secure place, operating or \ndeveloping new training camps, training new terrorists to launch \nattacks against our country. Meanwhile, we are going door to door in \nBaghdad in the middle of sectarian\n\n[[Page S11944]]\n\nviolence. If ever there is a description of a need for a change of \ncourse, that is it. I do not understand why some fail to recognize what \nhas happened.\n  You can go back to February, you can go to June, you can go to the \ndisclosures and read them. This one is June:\n  ``Al-Qaida regroups in new sanctuary in Pakistan border.''\n\n       While the U.S. presses its war against insurgents linked to \n     al Qaida in Iraq, Osama bin Laden's group is recruiting, \n     regrouping and rebuilding in a new sanctuary along the border \n     between Afghanistan and Pakistan, senior U.S. military, \n     intelligence and law enforcement officers said. The threat \n     from the radical Islamic enclave in Waziristan is more \n     dangerous than from Iraq, which President Bush and his aides \n     called the central front of the war on terrorism, said some \n     current and former officials. Bin Laden himself is believed \n     to be hiding in the region guiding a new generation of \n     lieutenants and inspiring allied extremist groups in Iraq and \n     other parts of the world.\n\n  I don't, for the life of me, understand the failure to recognize a \nset of facts. This reminds me of the period prior to the invasion of \nIraq--a set of information that on its face later turns out to have \nbeen wrong.\n  We don't need to be told what is right or wrong in terms of the set \nof facts--read the facts, understand the facts. If the central threat \nto our country, the greatest threat to our country, according to \nNational Intelligence Estimates, is al-Qaida and its leadership and its \nreconstruction of its system of terror and the development of new \nterrorist camps, if that is the case then, that is where America has to \nbe to wage the fight against that kind of terrorist group. Instead, we \nare in the middle of a civil war. That is why we need a change in \ncourse, a change in strategy.\n  It is not as some of my colleagues talk about, a plan for surrender. \nIt is simply deciding we are going to attack and launch an effort to \ndestroy that which represents the greatest threat to our country. It is \nsurprising to me that 6 years later there is anyplace on the planet \nEarth that should, by our national intelligence officials, be declared \nsafe or secure for the leadership of al-Qaida. Yet that is exactly what \nwe read and what we hear and what we see in official reports. That is \nnot something we should accept.\n  I wish briefly today to talk about the results of a hearing that the \nDemocratic Policy Committee held this morning. The hearing was about \nthe subject of contractors in Iraq and also the subject of what are \ncalled whistleblowers, those are people who are, in many cases, very \ncourageous people who blow the whistle on waste, fraud, and abuse on \nbehalf of the taxpayers of America; to say this is wrong and it must \nstop.\n  We had some very disturbing testimony this morning. We had eight \nwitnesses. Four of them were whistleblowers. They have paid dearly for \nhaving the courage to come forward.\n  Let me read the testimony of a Donald Vance, U.S. Navy veteran; 30-\nyear-old U.S. Navy veteran. When leaving the Navy, he chose to go to \nIraq as a civilian to help American efforts to rebuild the country. He \nworked for a couple of private military contractors in Iraq. Here is \nwhat happened to him.\n  What he saw with respect to the last contractor he worked with was \nthe sale of weapons, the sale of stolen weapons to interests who should \nnot have weapons, insurgents and others. So he began to report it. It \nwas something he believed very seriously. He reported it to his \nsuperiors. He reported it to the FBI. He reported it to U.S. military \nofficials.\n  As a result, this U.S. Navy veteran found himself in big trouble. \nHere is what he said.\n\n       Because of the information I possessed and because of my \n     unwillingness to condone the corruption in the company that I \n     saw, I became a target within the company. They took measures \n     to ensure that I could not leave their compound in the Red \n     Zone in which [they] were located. When I called the United \n     States government for help, [the U.S. Government] came to the \n     compound to rescue me. But what started as a rescue ended up \n     as a nightmare.\n       That night I was taken to the United States Embassy and \n     debriefed. I told the agent that questioned me everything I \n     had witnessed [about the sale of illegal guns and illegal \n     activity that had gone on.] I also told him that I was \n     informing for the FBI. Instead of contacting the FBI to \n     verify the information I provided, these U.S. government \n     officials blindfolded me, handcuffed me, and took me into \n     detention. According to the Department of Defense \n     spokesperson, they did not bother to contact the FBI until \n     three weeks into my detention. To this day [he said] even \n     though the Freedom of Information Act requests [have been \n     made] no government official has explained what was asked \n     of the FBI regarding myself and what the FBI said in \n     response.\n       I spent 97 days in . . . isolation. I was denied food and \n     water. I was denied sleep. I was also denied requested, and \n     much needed, medication. There was intolerably-loud heavy \n     metal and country music blaring into the cells. The lights in \n     the cells were always on. The guards would threaten me and \n     physically assault me. For example, the guards would walk me \n     into walls while I was blindfolded and handcuffed, ``shake \n     down'' my cell for contraband, threaten to use excessive \n     force if I did not obey all of their orders. Finally, for the \n     first few weeks I was [in this prison] I was denied a phone \n     call. No one in my family knew where I was, if I was alive or \n     if I was dead.\n       During [that] time I was interrogated constantly. Before \n     each session, I would ask for an attorney. The request was \n     invariably denied. Instead, I was interrogated by a host of \n     United States government personnel, including FBI agents, \n     Navy Criminal Investigative Service officers, as well as \n     possibly CIA and DIA agents. . . .\n       According to the government, I was being held as a security \n     internee because of my affiliation with [the private security \n     firm], certain members of which the government believed were \n     selling weapons to insurgents. . . .\n       Three months after I was detained, and after alleged \n     subsequent ``re-examination'' of my case, the government \n     released me. Before I was released, however, I had one final \n     interrogation. The main focus of that interrogation was what \n     was I going to do when I got home: Was I going to write a \n     book? Was I going to tell the press? Was I going to get an \n     attorney?\n\n  When they released me, he said, they ``gave me a $20 bill and dumped \nme at the Baghdad airport to fend for myself without the documentation \nI needed to return to the United States.''\n  A whistleblower who saw illegal activity, saw the selling of improper \nguns in Iraq, some to insurgents, he felt, went to authorities. His \ncountry, the United States of America, held him prisoner for 97 days. \nNo habeas corpus--which is in the Constitution, by the way. No right of \nhabeas corpus for an American citizen here. No right to contact an \nattorney. If this doesn't disturb the American people, I don't know \nwhat will disturb the American people.\n  We heard today from other witnesses talking about two things. One was \nthe abuse of the taxpayer by contracting firms in Iraq--waste, fraud, \nand abuse that represents I think some of the worst waste, fraud, and \nabuse in the history of this country. I have held, I believe, 10 or 12 \nhearings on this subject as chairman of the Policy Committee over the \nlast 3 years. The evidence is unbelievable: $40, $45 for a case of \nCoca-Cola. It doesn't matter, the taxpayer is going to pay for that. \nYou order 50,000 pounds, 25 tons of nails, and they deliver the wrong \nsize, it doesn't matter, throw them on the sand of Iraq, the taxpayers \nwill pay for it. Or a $7,000-a-month lease payment for an SUV.\n  Henry Bunting over in Kuwait, working for Halliburton--KBR, a \nsubsidiary of Halliburton--he had a job as a purchaser. He said, as a \nsmall example, I was supposed to order hand towels for the American \ntroops so I filled out an order to order white hand towels. My \nsupervisor said: No, we don't want those white hand towels. We want \nhand towels with KBR, the logo of our company, embroidered on the \ntowels. Henry says: But it will triple the cost. The supervisor says: \nIt doesn't matter, the American taxpayer is paying for this. It is a \ncost-plus contract; don't worry about it.\n  These are small items, but there are large items. It is unbelievable \nthe amount of waste, fraud, and abuse we have uncovered. The fact is, \nthere seems to be an attitude in some parts of this Government to \nsleepwalk through it all. It doesn't matter. It just doesn't matter.\n  Can you imagine a circumstance where a contractor, in this case \nHalliburton, KBR, is charging us for 42,000 meals a day it is providing \nAmerican troops, American soldiers--42,000 meals a day, and it turns \nout they are only giving 14,000 meals a day? They overcharged by 28,000 \nmeals a day, according to Government estimates. How do you miss 28,000 \nmeals a day?\n  The evidence is unbelievable when you go through this. This morning \nwe had a hearing about contracting abuse. We had testimony. I read some \nfrom Donald Vance, who worked for a contractor in Iraq and was \nimprisoned by\n\n[[Page S11945]]\n\nhis Government for 97 days, not given the right to an attorney, not \ngiven the right to contact anybody on the outside at any time during \nthe early stages of that confinement. That is unbelievable.\n  Bunnatine Greenhouse testified once again this morning, the highest \nranking civilian official in the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. She said \nthe abuse related to the awarding of contracts--here is what she said \nexactly. This is the highest ranking civilian official in the U.S. Army \nCorps of Engineers.\n\n       I can unequivocally state that the abuse related to the \n     contracts awarded to KBR--\n\n  that is a subsidiary of Halliburton--\n\n     represents the most blatant and improper contract abuse I \n     have witnessed during the course of my professional career.\n\n  Do you know what happened to this woman for that? She lost her job. \nThat is unbelievable, when you think about it. I talked to Secretary \nRumsfeld about this case. I talked to Secretary Gates about this case. \nI talked to Deputy Secretary England about this case--nothing. Oh, we \nare all looking at it, we are all investigating. They have been doing \nthat for 2 years.\n  I called the commanding officer of the Army Corps of Engineers when \nBunnatine Greenhouse was given this job. This is a woman with three \nmaster's degrees, judged by everyone from outside the Government who \ndeals with contractors as outstanding, given outstanding references on \nher performance reviews all along, until somehow she got into a \nsituation where she said: I saw things going on with sole-source \ncontracting, awarding big contracts, billions of dollars of contracts \nand doing it improperly, abusively. ``I blew the whistle,'' she said, \nand all of a sudden she got into trouble and they demoted her.\n  I called her former commanding officer, General Ballard, now retired. \nI called him at home one night and I said: Tell me about Bunnatine \nGreenhouse, because she has paid for her courage to speak out with her \ncareer. Here is what her boss said: ``She did an outstanding job.'' \nThis is an outstanding employee. But because she had the courage as a \nwhistleblower to stand up and report things that were wrong, abusive \nbehavior, behavior that abuses the American taxpayer, she paid for it \nwith her job.\n  We can't let that continue to happen. That is why I held this \nhearing. The best disinfectant for bad behavior is sunlight, and I \nhope, as we continue to expose more and more of this, I hope we can put \nan end to it. Those who have the courage to come forward and report \nwrongdoing, to report waste and fraud and graft and corruption--in my \njudgment, we ought to thank them. There is a story, I don't have a copy \nof it here, a story in the USA Today newspaper, written by an \ninvestigative reporter, that deals with these issues, the issues of \noversight of contractors and the oversight of contracts that are let \nwith respect to the war in Iraq. What we have found--Senator Wyden and \nI have worked on this in the Senate--the Pentagon wants to hire \ncompanies to oversee other companies. You can't do that. You can't \ndelegate that responsibility. Who is looking out for the taxpayer here?\n  We had testimony today from Robert Isackson. Robert Isackson is a \npatriotic American. He was someone who saw criminal activity with a \ncompany called Custer Battles. He reported it. For that, he and others \nwho were with him were surrounded by people with guns, threatened. He \ncame today and expressed profound disappointment at the way the Federal \nGovernment has responded or failed to respond. As a person who had the \ncourage to be a whistleblower, who saw something wrong and decided to \ntry to right it, as a person who stood up for the best interests of \nthis country and its taxpayers, we owe him a debt of gratitude.\n  And yet we see today that what has happened, systematically--the \nAssociated Press wrote a big article about this, exposing it. What has \nhappened systematically under this administration to whistleblowers is \nthey are abused, not protected; not thanked, but abused. I would hope \nwhoever in this administration is responsible and listening and \nunderstanding might decide that has to stop.\n  I will speak more at some point soon about the results of this \nhearing. My colleague Senator Grassley from Iowa I know has spent a lot \nof time on whistleblower issues, and other colleagues have as well. It \nis very important for us that when people come forward to report acts \nof wrongdoing, fraud, waste, abuse, that this country says thank you \nand follows up and will not allow those people to be abused and \npenalized. Yet, all too often, that has not been the case. It has to \nchange.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted \nto speak, and then the Senator from Alaska, Ms. Murkowski, be able to \nspeak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/21/senate-section/article/S11945-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11945-S11947]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              NOMINATIONS\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I want to address my colleagues for just a \nfew minutes on the subject of nominations to the Department of Justice \nand to the Federal judiciary.\n  Our obligation is the same for each, to focus on the qualifications \nof nominees through a process that respects the separation of powers.\n  First, let me say that the President has made a first-rate nomination \nby choosing Judge Michael Mukasey as the next Attorney General of the \nUnited States. He will bring to this vital leadership post 16 years of \nprivate legal practice, 4 years as a Federal prosecutor, and 19 years \nas a Federal judge.\n  He headed the Official Corruption Unit during his service as \nAssistant U.S. Attorney in the Southern District of New York. And he \nserved as Chief Judge during his last 6 years on the U.S. District \nCourt for the Southern District of New York.\n  By any reasonable or objective measure, Judge Mukasey is clearly \nqualified to lead the Justice Department.\n  I want also to draw attention to an aspect of Judge Mukasey's \nexperience and record that makes him particularly qualified to lead the \nJustice Department at this challenging time in our history.\n  The U.S. District Court is divided into 94 geographical districts. \nThese districts' caseloads vary widely, reflecting the characteristics, \ndemographics, and realities in those districts.\n  The Southern District of New York, where Judge Mukasey served for 19 \nyears and which he led for 6 years, is no different.\n  Serving in that key judicial district led Judge Mukasey to confront \nthe terrorist threat to America long before the 9/11 attacks. He \npresided over the prosecution of Omar Abdel Rahman and sentenced him to \nlife in prison for his role in the 1993 plot to blow up the World Trade \nCenter.\n  When the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed Judge \nMukasey's decision, it took the unusual step of commenting specifically \non how he had handled the trial. The appeals court said Judge Mukasey \n``presided with extraordinary skill and patience, assuring fairness to \nthe prosecution and to each defendant and helpfulness to the jury. His \nwas an outstanding achievement in the face of challenges far beyond \nthose normally endured by a trial judge.''\n  That is a remarkable statement. Appeals courts review lower court \ndecisions, but very rarely do they comment in this manner on lower \ncourt judges.\n  That case occurred before the 9/11 terrorist attacks.\n  Ten years later, after those attacks, Judge Mukasey ruled that the \nPresident had authority to designate Jose Padilla as an enemy combatant \nagainst the United States and that, even as an enemy combatant, he must \nhave access to his lawyers. Padilla was eventually convicted of \nproviding material assistance to terrorists.\n  Legal analyst Benjamin Wittes wrote about this case in the journal \nPolicy Review and said that Judge Mukasey's decision was ``the single \nmost compelling judicial opinion yet written on the\n\n[[Page S11946]]\n\ndue process rights of citizens held as enemy combatants.'' That is high \npraise indeed.\n  This background and experience with national security and terrorism \ncases make Judge Mukasey especially qualified to lead the Department of \nJustice at this time in America's history.\n  The Justice Department is being retooled and redirected in light of \nthe war on terror, including creation of its new National Security \nDivision.\n  Many of the issues in this area may begin with legislation, but end \nup in the courts. Having someone at the helm with experience not only \nas a prosecutor but as a judge evaluating these very issues will be \ninvaluable.\n  In addition to these qualifications are important personal and \ncharacter qualities which I believe we need in our leaders.\n  A Federal judge's law clerks probably know better than anyone how the \njudge thinks, how he approaches the law, how he handles tough issues, \nand how he treats others.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter signed \nby 43 of Judge Mukasey's former law clerks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. HATCH. This letter describes his decisiveness and mastery of the \nlaw, as well as his fairness, humility, and commitment to public \nservice.\n  We must evaluate Judge Mukasey's qualifications and character through \na process that respects the separation of powers.\n  The Constitution gives the President authority to appoint members of \nhis Cabinet, including the Attorney General. While the Senate has a \nrole in checking that authority, ours is not a coequal role with the \nPresident, and we may not use our confirmation role to undermine the \nPresident's appointment authority.\n  Some of my colleagues may want to use these nominations to fight \npolicy or political battles. Those fights are for the legislative \nprocess or the oversight process, but not the confirmation process.\n  Some of my colleagues have even hinted that they may manipulate the \nconfirmation process for Judge Mukasey in an attempt to force \ncompliance by the Bush administration with certain demands on other \nissues.\n  That kind of political extortion would be wrong.\n  The Justice Department needs leadership now, and Judge Michael \nMukasey is qualified and ready for duty now.\n  During my 31 years in this body, we have taken an average of 3 weeks \nto move an Attorney General nominee from nomination to confirmation. \nThere is no reason we cannot meet that standard with the excellent and \nwell-qualified nominee now before us.\n  The same two obligations apply to nominations to the Federal bench.\n  Let me repeat, we must focus on a nominee's qualifications through a \nprocess that respects the separation of powers.\n  It is a curious fact of recent American history that, like the \nsituation today, the last three Presidents each faced a Senate \ncontrolled by the other political party during his last 2 years in \noffice. Two of those presidents were Republicans, one was a Democrat.\n  During those last 2 years of a President's tenure, the Senate \nconfirmed an average of 91 judges, 74 to the U.S. District Court and 17 \nto the U.S. Court of Appeals.\n  This is only one way of measuring confirmation progress, and I \nrealize some may not care a bit about what has happened in the past. \nBut for those who do, I simply offer this as a yardstick, a gauge of \nthe progress we are making today.\n  The last 2 years of those previous Presidents' tenures are an \nobviously parallel measure for us today, since we are in the last 2 \nyears of President Bush's tenure.\n  We are nearing the end of September and have confirmed just three \njudges this year to the U.S. Court of Appeals. The last one was nearly \n5 months ago.\n  At the same point in this same year during those last three \nadministrations, the Senate had confirmed an average of six appeals \ncourt nominees, twice as many.\n  Meanwhile, the vacancy rate on the U.S. Court of Appeals continues to \nrise, and is nearly 10 percent higher than when President Bush was \nreelected.\n  By raising this issue, I run the risk of some talking about what they \nlike to call pocket filibusters of Clinton nominees. This cute but \nprofoundly misleading phrase is intended to suggest that the Republican \nSenate blocked Clinton judicial nominees, the number they use varies \nall the time, who all could have been confirmed.\n  I will say just two things about this well-worn mantra.\n  First, a certain number of nominees of every President remain \nunconfirmed for a variety of reasons. Anyone who pretends otherwise is \ntrying to mislead the American people about how the confirmation \nprocess actually works.\n  Some Clinton nominees were withdrawn, others were opposed by home-\nState Senators, others were nominated too late to be evaluated. \nHonestly taking these and other factors into account shows that the \nmargin of error by these critics tops an astonishing 400 percent.\n  The second response is simpler. President Clinton appointed 377 \nFederal judges with a Senate controlled by the other party for 6 of his \n8 years in office.\n  This is second only to President Reagan's 383 judicial appointees \nwith a Senate controlled by his own party for 6 of his 8 years in \noffice.\n  We need to make more progress confirming judicial nominees. The needs \nof the judiciary and the yardstick of history indicate that we are not \ndoing our duty.\n  President Bush has the lowest judicial confirmation rate, overall, \nand for appeals court judges in particular, of any President during my \nthree decades in this body.\n  Instead of making the confirmation progress that we should, we see a \nseries of steadily changing standards, whatever it takes to defeat the \nnominations of good men and women.\n  I have spoken here on the floor several times about the attack on \nJudge Leslie Southwick, nominated to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \nFifth Circuit.\n  Opponents urge his defeat on the basis of just two of the 7,000 cases \nin which he participated, on the basis of two concurring opinions he \ndid not write--not because he applied the law incorrectly, but because \nthe opponents do not like the result of him applying the law correctly.\n  That standard is wrong and I hope it does not succeed.\n  I have here the Washington Post editorial from last month and I agree \nwith its title. Judge Southwick is indeed qualified to serve.\n  The editorial says that while the Post does not like the results in \nthe two cases that opponents highlight, they cannot find fault with \nJudge Southwick's legitimate interpretation of the law.\n  Judges are not supposed to deliver results that please this or that \npolitical constituency. Judges are supposed to correctly interpret and \napply the law.\n  Judge Southwick is committed to that judicial role and he should be \nconfirmed.\n  Now we see an attack on another nominee to the same court, Judge \nJennifer Elrod.\n  When the Judiciary Committee reported her nomination to the floor \nyesterday, one of my Democratic colleagues questioned her \nqualifications for the position.\n  Judge Elrod, who currently serves on the State court trial bench in \nTexas, graduated cum laude from Harvard Law School and joined the State \ntrial court bench after 8 years of private practice. For a dozen years, \nshe served on the board and eventually chaired the Gulf Coast Legal \nFoundation, one of the largest legal aid organizations helping the poor \nin southeastern Texas.\n  Judge Elrod has as much judicial experience as did Sandra Day \nO'Connor when she was unanimously confirmed to the Supreme Court of \nUnited States. In fact, when you include Judge Elrod's 2 years clerking \nfor U.S. District Judge Sim Lake, Judge Elrod has more judicial \nexperience, and more Federal court experience, than did Justice \nO'Connor.\n  I voted for Justice O'Connor, I certainly believed she was qualified \nfor the Supreme Court, and I know that Judge Elrod is qualified for the \nFifth Circuit.\n  But Democratic colleagues in the Judiciary Committee also questioned\n\n[[Page S11947]]\n\nJudge Elrod's fitness for the Fifth Circuit because of her race. One \ncolleague said that we must consider the race of sitting judges as well \nas judicial nominees as we proceed through the confirmation process.\n  The implications of this view are troubling, to say the least. This \nmeans that no matter what a nominee's qualifications, no matter what \nher experience or background, no matter what she would bring to the \nbench, a nominee's race can, and some apparently believe even should, \ntrump her merit.\n  Appointing judges based on race is an inappropriate standard that I \ncannot accept.\n  Like Judge Southwick, Judge Elrod has been nominated to a vacancy \nopen so long that the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts has \ndesignated it a judicial emergency.\n  Like Judge Southwick, Judge Elrod should be confirmed without further \ndelay.\n  Evaluating nominees and deciding whether to consent to their \nappointment is a unique and profound responsibility of this body. As we \nexamine the nomination of Judge Mukasey to be Attorney General or the \nnominations of Judge Southwick and Judge Elrod to the Fifth Circuit, I \nurge my colleagues to focus on their qualifications. I urge my \ncolleagues to fulfill our responsibility through a process that \nrespects the separation of powers. I urge my colleagues to reject \ninappropriate standards such as political litmus tests or race.\n  Our judiciary is the best and most independent in the world, and I \nhope we will preserve this tradition in our confirmation actions and \ndecisions in the weeks and months ahead.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Majority Leader Reid, Minority Leader McConnell, \n     Chairman Leahy, and Ranking Member Specter: We served as law \n     clerks for the Honorable Michael B. Mukasey, former Chief \n     Judge of the United States District Court for the Southern \n     District of New York and the President's nominee for Attorney \n     General of the United States. Each of us had the privilege of \n     working closely with Judge Mukasey and observing this man of \n     great intellect, integrity, honor, and judgment. We write to \n     express our enthusiastic support for Judge Mukasey's \n     nomination.\n       Judge Mukasey's reputation as a careful and wise jurist is \n     well deserved. In each of his cases, Judge Mukasey based his \n     decisions--always thoughtful, carefully crafted, and well-\n     reasoned--on the application of governing laws and legal \n     principles to the facts. As a trial judge, he controlled the \n     courtroom through his decisiveness and mastery of the rules \n     of evidence. In the performance of his judicial duties, the \n     Judge taught us the importance of modesty and humility, for \n     he recognized that with his position came great \n     responsibility that had to be exercised prudently and with \n     care. All who appeared before him were treated with fairness \n     and respect. And as Chief Judge of the district for six \n     years, he managed one of the nation's busiest and most \n     respected courthouses, all the while attending to a full \n     docket of cases.\n       Because of the close relationship between law clerk and \n     judge, we came to know Judge Mukasey not only as a jurist, \n     but also as a person. The Judge is kind, caring, loyal, \n     ethical, and modest, with a disarming wit and robust sense of \n     humor. He was a wonderful teacher, sharing with us his \n     insights into life, law, and lawyering. Even after leaving \n     our clerkships, the Judge has joined in our significant life \n     events and provided invaluable advice--from attending our \n     weddings, to visiting us following the births of our \n     children, to assisting us with career choices. He remains a \n     true friend and mentor.\n       Finally, Judge Mukasey is deeply patriotic and has spent \n     most of his career in public service, first as an Assistant \n     United States Attorney--a job he speaks of with great pride \n     even years later--and then as a judge. Notwithstanding the \n     immense imposition on him and his family that resulted from \n     the terrorism cases over which he presided, the Judge \n     proceeded without complaint or hesitation, seeing it as part \n     of his duty to the country he loves.\n       The President has now asked Judge Mukasey to serve our \n     country again, this time as Attorney General of the United \n     States. We are certain that he will make an outstanding \n     Attorney General. Judge Mukasey's keen intelligence, \n     independence and judgment will bring to the country as a \n     whole and to the Department of Justice in particular strong \n     leadership and integrity.\n       We urge you to confirm him as Attorney General without \n     delay.\n           Sincerely,\n       Steven M.

Mr. President, we have had a very good, healthy debate \nin the Senate this week on the subject of the war in Iraq. Sometimes it \nhas been more spirited than usual. At times, it was spirited to the \npoint where some things were said that perhaps did not further a good \nconstructive debate but took the debate a little bit downhill. We in \nthe Senate recognize it is our job to bring forward the issues, to \ndiscuss the very difficult considerations that are before us as a \nCongress, but to always do it in a manner that reflects the level of \ncivility a truly good discourse, a good debate should bring.\n  I had an opportunity a couple days ago to speak with a general from \nmy home State. I asked him for his comments on what he was seeing as he \nwas watching our debate. He said: Senator, the debate has been good. \nThe debate has been healthy. There clearly are different perspectives \nthat are coming out on the floor, but through it all, no one has \nforesworn the soldier. He said: That makes me feel good as an American, \ncertainly good as a military leader.\n  That is important to remember, that in the heat of debate, we not \nforeswear our military, that we always honor and respect that which \nthey do in such an honorable way.\n  I personally want to thank Senator Webb, the junior Senator from \nVirginia, for bringing forth an issue this week. This was the amendment \nhe introduced that related to the amount of dwell time, the amount of \ntime deployed versus the amount of time a serviceman stays at home. It \nwas important for us to focus on the support side of our military. We \nknow that those who are serving us over in Iraq and Afghanistan, and \ntruly in all parts of the world, where they are separated from their \nfamilies, are at their best and serving us to their fullest when they \nare able to focus on their job.\n  For those families who remain behind, who miss not having dad or mom \nat home or miss not having their husband or their wife with them, they\n\n[[Page S11948]]\n\nwish the circumstances were otherwise. But we know that the families \nwho have stood behind our service men and women, allowing them to \nserve--it is these families, too, who are serving our country. We need \nto recognize the sacrifices those families also make. They may not be \non the front lines, but there is no shortage of worry and concern and \ntrue anxiety over the health and safety of their loved ones. We put our \nmilitary families through a great deal of stress at a time of war \nparticularly.\n  Just as we can never adequately tell our service men and women thank \nyou enough, neither can we say thank you enough to the families who \nprovide that support. I thank Senator Webb for reminding us of the \nobligation we owe to the military families themselves.\n  We all have our own stories of the exchanges we have had with the \nmilitary families in our respective States. A situation that is very \nclear in my mind, even well over a year later, was an incident that \nhappened in July 2006. This was, specifically, July 27 in Fort \nWainwright, AK, near Fairbanks, where it was publicly announced that \nthe men and women of the 172nd Stryker Brigade Combat Team were going \nto be extended in Iraq for 120 days. There was some uncertainty as to \nwhether it was just 120 days or whether it would go even beyond. This \nStryker Brigade had been serving very admirably, honorably in a \ndifficult part of Iraq and had been there for a year. This decision \nliterally pulled the rug out from under the families and the community \nin Fairbanks. It was a surprise, a shock to the servicemembers and \ntheir families.\n  At the time that extension was announced, some elements of the 172nd \nhad already returned home. They were back in Alaska. There were \nairplanes that were transporting other elements back home that \nliterally turned around in midair when they got the notice of the \nextension. Soldiers who had remained behind in Iraq were packing up the \nunit. They had heard the rumors that they might be extended. \nUnfortunately, they heard it from their family members back in \nFairbanks, who had heard it on the news and then contacted their loved \nones over in Iraq. They made some very difficult phone calls confirming \nthat, in fact, the rumors were true.\n  This was an absolutely unacceptable situation. It is one thing to be \nprepared for an extension. It is one thing to know this is your \ncommitment. But when your family is anxiously awaiting you, when you \nare anxiously awaiting your return after a year's service in combat, it \nwas horrible for the families.\n  I was in Fort Wainwright a couple days after the announcement of the \nextension. At the front gate of the post they have a chain-link fence \nthat goes for a mile or so. In anticipation of the return of their \nloved ones, families had pulled together the homemade banners saying, \n``Welcome home, Daddy. We miss you, we love you, we can't wait to see \nyou.'' Those signs, some of them clearly in children's writing, \nabsolutely broke one's heart because those signs were made with great \nanticipation and then put up on the fence. They were not going to be \nseeing dad that next day or that next week. They were not going to be \nseeing their husband as a consequence of the extension. As a \nconsequence of that extension, there were a few who never came home at \nall.\n  This was a difficult situation, of course, for the families, for the \nsoldiers. It certainly brought me much closer to many of those military \nfamilies. It caused me to set in mind a singular goal: that we were \ngoing to bring the 172nd Stryker Brigade Combat Team home without any \nfurther extension. This was tough enough, this 120-day extension, but \nwe were going to make sure there was no further extension.\n  To the Army's credit, they stepped up to the plate. They brought a \nvery extensive menu of family support services that we had never seen \nbefore.\n  The Fairbanks community, which has always been extremely welcoming, \nloving toward our military--gave an outpouring of support. They truly \nwent above and beyond.\n\n  The other thing we saw at that time was the strength of the family \nreadiness groups, the women, the wives who had for a year been holding \neverybody together, encouraging the younger wives who had never gone \nthrough deployment. There was a great deal of camaraderie, a great deal \nof support. The support from those family readiness groups helped them \nget through the additional 120 days.\n  In December of last year, the 172nd Stryker Brigade Combat Team came \nhome. There was no further extension. They were able to be home for \nChristmas. They were able to return because another unit that was ready \nto go broke dwell and went over early to relieve the 172nd. That speaks \nvolumes about the sacrifices the men and the women of our military and \ntheir military families make every day supporting our Nation and \nsupporting each other.\n  I was at Fort Wainwright in December when the returning soldiers were \narriving. I spent one afternoon greeting planeload after planeload of \nsoldiers. We were in a hangar where they were checking in weapons and \nawaiting transport to greet the families. These soldiers, from the \njunior enlisted up to the rank of colonel, were extremely positive \nabout the work in Iraq. They told me, absolutely, they were making a \ndifference. They were tired after 16 months of combat. They were \nabsolutely elated to be home. They were very proud of themselves, of \ntheir colleagues, as we were proud of them.\n  As I was standing in line, there was one young man from North Pole, \nAK, which is not too far from Fort Wainwright. I said: So you are home. \nWhat are you going to be doing?\n  He said: I have a house. My house is going to be kind of the welcome \nhome, the party house, if you will, for all the single guys and all the \nguys whose girlfriends have left them in the past year, for those guys \nwhose wives are not going to be here.\n  He got very serious in that conversation.\n  I said: Do you have a lot of those men who have come home to find \nthat their relationships are no longer intact?\n  He said: Yes, it is an unfortunate part. But we have been gone for a \nlong time.\n  He was a young man who was single. But that, too, pulls at your \nheart, to know that you come home after serving your country and the \nrelationship you had worked so hard to build prior to your departure is \nnow no longer there.\n  The extension of the 172nd made me angry at that time, very angry, \nvery frustrated--and not necessarily because our soldiers were \nextended. We know that it is the soldiers' creed that you put your \nmission before yourself. You never quit.\n  But I was upset because our soldiers and our families were forced to \nendure an abrupt reversal of what they had been promised. They had been \npromised: You are going to be home in a year, and they were not back in \na year. Their families had been promised: You have to wait this long, \nbut it turned out not to be true.\n  I have young kids. The Presiding Officer has young children. The \nPresiding Officer knows how children wait for something, whether it is \na holiday or school to start or school to end. They put it on the \ncalendar, and they count the days down. When the calendar has run out \nand that much-anticipated episode is supposed to happen and it does not \nhappen, the disappointment of the child is very difficult. It is \ndifficult as an adult to bear it, but we see what our children go \nthrough with extensions like this. It does make you angry that we \nfailed to keep our promise.\n  Now, I have had many opportunities to meet with the spouses of those \nwho are serving, both men and women. I have had an opportunity to meet \nwith the family readiness groups. I think probably the most difficult \nmeeting of any I have had with family members was a sitdown, literally \na sitdown on the floor of a classroom at an elementary school on post. \nChildren of the deployed military men and women got together for a \ncounseling session with the school counselor. I was touring the school \nat the time and was able to meet with the kids and sit down in a circle \nas they were drawing cards to send to their mostly dads over in Iraq--\nthere were a couple over in Afghanistan--and to talk to these children \nabout their life with their parent gone, and gone for a long time in a \nchild's eyes.\n  I talked to one little girl. She was 11 years old. Her dad has been \ndeployed seven times. Now, I did not ask her how\n\n[[Page S11949]]\n\nlong each of those deployments was because when you are 11 years old, \nseven deployments is a lot of time out of a young girl's life. We have \nto remember not only--not only--what is happening in the military \nfight, not only what is happening on the streets of Baghdad, but we \nneed to always keep in mind what our military families are doing in \ntheir service to support their loved ones who are serving us. So these \nwere the considerations which were on my mind and wrestling with when \nwe took up the Webb amendment this week.\n  It is important for people to understand the U.S. Army has a policy \nthat one-to-one dwell time--in other words, 1 day deployed, 1 day \nhome--one-to-one dwell time is the minimum acceptable dwell. This is \nnot only to allow soldiers the opportunity to reset but also to meet \nthe training and force structure needs. It is the minimum necessary to \nbalance reliance on the use of the Active and the Reserve Forces.\n  I keep saying this is the minimum time. It is not an ideal period. \nThe Army would actually prefer to adhere to its existing policy of 1 \nyear in combat, 2 years out for the Active Forces. But the Army knows \nit cannot comply with its existing policy and meet the demands of \nstaffing our efforts abroad. The Army discovered it could not comply as \nsoon as this policy was announced.\n  When you think about that, you say: What does this say? What does \nthis mean as far as our level of preparedness? Being prepared for war \nis not just making sure you have equipment you need. You have to have \nthat human equipment. When we talk about resetting our equipment, we \nalso need to be talking about resetting the human--the mind, the body, \nthe spirit, and the attitude.\n  So when the Webb amendment was before us, I reviewed it very \ncarefully. Contrary to some of the assertions made by some on this \nfloor that I was strong-armed by the administration, that was not my \nsituation. I sought out individuals whose judgment I trust. I did talk \nwith several generals to understand the implications of the policy that \nwas suggested--an inflexible policy, a policy that says it will be a \none-to-one dwell time but without any flexibility.\n  I was concerned that in an effort to make sure this administration is \npaying attention to the military families, making sure we are giving \nthe time we need to reset the soldier, that we were not locking \nourselves into something that ties the hands of our generals, ties the \nhands of our military planners, and, as a consequence, yields \nunintended consequences that could possibly further jeopardize the \nsafety and the security of those who are serving us in Iraq.\n  I did have an opportunity to meet with two of the senior military \nleaders. The senior Senator from Virginia had arranged for a meeting \nfor several of us who had questions about this issue: Tell us what the \nimplications of this policy are.\n  I sat down with one general who happens to be an Alaskan by choice, \nGeneral Lovelace. He served several tours over at Fort Richardson and \nalso with the Alaska Command at Elmendorf Air Force Base which is where \nI had known him previously. General Lovelace and General Hamm described \nthe consequences our troops on the ground would face if the amendment \nbefore us at that time had been adopted. They mentioned a shortage of \npeople to protect our troops from the IEDs, the improvised explosive \ndevices. They talked about a shortage of truck drivers and mechanics, a \nshortage of infantry, quite possibly a shortage of senior \nnoncommissioned officers and midcareer officers, greater reliance on \nReserve and Guard than is presently contemplated, and possibly further \nextensions of units that are presently in theater.\n  I thought about all of those, and while I do not know that all of \nthem would have come true if we had adopted the Webb amendment this \nweek, it concerned me greatly to think that through implementation of \nthis amendment you could have the further extension of the units that \nare presently in Iraq, operating under an understanding they will be \nhome by X date, and their family is operating under that similar \nassumption. That caused me great concern.\n\n  I made contact with the general who had been at Fort Wainwright at \nthe time the 172nd had been extended. He is now the general at Fort \nLewis with that Stryker Brigade unit. I asked him: Walk me through the \nimplications. What would it have meant to the 172nd? What can it mean \nto your brigade at Fort Lewis? He reiterated several of the things I \nhad learned in my conversations with General Lovelace and General Hamm. \nHe also spoke to the strength of support that comes from the family \nreadiness units that operate as a unit.\n  One of the concerns that an inflexible policy would bring is you \nwould--in order to get some of these specialists I referred to, either \nadditional infantrymen or additional mechanics, in certain areas or \nthose who are skilled with the IEDs, disabling them--in order to make \nsure you have enough on the ground, you would have to be plucking from \ndifferent units.\n  I thought back to what we learned there at Fort Wainwright. The thing \nthat held those families together when they learned their husband, \ntheir brother, their son was not going to be coming home and instead \nwas going to be extended another 120 days was the strength of that \nfamily readiness core unit. It had held everybody together.\n  If you separate those within the unit, you lose some of the strength \nand support because one of the families that had been a key member of \nthat team has now been pulled to another unit. You lose some of the \nstrength we have to provide for our soldiers as they are serving us. \nThat is important to remember.\n  Supporting the troops, supporting their families means, first and \nforemost, we want to bring our troops home alive. We know military \nmedicine is doing its part to treat those who have been injured, \ntreating them in an expeditious manner. We are saving lives in Iraq \ntoday that would have been lost in Vietnam. That is a credit to so \nmany. But still, the best way to come home alive is not to be injured \nat all.\n  This is what I had to come to grips with this week as we were \ndebating this issue--whether adoption of an inflexible policy that \nmight tie the hands of our military leaders, whether that would mean \nthere are fewer people who would be watching the backs of the service \nmen and women on the battlefield.\n  I do believe our current dwell policy must be revisited. For this \ntime, for 2007 and 2008, what we have in place, the 15 months that have \nbeen accepted for this 12-month dwell period, it is not a perfect \nsolution at all. I do not like it. I do not think our military leaders \nlike it. They would prefer we were in a better place so we could \nprovide for that equal dwell time. So I think it is important that even \nthough the Webb amendment is no longer before us--it did not achieve \nthe 60 votes--that we do not just kind of move on now, go to another \naspect, and say the issue of dwell time is not important to us, is not \nimportant to those who are serving and their military families who are \nproviding that support back home.\n  It has been suggested we could revise this policy as early as next \nyear without causing this chaos which has been described by some of the \ngenerals. It is something we should be looking at. When we think about \nhow we support those who are serving us, we have to remember it is \nunfair to our service men and our service women--who have already \nencountered personnel policies that turn on a dime, with multiple \ndeployments and extensions--to endure safety risks that directly flow \nfrom an inflexible policy that keeps qualified and competent people off \nthe battlefield. I said--and I will repeat--the current rotation may \nnot be ideal. I don't think it is ideal. The military needs to be \nhonest about not pushing people who are not fit for the battlefield \ninto combat, and it needs to be honest in compensating people who have \nsuffered debilitating mental health conditions and not take the easy \nway out of discharging based upon personality disorders.\n\n  The military needs to address these issues on an individual basis, \nand the Senate should hold them to it. We know the current rotation \npolicy may very well cause some individuals to leave the service \nprematurely, but it will also cause others to step up and say: I have a \ngreat deal more to give, and I am not going to abandon my buddy.\n\n[[Page S11950]]\n\n  When the Nation goes to war, we promise each and every individual on \nthe battlefield that they will have the best support this Nation can \nmuster. When we take people who are capable of performing off the \nbattlefield, we have the potential to jeopardize the safety of those \nwho remain.\n  The Presiding Officer was not here when I began my remarks, and I \nbegan those remarks by acknowledging what the Presiding Officer, the \nSenator from Virginia, has done in focusing the Senate's attention on \nthe families of those who serve. I greatly appreciate that. I also \nappreciate the level of debate, the level of concern, and the level of \ngenuine caring to make sure our policies do right by those who serve \nthis country, not only on the battlefield but for those who are serving \nat home. I don't believe that debate or this discussion is over by any \nstretch of the imagination, but as we continue to debate the direction \nof this war, we should always make sure we are recognizing all who are \nserving.\n  I want to take just a very brief moment, as I have had an opportunity \nto join with my colleague, Senator Casey from Pennsylvania, in \nintroducing an amendment to the Department of Defense Authorization \nAct. This amendment calls for a civilian and diplomatic surge in Iraq. \nWe spend a lot of time talking on this floor about the military \ncomponent, what our force strength is, the relative success or failures \nin certain parts of Iraq. There has been a lot of focus on that aspect \nof the war. Yet as we talk to our military leaders, we hear from them \nthat it is not a military solution alone. There must be a political \nresolve as well, and that political resolve must come about through \ndiplomatic channels and resources and truly on the civilian side.\n  When General Petraeus was before the Foreign Relations Committee a \nweek or so ago, I asked him at that time if he believed the civilian \nsurge was adequate; did he have the assistance he needed to do the job, \nto complete the task. He said certain elements of our Government are at \nwar, but not all of the others. We can use help in those areas, whether \nit is the Ministry of Agriculture or Treasury. There are areas that can \nbe identified. So I have joined with Senator Casey in calling for an \nequal push on the diplomatic front and on the civilian side. There is \nmore that we can do and more that we should do so we are able to see \nthe progress that all of us wish to see in the war in Iraq.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Webb).

Mr. President, in the aftermath of the Virginia Tech \nmassacre, Virginia Governor Tim Kaine commissioned a panel of experts \nto conduct an independent review of the tragedy and make \nrecommendations regarding improvements to Virginia's laws, policies and \nprocedures. Late last month, the Virginia Tech Review Panel released \nits report.\n  The panel was given the difficult task of reviewing the events, \nassessing the actions taken and not taken, identifying the lessons \nlearned, and proposing alternatives for the future. This included a \ndetailed review of Seung Hui Cho's background and interactions with the \nmental health and legal systems, as well as the circumstances \nsurrounding his gun purchases. Additionally, they assessed the \nemergency responses by law enforcement officials, university officials, \nmedical examiners, hospital care providers and the medical examiner. \nFinally, the panel reviewed the university's approach to helping \nfamilies, survivors, students and staff as they deal with the mental \ntrauma incurred by the tragedy.\n  Among other things, the report points to weak enforcement of and gaps \nin regulations regarding the purchase of guns, as well as holes in \nState and Federal privacy laws. It talks about the critical need for \nimproved background checks and the inherent danger the presence of \nfirearms can present on college campuses. Tragically, many proponents \nof gun safety legislation have previously unsuccessfully attempted to \nenact the very improvements recommended in the panel's report. The \ntragedy at Virginia Tech underscores the need to strengthen gun safety \nlaws. I urge Congress to wait no longer in taking up and passing \nsensible gun legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent to include the Virginia Tech Review Panel's \nprimary recommendations regarding firearm laws in the Record.\n\n       VI-1 All states should report information necessary to \n     conduct federal background checks on gun purchases. There \n     should be federal incentives to ensure compliance. This \n     should apply to states whose requirements are different from \n     federal law. States should become fully compliant with \n     federal law that disqualifies persons from purchasing or \n     possessing firearms who have been found by a court or other \n     lawful authority to be a danger to themselves or others as a \n     result of mental illness. Reporting of such information \n     should include not just those who are disqualified because \n     they have been found to be dangerous, but all other \n     categories of disqualification as well. In a society divided \n     on many gun control issues, laws that specify who is \n     prohibited from owning a firearm stand as examples of broad \n     agreement and should be enforced.\n       VI-2 Virginia should require background checks for all \n     firearms sales, including those at gun shows. In an age of \n     widespread information technology, it should not be too \n     difficult for anyone, including private sellers, to contact \n     the Virginia Firearms Transaction Program for a background \n     check that usually only takes minutes before transferring a \n     firearm. The program already processes transactions made by \n     registered dealers at gun shows. The practice should be \n     expanded to all sales.\n       Virginia should also provide an enhanced penalty for guns \n     sold without a background check and later used in a crime.\n       VI-3 Anyone found to be a danger to themselves or others by \n     a court-ordered review should be entered in the Central \n     Criminal Records Exchange database regardless of whether they \n     voluntarily agreed to treatment. Some people examined for a \n     mental illness and found to be a potential threat to \n     themselves or others are given the choice of agreeing to \n     mental treatment voluntarily to avoid being ordered by the \n     courts to be treated involuntarily. That does not appear on \n     their records, and they are free to purchase guns. Some \n     highly respected people knowledgeable about the interaction \n     of mentally ill people with the mental health system are \n     strongly opposed to requiring voluntary treatment to be \n     entered on the record and be sent to a state database.\n       Their concern is that it might reduce the incentive to seek \n     treatment voluntarily, which has many advantages to the \n     individuals (e.g., less time in hospital, less stigma, less \n     cost) and to the legal and medical personnel involved (e.g., \n     less time, less paperwork, less cost). However, there still \n     are powerful incentives to take the voluntary path, such as a \n     shorter stay in a hospital and not having a record of \n     mandatory treatment. It does not seem logical to the panel to \n     allow someone found to be dangerous to be able to purchase a \n     firearm.\n       VI-4 The existing attorney general's opinion regarding the \n     authority of universities and colleges to ban guns on campus \n     should be clarified immediately. The universities in Virginia \n     have received or developed various interpretations of the \n     law. The Commonwealth's attorney general has provided some \n     guidance to universities, but additional clarity is needed \n     from the attorney general or from state legislation regarding \n     guns at universities and colleges.\n       VI-5 The Virginia General Assembly should adopt legislation \n     in the 2008 session clearly establishing the right of every \n     institution of higher education in the Commonwealth to \n     regulate the possession of firearms on campus if it so \n     desires. The panel recommends that guns be banned on campus \n     grounds and in buildings unless mandated by law.\n       VI-6 Universities and colleges should make clear in their \n     literature what their policy is regarding weapons on campus. \n     Prospective students and their parents, as well as university \n     staff, should know the policy related to concealed weapons so \n     they can decide whether they prefer an armed or arms-free \n     learning environment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/21/senate-section/article/S11950-2", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11950-S11951]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        JUDGE MICHAEL B. MUKASEY\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise in support of the nomination of Judge \nMichael B. Mukasey to become the Nation' s 81st Attorney General.\n  Judge Mukasey has devoted more than 22 years to public service, 4 as \na Federal prosecutor and more than 18 as a Federal district court judge \nfor the Southern District of New York, one of the most prominent \nFederal district courts in the United States. For 6 years he was the \nchief judge.\n\n[[Page S11951]]\n\n  During his tenure on the bench, Judge Mukasey handled some of the \nmost challenging cases in recent history. In 1995, he presided over the \nterrorism trial of the ``blind Sheik'' Omar Abdel Rahman and nine other \ndefendants accused of plotting terrorist attacks on various sites in \nNew York City. Rahman was also one of the terrorist masterminds of the \n1993 World Trade Center bombing.\n  While presiding over the case of Jose Padilla--an American citizen \nwho was later convicted of, among other things, conspiring to provide \nmaterial support to al-Qaida--Mukasey issued key rulings that helped \nset judicial precedent in the war against terrorists. And in the wake \nof September 11, 2001, he presided over the difficult litigation of \nWorld Trade Center--related insurance claims.\n  During these cases and throughout his career, Judge Mukasey's \nknowledge, integrity, and consummate fairness have won him the respect \nof his colleagues, the attorneys who appeared before him, and many \nothers. In its opinion upholding the verdicts in the 1995 terrorism \ncase, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in an unusual \npublic commendation praised Mukasey' s ``extraordinary skill and \npatience, assuring fairness to the prosecution and to each defendant \nand helpfulness to the jury.'' The court added, ``[h]is was an \noutstanding achievement in the face of challenges far beyond those \nnormally endured by a trial judge.''\n  Judge Mukasey's career has been characterized by his commitment to \nupholding the rule of law. He has never served in a political role, and \nhis nomination should be considered above the partisan fray.\n  According to the Justice Department's mission statement, the Attorney \nGeneral's first allegiance should be to ``the fair and impartial \nadministration of justice for all Americans,'' not to any individual or \npolitical party. Indeed, Judge Mukasey's reputation for fairness and \nimpartiality is so well-known and respected that the senior Senator \nfrom New York, Senator Schumer, even recommended him to be a Supreme \nCourt justice.\n  It is unfortunate, however, that despite the nonpolitical character \nof Mukasey's nomination, some Democrats may attempt to hold his \nnomination hostage in exchange for documents related to the firing of \nU.S. attorneys. Leaving aside the fact that Congress has no right to \nthese documents, which are covered by executive privilege, Judge \nMukasey's nomination has nothing to do with the firing of these U.S. \nattorneys.\n  The President has nominated a distinguished and nonpolitical \ncandidate. The Senate should reciprocate by using the confirmation \nprocess not to settle old scores or politicize the nomination, but to \nexamine the qualifications of the nominee fairly.\n  Since the Carter administration, attorney general nominees have been \nconfirmed, on average, in approximately 3 weeks, with some being \nconfirmed even more quickly. The Senate should immediately move to \nconsider Judge Mukasey's nomination and confirm him before Columbus \nDay.\n  The Justice Department needs an Attorney General with the foresight, \nexperience, and resolve to lead the Nation's top law enforcement agency \nand tackle the difficult challenges presented by the post-9/11 world. I \nbelieve the qualities and background of Judge Michael Mukasey, combined \nwith his extensive experience in national security and terrorism cases, \ncommends him to serve as attorney general in these troubled times.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/21/senate-section/article/S11951-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11951]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRAILS ACT TECHNICAL CORRECTION ACT\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, today I rise with my colleague from \nMissouri, Senator Claire McCaskill, to correct a small but important \ninjustice in the National Trails System Act. The Trails Act Technical \nCorrection Act of 2007 is a Senate companion to a bipartisan House bill \nsponsored by Representatives Carnahan, Akin, Clay, Emerson, and Graves. \nOur bipartisan bill will ensure that property owners are compensated \nfor land taken from them as Congress intended.\n  In 1992, the Federal Government confiscated property owned by 102 St. \nLouis County residents through the Federal Rails-to-Trails Act. The \ntaking imposed an easement on their property for a public recreational \nhiking/biking trail. A trail easement was established on their property \non December 20, 1992. After 12 years of bureaucratic fighting and \ndelay, the Justice Department admitted the government's takings \nliability and agreed to pay the property owners a total of \n$2,385,000.85 for their property, interest and legal fees.\n  However, 2 days before the U.S. Court of Claims was scheduled to \napprove the agreement, the Federal circuit issued the Caldwell decision \nregarding a Rails-to-Trails takings case in Georgia. That decision \ninterpreted the statute of limitations for a taking in this program as \nbeginning with a notice of interim trail use, not the commonly \nunderstood later date the trail easement was legally imposed on the \nproperty. Under the new date, the statute of limitations on the St. \nLouis County takings claim had expired. The Justice Department \naccordingly sought dismissal of the claims without payment and the \ncourt of claims judge agreed.\n  Our bill clarifies in statute that the statute of limitations for a \ntakings claim under the Trails Act begins on the date an interest is \nconveyed and allows for reconsideration of past claims dismissed \nbecause of this issue. This technical clarification--the takings \nstatute of limitations starts upon the taking--makes the most sense. It \nalso corrects a past injustice that deprived landowners of their \nrightful compensation. It makes no change to the substance of the \nRails-to-Trails program and is supported on a bipartisan basis. I urge \nmy colleagues to agree to its passage.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/21/senate-section/article/S11951-2", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11951-S11952]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       INTERNATIONAL DAY OF PEACE\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I want to take some time to remind our \ncolleagues, and indeed all Americans, that today, September 21, 2007, \nis the International Day of Peace. The United Nations and its member \nstates unanimously established an International Day of Peace in 1981. \nHowever it was not until 2001 that September 21 was agreed to as the \npermanent date. According to the U.N. resolution, the International Day \nof Peace should be devoted to commemorating and strengthening the \nideals of peace both within and among all nations and peoples. I \napplaud Governor Chet Culver for his proclamation affirming Iowa's \nobservance of International Peace Day. And, at this time, I would like \nto do my own part to mark this day, especially on the behalf of the \nmany Iowans who are committed to the ideals of peace.\n  Unfortunately, this may be International Peace Day, but this is \nhardly a day of peace. The United States is in the fifth year of a \ndevastating war in Iraq, a war of choice that was launched preemptively \nby the current U.S. administration. The Middle East is marked by \nconflict and bloodshed from Lebanon to Israel to the Palestinian \nterritories to Iraq and Afghanistan. The genocide in Darfur continues \nto rage. Militias continue to prey on innocent women in Eastern Congo. \nIn Guatemala, there is an increase in violence against women and \nagainst those fighting for the rights of the indigenous population as a \nresult of the most recent elections. HIV/AIDS continues to ravage the \ncontinent of Africa. Millions of children are forced to work in abusive \nconditions--in many cases, as outright slaves--and are denied an \neducation.\n  Historically, the mixture of strength and a preference for peaceful \nrelations with the rest of the world is what has given the United \nStates its moral standing. In the past, it was our willingness to come \nto the aid of those who could not defend themselves, and a commitment \nto resolving conflicts peacefully, if at all possible, that made us the \nbeacon of hope for a better world.\n  But a true commitment to peace is not measured by a proclamation or \nby high-minded speeches on one day of the year. It takes more than good \nintentions and high ideals. What it takes is the hard work of \ndiplomacy, people-to-people exchanges, and active, assertive peace \nmovements in each country. It takes a sustained effort to understand \nour adversaries and, if at all possible, to resolve our differences \npeacefully.\n  I have long been committed to finding peaceful solutions to \nconflicts. That is why I was present at the creation of the U.S. \nInstitute of Peace.\n\n[[Page S11952]]\n\nThroughout our long history, America has been proud of its strong, \nwell-led military. And this outstanding military leadership is no \naccident. It is possible because we maintain prestigious, world-class \nmilitary academies that train some of the best and brightest minds in \nAmerica in the art and science of war. But Americans also have a long \nhistory as a peace-loving people. Time and again, we have brokered \npeace agreements between warring nations, and we have intervened to \nhead off potential conflicts. The Institute of Peace draws on this \nproud tradition, and today makes a vital intellectual investment in the \nart and science of peacemaking.\n  I look forward to a time, hopefully not too far in the future, that \nwill truly be a day of peace. But let us remember that peace is not \nmerely the cessation or absence of hostilities. The ideals of peace \nrequire us to practice understanding, tolerance, and honorable \ncompromise. The ideals of peace require us to look upon our fellow \nhuman beings and to see them as our brothers and sisters. The ideals of \npeace require us to reject unprovoked aggression and violence as \nacceptable instruments of national policy.\n  On this International Day of Peace, I salute the many good people in \nIowa, across America, and around the world who devote themselves 365 \ndays a year to the cause of peace and nonviolence. The world is a \nbetter place because of their activism and engagement, and because they \nsummon us to what Lincoln called the better angels of our nature.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/21/senate-section/article/S11952-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11952]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                   TO THE CHARLES F. KETTERING MUSEUM\n\n Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, in 1916, history records a number of \nmomentous events, events that changed the course of our world. \nPresident Woodrow Wilson was elected to a second term. World War I was \nramping up: Germany and Austria declared war on Portugal in March; \nRomania declared war on Austria in August; Italy declared war on \nGermany that same month; and Germany, Turkey, and Bulgaria declared war \non Romania. Pancho Villa invaded New Mexico, and the United States \nresponded by sending troops under General John J. Pershing into Mexico. \nIt is said that total miles of U.S. railroad trackage reached its \nhistoric peak.\n  That same year, something equally revolutionary occurred that \ncontributed to a significant change in the way farming was done in \nIdaho. In the fall of 1916, inventor, philosopher and engineer Charles \nF. Kettering from Centerville, OH, designed a self-starter for the \nMassey-Harris tractor. He did this for Thomas Lyon Hamer, a fellow \nOhioan, so that Hamer's nephew, Thomas Ray Hamer, could operate the \ntractor and farm his land in St. Anthony, Idaho, without the well-known \ndanger posed by the hand-crank.\n  Thomas Ray Hamer, a Representative in Idaho's state legislature in \n1896, was an attorney and a farmer. He also served in the military, in \nthe First Regiment, Idaho Volunteer Infantry and as a captain and \nlieutenant colonel in the Philippines. He also served as an associate \njustice of the Supreme Court of the Philippine Islands. During World \nWar I, he served as a judge advocate general. He spent his later years \npracticing law in St. Anthony and Boise, ID, and Portland, OR.\n  It gives me great pleasure to recognize Charles F. Kettering's \nsignificant contribution to Idaho history and Idaho agriculture. Were \nit not for Kettering's willingness to help a friend and his creative \ningenuity, a great Idahoan may not have gone on to a second successful \nmilitary career and secured his place in Idaho history. Charles \nKettering--at his death, coholder of more than 140 patents and \npossessing honorary doctorates from nearly 30 universities lived by his \nown words: ``With willing hands and open minds, the future will be \ngreater than the most fantastic story you can write.'' Kettering's \n``willing hands'' left their unmistakable handprint on the fields of my \nState of Idaho.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/21/senate-section/article/S11952-2", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11952]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              CONGRATULATING THE GEORGIA LOGISTICS COMMAND\n\n Mr. ISAKSON.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) violent crime and drug trafficking are pervasive \n     problems at the national, State, and local level;\n       (2) according to recent Federal Bureau of Investigation, \n     Uniform Crime Reports, violent crime in the United States is \n     on the rise, with a 2.3 percent increase in violent crime in \n     2005 (the largest increase in the United States in 15 years) \n     and an even larger 3.7 percent jump during the first 6 months \n     of 2006, and the Police Executive Research Forum reports \n     that, among jurisdictions providing information, homicides \n     are up 10.21 percent, robberies are up 12.27 percent, and \n     aggravated assaults with firearms are up 9.98 percent since \n     2004;\n       (3) these disturbing rises in violent crime are \n     attributable in part to the spread of criminal street gangs \n     and the willingness of gang members to commit acts of \n     violence and drug trafficking offenses;\n       (4) according to a recent National Drug Threat Assessment, \n     criminal street gangs are responsible for much of the retail \n     distribution of the cocaine, methamphetamine, heroin, and \n     other illegal drugs being distributed in rural and urban \n     communities throughout the United States;\n       (5) gangs commit acts of violence or drug offenses for \n     numerous motives, such as membership in or loyalty to the \n     gang, for protecting gang territory, and for profit;\n       (6) gang presence and intimidation, and the organized and \n     repetitive nature of the crimes that gangs and gang members \n     commit, has a pernicious effect on the free flow of \n     interstate commercial activities and directly affects the \n     freedom and security of communities plagued by gang activity, \n     diminishing the value of property, inhibiting the desire of \n     national and multinational corporations to transact business \n     in those communities, and in a variety of ways directly and \n     substantially affecting interstate and foreign commerce;\n       (7) gangs often recruit and utilize minors to engage in \n     acts of violence and other serious offenses out of a belief \n     that the criminal justice systems are more lenient on \n     juvenile offenders;\n       (8) gangs often intimidate and threaten witnesses to \n     prevent successful prosecutions;\n       (9) gangs prey upon and incorporate minors into their \n     ranks, exploiting the fact that adolescents have immature \n     decision-making capacity, therefore, gang activity and \n     recruitment can be reduced and deterred through increased \n     vigilance, appropriate criminal penalties, partnerships \n     between Federal and State and local law enforcement, and \n     proactive prevention and intervention efforts, particularly \n     targeted at juveniles and young adults, prior to and even \n     during gang involvement;\n       (10) State and local prosecutors and law enforcement \n     officers, in hearings before the Committee on the Judiciary \n     of the Senate and elsewhere, have enlisted the help of \n     Congress in the prevention, investigation, and prosecution of \n     gang crimes and in the protection of witnesses and victims of \n     gang crimes; and\n       (11) because State and local prosecutors and law \n     enforcement have the expertise, experience, and connection to \n     the community that is needed to assist in combating gang \n     violence, consultation and coordination between Federal, \n     State, and local law enforcement and collaboration with other \n     community agencies is critical to the successful prosecutions \n     of criminal street gangs and reduction of gang problems.\n\n TITLE I--NEW FEDERAL CRIMINAL LAWS NEEDED TO FIGHT VIOLENT NATIONAL, \n  INTERNATIONAL, REGIONAL, AND LOCAL GANGS THAT AFFECT INTERSTATE AND \n                            FOREIGN COMMERCE\n\n     SEC. 101.

Mr. President, today the Senate considers The Gang \nAbatement and Prevention Act of 2007, a bill concerned with the \nNation's growing gang problem. I want to thank Senator Feinstein for \nher tireless work on this issue over many years and, in particular, for \nworking diligently with me to address my concerns and to formulate what \nI hope we all agree is an even better gang bill.\n  Violent crime in America is again on the rise. This troubling news is \nin my view at least in part the result of the Bush administration's \nfailure to heed the lessons learned from our successful fight against \nviolent crime in the 1990s. Congress and the Clinton administration \nprovided significant new funding to strengthen State and local law \nenforcement and supported programs to prevent gang and youth violence. \nOur efforts worked. Studies have repeatedly shown that, violent crime \nand gang offenses steadily dropped to historic lows. But the Bush \nadministration chose a different course, and, despite warnings from me \nand others, has repeatedly cut funding for State and local cops on the \nbeat and community programs targeting the prevention of youth crime.\n  I hope that this bill will be part of a return to productive law \nenforcement strategies that worked so well in the past. I share the \nviews expressed at the hearing in June by Los Angeles Police Chief \nWilliam J. Bratton that ``we can't arrest our way out of our gang crime \nproblem.'' As those who have worked on this issue for years know all \ntoo well, we must match our commitment to law enforcement with an equal \ncommitment to intervention and prevention as a means of curbing gang \nviolence. Neither strategy works without the other, and I believe, as \nso many law enforcement and civil leaders do, that any legislative \nproposal to address gang violence must focus on new means to prevent \nyouth and gang violence. I am glad that Senator Feinstein's bill now \nreflects these priorities.\n  The Gang Abatement and Prevention Act of 2007 represents a \nsignificant improvement over earlier gang legislation. It does not \ncontain the death penalties, mandatory minimums, and expansive juvenile \ntransfer provisions that were among my strongest objections to some \npast proposals. Further, Senator Feinstein has worked with me and \nothers to ensure that this bill will provide some of the resources \nnecessary to reverse the policies of this administration, which have \nneglected the officers who combat gang violence on a daily basis and \nthe organizations that work to keep children out of gangs. I \nparticularly appreciate provisions in the bill to provide up to $1 \nbillion over 10 years to support collaborative law enforcement and \ncommunity prevention efforts, with a significant portion of that amount \ngoing to civic groups for innovative prevention programs that truly \nwork to reduce gang violence.\n  I have long said that I don't believe that sweeping new Federal \ncrimes, which federalize the kind of street crime that States have \ntraditionally addressed and can handle with the right resources and \nassistance, are the right way to go. The bill still contains more \nemphasis on federalizing crime and mandating sentences than I would \nlike. But I have tried to work with Senator Feinstein to reduce its \nimpact on the sphere of criminal law traditionally handled by the \nStates and to focus on the most serious offenders and conduct, for \nwhich Federal attention is needed. I also appreciate Senator Feinstein \nand Senator Schumer working with Senator Whitehouse and me to ensure \nthat small States such as Rhode Island and Vermont could be eligible \nunder the bill to receive crucially important witness protection \ngrants.\n  We all care deeply about eradicating gang violence, and we must work \ntogether to create a comprehensive solution to this troubling, \npersistent problem. I hope that this bill will be a step toward \nreversing the mistakes of the Bush administration and reinvigorating \nour efforts to provide Federal support for those who combat gang \nviolence every day and to protect those who are its victims.\n  Mr. HATCH. I rise today to congratulate my fellow Senators on the \npassage of the Gang Abatement and Prevention Act of 2007. This vital \nlegislation makes important changes to the federal criminal code which \nwill allow a more effective response to the ever growing threat that \nviolent street gangs present to our society.\n  Americans are acutely aware of the myriad problems brought about by \nthe influence and prevalence of criminal gangs in this country. I have \nlong shared this concern, and introduced legislation over 10 years ago \nthat attempted to address the problem. Senator Feinstein joined me in \nthat effort, and since that time has pursued this matter with a vigor \nand tenacity that should make the residents of California proud. I want \nto offer my heartfelt congratulations and appreciation to Senator \nFeinstein for her tireless efforts in sponsoring this bill, and am \npleased that our combined efforts over the\n\n[[Page S11965]]\n\nyears have brought us one step closer to having this legislation signed \ninto law.\n  I believe that all members of the Senate share their constituents' \ndesire to see a diminished role of gangs and associated violence in our \ncommunities. The question is very simple: How do we achieve this goal?\n  The prevailing thought is to either modify the criminal code or \nprovide financial assistance that enhances procedures and programs that \nhave been proven to effectively reduce gang participation. The bill \nthat passed today does both of these things, and it is my hope that the \nvital tools in this initiative can be utilized by state and local \npersonnel to provide for a greatly diminished threat from criminal \nstreet gangs.\n  One thing I want to make perfectly clear is that my involvement with \nthis issue does not diminish my concerns with the federalization of \ncrimes. I want to read a few sentences I said on the Senate Floor in \n1996 when introducing the Federal Gang Violence Act of 1996: ``Our \nproblem is severe. Moreover, there is a significant role the Federal \nGovernment can play in fighting this battle. I am not one to advocate \nthe unbridled extension of Federal jurisdiction. Indeed, I often think \nthat we have federalized too many crimes. However, in the case of \ncriminal street gangs, which increasingly are moving interstate to \ncommit crimes, there is a very proper role for the Federal Government \nto play.''\n  I said this in 1996, and my thoughts have not changed. The federal \ngovernment too many times hands out money like a broken ATM, \nsubsidizing projects that are more appropriately left to the states. \nHowever, the fact that Gangs have operations which spread throughout \nour country necessitates a federal law enforcement response. I am \nconfident that Americans would approve of their tax dollars being \neffectively utilized in attempts to reduce gangs and criminal activity, \nand provide a safer environment for their families.\n  The young people who join criminal gangs have made an unfortunate \nchoice to squander all of the opportunities available in their life, \nopportunities which are abundant in our great nation. But even worse, \ntheir choice to participate in violent gang crimes put the lives of \ninnocent Americans in danger. The same innocent people who have rightly \nchosen to live their life in a productive manner benefiting fellow \ncitizens.\n  Numerous cities in my home state of Utah, such as Orem, St. George, \nand Provo are facing an increase in gang activity. National gangs, like \nMS-13, are expanding their presence in Utah. Law enforcement is also \nreporting an increase in gang members relocating from areas of Southern \nCalifornia. It is vital that we provide immediate assistance to cities \nthat are in the beginning stages of a battle with highly sophisticated \nnational gangs. If a city can't deal with this problem swiftly and \nseverely, then the gangs will fester like a disease, amplifying to an \nunmanageable level. We have seen this throughout the country, and I am \ndedicated to ensure that the cities in Utah and other states receive \nappropriate and necessary assistance from Congress to increase \ncommunity prevention efforts.\n  I applaud the efforts of lawmakers whose tireless efforts produced \nthis bill, and am hopeful that the funds provided for prevention and \nmentoring can be utilized to help negate the persistent efforts of \ngangs to augment their ranks with additional kids. Life provides many \nchoices, and I hope that our youth will find the strength and courage \nto resist the gang lifestyle.\n  I recognize that there is no mechanism which can easily remove the \nscourge of criminal gangs, but am confident that this bill will provide \nresources which can enhance and amplify the efforts of dedicated \npersonnel who endeavor to bestow positive influence to our communities.\n  Mr. CASEY.
