Mr. President, let me say that at this moment we are on \nThursday of this workweek with the possibility and likelihood of a \ncloture vote tomorrow morning in the Senate. If one looks at the \nbusiness of the Senate this week, it is a good thing we are not being \npaid for piecework because we have done so little.\n  We had an initial motion to go to this climate security bill, which \nis an important piece of legislation. That was considered early in the \nweek, and then a second measure, which was very brief, on adopting a \nbudget--an important document but one that had already been debated at \nlength many times in this Chamber. We burned 30 hours off the clock in \nwhat was requested for a general debate. That, of course, took place, \nand it was a good debate: a bipartisan effort to explain an important \nbill involving global warming and carbon pollution which is changing \nthe world we live in.\n  Then a request was made yesterday by the Republican leader that this \nbill, the Climate Security Act, be read in its entirety into the \nRecord. So for 8 hours, our staff had to stand and read every word of \nthis bill into the Record. This bill--the substitute--had been \navailable for days and the concepts behind it for weeks. There was no \nelement of surprise, no necessity for this reading, other than to burn \noff an entire day in the Senate where little or nothing was \naccomplished. Now we face virtually the same thing again.\n  Although 89 percent of the people in America say that global warming \nis an important issue that should be addressed by the Senate, this week \nthere have been repeated efforts to make sure we never reach that \npoint. Those who oppose this bill should stand and vote accordingly. \nThose who have amendments should bring them forward. We are still \nwaiting for a list of amendments to the global warming bill from the \nRepublican side. We have given them a list of our amendments, including \na bipartisan amendment offered by Senator Lugar, who just spoke on the \nfloor, and Senator Biden. We have tried to engage the minority in a \ndebate on this critically important bill, but instead, they have \nengaged in delay tactics, including 8 hours wasted in the Senate \nyesterday reading this bill in its entirety.\n\n  We finally adjourned at about 12:15 a.m. this morning to return \ntoday. I guess it is the intention of the Republicans to stop us from \nconsidering the global warming issue, but that will not stop the \ndangers being created by global warming in the United States and around \nthe world. If we are truly elected to lead, I cannot understand why the \nRepublican minority will not engage us in a meaningful and honest \ndebate about this bill. That is why we are here. We should be voting on \namendments, testing different theories and policies to see what the \nmajority feels in the Senate, but instead, we are caught up in this \nexercise: 8 hours of reading this bill--a tremendous waste of time and \nenergy that the Senate should have put to more productive purposes.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/05/senate-section/article/S5128-3", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5128]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, since the substitute amendment by \nSenator Boxer was just given to us at 11 o'clock in the morning, you \ncould argue--almost with a straight face--that reading the proposal was \na good idea, but, of course, that was not what it was about. It was \nsomewhat similar to when Senator Reid, the now-majority leader, used 9 \nhours reading chapters from his book back in 2003. In a 9-hour \nfilibuster over judicial nominations, on November 19, 2003, Democratic \nleader Harry Reid discoursed on the virtues of wooden matches and read \nchapters from his book about his hometown: ``Searchlight: The Camp That \nDidn't Fail.'' That was a 9-hour recitation from a book that our good \nfriend the majority leader engaged in on the very subject of judicial \nconfirmations.\n  Yesterday's tactic of slowing down the Senate obviously is not \nunique. It was not, however, about trying to confirm a few district \ncourt nominations which the majority begrudgingly agreed to last night \naround 12:00 or 12:30. Rather, it was about the importance of keeping \none's word in this body, whether it be a commitment to meet the total \nnumber of circuit court confirmations that have occurred in prior \nCongresses--and we are familiar with what that commitment was; it was \nto do 17 during this Congress, which has been repeated time and time \nagain; everybody knows what the commitment was--or a commitment to \nconfirm a specific number of circuit court nominations by a specific \ntime; and that was the commitment made back in May by my good friend \nthe majority leader, that we would do three circuit court nominations \nbefore the Memorial Day recess. In fact, we did one. Keeping one's word \nin this body is important.\n  We are far behind the pace that is necessary for us to reach the goal \nthe majority leader and I set for this Congress. If that weren't \ntroubling enough, what we heard recently by the chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee are threats to shut down the confirmation process \ncompletely. Stop it already. Surely, that is not his plan. So be \nassured the Republican Conference will continue to make the point that \njudicial nominations need to be treated fairly and that commitments \nneed to be kept, and we will use the tools available to the minority to \ndo so until that proves to be the case. This is not over, I assure you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/05/senate-section/article/S5128-5", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5128-S5129]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          CLIMATE SECURITY ACT\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the majority leader said recently that \nglobal warming was ``the most important issue facing the world today.'' \nLet me repeat that: the most important issue affecting the world today. \nAnd nearly three-fourths of the Senate thought it was important enough \nto have a debate on the Senate floor. Seventy-four Senators voted to \nbring this measure to the floor for debate because they recognized the \nsignificance of this issue. Yet the majority is blocking fair \nconsideration.\n  Instead of allowing a full debate with an open amendment process \ndesigned to improve the bill, the majority last night filled the tree. \nWhat are they afraid of? Why don't they want to consider amendments to \na bill addressing what they call ``the most important issue facing the \nworld today''? If it is the most important issue facing the world \ntoday, it certainly deserves a lot longer debate than a few days.\n\n[[Page S5129]]\n\n  At $6.7 trillion, the climate tax bill--which is what we have before \nus--the climate tax bill is the largest bill we will consider this \nCongress. As the Wall Street Journal noted, this legislation represents \nthe most extensive--the most extensive--reorganization of the American \neconomy since the 1930s, which is why, of course, I am mystified as to \nwhy the Democrats decided to block the consideration of any and all \namendments designed to improve this bill: no consideration of gas \nprices, no consideration of clean energy technology. A bill with such \nwidespread ramifications merits serious, thoughtful consideration and a \nthorough debate.\n  A good example of how to handle a bill like this properly, another \ntime when our good friends on the other side were in the majority--and \nthere was a Republican in the White House--when the Senate considered \nthe Clean Air Act amendments in 1990, the process took 5 weeks on the \nfloor. There were about 180 amendments offered. I was here then, and \nnobody was telling one side or the other what they had to offer. Nobody \nsaid you have to show me your amendment first or I will not let you \noffer it. And 131 of those amendments were ultimately acted upon by the \nfull Senate.\n  As it currently stands, we would not even spend 5 days on this bill. \nBut we would like to spend more time on the bill and would encourage \nthe majority to open the process. I don't know what they are afraid of. \nSince when did we descend to the point in this body that we would not \nlet somebody offer an amendment unless they get to read it first? That \nisn't the way the Senate used to operate. Yet the majority blocked us \nfrom offering even one amendment regarding this massive restructuring.\n  That makes me wonder, why doesn't the majority want a fair debate on \nthis bill? What are we afraid of? If this bill alone will ``save the \nplanet,'' as has been suggested, why are they refusing to allow an open \ndebate or more than 2 days on the bill?\n  Perhaps they don't want to expose this bill for what it really is: a \nclimate tax. It is a climate tax. This legislation will raise gas \nprices, electricity prices, diesel prices, natural gas prices, and \nfertilizer prices. It will also put America at a significant economic \ndisadvantage compared to the rest of the world.\n  Given that families are already struggling to pay record gas prices--\nit is nearly $4 a gallon now--Congress should be working to lower gas \nprices, not increase them.\n  Republicans are eager to offer amendments to the Boxer climate tax \nbill to develop clean energy solutions and promote economic growth. In \nAmerica, we tackle problems like this with technology, not by clamping \ndown on our own economy. If this is a problem--and many of us believe \nit is--the way to get at it is with technology and then sell it to the \nIndians and Chinese, who, I assure you, are not going to do this to \ntheir own economies. They are going to take advantage of our foolish \ndecision to clamp down our own economy and have jobs exported to China \nand India.\n  If the majority is serious about debating this issue, then let's have \na real debate, complete with an open amendment process. Don't shut it \ndown after only 1 day.\n  This is entirely too important to consumers, to our economy, and to \nthe climate to block a thorough consideration.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/05/senate-section/article/S5129-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5129]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      ONE-YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF THE PASSING OF SENATOR CRAIG THOMAS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, a year ago yesterday marked the \noccasion of the loss of our good friend and colleague, Craig Thomas, \nwho was the senior Senator from Wyoming at the time. He lost his battle \nwith leukemia at the age of 74.\n  Born and raised in Cody, WY, a town named after Buffalo Bill, Craig \nwas brought up on a ranch. He brought those values of America's western \nsmall towns to our Nation's Capital.\n  So the Senator from America's smallest State by population, home to a \nrugged and independent-minded people, was one of the Senate's leading \nadvocates for a smaller, more efficient, and more responsive \ngovernment.\n  Other Senators who got to know Craig found him to be always polite \nand courteous. Yet that did not make him a pushover. A Marine captain, \nwho rose to that rank from the rank of private, Craig was a man of \ndiscipline and a man of principle. He was a perfect fit for the people \nand the values of his great State.\n  As accomplished as he was, Senator Thomas was also not afraid to poke \na little fun at himself as well. I know he once displayed a series of \npictures in his Senate office of himself trying his hand at roping a \nhorse. The pictures depict, one by one, his less than successful \nattempts, and then his unceremonious fall off his steed and onto the \ndirt.\n  Many of my colleagues will remember his subtle sense of humor, his \nskill at working with others to advance legislation, and his passion \nfor promoting the best interests of Wyoming.\n  I know my colleagues continue to hold his dear wife Susan, a great \nfriend of all of us, and their four children, Peter, Patrick, Greg, and \nLexie, in our thoughts. We still consider them members of our Senate \nfamily.\n  I also know how much Craig would be pleased that Senators Mike Enzi \nand John Barrasso are holding to the high standards he set and making \nWyoming proud.\n  A man of grit and courage, Craig never backed down from a challenge, \nnot even his final struggle with leukemia. Through the end of his life, \nhe represented Wyoming with honor and dignity. Admired by all who knew \nhim, he leaves behind a legacy of legislative accomplishment, as well \nas a Chamber full of very dear friends in the Senate. We still miss him \na lot.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The assistant majority leader is \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/05/senate-section/article/S5129-2", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5129-S5130]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             GLOBAL WARMING\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I want to say a word about the issue of \nglobal warming. I notice that my colleagues are waiting to speak in \ntribute to Craig Thomas, and I will also say a word about that.\n  I have to agree with Senator Reid when he said that global warming is \none of the most important issues of our age. I believe he said it was \nthe most important global issue and, of course, we realize whatever our \nundertaking may be in life, it is of little value if we don't live on a \nplanet that can sustain life. That is what we are worried about--that \nwe have warming and carbon pollution that is changing the planet on \nwhich we live.\n  I cannot think of a more formidable challenge that we have ever \nfaced. That is why we think it is important to move forward with this \nlegislation. The notion that we have blocked all amendments is not \ntrue. We have said to the Republicans repeatedly: Provide us with the \namendments. Show us what you are going to offer. Here is what we will \noffer. I think that is a good-faith effort--at least on our side--to \ntry to start this important debate. Yet the Republican side has \nrefused. They took 30 hours of general debate and didn't produce \namendments. They asked that this bill be read for 8 hours, and they \ndidn't produce any amendments.\n  Our fear, of course, is that when the time for actual debate begins, \nwithout any indication of what they might offer, we will face the same \nthing we did on the GI bill. If you recall that legislation, which was \nto help our returning veterans, it was stopped in its tracks by an \namendment offered on the Republican side, with a cloture motion filed. \nThat meant that 30 hours had to be burned off the clock while we waited \nfor the cloture motion to ripen.\n  Now, that is use of a procedure here which doesn't advance the debate \nor deliberations. So we asked for assurances from the Republican side. \nWe asked is this going to be a good-faith effort to debate and amend \nthis bill? Will you produce the amendments? They would not. It is clear \nthey don't want to. They are opposed to this bill. We have seen this \nbefore. We have had 72 filibusters during this session. We have broken \nall of the records of the Senate. The Republican minority has stopped \nus time and again when we have tried to bring up critically important \nissues for our Nation and the world.\n  President Bush and the Republicans have dismissed this issue of \nglobal\n\n[[Page S5130]]\n\nwarming, and I think that is why many Americans are dismissing their \nchances of speaking to the needs of this Nation. This is a critically \nimportant issue. If this Republican minority will not allow us to reach \nit, I predict the American voters will have the last words. We will \nreach this issue. They will demand that we reach this issue.\n  All of the fear being spread here about change in America is \nindicative of the problem the Republicans have today. They are afraid \nof change. Anything that will change things scares them. They don't \nthink America is resilient enough and powerful enough to accept change. \nThey are wrong.\n  Our Nation desperately wants change, starting in Washington, and \nrippling across America, to deal with the issues that face us--first \nand foremost, to bring peace to our Nation, bring our troops home, \nstabilize and strengthen our economy, and deal with critical issues, \nsuch as global warming.\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Yes, I am happy to.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I just ask the distinguished assistant \nmajority leader if he and the Democratic majority would agree to an \namendment designed to help bring down the price of gasoline at the pump \nfor the American consumer, and whether they would agree to allow us to \nfile that amendment, debate that amendment on this bill, and then have \nan up-or-down vote on the Senate floor?\n  Mr. DURBIN. My response is that we are on another bill now, while we \nare waiting for cloture to ripen on the global warming bill. It is our \nintention to move directly into the debate that you have just \nindicated. We have to deal with energy pricing in America. If the \nRepublican side is going to offer a good-faith policy amendment to deal \nwith this issue, I am sure that will be appropriate.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I take it from the answer of the assistant \nmajority leader that his answer is no.\n  Mr. DURBIN. The answer is yes.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I take it that they would not allow us to offer an \namendment on this bill that would be designed to bring down the price \nof gasoline at the pump by opening America's natural resources to \ndevelopment and production.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, time and time again we are told by the \nRepublican side, if we could just drill for oil in the Arctic National \nWildlife Refuge, all of our prayers would be answered and gasoline \nwould be $1.50 a gallon, people would stop complaining, and the \nAmerican economy would be back on its feet. It turns out this idea of \ndrilling for oil in ANWR is not the answer to our prayers. For many of \nus, it is somewhat blasphemous to think we would take a section of land \nthat was set aside by President Eisenhower as a wildlife refuge and say \nthat we are so desperate in America for oil that we are going to change \nit forever.\n  It strikes me that we have to look at the reality. Of all the oil \nreserves in the world, the United States has access in our boundaries, \nnear our shores, to 3 percent of all the oil in the world. We consume \n25 percent of the oil in the world. The Republicans believe we can \ndrill our way out--drill in the Great Lakes, drill in the ANWR--and it \nwill all be just fine. We know better. We have to take an honest look \nat this and realize that drilling in those places will not answer the \nneed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/05/senate-section/article/S5130-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5130]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING SENATOR THOMAS\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.

It was a wonderful, \nbeautiful service. He was such a quiet and strong man. He and I \ndisagreed on lots of issues, but I respected him so much. I think his \nreal strength was shown in his last battle with leukemia and cancer. \nCraig kept a smile on his face, despite some very difficult days. His \nwife Susan at his side out in Wyoming was a reminder that we are really \na Senate family.\n  We can debate issues back and forth, as we just did, but at the end \nof the day, I think he was a great Senator who served his State well, \nand it was an honor that I could count him as a friend.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/05/senate-section/article/S5130-2", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5130]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, 1 year ago yesterday, the State of Wyoming \nand our Nation lost one of the great cowboys ever to ride this land. On \nJune 4, 2007, Senator Craig Thomas, my senior Senator, my mentor, and \nmost important of all, my friend, lost his battle with leukemia. I \nstill expect to see him come in that door every time we vote and go \nover to the candy desk and get a piece of candy and come down to the \nwell to visit with me.\n  I can tell you right now, I feel him over my shoulder saying: You \ncannot let the Senator from Illinois get away with what he just said. \nThat is what Craig would do. He used to do it from that desk right over \nthere.\n  Craig would have said that honesty, truth, and promises are virtues \nof the West. When you promise three circuit court judges, you deliver \nthem. They did not deliver. That is why, yesterday, we weren't able to \ndo the tributes that we are doing today.\n  When it comes to the global warming issue, he would have said \n``gotcha'' politics doesn't have a place here. But that is what they \nare doing on issue after issue.\n  How do you tell it is ``gotcha'' politics? If it didn't go to \ncommittee, it is ``gotcha'' politics. Oh, yes, they would argue that \nglobal warming went to committee. Well, a bill went to committee, but \nthat is not the bill that we have shifted to. We have shifted to one \nthat didn't go to committee. It is full of little landmines. That is \nnot the way we used to do things around here. I know my friend, Craig, \nwould have pointed that out. Both the cowboy and the marine in Craig \nThomas would have been forced to point that out--to be honest, get the \njudges up; be honest, do the bills that go through the committee that \neverybody has a chance to amend.\n  As Craig comes through the door, which he does in my mind all the \ntime, I symbolically lift my hat to him, to celebrate the life of a \ngreat Senator.\n  He was raised in Wapiti, WY. That is between Cody and Yellowstone \nPark. The school he went to now has about an 8-foot fence to keep \ngrizzly bears out. Craig was so tough, they didn't need that fence when \nhe went to school there. He was executive director of the Wyoming Farm \nBureau, executive director of the Wyoming Rural Electric Association, \nhe was a small businessman, a State legislator, a Member of the U.S \nHouse of Representatives, and a Senator. He was a marine at heart, but \nhe was a cowboy in his soul. He was quiet. He was focused. He was \ntough. He was a staunch fiscal conservative. His life became a portrait \nof the American West. He preferred to see the world from the saddle of \na horse and from under the brim of his cowboy hat, but he sacrificed \nmuch to serve us here.\n  He was proud of Wyoming and our country, and we in Wyoming were proud \nto be represented by him. He encouraged vision, Mr. President, and, as \nyou can tell, he still challenges me and, I think, you. The cowboy and \nmarine in Craig made him a fierce fighter on behalf of Wyoming, and he \napproached his cancer no differently.\n  I will never forget when I learned about my friend's passing. I was \novercome with shock and heartbreak, but I also felt a sense of \nserenity, knowing that Craig was at peace.\n\n[[Page S5131]]\n\n  I can tell my colleagues that even a year later, not a day goes by \nwithout thoughts of memories of Craig passing my mind. I miss him. I \nmiss him in this Senate Chamber. I miss him on the trail back home in \nWyoming. I miss his camaraderie, his friendship, his leadership, and \nhis unwavering commitment to the values and ideals of the people he \nserved.\n  Although a year has passed since Craig left us, his spirit is alive \nand it is felt by all of us within this body. Work he championed on \nbehalf of Wyoming residents and all Americans is ongoing today. As a \nrecent example, Craig was a staunch supporter of country-of-origin \nlabeling. He saw it as a vital provision for our State's livestock \nproducers, and I know he would be proud to see COOL finally passed as \npart of the farm bill. It is something we had been working on together \nfor many years.\n  Craig's spirit has also been remembered here on the Senate floor with \nthe passage of a resolution designating July 26, 2008, National Day of \nthe American Cowboy. Craig was the driving force behind the recognition \nof cowboys on a national scale for the past 3 years, and I am proud we \nhave continued that tradition and are following in his footsteps.\n  Known for his love of the outdoors and the cowboy way of life, \nCraig's name has been recognized in Wyoming through a number of \ndedications in the past year. The Department of Interior recently named \na large area of public land the ``Craig Thomas Little Mountain Special \nManagement Area.'' Now more than 69,000 acres of land surrounding the \nmajestic Big Horn Mountains will be enjoyed and cherished by \ngenerations of Wyoming residents to come.\n  Also, at Grand Teton National Park in Jackson, the new visitors \ncenter now bears his name and will help us always to remember Craig's \ndedication to the land he loved so much.\n  His wife Susan, a close friend of mine and Diana's, continues to \nhonor Craig's legacy every day in the work she does as well. She is a \nchampion of the National Capital Chapter of the Leukemia and Lymphoma \nSociety, raising money for research and fighting against the blood \ncancer that took her husband's life. She also created the Craig and \nSusan Thomas Foundation. It is a scholarship program for at-risk youth \nseeking to continue their education at a Wyoming institution of higher \nlearning. Susan, throughout her whole life, worked with at-risk youth \nand is now continuing it with this memorial. The cause she has taken on \nembodies everything Craig stood for and believed in. Susan's efforts \nevery day are a tribute to his memory, and that foundation is something \nin which we all can participate.\n  Craig was a fine legislator, a dedicated public servant, and above \nall a kind, humble, and courageous man. With the heart of a marine and \nthe soul of a cowboy, he worked tirelessly and selflessly for Wyoming.\n  To my colleagues here today, I pray we never forget this man's legacy \nand the exceptional standard of public service he set for all of us--to \nserve the people with respect and integrity, always remembering it is \nof the utmost honor to serve. With a sense of humor, you will recall he \nalways said, ``Don't squat with your spurs on,'' in his trademark \nwestern grace. Craig was the modern-day cowboy fighting for the \nprinciples that made this country great.\n  Craig, I will never forget you. You are in my heart every day. We \nmiss you, cowboy. Thank you for everything you have done for Wyoming \nand this great Nation. Ride on, my friend, ride on.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I thank the minority leader, the \nassistant majority leader, and Wyoming's senior Senator for taking the \ntime to remember a departed friend and an esteemed colleague.\n  Wyoming's U.S. Senator Craig Thomas passed peacefully June 4, 2007, 1 \nyear ago this week. Craig was surrounded, as always, by his devoted \nwife Susan, by his family, and by close friends.\n  Wyoming has lost a great man. We have lost many great men and women \nover the years, but Craig Thomas leaves behind a legacy equal to all of \nthem. Yet Craig would be the first one to question that praise. Craig \nwould say he was a common man, a typical cowboy who wanted simply to \nwork hard and make a difference for the people of the place he loved. \nOne year later, it is appropriate and right that we remember him again \nin the Senate and also in our own lives.\n  Many of my colleagues joined us in my hometown of Casper, WY, to \nmourn Craig's passing. The words and presence of Senator Reid and \nSenator McConnell were especially meaningful to the people of Wyoming. \nPresident Bush and Vice President Cheney each extolled Craig's \ncharacter and devotion to the Wyoming people and Wyoming places.\n  But perhaps more to what Craig really meant to the people was the \nexceptional outpouring of very personal remembrances that followed his \npassing. In the halls of the U.S. Capitol, elevator operators, \ncashiers, janitors, office staff--each would say what a wonderful \nperson Craig Thomas was. His staff, many of whom are now serving with \nme, speak about his kindness and the family character that was the \nhallmark in his office. It was Craig's nature.\n  In Wyoming, from all walks of life, so many reflected their \nexperiences with Craig that left each of their lives a little brighter. \nThey recalled his loyalty and his commitment to their future, \nespecially the young people.\n  In Wyoming, after Craig's passing, folks in each town, in each \ncommunity talked about the personal loss they felt. They wrote about it \nin newspapers and in messages left online because Craig gave so much of \nhimself. Craig took time each day, every day to talk to you, to say \nhello, and not to simply pass by. He saw everyone, whoever you are.\n  Because he gave his time to Wyoming and to this body and to \nindividuals who needed help, he is remembered. He gave his passion, he \ngave his leadership, and his tireless energy to make this a better \nplace.\n  Ronald Reagan said:\n\n       Some people wonder all their lives if they've made a \n     difference. The Marines don't have that problem.\n\n  Craig was Wyoming's marine, and we will never need to wonder if he \nmade a difference. Craig Thomas represented honor and dignity. Admired \nby those who knew him, he has given us a legacy of legislative \naccomplishment, a brilliant example of what one can do with a life \nlived with determination, with strength of character, and with vision.\n  To Lexie, Peter, Greg, and Patrick, and all those amazing \ngrandchildren, we again offer our most heartfelt condolences.\n  Susan, today, like each day, we remember Craig for the great man he \nwas and what he meant to Wyoming, for what he accomplished and how he \ndid it, for what he taught us and how he touched so many.\n\n  Susan has created the Craig and Susan Thomas Foundation. For all of \nthose who miss Craig and want to see the great work in education that \nshe is continuing, I invite you to go to her Web site, thomas-\nfoundation.com. It is important and lasting work in Wyoming that \ncontinues the Thomas legacy of making a difference one life at a time.\n  To my Senate colleagues and to the people of Wyoming, remember--\nremember that leadership takes courage, as Craig Thomas demonstrated in \nhis remarkable life.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I thank my fellow Senator from Wyoming for \nhis comments and thank him for the way he has filled in and followed \nthe legacy Senator Thomas began and the work he has done on the issues \nthat were undone when Senator Thomas left us, his work on the Wyoming \nrange and his work on the wild scenic rivers and also on our joint \neffort to make sure Richard Honecker gets a vote as a judge. That is a \nnomination Senator Thomas offered well before he left. In fact, he has \nbeen waiting around--not that I am keeping track--443 days. There has \nbeen no vote on him yet in committee, so we cannot vote on the \nnomination on the floor. This is an outstanding person, rated highly by \neverybody and letters of recommendations from both Democrats and \nRepublicans in Wyoming who would really like to have a vote. So his \nlife has been in suspension.\n\n[[Page S5132]]\n\n  I thank Senator Barrasso for the work he as done on that issue and \nthe kind words about Senator Thomas, and I thank Senator Barrasso for \nfilling in.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I miss Craig Thomas. I loved him, and I \nwish I had told him that more explicitly. He is worthy of the ultimate \ncomment and praise given in my area of the country: He was a good man. \nAnd he truly was. He combined strength and genuine modesty. He was wise \nand insightful on important issues without any show of pride or \npomposity. He had integrity. He was a man's man. He was comfortable in \nhis skin. He was a man of courage. Most especially, he was a man of \nprinciple, much like one of his heroes, Ronald Reagan.\n  Craig was truly also a man of the West. It was in his bones. And he \nhad in his very being a love for America and a deep understanding--\nintellectual and intuitive--of its uniqueness, its exceptionalism, and \nwhy this country is so great. He understood that. His love for America \ncaused him to dedicate his life to her, just as our soldiers and his \nfellow marines place their lives at risk this very moment in service to \nour country.\n  I think that is why he undertook as part of his duties on this side \nto promote a policy principled message each morning in morning business \non the floor. He did that for a number of years. He believed we ought \nto talk about the issues that made America great.\n  Craig Thomas loved his country, he loved his wife Susan and his \nfamily. He loved Wyoming. Truly, he was a good man, and we do indeed \nmiss him.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, let me first thank the Senator from Texas \nfor allowing me to very briefly work in here.\n  It happens that I was elected to the House and then to the Senate at \nthe same time as Craig and Susan Thomas. And you know, sometimes you \nsee someone for the first time and they have, as Senator Enzi pointed \nout, that infectious smile, and that was Craig. That was Craig. \nEveryone had to love Craig.\n  I have thought of him so often during consideration of the bill that \nis on the floor now. Craig had such convictions, but he never quit \nsmiling. What the guy could do is, he could say the same thing I would \nsay and people would love him, but they wouldn't love me. I don't know \nhow he got by with that, but he did.\n  I picture him and where he would be today if he were here while we \nhave a bill on the floor that has an increase in gas taxes, $6.7 \ntrillion of increases in taxes over the life of the bill, with job \nlosses to China, and he wouldn't be sitting there, he would be up here. \nI applaud his replacement, the junior Senator from Wyoming, Senator \nBarrasso. Every time I turn around, he is coming down and saying \nexactly--exactly--what Craig would be saying.\n  I would say this about Craig Thomas: He was always there at our \nSenate prayer breakfast every Wednesday morning. He was a Jesus guy, \nlike we are, and so I don't feel the sadness a lot of people do with \nCraig Thomas, because I can only say right now: Craig, I know you are \nhere with us, and we are going to see you later.\n  I thank my colleague, and I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, may I inquire how much time remains in \nmorning business for this side of the aisle?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has 11\\1/2\\ minutes in \nthe first 30 minutes.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I join my colleagues in invoking the memory of Craig \nThomas. On our side of the aisle, there was nobody more dependable, \nmore loyal, or more of a team player. Whenever there was an important \nissue, particularly one concerning Wyoming or concerning energy, he \nwould be down here talking about it and he would be enlightening the \ndebate, and we miss him. I can't help but think he would be down here \non this particular piece of legislation, as Senator Enzi has alluded, \nin talking about what is obviously a game of ``gotcha.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/05/senate-section/article/S5132-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5132-S5133]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          CLIMATE SECURITY ACT\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, this is a bill where we are actually on \nour third version, I believe. The fourth version of the bill. I stand \ncorrected by the ranking member of the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee, Senator Inhofe. The last one I saw went from 342 pages to \n491 pages. That was the one that was read yesterday. I daresay that not \nmany, if any Senator who is going to be called upon to vote on that \nlegislation, had a chance to read it yet in detail. So I don't think it \nwas a wasted exercise to have the clerk read the bill yesterday to give \npeople a chance to understand what is in it.\n  When you look at a piece of legislation that comes with a $6.7 \ntrillion pricetag, and one that will raise and not lower the price of \ngasoline and electricity, will depress the American economy and \nliterally put people out of work, I think we need to know what is in it \nand we need to debate it. We need to offer amendments to hopefully \nimprove it.\n  There is not one among us who does not care about the environment. I \ndon't know any person of good will alive who doesn't care about the \nquality of the air we breathe and the cleanliness of the water we \ndrink. So I think those who would suggest that because there are \nquestions about this huge bill, this huge tax increase, this huge \nincrease in the cost of energy, that if you are asking questions and \nwant to offer amendments to improve it suggests you don't care about \nthe environment is demonstrably false.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CORNYN. I will yield.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, Senator Cornyn is a fabulous and \nimportant Senator. He knows what has been happening here on all the \nimportant issues and he knows the importance of certain actions on the \nfloor.\n  Senator Reid, last night, as I understand it, stood and filled the \ntree. As I understand it, that impacts directly the ability of persons \non this side to freely offer amendments; is that correct, I ask Senator \nCornyn?\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I say to the distinguished Senator from \nAlabama that he is exactly right. To come out here on the floor, as the \nassistant majority leader has done this morning, and say, Oh, we are \ninterested in full debate and amendments and we regret the delay that \noccurred yesterday from the reading of the bill, yet at the same time \nto say no Member of the Senate can offer an amendment because of the \nactions of the majority leader, unless the majority leader gives the \ngreen light, is at odds with that claim. It is not a demonstration, \nfrom my perspective, of a desire to have an open debate and an amended \nprocess.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. And so that act was a knowing and deliberate leadership \nact by the majority leader that fundamentally says unless he approves \nan amendment, whether it is offered by those who favor the legislation \nor oppose it, that is a significant event that constricts free \namendments on this bill; is that not correct?\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I say to the Senator from Alabama, again \nhe is correct. I think what it demonstrates is that the professed \ndesire to actually do something about this important issue is, in fact, \nnothing more than a political game. Because I predict what will happen \nis that because he is blocking any amendments and an open debate about \nthe bill, we will have a vote on the cloture motion, it will fail, and \nthen the majority leader will attempt to pull this bill from the floor \nand consideration. I hope Members of the Senate will prevent that from \nhappening by denying cloture on any future motions to proceed to other \nlegislation. I think it is important that we have the kind of debate \nthat a bill of this import and this size deserves.\n  If I can refer my colleagues to this chart, which is produced, I \nbelieve, by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Senator Dorgan, the Senator \nfrom North Dakota, the other day said this bill pales in comparison to \n``Hillary Care'' in terms of its complexity. I remember seeing the \ncharts at the time of the\n\n[[Page S5133]]\n\nhuge bureaucracy that would have been created by that government-run \nhealth care system proposed by Senator Clinton when she was the First \nLady of the United States. I think it was back in 1993.\n  But this chart, produced by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, reflects \nall of the regulations and mandates of the Boxer climate tax and it \nindicates the complexity of what has been proposed here, and why I \nguess it shouldn't be surprising that the pricetag comes in at $6.7 \ntrillion, and where the Federal Government, through a growth in the \nbureaucracy, an intrusion in the freedom and lives of the American \npeople and small and large businesses alike, will be the one that will \nchoose the winners and losers in this system, who gets the goodies and \nwho does not; who gets permission to operate their powerplant and who \ndoes not. That is why the price of gasoline, that is why the price of \nelectricity is expected to go through the roof as a result of this \nbill.\n  I agree with the Senator from Tennessee, Senator Corker, who called \nthis bill the ``mother of all earmarks.'' There has been a lot of \ndiscussion about earmarks here and lack of transparency in the way \nCongress spends money. Well, this bill, if it is passed and signed by \nthe President of the United States, would empower the Congress to dole \nout earmarks with a complete lack of transparency, in a way that would \nallow massive Government intrusion in the free market system. That is \nwhy the Wall Street Journal dubbed this bill ``the biggest government \nreorganization of the economy since the 1930s.''\n  The National Association of Manufacturers has estimated the economic \nimpact on my State, the State of Texas. We are fortunate now. While \nsome parts of the country are suffering through a headwind when it \ncomes to the economy, we are doing pretty well, relatively speaking. \nUnemployment is at 4.1 percent. A lot of new jobs have been created, a \nlot of opportunity. We have seen a lot of growth in the population \nbecause people are moving to where the jobs and the opportunities are. \nBut under the Boxer climate tax bill that we have before us on the \nfloor of the Senate, it is estimated that 334,000 of my constituents \nwould lose their jobs.\n  Why would they lose their job? Because this bill would be like a wet \nblanket on the economy, raising electricity prices, raising gas prices \non everything from agriculture to small businesses, and it is estimated \nthat it would cost the average Texas household $8,000 in additional \ncosts. Now, that is on top of the $1,400 that most Texas households are \ncurrently having to pay because of increased gas prices due to the \nobstruction of Congress in failing to allow development of American \nnatural resources, an American solution to our energy crisis. It would \nbe a $52 billion loss to the Texas economy. As you see here, it is \nestimated that electricity prices would go up 145 percent and gasoline \nprices 147 percent.\n  I am sorry the assistant majority leader refused to allow us to offer \nan amendment designed to lower gas prices, because I can't think of any \nmore urgent, any more targeted relief we could offer the American \npeople today than to provide some relief for the pain at the pump. I \nthink that should be our highest priority as we go about the process of \ndeveloping a clean energy future for this country, as we transition out \nof an oil-based economy into one for renewable forms of energy and \nincreased nuclear capacity, and one that will improve the climate at \nthe same time.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a quick \nquestion? I don't want to use the Senator's time.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I will yield.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I want it made clear today, as we go into the debate, \nthat when we look back at the clean air amendments of the 1990s, we had \nsomething like 180 amendments considered at that time and we had it on \nthe floor for 5 weeks. This goes much further than those amendments \ndid, and yet they are cutting us off.\n  Let us make it very clear: The Republicans on this side of the aisle \nwant to debate this bill, want to vote, we want recorded votes on \namendments, and we want to vote on the bill itself.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from Oklahoma is \nabsolutely correct. That is why 74 Senators--I believe 74--voted for \nthe motion to proceed, so that we could get on the bill, so we could \noffer amendments, and we have a list of amendments we wish to offer. We \nwish to have debate on those amendments because we think the impact of \nthis proposal would be dramatic on the American people and on the \neconomy and would, in all likelihood, not accomplish the goal Senator \nBoxer professes to want to accomplish.\n  If in fact we impose this Draconian bureaucracy and this huge expense \non the American people, and our competitors in China and India are not \ngoing to do it, we are going to put people out of work in Texas while \npeople in China and India are going to continue to do what they are \ndoing now and enjoying the prosperity caused by their access to the \nenergy which they need to grow their economy. This bill would do \nnothing to impose the same restrictions on them, the same high prices \non them that the Congress proposes to impose on the American people, \nincluding my constituents.\n  So rather than increasing gas prices by 147 percent, I would hope our \nfriends on the other side of the aisle would reconsider and let us take \nup that most urgent issue in the minds of most of our constituents: How \ndo we bring down the price of gas at the pump? I suggest the first \nthing we should do is take advantage of the natural resources God has \ngiven this great country of ours, which Congress has put out of bounds \nbecause of the moratorium on that development going back to, I believe, \n1982.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse).

Mr. President, I am pleased to report to the Senate \nthat the Senate Intelligence Committee has completed its review of \nprewar intelligence related to Iraq. Today the committee filed with the \nSenate and released to the public the two final reports of what has \nbeen called phase 2 of the review. One of these reports examines the \npublic statements of senior policymakers prior to the war and compares \nthose statements to the intelligence that was available to those senior \npolicymakers at the time they made those statements. The second report \nlooks at the intelligence activities of individuals working for the \nOffice of the Under Secretary of Defense Policy.\n  The first of these reports, report on public statements, has \nobviously been the most controversial aspect of the committee's work on \nprewar intelligence. That was inevitable. Much has been said and much \nhas been written since the beginning of the war about how we got into \nit. In the end, the committee did conclude that the administration \nrepeatedly presented intelligence as fact, when in reality it was \nunsubstantiated and often contradicted what they were saying, or even \nwas nonexistent.\n  The committee's July 2004 report found that the prewar assessments on\n\n[[Page S5134]]\n\nintelligence related to weapons of mass destruction were clearly \nflawed. There was a 511-page report and it decimated the whole concept \nof weapons of mass destruction being there. It turned out most of them \nwere left over from the Iran-Iraq war. Nuclear scientists were kept \naround, but they had nothing to do. People began to draw conclusions. \nThey understood, at some of the highest levels, that this intelligence \nwas there, but they ignored it. The report we are releasing today \nindicates that many of the public statements of the Bush administration \nwere, in fact, accurate and substantiated by underlying intelligence, \neven though that intelligence itself was flawed. So we tried to be \nfair. No one, however, should interpret these findings as vindication \nof how the administration was using intelligence to sell to the \nAmerican people and to the Congress the war in Iraq.\n  This report documents significant instances in which the \nadministration went beyond what the intelligence community knew--well \nbeyond what the intelligence committee knew or believed, most notably \non the false assertion that Iraq and al-Qaida had an operational \nrelationship, a partnership, and the manipulative attempt to suggest, \ninaccurately, that Iraq had any complicity in the attacks of September \n11--shockingly wrong statements which were made and made and made.\n  Many of them obviously were made prior to the State of the Union \nAddress in an attempt to prepare American public opinion. But, on the \nother hand, many of them continued well afterwards and even until \nrecently. The committee also found that when administration officials \nwere making statements related to weapons of mass destruction, they \noften spoke in declarative and unequivocal terms that went well beyond \nthe confidence levels reflected in the intelligence community's \nintelligence assessments and products.\n  They omitted caveats. In other words, if the Department of Energy and \nINR in the Department of State, their intelligence wing, disagreed--\nthose were omitted. Anything that didn't agree was omitted, it was \nignored. Dissenting views by intelligence agencies were ignored and did \nnot acknowledge significant gaps in what we knew. In other words, they \nhad a message they were driving and they stopped at nothing to do that.\n  In short, administration officials failed to accurately portray what \nwas known, what was not known, and what was suspected about Iraq and \nthe threat it represented to our national security. When the Nation is \nweighing the decision to go to war, they deserve the complete and \nunvarnished truth, and they did not get it in the buildup to the war in \nIraq.\n  Additionally, the committee found instances where public statements \nselectively used intelligence information which supported a particular \npolicy viewpoint; that is, public statements made by high officials, \nthe highest officials, and at the same time they completely ignored \ncontradictory information that weakened the position which they \ndeclared to be the truth. While on its face the statement might have \nbeen accurate, it nevertheless presented a slanted picture to those who \nwere unaware of the hidden intelligence. Intelligence is complex. It is \nan art, not just a science. You have to establish all aspects of what \ngoes into an intelligence product before you can make any kind of a \ndeclaration or decision.\n  In fact, the committee's report cites several areas in which the \nadministration's public statements were not supported by the \nintelligence, and I very specifically wish to state them now. No. 1, \nstatements and implications by the President and the Secretary of \nState, suggesting Iraq and al-Qaida had a partnership or Iraq had \nprovided al-Qaida with weapons training were not substantiated by the \nintelligence. No. 2, statements by the President and the Vice \nPresident, indicating Saddam Hussein was prepared to give weapons of \nmass destruction to terrorist groups for attacks against the United \nStates were contradicted by available intelligence information. No. 3, \nstatements by President Bush and Vice President Cheney regarding the \npostwar situation in Iraq, in terms of the political security, the \neconomics, et cetera, did not reflect the concerns and uncertainties \nexpressed in the intelligence products. The results have been there for \nus to see. No. 4, statements by the President and Vice President, prior \nto the October 2002 National Intelligence Estimate regarding Iraq's \nchemical weapons production capability and activities, did not reflect \nthe intelligence community's uncertainties as to whether such \nproduction was ongoing. No. 5, the Secretary of Defense statement that \nthe Iraqi Government operated underground WMD--weapons of mass \ndestruction--facilities that were not vulnerable to conventional \nairstrikes because they were underground, so deeply buried--that was \nnot substantiated by available intelligence information. No. 6, the \nintelligence community did not confirm that Mohamed Atta met an Iraqi \nintelligence officer in Prague in 2001, as the Vice President has \nrepeatedly, repeatedly, repeatedly claimed--and may do so again today. \nThat is terribly important. There was all kinds of information which so \ntotally contradicts that it should be embarrassing, but it was not, and \nthey went ahead and used it. No connection between Mohamed Atta and \nIraqi intelligence.\n  In addition, the administration's misuse of intelligence prior to the \nwar was aided by selective declassification of intelligence reporting. \nThe executive branch exercises the prerogative to classify information \nin order to protect national security. Unlike Congress, it can \ndeclassify information unilaterally, and it can do so with great ease. \nThe administration manipulated and exploited this declassification \nauthority in the lead-up to the war, and disclosed intelligence at a \ntime and in a manner of its choosing, knowing others attempting to \ndisclose additional details that might provide balance or improved \naccuracy would be prevented from so doing under the threat of criminal \nprosecution. So they could declassify what they wanted. Nobody else \ncould do anything.\n  This unlevel playing field allowed senior officials to disclose and \ndiscuss sensitive intelligence reports when they supported the \nadministration's policy objectives and keep out of the discourse \ninformation that did not support those objectives.\n  In preparing a report on public statements, the committee \nconcentrated on those statements that were central to the debate over \nthe decision to go to war in 2002-2003. We identified five major policy \nspeeches made by President Bush, Vice President Cheney, and Secretary \nof State Colin Powell during this period as the most significant \nexpressions of how the Bush administration communicated intelligence \njudgments to the American people, to the Congress, and to the \ninternational community. Additional statements made by senior \nadministration officials during this same timeframe, containing \nassertions not included in the major policy speeches, were examined as \nwell and they are part of our report.\n\n  To the point: The statements we examined were made by the individuals \ninvolved in the decision to go to war and in convincing the American \npublic to support that decision. The committee will be criticized for \nnot examining statements made by Members of Congress. A bipartisan \nmajority of the committee--bipartisan--agreed these statements do not \ncarry the same weight of authority as statements made by the President \nand others in the executive branch. It was the President and his senior \nadvisers who were pushing the policy of invasion, not the Congress. In \naddition, Members of Congress did not have--do not have--the same ready \naccess to intelligence as the senior executive branch policymakers. We \ndo not see raw intelligence data. We do not get PDEs. We do not receive \nthe daily briefing and were not briefed every morning by the Nation's \nsenior intelligence officers.\n  It is important to note we did not receive the October NIE, National \nIntelligence Estimate, critical to the vote, until 3 days before the \nSenate was expected to vote. Was that initiated by the administration? \nNo. It was initiated, requested and finally agreed to and then rushed \nup very quickly because Senator Bob Graham was chairman of the \nIntelligence Committee at that time, and he asked for it.\n  As I said, the truth of how intelligence was used or misused is not \nblack and white. Supporters from both sides will point to specific \nfindings in this report to bolster their arguments. I consider that to \nbe evidence that the\n\n[[Page S5135]]\n\ncommittee's findings are fair and objective. Our job was to compare \nstatements to intelligence and render a narrow judgment as to whether \nthe statement was substantiated. In those instances where a statement \nis not substantiated by the intelligence, the committee renders no \njudgment as to why. All we were interested in was the facts.\n  The second report we are releasing today deals with operations of the \nOffice of Under Secretary of Defense for Policy. It is a very important \nreport. A February 2007 report from the Department of Defense inspector \ngeneral addresses many of the issues the committee had originally \nintended to examine relating to this office. That report concluded that \nthe Policy Office of the Pentagon had inappropriately disseminated an \nalternative intelligence analysis, drawing a link between Iraq and al-\nQaida terrorists--again what the administration wanted--who carried out \nthe attacks on September 11. This hypothesis has been thoroughly \nexamined by the intelligence community and no link was found. That, \nhowever, did not stop this office from concocting its own intelligence \nanalysis and presenting it to senior policymakers. The committee first \nuncovered this attempt by DOD policy officials to shape and politicize \nintelligence in order to bolster the administration's policy in our \nJuly 2004 report and the inspector general's review. Both of these were \nconfirmed.\n  The committee's own investigation of the policy office's activities \nhad been abruptly terminated by the former chairman of the Intelligence \nCommittee in July of 2004 because the inspector general's report \nthoroughly covered the issues of alternative analysis when the \ncommittee investigation was restarted in 2007, it focused on \nclandestine meetings between DOD policy officials and Iranians in Rome \nand Paris in 2001 and 2003.\n  These meetings were facilitated by Manucher Ghorbanifar, an Iranian \nexile and intelligence fabricator implicated in the 1986 Iran Contra \nscandal. During these meetings, intelligence was collected, but it was \nnot shared with the intelligence community. It went right around the \nintelligence community, including the CIA. They knew nothing about it. \nGeorge Tenet indicated there was no possible way he knew anything about \nthis.\n  The committee's findings paint a disturbing picture of Pentagon \npolicy officials who were distrustful of the intelligence community and \nundertook the collection of sensitive intelligence without coordinating \ntheir activities. It was a rogue operation. It went to high levels in \nthe administration; it went right to the National Security Council, \ntotally bypassing all other intelligence agencies. It is infuriating \nand not the way intelligence should be handled at all.\n  The actions of DOD officials to blindly disregard the red flags over \nthe role played by Mr. Ghorbanifar in these meetings and to wall off \nthe intelligence community from its activities and the information it \nobtained were improper and demonstrated a fundamental disdain for the \nintelligence community's role in vetting sensitive sources.\n  The committee's 2004 report presented evidence that the DOD policy \noffice attempted to shape the CIA's terrorism analysis in late 2002, \nand when it failed, prepared an alternative intelligence analysis \nattacking the CIA for not embracing a link between Iraq and the 9/11 \nterrorist attacks. So the CIA and the intelligence community were \ntrying to do what they could, and these people were just end-running \nthem because that is what the White House wanted to see. And then, you \nknow, it was a disgrace, an embarrassment to the Nation. The Department \nof Defense inspector general found himself that these actions were \nhighly inappropriate.\n  Our most recent report shows that these rogue actions of this office \nwere not isolated. The committee's body of work on Iraq-related \nintelligence--a series of six reports issued over a 4-year period--\ndemonstrate why congressional oversight is essential in evaluating \nAmerica's intelligence collection and analytical activities.\n  During the course of its investigation, the committee found that the \nOctober 2002 National Intelligence Estimate on Iraq's alleged weapons \nof mass destruction was based on stale, fragmentary, and speculative \nintelligence reports and replete with unsupported judgments. Troubling \nincidents were reported in which internal dissent and warnings about \nthe veracity of intelligence on Iraq were ignored in the rush to get to \nwar.\n  The committee's investigation also revealed how administration \nofficials applied pressure on intelligence analysts prior to the war \nfor them to support links between Iraq and the terrorists responsible \nfor the attacks of September 11, none of which existed.\n  Our investigation detailed how the Iraqi National Congress and Ahmed \nChalabi attempted to influence the U.S. policy on Iraq by providing \nfalse information through defectors directed at convincing the United \nStates at the higher levels that Iraq possessed weapons of mass \ndestruction and had links to terrorists and how this false information \nwas embraced despite warnings and fabrication.\n  The committee's investigation also documented for the public how the \nadministration ignored the prewar judgments of the intelligence \ncommunity that the invasion would destabilize security in Iraq and \nprovide al-Qaida with an opportunity to exploit the situation and \nincrease attacks against U.S. forces during and after the war. After 5 \nyears and the loss of over 4,000 American lives, these ignored \njudgments were tragically prescient.\n  Overall, the findings and conclusions of the committee's Iraq \ninvestigation were an important catalyst in bringing about subsequent \nlegislative and administrative reforms of the intelligence community so \nthat these mistakes will never be repeated again, hopefully.\n  In conclusion, it has been a long, hard road for the committee to get \nto this point. There have been and continue to be a lot of finger-\npointing and accusations of partisanship. It is important to remember \nthat this undertaking was a unanimous decision--phase 1 and phase 2--\nwas a unanimous decision of the committee in February of 2004. That it \ntook such a long time to do is another subject. It is also important to \nremember that the committee adopted these two reports, both reports, by \na vote of 10 to 5--in other words, bipartisan.\n  In undertaking these additional lines of inquiry, the committee acted \nto tell a complete story of how intelligence was not only collected and \nanalyzed prior to the Iraq invasions but how it was publicly used in \nauthoritative statements made by the highest officials in the Bush \nadministration in furtherance of its policy to overthrow Saddam Hussein \nand more.\n  I believe these reports will help answer some of the many lingering \nquestions surrounding the Nation's misguided decision to launch the war \nin Iraq.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cardin).

I thank my colleagues. I have sought recognition to \ncomment on a couple of subjects. One is the gridlock we are facing now \nin this body on the issue of judicial confirmations.\n  It is my hope that we will yet be able to find a formula to break \nthis cycle of gridlock. I have spoken on the subject repeatedly--about \nthe events of the last 20 years, where in the last 2 years of each \nadministration, when the White House is controlled by one party, as was \nthe case with President Reagan in\n\n[[Page S5136]]\n\nhis last 2 years, and the nominations were gridlocked, and slowed down. \nSimilarly, with President Bush the first, the last 2 years were slowed \ndown, and then other devices and procedures were employed during the \nlast 2 years of President Clinton's administration, procedures employed \nby the Republican caucus. As I have said on a number of occasions, I \nthink the Republican caucus was wrong. I said so, and I voted so, in \nsupport of President Clinton's nominations. And now, I think the \nDemocratic caucus is wrong in what the Democratic caucus is doing.\n  I am not going to get into all of the nuances of the so-called \n``deal'' about the confirmation of three circuit judges before Memorial \nDay, but that deal could have been accomplished had the judges waiting \nin line the longest been processed as opposed to judges who had not had \ntheir investigations done and had not had their ABA clearances.\n  But, all of that is prologue, as I see it. During an Judiciary \nexecutive committee meeting, before the recess, I said publicly that I \nhoped to sit down with this chairman to try to work through this. We \nhad a meeting scheduled yesterday, and we are going to sit down this \nafternoon. So it is my hope we will find a way through this thicket.\n  I have proposed a protocol where we would have a hearing so many days \nafter a nomination; then so many days later, we would have executive \ncommittee action; then so many days later, floor action.\n  I think it is time that we reexamined the blue slip situation, a \nconcept where an individual who was personally obnoxious to a given \nSenator was objected to. Well, I have grave questions about that \nstandard for excluding people. I think it ought to be a matter of \nwhether they are publicly obnoxious, but, what we ought to do is we \nought to vote; we ought to bring these people to the floor for a vote.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/05/senate-section/article/S5136-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5136-S5144]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             GLOBAL WARMING\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I am sorry to see that the majority \nleader has filled the tree on the global warming bill. There is no way \nwe are going to move ahead on this legislation, as I have stated before \non the floor, if we are not permitted to offer amendments.\n  I think there is general agreement, although there are still some \ndissenters, that we need to do something. We have the Warner-Lieberman \nbill. I think it has objectives which are not technologically \nobtainable, which are too difficult on the U.S. economy, and have \njoined with Senator Bingaman on alternative legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the statement regarding a number of \namendments which I had proposed to introduce be printed in the Record, \none on emissions caps/targets, a second on a cost-containment safety-\nvalve amendment, a third on an international competitiveness amendment, \nand a fourth on process gas emissions.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              Specter Amendments to Lieberman-Warner Bill\n\n       As I stated on the Senate floor on Tuesday, it was my \n     intention to offer amendments;\n       It is very disappointing that the Majority Leaders has \n     opted to move to cloture on the Boxer substitute without \n     allowing consideration of amendments;\n       I have played a constructive role in this debate in an \n     attempt to improve the bill and enter into a substantive \n     discussion with my colleagues;\n       Since there will be no votes on amendments, I will instead \n     file my amendments for public scrutiny until the next \n     opportunity to debate this important issue;\n       Emissions Caps/Targets Amendment.--This amendment \n     substitutes the Bingaman-Specter emissions caps in place of \n     the Lieberman-Warner caps. I have serious concerns that the \n     emissions limits are not aligned with necessary technologies. \n     If I had a comfort level with the ability of our nation to \n     meet these targets, I could support them, but I remain \n     unconvinced.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n             Lieberman-Warner                     Bingaman-Specter\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIn 2012, limits to 2005 levels............

That provision provides a price-capped \n     option for purchasing emissions allowances from the \n     government when the market price rises too high. Starting at \n     $12 per ton in 2012 and rising 5% over inflation annually, \n     this is an important protection for the economy. I am open to \n     considering a different price level, but it is a \n     fundamentally important provision. If this mechanism is \n     triggered, all of the funds collected through the purchase of \n     allowances would be invested directly in zero- and low-carbon \n     technologies to accelerate our ability to reduce emissions.\n       International Competitiveness Amendment.--This amendment \n     takes a number of steps to further refine the excellent \n     proposal that was first included in the Bingaman-Specter bill \n     to require purchase of emissions allowances by importers of \n     goods into the U.S. from countries which are not taking \n     comparable action on climate change. The amendment seeks to \n     better define ``comparable action.'' It also makes the \n     effective date for import allowances the same as the \n     effective date for domestic producers (2012). Further, it \n     applies the import allowance program to all countries, \n     including those with ``de minimis'' emissions levels. \n     Finally, it equalizes the ability of importers to submit \n     foreign credits and allowances to the same 15 percent limit \n     for which domestic producers may use.\n       Process Gas Emissions Amendment.--This amendment exempts \n     process gas emissions from ironmaking, steelmaking, steel \n     recycling, and coke processes. There are currently \n     insufficient technological options to make virgin steel \n     without emitting carbon dioxide from the use of coal and \n     coke. Therefore, requiring submission of allowances will only \n     raise the cost of domestic steel in a highly competitive and \n     unforgiving global steel market. This will put our industry \n     at a serious disadvantage and likely send jobs overseas \n     actually increasing emissions from steelmaking in non-carbon-\n     reducing nations.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. But there is no way to get 60 votes to impose cloture \nunless we find a way to allow Senators to offer their amendments.\n  Finally, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of a floor \nstatement of mine on the New England Patriots videotaping of NFL \nfootball games be printed in the Congressional Record as if read in \nfull on the Senate floor.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     Senate Floor Statement on the New England Patriots Videotaping\n\n                    (By Arlen Specter, June 5, 2008)\n\n       With the Memorial Day Recess and the cancellation of my \n     west coast fundraising trip due to my recurrence of \n     Hodgkin's, there was time to review and reflect on the issues \n     and comments on the New England Patriots' videotaping and to \n     prepare a summary for entry into the Congressional Record for \n     future reference.\n\n    Background: Two Questions; No Answers; No Initial Intent For an \n                             Investigation\n\n       When I made my first inquiry of the NFL on the videotaping, \n     there was no intent to initiate an investigation. After \n     reading about the Patriots' videotaping of the Jets September \n     9, 2007 game, I wrote Commissioner Roger Goodell by letter \n     dated November 15, 2007, shortly before the Patriots were \n     scheduled to play the Philadelphia Eagles, asking if there \n     had been any evidence of videotaping of the 2005 Super Bowl \n     between the Eagles and the Patriots:\n\n       Dear Commissioner Goodell:\n       With the New England Patriots about to play the \n     Philadelphia Eagles again, as they did in the Super Bowl in \n     January 2005, I would appreciate your advising me what your \n     investigation showed, if anything, on the question of the \n     Patriots stealing Eagles' signals during that Super Bowl \n     game.\n       I had thought there would be some additional disclosures \n     following your initial sanction on the Patriots and Coach \n     Belichick, but I did not see anything further so I would like \n     a response on this specific question.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Arlen Specter.\n\n       I received no answer. When I later read about the NFL's \n     destruction of the videotapes, I wrote again by letter dated \n     December 19, 2007:\n\n       Dear Commissioner Goodell:\n       More than a month has passed since I wrote to you on \n     November 15, 2007 concerning the issue of the New England \n     Patriots spying on the Philadelphia Eagles on their 2005 \n     Super Bowl game. I would appreciate a prompt response.\n       I was surprised to read in the New York Times on December \n     16th that the NFL had destroyed the tapes on the Patriots \n     spying. Is that true?\n       The same New York Times story also contained the author's \n     surmising that there was more than one copy because of the \n     general practice of not having a single copy of anything. Was \n     there a second copy? Is it possible to retrieve a copy?\n       Candidly, the destruction of the tapes is, in my opinion, \n     highly suspicious. I would appreciate your reply as to the \n     scope of your investigation and your findings on the number \n     of times the Patriots spied and on whom.\n       I share the concern that your treatment of the Patriots and \n     Coach Belichick was insufficient. I would like to know the \n     specifics of\n\n[[Page S5137]]\n\n     the misconduct which you found and your reasons for imposing \n     the penalties which you did.\n       As I have said on many occasions in the past, including \n     legislation which I have introduced, the NFL has a special \n     duty to the public in light of the antitrust exemption which \n     the NFL enjoys.\n       I would appreciate a prompt response to the questions posed \n     in this letter and in my prior letter to you.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Arlen Specter.\n\n       Again, I received no answer.\n       I thought nothing more about the issue until early January \n     2008 after returning to Washington when I had a casual \n     conversation in the Capitol with New York Times reporter Carl \n     Hulse who covers the Senate. Hulse asked me who I thought \n     would win the Super Bowl and I jokingly replied that it all \n     depended on whether there was cheating. That led to a \n     conversation about the Patriots' videotaping and my \n     unanswered letters. At Hulse's request, I gave him copies of \n     those letters.\n       I thought nothing more about the matter until the middle of \n     the week before the Super Bowl when I received a call from \n     New York Times sportswriter Greg Bishop. Hulse had given him \n     my letters. I gave him background of my reasons for writing. \n     Bishop then apparently contacted the Commissioner's office on \n     the Thursday before the Super Bowl, prompting Commissioner \n     Goodell to write to me on January 31, 2008:\n\n       Dear Senator Specter:\n       I saw today for the first time your letters inquiring about \n     my investigation into the taping of defensive signals by the \n     New England Patriots. I apologize for not having replied \n     earlier. (I have instructed my staff to contact your office \n     to make sure that you have my best phone and fax numbers for \n     our future communications.)\n       With respect to the Patriots matter, senior members of my \n     staff conducted detailed, individual interview with Patriots' \n     owner Robert Kraft, Coach Belichick, and other Patriots \n     employees promptly after this matter came to our attention. \n     They reviewed the videotapes and notes made by the Patriots \n     employee who reviewed the tapes on behalf of the club. \n     Following that review, the tapes and the notes were destroyed \n     by our office in order to ensure that they could not be used \n     for any purpose going forward. Our goal was to ensure that \n     the Patriots would not secure any possible competitive \n     advantage as a result of the misconduct that had been \n     identified. The Patriots have separately certified to me in \n     writing that we received all tapes, all notes, and that no \n     other material exists relating to taping of defensive \n     signals.\n       Our investigation specifically disclosed nothing relating \n     to the stealing of Eagles' signals during the Super Bowl game \n     between the Patriots and the Philadelphia Eagles in 2005. \n     (The two teams had only played one other game against each \n     other in the current decade, a preseason game in the summer \n     of 2003.) We have no reason to believe that the outcome of \n     the 2005 Super Bowl was affected in any way by the improper \n     taping of Eagles' defensive signals.\n       The discipline I imposed on both the Patriots and Coach \n     Belichick was very substantial. No coach has ever been fined \n     as much as Coach Belichick, and no club has been required to \n     forfeit its first round selection in the college draft for \n     such an on-field violation. I am confident that neither the \n     Patriots, nor any other NFL team, will engage in this type of \n     conduct again.\n       I believe that I have no more significant responsibility \n     than protecting the integrity of the game and promoting \n     public confidence in the NFL, and that our actions in \n     response to the Patriots' taping was entirely consistent with \n     that responsibility.\n       Again, I regret not having seen and responded to your \n     questions sooner. As always, I appreciate your interest in \n     the NFL.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Roger Goodell.\n\n       The next day, February 1, 2008, there was a headline at the \n     top of the New York Times sports page: ``Senator Arlen \n     Specter Wants NFL Commissioner Goodell to Explain the \n     Rationale Behind Destroying Evidence that the Patriots \n     Cheated,'' followed by text of my letter to Goodell dated \n     November 15, 2007, partial text of my December 19, 2007 \n     letter and a partial text of his reply dated January 31, \n     2008.\n       I was then accused of timing the dropping of a bomb on \n     Super Bowl weekend. The fact is that had my earlier letters \n     been answered, the matter would not have achieved such \n     attention.\n       Those events then led to my meeting with Commissioner \n     Goodell in my Senate office on February 13, 2008, and a \n     series of disclosures far beyond the Commissioner's initial \n     statement at his February 1 news conference: ``I believe \n     there were six tapes, and I believe some were from the pre-\n     season in 2007, and the rest were primarily in the late 2006 \n     season,'' before the Patriots were caught videotaping the \n     Jets on September 9.''\n\n   The Antitrust Exemption--Public Financing for Stadium Construction\n\n       A question is sometimes raised as to Congress's reasons for \n     special attention to the NFL. In part, it is because the NFL \n     has an antitrust exemption enjoyed by few other businesses. \n     The NFL has contracts for broadcast rights with Fox, NBC, CBS \n     and ABC/ESPN to make more than $3.7 billion through 2011. \n     Over the past twenty-five years, the NFL has earned roughly \n     $33.6 billion from its television contracts with broadcast \n     networks.\n       When I saw what was happening with stadium financing in the \n     1990's, I introduced the Stadium Financing Act of 1999 (S. \n     952) on March 19, 1999, requiring the NFL to contribute 10% \n     of the amounts received under the joint agreement for \n     broadcasting rights to finance the construction and \n     renovation of playing facilities. As a matter of basic \n     fairness, the owners should have been paying for their own \n     stadium construction without relying on the public funds \n     desperately needed for so many other purposes. In my opinion, \n     it would have been sound public policy to condition the \n     antitrust exemption on the owners paying for construction \n     costs without relying on taxpayers funds. Under the threat of \n     franchise removal to other cities, NFL teams have extracted \n     enormous public funding.\n\n                            STADIUMS--PUBLIC CONTRIBUTION ( FROM BONDS, TAXES, ETC.)\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                      Public          Private\n              City                  Year opened    Project cost    contribution    contribution    Lease (years)\n                                                   (in millions)   (in millions)   (in millions)\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nGlendale, AZ....................            2006            $448            $344            $104              30\nPhiladelphia....................            2003             512             202             310              30\nDetroit.........................            2002             471             125             346              35\nHouston.........................            2002             424             309             125              30\nBoston..........................            2002             452  ..............            *452              25\nSeattle.........................            2002             465             296             169              30\nDenver..........................            2001             370             229             141              30\nPittsburgh......................            2001             271             158             123              30\nCincinnati......................            2000             450             425              25              26\nCleveland.......................            1999             300             212              88              30\nNashville.......................            1999             292             220              72              30\nBaltimore.......................            1998             224             200              24              30\nTampa Bay.......................            1998             168             153              15              30\nWashington DC...................            1997             251              71             180              30\nCharlotte.......................            1996             250              50             200              31\nSt. Louis.......................            1995             257             257               0              30\nAtlanta.........................            1992             214             214               0              20\n                                 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n      Total Public Contribution.  ..............  ..............   $3.46 billion  ..............  ..............\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n*The Commonwealth of Massachusetts contributed $70 million to be repaid over twenty years.\n\n\n                                                  FUTURE PLANS\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                      Public          Private\n                 City                             Type             Project cost    contribution    contributions\n                                                                   (in millions)   (in millions)   (in millions)\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDallas................................

Nationals \n     Park, in Washington D.C., was completed in 2008 at a cost of \n     $610.8 million and was 100% publicly funded.\n\n     The Concealed Taping and Spying Was Done on a Widespread Basis\n\n       Contrary to Commissioner Goodell's initial statement that: \n     ``[W]e think (the taping) was quite limited. It was not \n     something that was done on a widespread basis,'' the facts \n     demonstrate the opposite. At my meeting with Goodell on \n     February 13, 2008, he dramatically changed the story and \n     conceded that taping began in 2000. Until my meeting with \n     Matt Walsh on May 13, 2008, the only taping we knew about \n     took place from 2000 until 2002 and during the 2006 and 2007 \n     seasons.\n       That left an obvious gap between 2003 and 2005. In response \n     to my questions, Walsh stated he had season tickets in 2003, \n     2004 and 2005, and saw Steve Scarnecchia, his successor, \n     videotape games during those seasons including:\n       The Patriots' September 9, 2002 game against the Steelers.\n       The Patriots' November 16, 2003 game against the Cowboys.\n       The Patriots' September 25, 2005 game against the Steelers, \n     which the Steelers won 23-20.\n\n       Walsh stated he observed Scarnecchia filming additional \n     Patriots home games, though he could not recall the specific \n     games. Walsh said he did not tell Goodell about the taping \n     during 2003, 2004 and 2005 because he was not asked.\n       Matt Walsh and other Patriots employees, Steve Scarnecchia, \n     Jimmy Dee, Fernando Neto, and possibly Ed Bailey, were \n     present to observe most, if not all, of the St. Louis Rams \n     walk-through practice in advance of the 2002 Super Bowl, \n     including Marshall Faulk's unusual positioning as a punt \n     returner. David Halberstam's book, The Education of a Coach, \n     documents the way Belichick spent the week before the Super \n     Bowl obsessing about where the Rams would line up Faulk.\n       Walsh was asked, and he told Assistant Coach Brian Daboll \n     about the walk-through. Walsh said Daboll asked him specific \n     questions about the Rams offense, and Walsh told Daboll about \n     Faulk's lining up as a kick returner. Walsh said Daboll then \n     drew diagrams of the formations Walsh had described. \n     According to media reports, Daboll denied talking to Walsh \n     about Faulk. The NFL has not disclosed the details on \n     Daboll's statements. We do not know what Scarnecchia, Dee, \n     Neto or Bailey did, or what they said if they were \n     interviewed.\n       The Patriots took elaborate steps to conceal their filming \n     of opponents' signals. Patriots personnel instructed Walsh to \n     use a ``cover story'' if anyone questioned him about the \n     filming. For example, if asked why the Patriots had an extra \n     camera filming, he was instructed to say that he was filming \n     ``tight shots'' of a particular player or players or that he \n     was filming highlights. If asked why he was not filming the \n     play on the field, he was instructed to say that he was \n     filming the down marker. The red light that indicated when \n     his camera was rolling was broken.\n       During at least one game, the January 27, 2002, AFC \n     Championship game with the Steelers, Walsh was specifically \n     instructed not to wear anything displaying a Patriots logo. \n     Walsh indicated he turned the Patriots sweatshirt he was \n     wearing at the time inside-out. Walsh was also given a \n     generic credential instead of one that identified him as team \n     personnel. These efforts to conceal the filming demonstrate \n     the Patriots knew they were violating NFL rules.\n       While there may have been others, as best as can be \n     determined from the available information, the Patriots taped \n     opponents' signals in the following games:\n\n\n           Games for which Walsh turned over tapes to the NFL\n\n       September 25, 2000: Miami Dolphins v.

New England \n     Patriots\n       December 3, 2006: Detroit Lions v. New England Patriots\n\n         The Videotaping Had a Significant Impact on the Games\n\n       The overwhelming evidence flatly contradicts Commissioner \n     Goodell's assertion that there was little or no effect on the \n     outcome of the games. During his February 1, 2008 press \n     conference, Commission Goodell stated, ``I think it probably \n     had a limited effect, if any effect, on the outcome on any \n     game.'' Later during that press conference, Goodell stated \n     again, ``I don't believe it affected the outcome of any \n     games.'' Commissioner Goodell's effort to minimize the effect \n     of the videotaping is categorically refuted by the persistent \n     use of the sophisticated scheme which required a great deal \n     of effort and produced remarkable results.\n       The filming enabled the Patriots coaching staff to \n     anticipate the defensive plays called by the opposing team. \n     According to Walsh, he first filmed an opponent's signals \n     during the August 20, 2000 pre-season game against the Tampa \n     Bay Buccaneers. After Walsh filmed a game, he would provide \n     the tape for Ernie Adams, a coaching assistant for the \n     Patriots, who would match the signals with the plays.\n\n[[Page S5139]]\n\n       Walsh was told by a former offensive player that a few days \n     before the September 3, 2000 regular season game against \n     Tampa Bay, he (the offensive player) was called into a \n     meeting with Adams, Bill Belichick and Charlie Weis, then the \n     offensive coordinator for the Patriots, during which it was \n     explained how the Patriots would make use of the tapes. The \n     offensive player would memorize the signals and then watch \n     for Tampa Bay's defensive calls during the game. He would \n     then pass the plays along to Weis, who would give \n     instructions to the quarterback on the field. This process \n     enabled the Patriots to go to a ``no-huddle'' offense, which \n     would lock in the defense the opposing team had called from \n     the sideline, preventing the defense from making any \n     adjustments. When Walsh asked whether the tape he had filmed \n     was helpful, the offensive player said it had enabled the \n     team to anticipate 75 percent of the plays being called by \n     the opposing team.\n       Tampa Bay won the August 20, 2000 pre-season game by a \n     score of 31-21. According to the information provided by Matt \n     Walsh, the Patriots used the film to their advantage when the \n     Patriots played Tampa Bay in their first regular season game \n     on September 3, 2000. The Patriots narrowed the spread, \n     losing by a score of 21-16. After the game, Charlie Weis, the \n     Patriots' offensive coordinator, was reportedly overheard \n     telling Tampa Bay's defensive coordinator, Monte Kiffin, ``We \n     knew all your calls, and you still stopped us.'' The tapes \n     Walsh turned over to the NFL indicate the Patriots filmed the \n     Dolphins during their game on September 24, 2000, a game the \n     Patriots lost by 10-3.\n       According to Walsh, when the Patriots first began filming \n     opponents, they filmed opponents they would play again during \n     that same season. The Patriots played the Dolphins again that \n     season on December 24, 2000; they again narrowed the spread, \n     losing by a score of 27-24.\n       According to Walsh, he filmed the Patriots' game against \n     Buffalo on November 5, 2000, a game the Patriots lost 16-13. \n     When the Patriots played the Bills again that season on \n     December 17, 2000, the Patriots won by a score of 13-10.\n       During the following season, Walsh filmed the Patriots' \n     game against the Jets on September 23, 2001, a game the \n     Patriots lost by a score of 10-3. When the Patriots played \n     the Jets again that season on December 2, 2001, the Patriots \n     won by a score of 17-16.\n       The tapes Walsh turned over to the NFL indicate the \n     Patriots filmed the Dolphins during their game on October 7, \n     2001, a game the Patriots lost by 30-10. When the Patriots \n     played the Dolphins again that season on December 22, 2001, \n     the Patriots won by a score of 20-13.\n       The Patriots filmed opponents' offensive signals in \n     addition to defensive signals. On April 23, 2008, the NFL \n     issued a statement indicating that ``Commissioner Goodell \n     determined last September that the Patriots had violated \n     league rules by videotaping opposing coaches' defensive \n     signals during Patriots games throughout Bill Belichick's \n     tenure as head coach.'' (Emphasis added). However, the tapes \n     turned over by Matt Walsh on May 8, 2008 contain footage of \n     offensive signals. The tapes turned over to the NFL and the \n     information provided by Walsh prove that the Patriots also \n     routinely filmed opponents' offensive signals.\n       Why did the Patriots videotape signals during games when \n     they were not scheduled to play that opponent during the \n     balance of the season unless they were able to utilize the \n     videotape during the latter portion of the same game? The NFL \n     has not addressed the question as to whether the Patriots \n     decoded signals during the game for later use in that game. \n     Mark Schlereth, a former NFL offensive lineman and an ESPN \n     football analyst, is quoted in the New York Times on May 14, \n     2008:\n\n       Then why are you doing it against teams you aren't going to \n     play again that season?\n       Schlereth said that the breadth of information on the \n     tapes--mainly, the coaches' signals and the subsequent play--\n     would be simple for someone to analyze during a game. There \n     are enough plays in the first quarter, he said, to glean any \n     team's ``staples,'' and a quick view of them could prove \n     immediately helpful.\n       ``I don't see them wasting time if they weren't using it in \n     that game,'' Schlereth said.\n\n Coaches, Players and Sports Commentators/Experts Confirm Videotaping \n                 had a Significant Impact on the Games\n\n       Jim Bates, the Miami Dolphins' defensive coordinator in \n     2001 who stepped down as the Denver Broncos' Assistant Head \n     Coach of defense in January 2008, was referenced and quoted \n     in the Palm Beach Post on May 13, 2008:\n\n       Bates wouldn't declare that the Patriots stole the 2001 AFC \n     East title, but he wasn't afraid to accuse the Patriots of \n     putting the Dolphins at a ``tremendous disadvantage'' in \n     their critical rematch that essentially decided the division.\n       ``There's only a certain number of plays that truly \n     determine winning and losing,'' Bates said. ``It might come \n     down to five plays. Sometimes it's just one play. A critical \n     play at a critical time to move the sticks and get a first \n     down, it definitely can change the outcome of a game.'' . . . \n     .\n       ``To know their personnel as soon as they do . . . it's a \n     tremendous advantage,'' Bates said. ``You're not panicking to \n     get players in and out of the game as far as matching up with \n     the offense.''\n       The same Palm Beach Post article referenced comments made \n     by former Dolphins quarterback Jay Fiedler. Although Fiedler \n     contended that stealing offensive signals didn't have much \n     impact on a game, the Post article said that:\n\n       Fiedler, a Dartmouth grad known as a cerebral quarterback, \n     certainly would have welcomed inside information on the \n     opposition's defensive signals.\n       ``That's what you put all the hours of film study \n     throughout the week for,'' Fiedler said, ``to get that little \n     advantage out on the field, to see the little rotations in \n     the defense or how they line up or the alignments to tip off \n     what kind of blitz is coming.''\n       ``If the quarterback knows what's coming, he can dissect it \n     at the line of scrimmage. In most cases you're not going to \n     get an advantage, but if there's an exotic blitz coming, then \n     usually there are ways to exploit that.''\n\n       Commenting on the Patriots' videotaping in a Pittsburgh \n     Post-Gazette sports article ``On the Steelers'' on May 25, \n     2008, Ed Bouchette said:\n\n       The practice was unique to Belichick and his crew. Some pro \n     scouts advancing games have told me that they've tried to \n     steal the signals of opposing coaches on the sideline which \n     is as legal as trying to pick up the third-base coaches' \n     signals in baseball. Some say it can help, some say it's \n     futile and wastes time.\n       ``I didn't think it was worth the time and energy you were \n     looking at,'' said Hal Hunter, who spent 23 years in the \n     league as a coach and pro scout, including four as the \n     Steelers' offensive line coach in the 1980s.\n       But, if you can set up a sophisticated system like the \n     Patriots had, it was worth it. New England would break down \n     its videotape of the coaches using their hand signals from \n     earlier games and match it with the defense that was used on \n     that play.\n       Where it helped the most came when they went to their no-\n     huddle offense. Because a defense does not know when the ball \n     will be snapped in the no-huddle, it must call its plays \n     quickly. The quarterback, then, could simply wait until the \n     defense was signaled in and the word was relayed to him by \n     his coaches in his headset what to call against it.\n       Defenses normally use the same or similar signals from game \n     to game and even year to year under the same coordinators. \n     The reason is simple: It's not as easy to change signals in \n     football as it is in baseball, where the calls are simple. It \n     will confuse the players--the reason for so many of those \n     ``miscommunications.''\n\n       The Pittsburgh Tribune-Review's issue of May 9, 2008 noted \n     the comment of Steelers linebacker Larry Foote who joined the \n     team the season after the 2002 championship game and started \n     against the Patriots when the teams met in a title game three \n     years later. The Tribune-Review said:\n\n       (Foote) believes the Patriots may have gained an advantage \n     by taping signals, but he doesn't know how much.\n       ``If they know our defense, that's a big advantage,'' Foote \n     said yesterday. ``But we don't know the degree of it. We'll \n     never know the degree of it.''\n\n       In a highly critical article in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch \n     on May 16, 2008 entitled ``Getting Tougher to Keep NFL Image \n     Clean,'' Bryan Burwell asserts that the Patriots had a \n     competitive advantage on their taping, and concludes his \n     column with the question ``Who says crime doesn't pay?''\n\n          Key Conclusion: NFL Investigation Lacked Credibility\n\n       The most important conclusion from the NFL investigation is \n     its lack of credibility. This judgment emerged from the NFL's \n     calculated effort to appear objective while pulling its \n     punches and acting only when compelled by public pressure.\n       (1) Commissioner Goodell's letter to me dated January 31, \n     2008 stated that my letters of November 15, 2007 and December \n     19, 2007 had just come to his attention: ``I saw today for \n     the first time your letters inquiring about my investigation \n     into the taping of defensive signals by the New England \n     Patriots.'' The Commissioner's representation that this was \n     the first the NFL had known of my letters was contradicted by \n     an email exchange on January 25, 2008 between NFL counsel \n     and my staffer, Ivy Johnson, that the NFL had received my \n     letters and would reply to them in due course after the \n     Super Bowl.\n       (2) The Commissioner originally represented in his news \n     conference on February 1, 2008 in advance of the Super Bowl \n     that the taping was limited to the September 9, 2007 game and \n     six other games. Specifically, he stated: ``I believe there \n     were six tapes, and I believe some were from the preseason in \n     2007, and the rest were primarily in the late 2006 season.'' \n     That representation was flatly contradicted in the meeting of \n     February 13, 2008 between Commissioner Goodell and me where \n     he admitted that the taping had gone on back to the year \n     2000.\n       (3) The NFL's judgment on the penalty was not credible--\n     really not rational. The Patriots were caught taping the Jets \n     on September 9, 2007. The Commissioner imposed the penalty on \n     September 13, 2007. The NFL reviewed the tapes for the first \n     time on September 17, 2007. The NFL announced the tapes had \n     been destroyed on September 20, 2007. How could the penalty \n     be rationally imposed before examining the evidence?\n       (4) The Commissioner's stated reason for destroying the \n     tapes lacks credibility. He\n\n[[Page S5140]]\n\n     said in his January 31, 2008 letter that ``the tapes and the \n     notes were destroyed by our office in order to ensure that \n     they could not be used for any purpose going forward. Our \n     goal was to ensure that the Patriots would not secure any \n     possible competitive advantage as a result of the misconduct \n     that had been identified.'' That objective could have been \n     obtained by storing the tapes in a vault and they would have \n     been preserved for future inspection if the need arose. The \n     NFL would have avoided the inevitable smell of destroying \n     evidence.\n       (5) Like destroying the tapes, the NFL's destruction of the \n     Patriots' notes of tapings lacks a credible reason--raising \n     the obvious inference that there is something to hide. That \n     applies to all the destruction of notes, but especially to \n     the destruction of notes on the tapings of the Steelers \n     games.\n       In the AFC Championship game on January 27, 2002, the \n     Patriots defeated the Steelers by a score of 24-17. Hines \n     Ward, Steelers wide receiver, was quoted: ``Oh, they knew. \n     They were calling our stuff out. They knew, especially that \n     first championship game (2002) here at Heinz Field. They knew \n     a lot of our calls. There's no question some of their players \n     were calling out some of our stuff.'' When the Patriots \n     played the Steelers again during their season-opener on \n     September 9, 2002, the Patriots again won, this time by a \n     score of 30-14.\n       On October 31, 2004, the Steelers beat the Patriots 34-20, \n     forced four turnovers, including two interceptions, and \n     sacked the quarterback four times. In the AFC Championship \n     game on January 23, 2005, the Patriots won 41-27 and \n     intercepted Ben Roethlisberger three times. The Steelers had \n     no sacks that game.\n       (6) No objective, credible investigation would permit a \n     representative of the subject of the inquiry to be present at \n     the questioning of a key witness. Walsh said that Dan \n     Goldberg, an attorney for the Patriots, was present at his \n     interview and asked questions. With some experience in \n     investigations, I have never heard of a situation where the \n     subject of an investigation or his/her/its representative was \n     permitted to be present during the investigation. It strains \n     credulity that any objective investigator would countenance \n     such a practice. During a hearing or trial, parties will be \n     present with the right of cross-examination and \n     confrontation, but certainly not in the investigative stage \n     with the sensitive questioning of a witness.\n\n           Comments (Criticism/Compliments) on My Activities\n\n       Some newspapers, especially in New England, have been \n     critical of my role, and there were some hostile comments on \n     two radio interviews I volunteered to do on the Dennis and \n     Callahan Show on WEEI (Boston radio) on February 8, 2008 and \n     May 16, 2008, but there were many columns, editorials and \n     letters to the editor supporting my position.\n       Harvey Araton, writing in the New York Times sports section \n     on May 9, 2008, called me the ``crusading Senator Arlen \n     Specter'' in a column seeking for the NFL to bar Belichick \n     from coaching the Patriots for one season saying, ``One year \n     out. Then let's see Belichick dare spy again in 2009.''\n       In its May 10, 2008 edition, the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review \n     commented about the Steelers organization limiting comment on \n     Spygate, saying:\n\n     Which brings us to Sen. Arlen Specter, a lifetime politician \n     who doesn't have to straddle the Steelers' company line. He \n     refuses to go away and shut up about the New England Patriots \n     videotaping opposing coaches' signals. Bless his heart. The \n     Steelers should be glad they have Specter on their side.\n\n       Even the Boston Globe had a favorable comment about me in \n     its May 11, 2008 edition by Mike Reiss captioned ``Tale of \n     the Tape Re-Visited'': ``. . . it would be difficult to argue \n     that (Specter) did not add clarity to the situation.''\n       Fox Sports on May 14, 2008 criticized the NFL's \n     investigation, saying:\n\n       Kudos to the dogged efforts of the media and Pennsylvania \n     Senator Arlen Specter for demanding more on Spygate after \n     Goodell's essentially declared ``Mission accomplished.''\n\n       An article by Jeff Jacobs in the May 13, 2008 edition of \n     the Hartford Courant captioned ``Goodell-Walsh Meeting: Only \n     the Truth Will Do'':\n\n       . . . but give Specter this much: He did provide some \n     focus, and it was in their meeting Goodell finally confirmed \n     how long Belichick had been videotaping other teams.\n\n       As noted by Don Banks in the May 14, 2008 article on Sports \n     Illustrated's website, SI.com:\n\n       I happen to agree with the always-skeptical senior senator \n     from Pennsylvania that NFL commissioner Roger Goodell has an \n     inherent conflict of interest whenever he undertakes to \n     investigate his own league.\n\n       The Los Angeles Times edition of May 16, 2008 in a column \n     by Sam Farmer captioned ``Arlen Specter Has Good Reason To \n     Keep An Eye On NFL, Spygate'' challenged my objectivity and \n     added: ``Yes he's a politician. But he could still be \n     right.''\n       The Bradenton Herald in a May 16, 2008 column captioned \n     ``NFL Fumbles Again'' supported my position saying:\n\n       Again, we stand alongside the senator on his statement: \n     ``What is necessary is an objective investigation. And this \n     one has not been objective.\n       The NFL's stand on this scandal is a self-serving ``trust \n     us, we did the right thing.''\n       Would anyone trust the White House with that kind of \n     position? We hold our public officials to high standards, we \n     demand transparency and accountability.\n       Specter is threatening the NFL's antitrust exemption. With \n     its highly visible and unique position in our culture, the \n     league owes the public transparency and accountability.\n       This isn't just about sports. This is about truth, justice \n     and the American way.\n       The NFL doesn't get it--yet.\n\n       The Herald added:\n\n       Specter is right on target with his outrage: ``That \n     sequence is incomprehensible,'' he said this week in \n     repeating his criticism of the decision to destroy the \n     materials. ``It's an insult to the intelligence of the people \n     who follow it.''\n\n       In an editorial in Chester, Pennsylvania's Daily Local \n     dated May 17, 2008, captioned ``Specter Isn't Accepting \n     Goodell's `Spygate is Over' Stance,'' the writer notes:\n\n       Fortunately for the football fan, Arlen Specter continues \n     to refuse to play by those rules. And because he is a U.S. \n     Senator, he has a high-volume microphone of his own.\n       Roger Goodell does not get to announce when an alleged NFL \n     scandal goes away. The people do, and the people are \n     represented in Congress. That makes Specter correct: The NFL \n     should be open to independent analysis of the possibility of \n     cheating--cheating by certain teams not against other teams, \n     but against the customers, who have the right to expect fair \n     contests.\n       Goodell may be right. There may be nothing to Spygate.\n       But Specter is definitely right: It's not Goodell's \n     decision.\n\n       The New York Daily News in a column on May 18, 2008 said \n     that it ``might not be enough'' to conclude with the judgment \n     ``Belichick cheated, was punished, humiliated and now his \n     record is tainted.'' Commenting on my involvement, the New \n     York Daily News said:\n\n       Specter, the Pennsylvania Republican, has endless and \n     admirable energy, especially for a 78 year-old man undergoing \n     chemotherapy treatments for Hodgkin's disease, and he says he \n     is concerned about the integrity of the game.\n\n       The May 18, 2008 edition of the New York Times contained an \n     article captioned ``Politicians Challenge Integrity of NFL,'' \n     written by William C. Rhoden, noting:\n\n       Sprawling industries cannot adequately police themselves \n     and Specter, to his credit, is questioning whether the N.F.L. \n     has properly handled allegations that Belichick had \n     assistants videotape opponents' signals. Specter has called \n     for an independent ``objective'' investigation into the \n     Patriots' taping practice.\n       ``This one,'' he said, referring to the NFL's in-house \n     investigation ``has not been objective.'' Specter said \n     Goodell was caught in an ``apparent conflict of interest'' \n     because the N.F.L. doesn't want the public to lose confidence \n     in the league's integrity.\n       The conflict isn't ``apparent,'' it's tremendous. The \n     N.F.L. is a multibillion dollar industry that sells itself on \n     fair competition and championships that are won fairly and \n     squarely.\n\n       Noting that, ``Specter is not an objective party. He has \n     two professional football teams in his state,'' the Rhoden \n     article continued:\n\n       That being said, the issues he (Specter) raises about the \n     NFL's actions against New England are legitimate. This book \n     has more chapters.\n       The politics of business and the business of politics \n     usually compromise the sort of fair and honest competition we \n     celebrate in competitive athletics.\n       What a sad sign of the times: the sports industry has gone \n     so far a field that we need politicians to reel it back in.\n\n       While expressing a preference for solutions on ``some \n     things that are `truly problems','' the May 18, 2008 edition \n     of the Chambersburg Public Opinion (Pennsylvania) newspaper \n     said:\n\n       Congress is not getting into football. It has been involved \n     in it because it is required to do so because of the \n     antitrust exemption given to the league by the government.\n       If the mega-rich owners will give back their antitrust \n     exemptions, pay their fair share of taxes and stop asking \n     taxpayers to pay for their stadiums, they would be able to \n     tell the likes of Specter to go take a ride.\n       But that is not the case, and is why Specter is within his \n     right to press the issue.\n\n       Lee Jenkins, writing in the May 26, 2008, edition of Sports \n     Illustrated, comments:\n\n       It is commendable that Specter, an unabashed Eagles fan, is \n     willing to fight to protect the ethics of competitive \n     athletics.\n\n       Jenkins then commented about other areas which might \n     benefit from congressional oversight, saying:\n\n       But Congress could use its power in other areas of sports--\n     by scrutinizing readily available sports supplements that \n     aren't regulated by the FDA, perhaps, or by studying the \n     legality and rationality of using public funds to finance \n     stadiums. There are significant digital-age First Amendment \n     issues relating to how much control leagues have over who \n     covers their games and how the news and images they generate \n     can be used, and there is the wisdom of granting pro leagues \n     antitrust exemptions.\n\n\n[[Page S5141]]\n\n\n       An article in the St. Louis American, dated May 22, 2008, \n     by Mike Claiborne (``NFL Out of Control at the Top, Cheats--\n     and Protects Cheaters''), said:\n\n       . . . the league tried to look the other way as long as \n     they could until Senator Arlen Specter decided he was not \n     satisfied with the answers he had been given.\n\n       Noting his preference for more attention to other national \n     problems, Claiborne added:\n\n       I have come to appreciate his tenacity. Now that he has \n     rattled the cage, the league cannot wait to have some games \n     be played so the issue can be moved to the back pages. A \n     little cooperation with their TV partners, and it will be \n     `Spy-Who?'\n\n       Sportswriter Dave Fairbank, writing in the Newport News, \n     Virginia Daily Press on May 24th in a column titled ``Sports \n     Need Integrity, or Else,'' said in part:\n\n       Specter, that dogged, old cancer survivor, thought the \n     NFL's reaction last fall a little too quick, neat and self-\n     serving, so he continued to talk it up and conducted his own \n     inquiry.\n       He released the findings in a 2,500 word memo 10 days ago, \n     more than seven months after the initial incident that caused \n     all of the hooha. He said Goodell's remarks and the NFL \n     investigation weren't credible. He believes a Mitchell \n     Report-type of investigation is warranted.\n       You can make the argument that Congress has more pressing \n     business than NFL cheats and sneaks. But where Specter is \n     correct is the point that the NFL ought not to be its own \n     police force in all instances, any more than Big Oil or the \n     Bar Association or the U.S. government.\n\n       After saying it was time to move on, a sports column in the \n     Pittsburgh Post-Gazette May 25, 2008, by Ed Bouchette ``On \n     the Steelers'' said:\n\n       Specter did his job; by raising Cain he rattled the NFL \n     into at least acknowledging the scope of the scandal and \n     forced more details onto the public record.\n\n                              The Penalty\n\n       I have not taken issue with the penalty. In my May 14, \n     2008, news conference, I was asked what punishment the \n     Patriots should have received and I said I would not get into \n     that. I said I wanted to find the facts to deal with the \n     issues for the future.\n       As noted earlier, Harvey Araton, in the New York Times on \n     May 9, 2008, called for banning Belichick for one year. \n     Similarly, Gregg Easterbrook, writing on ESPN.com on May 17, \n     2008, called for the suspension of Belichick for at least a \n     year. On the subject of discipline toward Belichick, the May \n     8, 2008, edition of the New York Daily News in an article by \n     Gary Myers captioned ``Double-sided Tape for Bill Belichick'' \n     stated:\n\n       It appears that Belichick will escape further discipline \n     from Goodell. That hardly clears him from cheating all these \n     years.\n\n       The Seattle Times, in a May 11, 2008, story by Steve Kelley \n     captioned ``Belichick's Penalty Should Match Severity of \n     Violations,'' stated:\n\n       Integrity separates the NFL from the WWE. It is the \n     difference between pro football and pro jai alai.\n\n       The toughest position was taken by the Pittsburgh Tribune \n     Review in its May 11, 2008, edition, saying the fines, \n     penalties and even suspension of Belichick were ``too \n     lenient'' and adding:\n\n       Sadly, ``cheating'' and ``sport'' have become synonymous. \n     And if the Patriots have any integrity, they'll fire \n     Belichick. And if the NFL has any guts, it will ban Bill \n     Belichick from the league.\n       Anything less renders sportsmanship meaningless.\n\n       The publicity in exposing Belichick and the Patriots \n     conduct has been a far greater punishment than dollars and \n     draft choices. History will impose the final judgment on the \n     penalty for Belichick and the Patriots.\n\n                            Some NFL Reforms\n\n       The disclosure of the Patriots' taping has produced some \n     potential reforms which, if enforced, could improve the \n     integrity of the game.\n       During their 2008 annual spring meeting earlier this \n     spring, the Commissioner proposed, and the NFL owners \n     accepted, a new policy that requires all club owners, \n     executives and head coaches to certify annually that they \n     have complied with league rules and policies and have \n     reported any violations they know. They also lowered the \n     standard of proof for establishing any violations of league \n     rules to ``preponderance of the evidence.'' Goodell also \n     reserved the right to expand programs and technology to \n     monitor and enforce compliance by, for example, conducting \n     regular spot checks of game-day locker rooms, press boxes, \n     coaches' booths, coach-to-player communications systems, and \n     other in-stadium communications systems.\n       The NFL had already made changes to the rules prior to the \n     start of the 2007 season. The New York Times suggested those \n     changes were in response to earlier instances when the \n     Patriots were caught filming. According to a May 11, 2008 \n     story in the Times, the 2007 NFL operations manual shows that \n     many of those changes concern policies on the placement of \n     cameras and microphones. The league also mandated that \n     neutral operators, who have not previously worked that team's \n     home games, run the coach-to-quarterback radio systems, as \n     well as game clocks, for playoff games. In addition, the \n     league required that players with radio components in their \n     helmets wear a decal--a lime-green dot--on their helmet. In \n     the manual, the league also promised to make unannounced \n     visits to teams to make sure no one tampered with the radio \n     systems. It would obviously be useful if the NFL and other \n     sports leagues would publicly disclose rules and procedural \n     changes to provide transparency in their operations instead \n     of waiting for leaks and news media ferreting out their \n     private moves which have a public impact with an arguable \n     public right to know.\n\n       A Thorough, Objective, Transparent Investigation is Needed\n\n       On the totality of the available evidence and the potential \n     unknown evidence, the Commissioner's investigation has been \n     fatally flawed. The lack of candor, the piecemeal \n     disclosures, the changes in position on material matters, the \n     failure to be proactive in seeking out other key witnesses, \n     and responding only when unavoidable when evidence is thrust \n     upon the NFL leads to the judgment that an impartial \n     investigation is mandatory.\n       There is an unmistakable atmosphere of conflict of interest \n     between what is in the public's interest and what is in the \n     NFL's interest. The NFL has good reason to disclose as little \n     as possible in its effort to convince the public that what \n     was done wasn't so bad, had no significant effect on the \n     games and, in any event, has been cleaned up. Enormous \n     financial interests are involved and the owners have a mutual \n     self-interest in sticking together. Evidence of winning by \n     cheating would have the inevitable effect of undercutting \n     public confidence in the game and reducing, perhaps \n     drastically, attendance and TV revenues.\n       Commissioner Goodell has conducted a closed door \n     investigation without specifying what key Patriot personnel \n     have said. He gives only generalized statements and those \n     shift with the wind to accommodate changes in the weather. \n     Uniform comments made by the owners raise the obvious \n     implication that they have coordinated their responses and \n     were issuing statements to the news media from talking points \n     which sought to minimize the seriousness of the taping. They \n     all said it had no impact on the games, specified that they \n     were satisfied with the Commissioner's results even though \n     their teams may have been prejudiced and said that they were \n     ready to move on.\n       The May 16, 2008 story by Sam Farmer of the Los Angeles \n     Times highlighted the credibility issue when decisions are \n     made among 32 owners behind closed doors:\n\n       The NFL is a $6-billion-a-year enterprise. Thanks to \n     Congress, it also enjoys an exemption from antitrust laws, a \n     luxury rarely afforded other businesses. With that comes \n     responsibility, especially when the league's credibility is \n     called into question. Making decisions among 32 owners in \n     closed-door meetings is not always the most forthright way to \n     go about things.\n       It wasn't so long ago that people wondered why the \n     government should be meddling with the big business of Wall \n     Street. Few people question that now.\n       A greater degree of transparency is essential the next time \n     a Spygate-type situation arises. That might help stem the \n     flood of rumors, half-truths and outright myths that swirled \n     around the New England story.\n\n       Congress conferred an antitrust exemption upon professional \n     sports, including football, because it was viewed as \n     necessary to their ability to organize a successful football \n     league. Over the years, the exemption, which allows the NFL \n     teams to jointly sell their television rights, has yielded \n     incredible profits for the NFL. It has been reported that the \n     NFL will generate $7.6 billion in revenue this season. \n     Congress has provided the antitrust exemption without any \n     guarantee of accountability. In light of the NFL's \n     investigation of the Patriots' taping, I thought it necessary \n     to ask the important questions to determine how widespread a \n     practice taping opponents' signals was and whether more could \n     be done to ensure the integrity of the game.\n       The public interest is enormous. Sports personalities are \n     role models for all of us, especially youngsters. If the \n     Patriots can cheat, so can the college teams, so can the high \n     school teams, so can the 6th grader taking a math \n     examination. The Congress has granted the NFL a most \n     significant business advantage, an antitrust exemption, \n     highly unusual in the commercial world. That largesse can \n     continue only if the NFL can prove itself worthy. Beyond \n     the issues of role models and antitrust, America has a \n     love affair with sports. Professional football has topped \n     all other sporting events in fan interest. Americans have \n     a right to be guaranteed that their favorite sport is \n     honestly competitive.\n       It may be that the entire matter will have to percolate for \n     a while. The attention span of the American people, including \n     sports writers, is limited by the rush of ongoing superseding \n     events on compelling national and international issues. \n     Sports fans and others may have lost interest for reasons \n     stated by Dave Fairbank in the Newport News, Virginia Daily \n     Press on May 24, 2008 when he commented on why the public \n     tires of investigations and has not demanded a Mitchell-type \n     inquiry:\n\n       Granted many of you who eyeball pro sports have reached the \n     saturation point.\n\n[[Page S5142]]\n\n     You don't care which baseball players used steroids. You \n     don't want to hear if the Patriots filmed games and tried to \n     steal signals.\n       You are so over Donaghy and the idea of fixed NBA games. \n     You don't want to know which Olympic athlete tested positive \n     when.\n       You want games. Period. Scores, rivalries, matchups, \n     pennant races, playoff runs.\n\n       There are signs bubbling below the surface that potential \n     imminent events could stimulate renewed interest in the NFL's \n     integrity. The NFL is mentioned in investigations of other \n     sports.\n       The New York Times, on May 25, 2008, sounded an alarm on \n     fixing in sporting contests noting:\n\n       With Internet gambling predicted to surpass $20 billion in \n     2008, and with illegal wagering accounting for $150 billion \n     in the United States, by some estimates, the temptation for \n     those seeking to influence the outcome of games has never \n     been greater. Now, a raft of gambling scandals in sports, \n     from cricket to soccer and most recently tennis, has raised \n     an uncomfortable question: Are the games we watch fixed?\n\n       A report commissioned by the major tennis governing bodies \n     recommended that 45 matches played in the last five years be \n     investigated because betting patterns gave a ``strong \n     indication'' that gamblers were profiting from inside \n     information. And those matches, the report said, may be only \n     the tip of the iceberg.\n       Betfair offers betting on major sports based in the United \n     States, like the NFL, the NBA and Major League Baseball. But \n     it does not take any wagers from the United States or China, \n     Japan, Hong Kong or India, places where online gambling is \n     illegal. (Emphasis added.)\n\n       In a May 29, 2008 Philadelphia Inquirer article, Phil \n     Sheridan begins with analyzing the basketball scandal \n     involving referee Tim Donaghy and then moves to other sports \n     including the NFL:\n\n       Instead of being critical of an official's call, fans now \n     openly suspect the NBA (and the NHL and the NFL) of dictating \n     the outcomes of postseason games. Instead of trusting in the \n     fundamental integrity of the games, fans have good cause to \n     wonder whether there isn't some secret script.\n\n       Within the past week, two major newspapers have carried \n     comments calling for an extended investigation. The May 29, \n     2008 Philadelphia Inquirer editorial noted its change of \n     position on my activity:\n\n       Sen. Arlen Specter (R., Pa.) criticized the NFL for \n     prematurely shutting down the investigation and destroying \n     any related evidence.\n       The senator's involvement initially prompted this Editorial \n     Board to conclude that he should be spending his time and \n     taxpayers' money on weightier issues. But, in retrospect, \n     Specter may be on to something.\n       Given the inherent conflict that the NFL has with its \n     teams--after all, it prospers when they prosper--an \n     independent investigation seems warranted. That's the route \n     the governing bodies of professional tennis took after \n     allegations surfaced regarding match fixing.\n       An independent review recommended that 45 pro tennis \n     matches played in the last five years be investigated. The \n     review found betting patterns in those matches that showed \n     large wagers had been placed on underdogs, an indication that \n     bettors might have had inside information. The inquiry \n     continues.\n       Meanwhile, what's most disturbing about the betting and \n     taping scandals in the NBA and NFL is how both of those \n     leagues' commissioners seem more eager to move beyond the \n     controversies than to get to the truth. Independent, thorough \n     investigations are needed to ensure fans of the integrity of \n     the games.\n\n       After commenting that I appear vulnerable because Comcast \n     of Philadelphia is at war with the NFL and the Eagles lost \n     the Super Bowl to New England in 2004, Skip Rozin wrote in \n     the May 31, 2008 edition of the Wall Street Journal: ``But \n     neither of these facts blunts the point of his (my) inquiry; \n     the NFL seems to beg for intervention.'' Rozin then \n     references the response to the 1919 World Series White Sox/\n     Black Sox scandal where newly appointed commissioner \n     (formerly federal judge) Kenesaw Mountain Landis banned the \n     eight players involved for life, even though a court found \n     insufficient evidence to convict them. Rozin concluded:\n\n       When steroid abuse recently threatened to turn that same \n     sport and its records into a joke, it took the threat of \n     congressional intervention to force Major League Baseball to \n     act.\n       Throwing games, taking steroids, spying on opponents--it's \n     all cheating. And any attack on the credibility of the game \n     is a serious threat. The NFL had a chance to act decisively \n     to clean its own house, but it failed to do so, leaving the \n     door open to Congress.\n\n       In a March 3, 2008 Philadelphia Inquirer column, Michael \n     Smerconish called Commissioner Goodell's response to the \n     Patriots' videotaping ``odd,'' characterized responses by \n     other franchise owners as ``teams seem to be reading from \n     timid talking points . . .'' and said ``if the NFL appears \n     lax in this matter, it risks being compared to professional \n     wrestling where nothing is `real'.'' Smerconish concluded:\n\n       What's needed is (a) truly independent investigation, and \n     (b) an NFL commissioner who is intolerant of cheating--in the \n     mold of baseball commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis, who \n     took the helm in 1920 after the Chicago Black Sox scandal--to \n     protect pro football from itself.\n       After thinking and rethinking this matter, it is hard for \n     me to understand the willingness of the public, the media and \n     even the NFL to accept the status quo. There is no higher \n     value in our society than integrity. Americans' addiction \n     to sports, with the NFL at the top, is based on the \n     excitement generated by the potential for the unexpected \n     great play which can only happen with honest competition \n     from great athletes. The clouds are heavy and getting \n     heavier.\n       My strong preference is for the NFL to activate a Mitchell-\n     type investigation. I have been careful not to call for a \n     Congressional hearing because I believe the NFL should step \n     forward and embrace an independent inquiry and Congress is \n     extraordinarily busy on other matters. If the NFL continues \n     to leave a vacuum, Congress may be tempted to fill it.\n\n Collateral Considerations: I Challenged the NFL's Conduct Long Before \n              Comcast Became a Major Pennsylvania Company\n\n       Occasional rumors have been floated to the media that I am \n     motivated to protect Comcast in its battles with the NFL. The \n     solid historical record demonstrates that I have been \n     concerned about the NFL's conduct long before Comcast became \n     a power.\n       In 1982, I was approached by the NFL to request Senator \n     Strom Thurmond, Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, \n     to have hearings on the proposed move by Al Davis and the \n     Oakland Raiders from Oakland to Los Angeles. I had introduced \n     S. 2821 on August 9, 1982, to prevent a professional football \n     team from leaving a city where it has established ties unless \n     it could not survive as a profitable business. In my \n     statement introducing S. 2821, I said:\n\n       This legislation is premised on the judgment that sports \n     fans in a city have a form of a `proprietary interest' in \n     their team which should preclude the owners from moving the \n     franchise unless it is a failing business. In my judgment, a \n     sports team is ``affected with the public interest.''\n       I believe a sports team is different from a regular \n     business entity. If an ordinary business moves away another \n     such business will take its place if a reasonable profit \n     could be made. That is customarily not so with a sports team.\n       It is my sense that two generations of sport fans still \n     resent the movement of the Brooklyn Dodgers and the New York \n     Giants baseball franchise. Conversely people understood that \n     the necessity for the relocation of the St. Louis Browns and \n     the Philadelphia, and later Kansas City, Athletics.\n       On August 16, 1982, the Senate Judiciary Committee began \n     hearings on that legislation. The key witnesses were NFL \n     Commissioner Pete Rozelle and Al Davis, owner of the Oakland \n     Raiders.\n       On January 3, 1985, I introduced S. 172 with the same \n     objective when the Eagles threatened to move to Phoenix. In \n     my floor statement, I said:\n\n       According to media accounts, the estimated cost to \n     Philadelphia taxpayers of the concessions made by the city to \n     retain the Eagles is at least $30 million over the next 20 \n     years. On December 17, [1984,] I wrote to Commissioner \n     Rozelle and stated that the National Football League, rather \n     than the city of Philadelphia, should bear the cost of any \n     concessions which have been made to keep the Eagles in \n     Philadelphia.\n       Commissioner Rozelle answered on December 19, 1984 without \n     responding to my question concerning the cost of the \n     concessions made by the city of Philadelphia and my belief \n     that such costs should be born by the National Football \n     League.\n       On March 19, 1987, I introduced similar legislation, S. \n     782, The Professional Sports Community Protection Act of \n     1987.\n       On March 19, 1996, I again introduced similar legislation, \n     S. 1625, The Professional Sports Franchise Relocation Act of \n     1996.\n       On March 19, 1999, I introduced the Stadium Financing and \n     Franchise Relocation Act of 1999, S. 952, conditioning the \n     NFL and MLB antitrust exemptions on their paying part of \n     construction costs for new stadiums by requiring the Leagues \n     to deposit ten percent of the amounts received under the \n     joint agreement for the sale or transfer of the rights in \n     sponsored telecasting of games to finance the construction or \n     renovation of playing facilities, upon request of a local \n     governmental entity.\n       Comcast was not affected by the NFL's antitrust exemption. \n     Paul Tagliabue, attorney for the NFL, appearing with \n     Commissioner Rozelle in the 1982 hearing, confirmed the point \n     that the antitrust exemption did not cover pay and cable when \n     he said:\n\n       [T]he words ``sponsored telecasting'' in that statute were \n     intended to exclude pay and cable. That is clear from the \n     legislative history and from the committee reports. So, that \n     statute does not authorize us to pool and sell to pay and \n     cable.\n\n\n Comcast Has Only in the Last Decade Become a Powerful Mega-Corporation\n\n                                  1982\n\n       Total Assets: $171,404,000\n       Total Revenue: $62,838,000\n       Basic Cable Subscribers: 284,000\n       Employees: 994\n\n\n                                  1985\n\n       Total Assets: $360,998,000\n       Total Revenue: $117,312,000\n       Basic Cable Subscribers: 516,000\n\n[[Page S5143]]\n\n       Employees: 1318\n\n\n                                  1987\n\n       Total Assets: $1,034,876,000\n       Total Revenue: $309,250,000\n       Basic Cable Subscribers: 1,336,000\n       Employees: 2794\n\n\n                                  1996\n\n       Total Assets: $12,088,600,000\n       Total Revenue: $4,038,400,000\n       Basic Cable Subscribers: 4,300,000\n       Employees: 16,400\n\n\n                                  1999\n\n       Total Assets: $28,685,600,000\n       Total Revenue: $6,209,200,000\n       Total Cable Subscribers: 6,200,000\n       Employees 25,700\n\n\n                                  2007\n\n       Total Assets: $113,400,000,000\n       Total Revenue: $30,900,000,000\n       Total Video Subscribers: 24,100,000\n       Employees: 100,000\n\nMy Work on the Patriots Videotaping Did Not Interfere With Other Senate \n                                 Duties\n\n       I take very seriously any suggestion that this matter \n     impacted on my other Senate work. The facts are that the few \n     hours I spent on the NFL issue did not detract from my Senate \n     duties. For twenty-eight years in the United States Senate \n     and before that as Philadelphia's District Attorney, I have \n     established a record of comprehensively covering all my \n     responsibilities.\n       A few hours were involved in writing an occasional letter, \n     meeting with Commissioner Goodell and Matt Walsh and being \n     interviewed by sports columnists and radio-TV talk show \n     hosts. A listing of some of my Senate activities from October \n     2007 to May 2008 confirms I was diligent in attending to my \n     Senate duties.\n       During that period I missed only two votes out of 180 \n     (98.8% attendance). Those two votes were missed on April 4, \n     2008 when I was getting a PET scan at the Hospital of the \n     University of Pennsylvania.\n       It is with some reservation that I am inserting this \n     section because it may appear overly defensive. But the facts \n     are the facts and I think the record should be documented on \n     this important issue.\n\n          Some of My Senate Activities: October 2007--May 2008\n\n\n                              Legislation\n\n       Gas Prices, S. 879--Cosponsored S. 879 with Senator Kohl to \n     take away the OPEC's antitrust protection exemption to \n     increase oil supply thereby reducing the cost of oil at the \n     barrel and gasoline at the pump.\n       Patent Reform, S. 1145--Cosponsored S. 1145 with Senators \n     Leahy and Hatch to provide comprehensive patent reform.\n       Climate Change, S. 1766--Cosponsored S. 1766 with Senator \n     Bingaman to provide comprehensive legislation to combat \n     global warming.\n       Mortgage Default Protection, S. 2133--Introduced \n     legislation to authorize bankruptcy courts to modify the \n     terms of variable rate mortgages, mortgages where there \n     frequently was misrepresentation by leaders and/or \n     misunderstanding by borrowers.\n       Economic Stimulus Measure, S. 2539--Introduced S. 2539 to \n     give businesses 50% bonus depreciation for purchases made \n     during 2008 and 2009, a modified version of which was \n     included in the 2008 stimulus package.\n       State Secrets, S. 2533--Cosponsored S. 2533 with Senator \n     Kennedy to require courts to evaluate state secrets claims as \n     a check to avoid potential executive branch abuse.\n       Terrorist Surveillance Program and DOJ/FBI Oversight--Held \n     extensive oversight hearings with the Attorney General, the \n     FBI director, and the Homeland Security Secretary to provide \n     judicial oversight for wiretapping.\n       Foreign Intelligence Surveillance--Committee and floor \n     amendment to substitute the U.S. government for the telephone \n     companies to secure judicial review for warrantless \n     wiretapping.\n       Recidivism Reduction, S. 1060--Cosponsored S. 1060 with \n     Senator Biden which was signed into law by President Bush on \n     April 9, 2008 entitled ``Second Chance Act of 2007.''\n       Journalist Protection, S. 2977--Cosponsored S. 2977 with \n     Senator Lieberman to protect American journalists from libel \n     suits brought in foreign countries with less protections of \n     free speech.\n       Intellectual Property Enforcement, S. 2317--Cosponsored S. \n     2317 with Senators Leahy and Cornyn to help the Justice \n     Department combat copyright infringements.\n       Media Shield, S. 2035--Obtained vote of 15-4 in Senate \n     Judiciary Committee on a bill co-sponsored by Senators \n     Schumer and Lugar that provides evidentiary privilege to \n     reporters.\n       Foreign Maintenance of Aircraft, S.

Mr. President, 5 years ago President Bush and this \nadministration misled this country into a war that should never have \nbeen waged, a war that has cost our Nation the lives of more than 4,000 \ncourageous men and women, squandered many hundreds of billions of our \ntax dollars, and diminished the world's faith in our country.\n  This morning, the Senate Intelligence Committee, led by our \ndistinguished chairman, Senator Jay Rockefeller of West Virginia, \nreleased a report confirming what many have long feared: that the Bush \nadministration ignored or swept aside substantial reliable intelligence \nthat portrayed something other than what the President and his \npolitical allies wanted America to see.\n  The decision to take the Nation to war, as Chairman Rockefeller \nindicated, is among the gravest and most momentous that a leader can \nmake. In our democracy, we expect and deserve to be sure that when our \ntroops are sent in harm's way, when their families are made to watch \nand wait through sleepless nights, when our security and national \nwelfare is put on the line, that that decision has been taken for the \nright reasons. This is a sacred compact, an article of faith between \nour people and our Government.\n  This administration broke that compact, betrayed that trust. For \nyears, the evidence has been mounting that this administration's \nreasons for the war were a sham. This week, the President's own former \nspokesman indicated that the White House ran a ``political propaganda \ncampaign'' building the case for war.\n  This morning's report is a chilling reminder of the Bush \nadministration's willingness to overlook or set aside intelligence that \ndoes not confirm to its preordained view of the world. Over and over, \nagain the committee documented instances in which public statements by \nthe President, the Vice President, and members of the administration's \nnational security team were at odds with available intelligence \ninformation. By leading the American people to believe the situation in \nIraq was significantly more drastic than it actually was, the Bush \nadministration took this country into an unnecessary war, a war it \nstill refuses to end.\n  In a speech in Cincinnati a little over a year after al-Qaida \nattacked America on September 11, President Bush said:\n\n       We know that Iraq and al-Qaida have had high-level contacts \n     that go back a decade. We have learned that Iraq has trained \n     al-Qaida members in bomb-making and poisons and deadly \n     gasses.\n\n  In his 2003 State of the Union Address, a few short weeks before \ngiving the order that began this war, the President said:\n\n       Evidence from intelligence sources, secret communications \n     and statements by people now in custody, reveal that Saddam \n     Hussein aids and protects terrorists, including members of \n     al-Qaida.\n\n  It was not true. The President of the United States told these things \nto our people and to the world, and they were false.\n  According to the report released this morning by our committee:\n\n       Statements and implications by the President and Secretary \n     of State suggesting that Iraq and al-Qaida had a partnership \n     or that Iraq had provided al-Qaida with weapons training were \n     not substantiated by the intelligence.\n\n  The committee found that multiple CIA reports and a National \nIntelligence Estimate, released in November 2002, even as the \nadministration was in the drumbeat to war, ``dismissed the claim that \nIraq and al-Qaida were cooperating partners.'' It was not true, and yet \nthis President used this claim to convince the American public that \nthere was a link between the Iraqi Government and the terrorists that \nperpetrated the crimes of September 11, 2001.\n  Again, in an October 2002 speech in Cincinnati, the President said:\n\n       We know that the regime has produced thousands of tons of \n     chemical agents, including mustard gas, sarin nerve gas, VX \n     nerve gas. Saddam Hussein also has experience in using \n     chemical weapons. . . .Every chemical and biological weapon \n     that Iraq has or makes is a direct violation of the truce \n     that ended the Persian Gulf war in 1991. Yet, Saddam Hussein \n     has chosen to build and keep these weapons despite \n     international sanctions, U.N. demands, and isolation from the \n     civilized world.\n\n  The report concludes:\n\n       Statements by the President and Vice President prior to the \n     October 2002 National Intelligence Estimate regarding Iraq's \n     chemical weapons production capabilities and activities did \n     not reflect the intelligence community's uncertainties as to \n     whether such production was ongoing.\n\n  The intelligence community knew Saddam Hussein wanted to be able to \nproduce chemical weapons. It could not, however, confirm President \nBush's claim of certainty that Hussein's regime was actually producing \nchemical weapons. Yet the President made that argument, stirring up \nunfounded fears among the American people.\n  This administration not only asserted that Saddam Hussein possessed \nchemical weapons and intended to use them, the President also said in \nhis speech on October 2002:\n\n       We could wait and hope that Saddam does not give weapons to \n     terrorists, or develop a nuclear weapon to blackmail the \n     world. But I'm convinced that is a hope against all evidence.\n\n\n[[Page S5145]]\n\n\n  He said:\n\n       We cannot wait for the final proof--the smoking gun--that \n     could come in the form of a mushroom cloud.\n\n  Mr. President, again, it was not true. The committee's report states:\n\n       Statements by the President and the Vice President \n     indicating that Saddam Hussein was prepared to give weapons \n     of mass destruction to terrorist groups for attacks against \n     the United States were contradicted by available intelligence \n     information.\n\n  At the time of the President's speech, the intelligence community \nbelieved Saddam Hussein did not possess nuclear weapons. The President \npreyed on Americans' fears of a nuclear attack, perhaps the most \nterrible fear we could have, to bolster his case for an unwarranted \nwar.\n  Finally, the President led the American people to believe if it came \nto war in Iraq, America's military would easily help liberate a \ngrateful nation. In Cincinnati, in 2002, he said:\n\n       If military action is necessary, the United States and our \n     allies will help the Iraqi people to rebuild their economy, \n     and create the institutions of liberty and a unified Iraq at \n     peace with its neighbors.\n\n  This was the ``hope against all evidence.''\n  Analysis by the Defense Intelligence Agency assessed that:\n\n       The Iraqi populace will adopt an ambivalent attitude toward \n     liberation.\n\n  That is an understatement.\n  The CIA wrote, in August 2002, that ``traditional Iraqi political \nculture has been inhospitable to democracy.''\n  According to the committee's report:\n\n       Statements by President Bush and Vice President Cheney \n     regarding the postwar situation, in Iraq in terms of the \n     political, security, and economic [situation], did not \n     reflect the concerns and uncertainties expressed in the \n     intelligence products.\n\n  The view of the President and Vice President that American troops \nwould be ``greeted as liberators'' did not take into account the \ncomplex social, political, and sectarian dynamics at work about which \nthe intelligence community was well aware. Yet this administration \nstill led the American people to believe our troops would be welcomed, \nthat the war would be short, that the burden in lives and dollars would \nbe light, and that victory would be absolute. This delusion has cost \nour service men and women and our Nation every day since. Once again, \nit was not true. It just was not true.\n  If this administration had made the least effort to give an honest \nreview of classified intelligence, it would have been known to be \nuntrue. All too often in these 7 long years we have seen this \nadministration cast aside facts and principles that did not conform \nwith its political aims.\n  We have seen it attempt to take great institutions of our country--\nour intelligence community, our Environmental Protection Agency, the \nDepartment of Justice--and twist them to its own ends, without due \nregard for the welfare of the American people. I believe the \nirresponsibility and mismanagement of this administration will go down \nin our history as among the darkest moments our Government has \nwitnessed. It rocks the very fiber of democracy when our Government is \nput to these uses. We do not yet know all the damage that has been \ndone. Yet we hope, through the efforts of this committee and this body, \nto continue the long and difficult repair work we have begun.\n  We can look ahead to next January when we in our Nation can begin \nagain with a new administration, an administration that will not break \nthe essential compact of honesty with the American people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/05/senate-section/article/S5145-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5145]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          READING IS FUN WEEK\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE.

Mr. President, I take this time to urge my colleagues to \nput aside our partisan differences. Let's follow the leadership of \nSenator Lieberman, Senator Warner, and Senator Boxer and find a way to \nmove forward with the global warming legislation. It is so important to \nthis country.\n  The scientific information is clear. There is something happening out \nthere. We all know about it. We know the weather changes. We see \nextreme weather taking place--the droughts, the floods, the impact it \nis having on our food chain, the drought in Australia with the wheat \ncrop and what it has done with bread prices. In my State of Maryland we \nsee the warming of the Chesapeake Bay and the impact it has on blue \ncrabs with the eelgrass which is critically important for juvenile \ncrabs not being there.\n  The Governor imposed a restriction on the taking of blue crabs during \nthis season. I could give 100 more examples.\n  If I can't convince my colleagues on the science, let me refer to an \nissue on which we can all agree; that is, we need energy independence. \nOur global warming bill leads us to energy independence. We need energy \nindependence for national security, so we are not dependent upon other \ncountries. We need energy independence so we don't have to wake up \nevery morning to find out what OPEC is doing that affects gasoline \nprices in the United States. We need energy independence for our \nenvironment.\n  This legislation uses market forces to solve the problem of \ngreenhouse gases. We did that with acid rain, and it worked, far less \nexpensively than the projections, and the benefit ratio to cost was 40 \nto 1. If we unleash our economy, we can solve this problem.\n  Let me state the obvious: When we invest in renewables--and this \nlegislation does--we invest in energy efficiency. If we invest in \npublic transportation, we are going to have less use of gasoline by \nAmericans--yes, less use of oil. If we have less use of oil, gasoline \nprices are going to go down, supply and demand. If we have less use of \noil, we are going to be less dependent on other countries. If we use \nless oil, we control our own economic future.\n  But this legislation goes further than that, providing assistance \nfor, perhaps, consequences we can't fully understand. So we provide \nhelp to heavy industry. Maryland is a proud manufacturing State. It has \na great history of manufacturing. I want to make sure Maryland has a \nfuture in manufacturing. This legislation deals with that, providing \nhelp to our industries. We don't know exactly what impact it is going \nto have on different constituencies. The legislation provides help for \nconsumers. Just as importantly, this legislation provides that it is \ndeficit neutral; that we will make sure we don't have to borrow more \nmoney. In fact, this legislation will mean Americans will borrow less. \nIt is good for our economy.\n  Another part of this bill I found very helpful and that hasn't \nreceived a lot of attention is that we establish a level playing field \nso if other countries don't put a cap on their carbon emissions, they \nhave to pay a tariff to bring their product to America, so that we \ndon't put American manufacturers, producers, or farmers at a \ncompetitive disadvantage.\n  There is one particular section of this bill I would like to \nunderscore and I am particularly proud of because I introduced the \namendment in committee and worked with Senator Boxer, and that is the \npublic transit provisions. It provides over $170 billion during the \nlife of the bill to build stronger public transportation in America. \nOne-third of all CO2 emissions come from transportation. But \nin the last 15 years, 50 percent of the increase in our emissions have \ncome from the transportation sector.\n  The projected growth in the next 30 years of vehicle traffic alone \nwould negate all the benefit from the CAFE standard increases we passed \nlast year if we don't take more aggressive steps to get cars off the \nroad. Public transportation is critically important. It reduces \nemissions.\n  People are interested in public transportation. Since 1995, we have \nseen a 32-percent increase in ridership, 10.3 billion passenger trips \nin 2007. In the first quarter of this year, there has been a 3.3-\npercent increase in public transportation. That is 85 million more \ntrips on public transportation. The problem is the physical \ninfrastructure\n\n[[Page S5146]]\n\nneeds attention. The ridership at peak hours is already full. We need \ngreater capacity. We need more efficiency and more economy in the use \nof public transportation. This legislation provides for it. Of the \nfunds that are provided--the $170 billion plus--95 percent is \ndistributed on the SAFETEA-LU formula; 65 percent for existing systems; \n30 percent for new starts; and 5 percent in competitive grants for \ntransportation alternatives and travel demand reduction projects.\n  It is supported by the American Public Transportation Association, \nthe National League of Cities, and I could add many more.\n  Mr. President, I strongly support this bill as brought forward by \nSenator Boxer. I urge my colleagues to support it. I do have amendments \nto improve it. I hope we will get to amendments. One of my amendments \nwould include the public transportation sector by including \nmetropolitan planning organizations as eligible entities to receive \ngrants under the funding. This builds upon smart growth. Maryland \nprovided leadership nationally on how smart growth can add to our \nenergy independence and a cleaner environment. That experience in \nMaryland can be used nationwide. My amendment will make funds available \nfor States to move forward for smart growth.\n  The amendment also provides for transit enhancements, including \npedestrian and bicycle infrastructure that would be eligible \nactivities. In Maryland, I am proud of the work we have done in taking \nfunds and building paths for bicycles and pedestrians. The Gwynns Falls \nGreenway in Baltimore and the Jones Falls Greenway are examples of how \nwe have rehabilitated historical trails where people can walk and bike \nand add to the quality of life.\n  Another amendment that I intend to offer will allow for the clean, \nmedium-heavy truck vehicle fleets which are provided for in this bill, \nfunds to help fleets use clean energy but to expand that to public \nentities--Senator Specter and Senator Carper are joining me on that--\nthat they would qualify. That will help vehicle manufacturers. The \ncoalition that supported the original provision for fleet vehicles--\nsuch as Volvo, PowerTran, UPS, Federal Express, and PepsiCo--supports \nthe change I am suggesting.\n  Lastly, let me point to intercity rail. I will offer an amendment to \nprovide funding for intercity rail. I think it is another way we can \nget people out of their cars. That is what we have to do if we are \ngoing to have a clean environment and be energy independent. The \nintercity rail is another way we can do it.\n  Let me make it clear, I hope we get to amendments. Amendments can \nstrengthen this bill. This bill needs to be strengthened. But the bill \nbefore us today is a bill that deserves our support. I hope my \ncolleagues will vote in favor of making sure we move forward to enact \nglobal warming legislation this year. I urge my colleagues to do that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/05/senate-section/article/S5146-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5146-S5147]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              HONORING THE LATE SENATOR ROBERT F. KENNEDY\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, tomorrow our Nation will mark the 40th \nanniversary of Senator Robert F. Kennedy's death. In his all too brief \nlifetime, Robert Kennedy was an icon of the struggle for civil and \nhuman rights, social justice, and peace. In the midst of the civil \nrights movement, the increasingly unpopular war in Vietnam, and the \nassassination of the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Senator \nKennedy stood as a beacon of hope, inspiring Americans from all walks \nof life that we could rise above our Nation's struggles. With his death \nin the early morning of June 6, 1968, America lost a true public \nservant, a voice for the underprivileged and underserved, and a source \nof hope during a turbulent time.\n  My own political career began the year before, in 1967, but for years \nprior, Robert Kennedy's life had inspired me to seek public office. \nAfter managing his brother John's successful 1952 Senate campaign, \nRobert Kennedy worked briefly on Capitol Hill. He then went on to serve \nin his brother John's administration as Attorney General, where he was \nrenowned for his diligence, effectiveness, and nonpartisanship. At \nJustice, he pursued a relentless battle against organized crime, \nfrequently at odds with Federal Bureau of Investigation Director J. \nEdgar Hoover. During his tenure, convictions of notorious organized \ncrime figures rose eightfold. It was also during this time that Robert \nKennedy moved to center stage in the struggle for civil rights. On May \n6, 1961, he visited the University of Georgia, which just months before \nhad admitted its first black students. Kennedy addressed the \nuniversity's law school, enunciating the administration's position on \ncivil rights, stating:\n\n       We must recognize the full human equality of all our \n     people--before God, before the law, and in the councils of \n     government. We must do this not because it is economically \n     advantageous--although it is; not because the laws of God and \n     man command it--although they do command it; not because \n     people in other lands wish it so. We must do it for the \n     single and fundamental reason that it is the right thing to \n     do.\n\n  Robert Kennedy's commitment to promoting African Americans' right to \nvote, receive an equal education, and equal protection under the law \nintensified over time. In 1962 he sent U.S. Marshals and troops to \nOxford, MS to enforce a Federal court order admitting the first black \nstudent, James Meredith, to the University of Mississippi. As Attorney \nGeneral, Robert Kennedy demanded that every corner of Government begin \nrecruiting realistic levels of blacks and other minorities. He \ncollaborated with Presidents Kennedy and Johnson to create the landmark \nCivil Rights Act of 1964, and served as one of its most forceful and \ncommitted proponents.\n  In 1964, Robert Kennedy ran for the U.S. Senate, challenging and \ndefeating incumbent Republican Senator Kenneth Keating of New York. As \na Senator, Robert Kennedy continued to champion civil rights, human \nrights, and disenfranchised peoples, both at home and abroad. When few \npoliticians dared to entangle themselves in the politics of South \nAfrica, Senator Kennedy spoke out against oppression and injustice \nthere. His groundbreaking 1966 visit to South Africa helped awaken \nAmericans to the bitter realities of apartheid. During this period, he \nvociferously opposed the Vietnam war, advocating for increased \ndiplomacy rather than the use of force.\n  At home in New York, Senator Kennedy initiated a number of projects \nin the State, including assistance to underprivileged children and \nstudents with disabilities. He authored legislation that led to the \nestablishment of the Bedford-Stuyvesant Restoration Corporation, which \nimproved living conditions and brought employment opportunities to \neconomically depressed areas of Brooklyn. Now in its 40th year, the \nprogram remains a model for communities across the Nation. This program \nwas part of a broader effort to address the needs of the dispossessed \nand powerless in America. He sought to bring the facts about poverty to \nthe conscience of the American people, journeying into poor urban \nneighborhoods, Appalachia, the Mississippi Delta, Indian reservations, \nand migrant workers' camps.\n  Senator Kennedy's fervent belief that America could do better \ncompelled him to seek the Democratic Presidential nomination in 1968. \nThe night of June 5 should have been a triumphant one for Robert \nKennedy. After winning the California primary by four points, he seemed \ndestined to secure the nomination, standing as a symbol of the hope and \nchange that so many people across the country desperately wanted, but \nhis life was cut short by an assassin's bullet. Coming a mere 2 months \nafter the death of Martin Luther King, Jr., Robert Kennedy's death \nshocked the Nation.\n  Early in the afternoon on June 6, 1968, Robert Kennedy's body was \nflown from California to New York City's St. Patrick's Cathedral for a \nrequiem mass. On Saturday, June 8, a funeral train of 20 cars \ntransported Robert Kennedy's body from New York, through Baltimore, to \nWashington. Tens of thousands of Americans--some in the press estimated \na million people--lined the tracks to pay their respects. Robert \nKennedy's casket traveled down Constitution Avenue, past the Justice \nDepartment Building that now bears his name, to the Lincoln Memorial \nand across the bridge to Arlington National Cemetery, where he was \nburied next to his brother, President John F. Kennedy.\n  The legacy of Robert F. Kennedy--the passion with which he fought for\n\n[[Page S5147]]\n\ncivil and human rights, and his steadfast dedication to the \ndispossessed--has lived on in this Chamber for the past 40 years \nthrough his brother, our distinguished colleague and friend, Senator \nTed Kennedy. We are fortunate indeed that the Kennedy family's selfless \nservice to our Nation has extended to younger generations. In the House \nof Representatives, I was proud to serve with Robert Kennedy's eldest \nson, Joe, and his nephew, Patrick. His eldest daughter, Kathleen \nKennedy Townsend, served as Maryland's Lieutenant Governor for 8 years. \nBut the Kennedy family's wonderful record of public service is not \nlimited to elective office alone. Think of Joe Kennedy, who founded the \nCitizens Energy Corporation; or Robert Kennedy, Jr., who established \nthe Waterkeeper Alliance; or Courtney Kennedy Hill, who worked as a \nrepresentative for the United Nations AIDS Foundation. And I would be \nremiss not to mention Robert Kennedy's amazing wife, Ethel, widowed at \nthe age of 40 with 10 children and pregnant with another. Her courage \nand grace are an inspiration to us all.\n  At Robert Kennedy's request, his grave consists of a plain white \ncross and a stone slab on which is inscribed a passage from his Day of \nAffirmation speech to South Africans. It reads:\n\n       Each time a man stands up for an ideal, or acts to improve \n     the lot of others, or strikes out against injustice, he sends \n     forth a tiny ripple of hope, and crossing each other from a \n     million different centers of energy and daring, those ripples \n     build a current that can sweep down the mightiest walls of \n     oppression and resistance.\n\n  We can honor Robert Kennedy, his legacy, and his promise by standing \nup for an ideal, by acting to improve the lot of others, by striking \nout against injustice, and by sending forth those ripples of hope our \nNation and the rest of the world so desperately need.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The junior Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n  Mr. SMITH. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/05/senate-section/article/S5147-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5147-S5149]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, the Senate is engaged this week in a great \ndebate, an important debate, on the vital issue of global climate \nchange. I join that debate in order to find the best and most practical \nways to ease our dependence on foreign oil, reduce pollution, and \nencourage clean energy.\n  Climate change is real. It is a problem, and it needs our response--\nfor the sake of our economy, our environment, and our national \nsecurity. Our country's energy future is one of the greatest challenges \nwe will face in the coming decades. Addressing climate change is about \nwhat is good and what is right for our country, for our future. It is \nabout how we reduce our reliance on foreign oil, develop a new sector \nin the American economy that will spur domestic manufacturing, and \ncreate millions of new jobs, all while reducing harmful greenhouse gas \nemissions.\n  These challenges are too great and the stakes are too high--America \ncannot take a backseat or sit on the sidelines. We simply must lead on \nthis issue. We must make fundamental changes, and we must start now, \ntoday. We put a man on the Moon. We defeated communism. We even created \nan Internet world. Many thought the Internet was a fad, but look how it \nhas changed our world in a decade. A renewable energy economy can and \nwill do the same thing.\n  America is an exporter of our thoughts, our ideas, our dreams, our \nideals. On the great challenges facing us today, we must reach high, \nchallenge our thinking, and deliver results such as only the American \npeople can deliver.\n  We are on an upward path with the emergence of green, renewable \ntechnologies in the State of Oregon--wind, solar, wave, and geothermal. \nToday, in Oregon, we are leading the way, from innovative biomass in \nUmatilla, to geothermal in Klamath Falls, to our long-lived hydropower \ndams and wind farms in eastern Oregon.\n  Jobs are being created in Oregon by companies that research and \nmanufacture these new energy sources, boosting our economy, addressing \nclimate change, and cutting our dependence on foreign oil.\n  Oregon and the Northwest already enjoy one of the best sources of \ngreen energy--our hydroelectric dams--a source of 100-percent carbon-\nfree energy. These dams are not only critical to our economy but are a \nperfect example of existing sources of green energy.\n  In Oregon, we are leading the way in training the next generation \nworkforce for green-collar jobs. Schools across Oregon--Oregon State \nUniversity, Oregon Institute of Technology, Lane Community College, and \nColumbia Gorge Community College--are creating programs that will help \nsupply our State and Nation with a vibrant and skilled workforce to \naccommodate a future of renewable, independent, and clean energy \nfacilities.\n  Through a combination of Federal and State tax incentives, Oregon has \nbeen able to attract solar panel manufacturers, geothermal developers, \nfuel cell manufacturers, biomass facilities, and significant wind \nenergy facilities.\n  Oregon has become a hub of investment in solar facilities. For \nexample, SolarWorld, one of the biggest solar manufacturers on Earth, \nis investing over $650 million in a manufacturing facility in \nHillsboro, Oregon, that will employ over 1,000 people.\n  As the lead sponsor of legislation to provide for the long-term \nextension of the investment tax credit for solar and fuel cell \nfacilities, I am encouraged by the investments solar and fuel cell \ncompanies are making in Oregon and across the Nation.\n  We must provide for the extension of these and other renewable energy \ntax incentives in order to avoid the boom-bust cycle we see in these \nemerging technologies every time the tax credit is allowed to expire. \nThat is an action we can and should take now that will produce results \nnow.\n  We must set ourselves on a path to energy independence and reduce our \noil consumption. That is why I fought successfully to increase our \ninvestment in renewable fuels such as those thriving back in Oregon. \nThat is why Senator Obama and I passed a bill to raise the fuel \nefficiency standards for the first time in two decades for our \nautomobiles in this country.\n  We have been making small strides. Now we need to make big ones. \nRenewable energy sources and less oil consumption will benefit not only \nour environment but our economy and our national security--energy \nsources, clean ones, produced here at home instead of imported from the \nMiddle East.\n  The private sector in America is already visionary about a clean, \nstrong economy. We in Congress must help and not hinder. This \ntransformation will not happen overnight, but we can start now. We must \nstart today. Right now, the sources of our fuel-efficient vehicles and \nrenewable energy manufacturing too often come from foreign countries. \nIf we do not take the lead going forward, these foreign countries will. \nTo do so would put our country and our economy behind the eight ball, \nreliant upon others and not ourselves.\n  Right now, the world's fossil fuel is controlled by countries such as \nIran, Venezuela, and Russia. We cannot let our national security and \nour economic security be at risk to the whims of rogue governments. Our \nreliance on foreign oil has gotten us into the entanglements that many \nof us wish had not happened. By investing in a clean energy future--a \nskilled green workforce, investment in the next generation of biofuels, \nthe promotion of fuel-efficient transportation--we will depend on \nourselves, not on others.\n  It is also time for America and this Congress to debate the merits of \na new system to regulate carbon to reduce greenhouse gases and to \nreduce this country's carbon footprint. I know we can come together, in \nthis Chamber and with the next President, to practically and \neffectively reduce the greenhouse gases we emit in this country.\n  To truly reduce carbon, the response must be global. We have all the \ntools. We have the will, the technology, the raw resources. It is time \nto move forward for the sake of our environment, for the sake of our \neconomy, and for the sake of our national security. Success will only \nbe found in setting aside partisan agendas and focusing on common-\nground solutions.\n  Our country can do this, and we must lead. I have great confidence in \nthe will of the American people. They know this must be done. I will \nhelp to make sure it is done.\n\n[[Page S5148]]\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I thank the Presiding Officer for that \nrecognition.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer in this body for the chance to address \nan important topic. I am glad we are discussing important topics. It is \nimportant we get a chance to bring up these topics. I, similar to many \npeople, have spent a lot of time with experts and a lot of time with \npeople in my State talking about climate change issues and how we can \naddress them. I do not know of any topic that I have actually probably \nmet with more scientists on, more individuals about, than the climate \nchange topic. It is enormous, it is important, and it is something we \nneed to talk about and address.\n  When traveling across Kansas--we have 105 counties in the State, and \nI have been to 57 of them now within the last 6 months, going to all \n105 of them. We talk a lot about clean energy, and I talk about \nbalancing the three Es--the energy, the environment, and the economy. \nWe have to get these three Es balanced. They are like a cardboard piece \nbalanced on a pencil. You can kind of tilt them a little bit, you can \nmove it a little bit, but you cannot tank it one way or another. You \nhave to move these three together.\n  Most people across Kansas looking at the issue generally agree with \nthat. I want a clean environment. I want a healthy economy. I want \nenergy sources here at home, and I do not want to pay too much for \nthem. Most people are complaining bitterly today, as well they should \nbe, about the high price of energy. It is way too high: $4-a-gallon \ngasoline that people are having to pay. It is directly out of their \npocketbooks. It is directly impacting their economy.\n  We are a big energy-using State. We have a lot of manufacturing, \nagriculture. Diesel fuel is very important to us. It is well over $4 a \ngallon, getting up to $5 a gallon in some places. This is a very high-\nenergy formula, and the last thing people want today is to increase the \ncost of energy. At the same time, they recognize we need to deal with \nthe environment, and we have to grow this economy. So I wish to talk \nabout this in the sense of those three Es, being able to balance those \ntogether. I think we can and we should do that.\n  I read a paper recently that talked about the different waves of \nenvironmentalism. I thought it was quite good, and I think it is one \nthis body should look at. The title of the paper was ``The End of \nEnvironmentalism.'' It was written by a couple of very strong \nenvironmentalists. They were talking about what needs to take place \nnow. They were talking about the waves of environmentalism. They were \nsaying the first wave of environmentalism, if I can paraphrase them \nappropriately, was a conservation wave. The second wave was a \nregulatory wave. The third wave, that we are in right now, is an \ninvestment wave. That is the way you move this forward, through \ninvestment and through technology and for us to invest heavily in that \nnext wave of technology, to be able the balance these three Es I talked \nabout--energy, the economy, and the environment. That is the real way \nforward.\n  This bill does not get us going forward that way. The key for us to \nbe able to do investment is to be able to have a very robust economy \nand for people to invest in these next-wave technologies, not to load \nadditional costs onto the system. We can look at the cost of what they \nare today, and then you can look at the projected cost of what this \nbill would put on the American public and on the energy economy and, at \nthe end of day, still not produce the sorts of results we need to have \nof strong key reductions in CO2 and, at the same time, \nmaintaining the economy and giving us enough energy to be able to move \nforward.\n  I would like to point out--and a number of my colleagues have already \ndone this--what this bill will do on driving up the price of \nelectricity. The Energy Information Administration predicts electric \nprices will be 64 percent higher in 2030 as a result of the bill, fuel \nprices 53 cents higher by 2030. Actually, I do not think anybody knows, \nother than they know it will be higher.\n  But I think the biggest stat came yesterday, for me, from Western \nResources. It is a utility in my hometown of Topeka, KS, that provides \nelectricity through much of the State. They are saying, at a $20-a-ton \ncost for CO2, that is going to raise their fuel costs. It is \ngoing to more than double the cost of their fuel as compared to what \nthey are looking at presently. We are getting the actual statistics. We \nare going to put that, later, in the Record. But this is going to be a \ndramatic increase in the price of electricity for people in Topeka, KS, \nand across my State.\n  We are a strong coal user, using coal out of the Powder River Basin. \nI think, as we look forward to the future, the answer is not: No, we \nare not going to use particular types of energy. It is how you use \nenergy and you reduce your CO2, how you build the next \ngeneration of coal-fired plants and reduce the CO2 \nfootprint.\n  A very innovative project is being put forward in the western part of \nmy State. There is a coal-fired plant, where they take the C02 stream--\nbecause we don't know how to do CO2 sequestration on a \nmassive scale yet--they take that C02 stream and run it through algae \nreactors and have the algae harvest, of sorts, the CO2; and \nthey are building in their biological photosynthesis process and then \ntaking the algae and making biodiesel out of that.\n  Yes, it is experimental, but it is on a large scale experimental, and \nit is the sort of thing we ought to be looking to for us to invest in \nthat next wave of environmentalism, being an investment wave, to see if \nwe can make these things work in the interim, where we do not know how \nwe are going to be able to sequester, and we cannot drive up too fast \nthe cost of energy because energy prices are so high right now and \npeople are very sensitive to energy prices, as well they should be. We \nshould be sensitive to their sensitivity of energy prices.\n  I think the way we move this forward is with innovation and \ntechnology and investment rather than loading a lot of cost on a system \nthat, at the end of the day, could well--and in all probability, from \nsome of the projections, will have huge, substantial impacts and, \nindeed, may well have the adverse impact of driving things overseas. I \nthink there is a lot in this bill that has unpredictable consequences \nother than, we know, an increased cost in the United States. That piece \nwe do know about. But what will happen? How will industry react to \nthis? Where will it go? We do know costs will go up for American \nconsumers at a time when we can ill afford to do that; at a time when \nwe would be better off taking those increased costs of investment and \nputting them into the next wave of technology. That is the route \nforward. That is the route to stabilize. That is the route to move us \nand to balance the three ``e''s in this process as we move forward.\n\n  I am going to be putting forward different amendments and proposals \nto do just that; to see if we can put forward ideas, particularly in \nthe agricultural sector, to help with carbon sequestration projects, to \nhelp with ethanol and biodiesel and wind and solar power, soybean and \nalgae as an investment, as a way of storing it through a natural \nprocess, but not putting on a hard cap and trade that adds costs in the \nsystem. I think that is the sort of pioneering spirit--that is the sort \nof investment type of way--that we need to go forward.\n  I am pleased that an amendment I am working on with Senators Stabenow \nand Crapo has the backing of the American Farm Bureau on a more robust \neffort on CO2 sequestration via agriculture. I think that is \na key way we can move forward and have some success.\n  Finally, I wish to note to my colleagues as well that we are woefully \nbehind on getting judges approved for the circuit court. That was a \nsubject that stalled this body yesterday and I predict to my colleagues \nthat it is going to stall us a lot more if we don't start getting on \ntrack to increase the number and get to even a minimal number of \ncircuit court nominees to be approved during the remainder of this \nCongress. We are at eight for this session of Congress. The low \nwatermark was 15. We are not anywhere near close to getting that. It is \na requirement of this body for us to be able to clear\n\n[[Page S5149]]\n\njudges through who get nominated by the President, and then let's vote \nup or down one way or the other. Let's consider them and let's get a \nminimum number. We had an agreement for three by the Memorial Day \nbreak. One was approved. There are several highly qualified judges in \nthe system. For us to be able to get our business done, if we are going \nto get it done, we have to get some of these circuit court judges \napproved. If we don't, it is going to stall the body and we are going \nto stall it a lot, until we can get circuit court judges approved in \nsome minimal number.\n  I know there is a lot of dispute about this. It is a need of this \nbody. We need to do this and if we don't do it, things are going to \nslow down a lot. They are going to get jammed up a lot and it is going \nto be early and it is going to be very difficult for us to accomplish \nany other of our business.\n  I urge the leadership to come together and let's say: Here is the \nnumber we can approve by this date, and let's get that done or there \nare going to be a lot of things that are going to stop happening in \nthis body until we can get those approved.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, it is my understanding that we are in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. And that we will go on the bill, I understand, around \nnoon?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.

Mr. President, over the years this Congress has spent \ncountless hours fighting for the best and the safest equipment possible \nfor our men and women in the military. Whether it was better weapons or \nenough body armor, armored humvees, we have all worked tirelessly to \nmake sure our troops around the world have what they need to do their \njobs and return home safely to their families.\n  I come to the floor today because the Pentagon is now on the verge of \npurchasing the next generation aerial refueling tankers. This is going \nto be a decision that will cost billions of dollars and affect our \nservice members for decades. But I have serious concerns about the \nadministration's decision to buy these planes from Airbus, a subsidized \ncompany that has never produced refueling tankers before. I believe we \nmust again fight to ensure that our troops and taxpayers get the right \nplane.\n  Now I am not the only one with these concerns. Because this contest \nwas flawed from the very beginning and the rules were changed \nthroughout, Boeing has filed its first ever protest of the bidding \nprocess with the Government Accountability Office. The GAO is now \nexpected to make a ruling in the next few weeks and we are all awaiting \ntheir decision. But the GAO investigation has a very narrow scope. The \nGAO is only allowed to determine whether the letter of the law was \nfollowed in the selection process. It cannot look at anything beyond \nthat. So even if it is obvious that the Airbus plane costs more or it \nhas unproven technology, or it doesn't meet the intended mission, the \nGAO cannot take any action to ensure that the contract is justified or \nin the best interests of our military, or, in fact, our national \nsecurity. So I have come to the floor today because I believe that \nbecause of the GAO's limited role, Congress must look carefully at \nwhether major Defense acquisitions are in line with the concerns of the \nAmerican people. We need real answers before we move forward on this \ncontract, and we have to demand that the administration make the case \nfor why we should buy--American taxpayers should buy--an unproven and \nvery costly Airbus tanker.\n\n  Let me begin by outlining why I am so concerned. When you examine \nboth of these planes carefully as I have done, it is clear that \nBoeing's tanker is superior. Yet even though I have asked numerous \nquestions in committee hearings, in letters, in face-to-face meetings \nin my office, no one--no one--has been able to make the case for why we \nshould buy the Airbus tanker; not the Air Force, not the Pentagon, and \nnot even the Commander in Chief.\n  Compared to Boeing's tanker, Airbus's A-330 is, we all know, much \nlarger, less efficient, and, in fact, more expensive. It is so big that \nthat plane cannot use hundreds of our current hangars, our ramps, or \nour runways around the globe. It burns more fuel, and it is going to \ncost billions of dollars more to maintain over the lifetime of the \nfleet, yet the Pentagon has not explained why Airbus's plane is the \nbetter buy.\n  The Air Force competition found that the Boeing 767 is more \nsurvivable than the A-330. That means it is better equipped to protect \nour warfighters when they are in harm's way. Yet the Pentagon has not \nexplained why in the world it wants to give the Air Force a plane that \ndoesn't match up. Airbus has never built a refueling tanker. Its \ntechnology is unproven, and it is proposing to do some assembly at \nplants in Alabama that haven't even been built. They don't exist. Yet \nthe Pentagon has not explained why this is a better investment than the \nplane built by Boeing--the same company, by the way, that has been \nsupplying our tankers for nearly 70 years.\n  I also have very serious questions about whether we should give a \nforeign company a multibillion-dollar contract to build a major piece \nof our military defense. If this contract goes forward, we would be \nhanding billions of dollars in critical research and development \nfunding to a foreign company, owned by foreign governments, to learn \nhow to build a military plane that is flown by American air crews. Let \nme say that again. If this contract goes forward, we will be handing \nbillions of dollars in critical research in funding to a foreign \ncompany, owned by foreign governments, to learn how to build a military \nplane that is flown by our American air crews. I am talking about \nairplanes that are the backbone of our entire military strength.\n  These tankers we are talking about refuel planes and aircraft from \nevery single branch of our military. As long as we control the \ntechnology to build these tankers, we control our skies and we control \nour own security. Yet the Pentagon has not explained why it would let \nall of this slip away.\n  Finally, Airbus has always had a leg up on the American aerospace \nindustry because the European Union floods it with subsidies. In fact, \nour Government has a case pending currently before the WTO accusing \nAirbus of illegal--illegal--business practices. So I am astounded that \nour Defense Department has not been able to answer why in the world, \nwhen we have a case pending before the WTO accusing Airbus of illegal--\nillegal business practices, that we would turn around and give them a \nmajor Defense contract. It does not make sense.\n  I am not the only one asking questions. Increasingly, even experts in \nmilitary contracting are demanding answers too. One of those experts is \nDr. Loren Thompson who, according to even the Secretary of our Air \nForce, was given access to inside information on the decisionmaking \nprocess. Dr. Thompson now believes that the contract process had been \nless than transparent and he recently wrote an article saying that he \nbelieves the military has failed to make its case about why it chose \nthe Airbus plane. He wrote that he too wants an explanation for why the \nmilitary believes the A-330 is superior to the 767, when Airbus's \nmilitary air tanker is bigger--much bigger--much heavier, untested, and \nunproven. As he put it last week:\n\n       The service has failed to answer even the most basic \n     questions about how the decision was made to deny the \n     contract to Boeing. . . . The Air Force has some explaining \n     to do.\n\n  As I said earlier, despite all of these questions, the GAO is not \nallowed to dig for these answers. In fact, its role\n\n[[Page S5150]]\n\nin analyzing this decision is very limited. The GAO can only look at \nwhether the Pentagon followed the letter of the law and regulations \nthat govern the Federal procurement process. It cannot consider the \nreal-world concerns of Congress and the American people. That is our \njob. The GAO cannot address whether the military made the right \ndecision for our servicemembers. That is our job. That is why Congress \nhas to get involved. It is our job to demand that we get answers to \nthose questions before we go any further with this contract. Congress--\nus--we, the people--have to ask whether this contract will leave our \nservicemembers unprotected when they fly a plane. Congress has to ask \nwhether Airbus's plane will cost too much to all of us: to our \ntaxpayers, in military construction, in fuel, in maintenance--serious \nquestions that are our responsibility. Congress has to ask whether our \nworkers and our national economy will suffer if we outsource this major \naerospace contract. Finally, Congress--us--all of us--need to decide \nwhether this contract will put our national security at risk. The GAO \ncan't do that. That is our job.\n  This is a major decision. We are talking about a contract that will \ncost at least $35 billion and could cost the taxpayers more than $100 \nbillion over the life of these planes in purchasing costs alone. Yet \nthe Pentagon hasn't made a case for why they would choose to buy the \nAirbus plane. ``I don't know'' is not an acceptable response when you \nare talking about billions of taxpayer dollars and the safety of our \nservicemembers who fly these planes.\n  We deserve answers. Our taxpayers deserve answers. Our servicemembers \ndeserve answers. I hope our colleagues will stand with me and others \nand demand that the Defense Department justify this decision.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, as the American public observes and listens \nto the debate on climate change and global warming, I think there are \nprobably three fundamental questions everybody wants answered. The \nfirst question is an obvious one, and that is: Is climate change \noccurring? Is global warming a fact and a reality that we need to deal \nwith? I think you have to assume the answer to that question is yes. \nThere are changes going on in our climate, on our planet, some of which \nwe can explain and some of which we cannot explain.\n  Honestly, I will use South Dakota as a case in point. We have \nexperienced--probably for the last decade--successive and continuous \nyears of drought. Yet, this year, in May, we had the wettest year in \nwestern South Dakota--in Rapid City--ever since they started keeping \nhistorical records. So there are changes that occur that have to be \nviewed in the context of time--not just a decade period but a hundred- \nor thousand-year period--to determine what are the causes of the \nchanges we are seeing in the climate. We had, in South Dakota, the \ncoldest April this year we have had historically, going back 50 to 100 \nyears, and blizzards into the month of May. So there are a lot of \nchanges that are going on, some of which I think can be explained and \nsome of which cannot be explained. We need to look at them in the \nbroader context of what has happened over a long period of time with \nrespect to our climate.\n  The second question the American people would ask is this: If, in \nfact, climate change is occurring--and we assume the answer to that is \nyes--is human activity contributing to that? If we, again, assume the \nanswer to this question is yes, then we have to get to the next \nquestion. I think, frankly, I would answer, if we look at the question \nof whether human activity is contributing to that, we cannot put our \nheads in the sand. Obviously, changes are occurring. We assume that the \npresence of humanity on this planet and some of the things we are \nemitting into the atmosphere are creating changes. I think we need to \nacknowledge that.\n  That leads to the next question that I think has become the focus of \nthe debate in the Senate, and that is this question: If the answer to \nquestion No. 1 is yes, it is occurring, and 2, it is occurring at least \non some level--and we don't know how to quantify that because of human \nactivity--what are we going to do about it and at what cost? That is \nreally the focal point of the debate in the Senate today.\n  In my view, there are many problems associated with the bill \ncurrently under consideration on the floor of the Senate. First off, it \nprovides a minimal environmental benefit since it is a unilateral \nsolution. China has exceeded us in terms of CO2 emissions. \nIt will not get them to stop their CO2 emissions because the \nUnited States chooses to implement a cap-and-trade program. So you \ndon't gain environmental benefit. In fact, it could likely have some \nprofound and devastating impacts on our economy.\n  With regard to the first point about the other polluting countries \naround the world, this was said recently by President Clinton with \nregard to the Kyoto protocol. He said that 170 countries signed the \ntreaty, and only 6 out of 170 reduced their greenhouse gases to the \n1990 level, and only 6 will do so by 2012 at the deadline.\n  These countries signed a binding agreement, and yet they are doing \nreally nothing to get back to the goal or targets called for in that \nprotocol.\n  The Wall Street Journal recently reported that the European Union, \nwhich began to operate its cap-and-trade system in 2005, has actually \nseen carbon dioxide emissions rise by 1 percent per year since that \ntime. Interestingly enough, in the United States, since that same time \nwhen Europe implemented their cap-and-trade system, carbon dioxide \nemissions have actually declined by about 1 percent.\n  I guess the bigger question here to this last question is, if this is \noccurring, what do we do about it and at what cost? We have to think \nlong and hard about that in light of some of the things that are \noccurring in the country. We have $3.99 gasoline and $4.67 diesel. We \nhave had devastating impacts on the economy in the United States as a \nresult of our dependence upon foreign sources of energy. We need to \nlessen that dependence and look for technologies that will clean up our \nenvironment. Imposing an onerous, burdensome system from the top in \nwhich we impose a big tax burden on literally every American, because \nwith $3.99 gasoline and all the studies done by the Energy Information \nAgency--11 studies have been done, all of which have concluded that \nthey will increase gas prices substantially and electricity prices \nsubstantially. We have to take a hard look at what the impact will be \non our economy.\n  I understand the time for morning business is going to expire. I \nwould like to address some of those impacts as this debate on the \nclimate change legislation gets underway. If I could wrap up morning \nbusiness, I would like to continue with the debate on the climate \nchange legislation, if that would be in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota may continue.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I want to start with, regarding these \neconomic impacts, looking generally at the economy.\n  In the fourth quarter of last year, the economy grew at six-tenths of \n1 percent, and in the first quarter of this year it grew at nine-tenths \nof 1 percent. Some analysts and elected officials are looking at the \nrecord-high energy prices, the crisis in the financial services and \nhousing markets, and the recent job losses as signs that we are already \nin a recession. In the last few weeks, we have seen oil traded at $130 \na barrel, which has caused the price of virtually all consumer goods in \nthis country to increase. However, after months of debating high energy \nprices and a sluggish economy, we are now debating a bill that would \nactually raise energy prices and slow economic growth. I don't blame my \nconstituents when they wonder how Washington works and complain that \nCongress seems to be out of touch with their everyday reality.\n  Over the Memorial Day weekend, millions of families were faced with \nrecord-high gas prices. As they planned their vacations to travel to \nsee loved ones, they were met with average gasoline prices that hovered \naround $4 per gallon.\n  I point out that as the economy has slowed down, high energy prices \nhave gone up, and the impact it has had on\n\n[[Page S5151]]\n\nevery American family--again, the EIA analyzed this bill on the floor \ntoday, and it would project gasoline prices to increase at 21 percent, \nor higher, in 2020 and 41 percent in the year 2030 under this proposal \nbefore us today. The Environmental Protection Agency also looked at the \nbill and concluded that gas prices would increase over 20 percent by \n2030.\n  As we have debated this bill this week, there has been one particular \nimpact that I think may have been overlooked in the legislation that \nhas been drafted, and that is the impact on our Nation's domestic \naviation sector.\n  Many of my colleagues and consumers in the country have witnessed \nfirsthand in the first few months of this year that the domestic \nairlines are being crippled by the record price of aviation fuel, which \nwill continue to rise in price under the cap-and-trade structure of \nthis legislation. I will point out headlines of a few articles from \nyesterday and today: ``Continental Airlines to cut 3,000 jobs and \ncapacity''; ``Summer airfares double, triple, quadruple''; ``United to \ncut back service, eliminate jobs.''\n  The U.S. airline industry recently sent a letter to all Senators in \nanticipation of the debate on this climate change legislation we have \nin front of us today. Here is what it says:\n\n       The proposed bill adds a significant additional increment \n     to the cost of transportation fuel. Assuming that emissions \n     allowances are modestly priced at $25 per metric ton of \n     carbon dioxide equivalents in 2012, when the bill would go \n     into effect, this legislation would add another $5 billion to \n     U.S. airline fuel costs, escalating each year thereafter. \n     Assuming a lower-end estimate in the prices in 2020, a $40 \n     per metric ton CO2 price, the bill would impose a \n     $10 billion additional fuel tax on the U.S. airlines, \n     again escalating annually thereafter. Such costs will \n     result in further job losses, losses in air services to \n     small communities, and negative economic effects.\n\n  I certainly agree we should all be doing more to promote cleaner \nforms of energy. But the legislation, as drafted, that we have before \nus today has significant ramifications that I think many individuals \nhaven't fully considered.\n  I have been a strong supporter of renewable fuels that can be \nproduced in the United States and used in automobiles to reduce our \ndangerous dependence upon foreign oil. These alternative fuels are not \napplicable to our Nation's aviation sector. Now, it would be one thing \nto require sectors of the economy to transition to cleaner forms of \nenergy, but this legislation, as drafted, would have a significant cost \non our domestic airlines, which are already being significantly \nimpacted by the record cost of oil, by adding additional costs that \nwill be passed on to the consumer, which, in my opinion, could result \nin not only fewer people traveling but could bankrupt U.S. air \ncarriers, while at the same time not requiring foreign air carriers to \nbe subject to the same taxes that will be passed along under the cap-\nand-trade system that is envisioned in this legislation.\n  So one impact that I don't think has been entered in this debate as \nheavily as it should have been is the aviation sector of our economy, \nwhich is going through tumult and is experiencing economic hardship \nbecause of high fuel prices. This would complicate that further, and \nbecause they don't have access to using some of the cleaner fuels we \nare able to run through automobiles, it only worsens the situation they \nface. That is on top of what we are talking about today in terms of our \nheadlines on job losses, capacity losses, airfares doubling, tripling, \nquadrupling, and cutbacks in service.\n  What do we do, then, in response to the question, If this is \noccurring--climate change--and if human activity is contributing to it, \nwhat do we do about it and at what cost? I think there are a lot of \nthings we could and should be doing.\n  Honestly, irrespective of the answers to the first two questions, we \nshould be making every effort we can to get emissions such as \nCO2 out of our atmosphere. We ought to work as hard as we \ncan to do that. Rather than creating a cumbersome new bureaucracy that \nwould increase the price of gasoline, Congress ought to look to \nlowering gas prices through increased domestic production and refining \ncapacity and investment in alternatives, such as biofuels.\n  With respect to electricity rates, again, according to the EIA, \nelectricity prices are projected to increase up to 27 percent in 2020 \nand a 64-percent increase in electricity prices by 2030. Under the bill \nbefore us, average annual household energy bills, excluding \ntransportation costs, would be $325 higher in 2020 and $123 higher in \nthe year 2030.\n  I think there are some really good things that can be done and should \nbe done. We need to start by investing in clean energy. I agree that we \nneed to research and develop a new, reliable low-carbon energy source.\n  In South Dakota, we have examples of how that works. We are going to \nbe producing a billion gallons of ethanol by the end of this year. New \ncorn-based ethanol plants are producing ethanol with a 20-percent \nreduction in life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions relative to regular \ngasoline. In the coming years, we will be producing cellulosic ethanol \nthat will reduce life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80 \npercent. South Dakota also has an abundant source of wind, which is a \nzero-carbon-emitting source of energy.\n  A recent DOE study noted that the United States has the ability to \nmeet 20 percent of its generation needs with wind by 2030. We can \npromote low-carbon energy without destroying jobs. We can do this \nwithout raising taxes, and we can do this without raising gasoline \nprices.\n  The climate change bill before the Senate puts the cart before the \nhorse. The bill enacts mandates on at least 2,000 entities, and then \nthe Federal Government collects the revenue through annual allowance \nauctions, and then the Government invests in new technologies. \nMeanwhile, jobs are lost, our economic growth slows, and family budgets \nget squeezed. If we are willing to make a bipartisan commitment to \nresearch and development of new technologies today, carbon reductions, \nin the very near future, will be considerably less expensive.\n  In November of 2007, the Senate Commerce Committee held one of many \nhearings on clean coal technology, which will play a major role in the \nfuture of our Nation's energy portfolio. The nonprofit Electric Power \nResearch Institute, which was represented at that hearing, identified \nthe research and development pathways to demonstrate, by 2025, a full \nportfolio of economically attractive, commercial-scale, advanced coal \npower and integrated CCS technologies suitable for use with the broad \nrange of coal types. If we make the commitment today to fund the \nresearch, finance the demonstration projects, and fund the loan \nguarantees first--if we do all those things first--reducing carbon \nemissions in the future will be far less costly to our economy.\n  Mr. President, my message to my colleagues is very simply that we \nneed to develop the technology before enacting onerous Government \nmandates on virtually every single part of our economy. Higher gas \nprices, higher electricity rates, a shrinking GDP, job losses, and \nminimal environmental benefit is what will come about as a result of \nthis legislation if enacted.\n  There is a better way. We ought to be doing everything we possibly \ncan to get CO2 emissions and other pollutants out of our \natmosphere to address the concerns we have about our environment, to be \ngood stewards, to pass on a better world to the next generation, but \nthere is a way we can go about this that is incentive based, that gets \naway from the heavy-handed, onerous regulations imposed by this bill \nand the enormous cost that will be imposed on literally every sector of \nour economy and, most importantly, on the hard-working American \nfamilies who will be faced with higher prices for gasoline, higher \nprices for electricity at a time when we should be desperately looking \nfor ways to reduce those prices and to lessen the economic hardship \nthat every family in this country is experiencing.\n  I hope my colleagues will vote no. I, too, have some amendments to \noffer to the bill if we get the opportunity to offer the amendments. My \nunderstanding is the amendment tree has been filled. That is \nunfortunate. This is a bill of enormous consequence to this country. \nSome have described it as the biggest reorganization of the Government \nsince the 1930s. Given the complexities and the enormous impact this \nwould have on Americans' everyday lives, we need to go about this in a \nway\n\n[[Page S5152]]\n\nthat allows us to have open debate, offer amendments, and improve this \nbill.\n  I regret the fact that the Democratic leadership has decided to \nabandon that open process in exchange for filling the amendment tree \nand preventing us from having an open debate and considering amendments \nthat actually would protect consumers from higher gas and energy prices \nthat would be the result of this legislation.\n  If we get to an open process, I hope to have further debate and \namendments we can consider.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The \nSenator from Minnesota is recognized for 15 minutes.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, the issue we are addressing this \nweek, global climate change, is a challenge with so many dimensions. \nSome are moral, some are economic, and some are scientific. I want to \nspend my first few minutes today talking about the science because we \ncannot get the policy right unless we get the science right.\n  I come from a State that believes in science. Minnesota is home to \nthe Mayo Clinic and other great medical institutions. It helped launch \nthe green revolution in agriculture half a century ago. Today it is \nhome to a great research university in the University of Minnesota and \nhigh-tech companies such as 3M and Medtronic.\n  We have brought the world everything from the pacemaker to the Post-\nit notes. My State believes in science. Over the last few days, we have \nheard a great deal of debate about the science of climate change. I \nbelieve the debate should be over. The facts are in and the science is \nclear.\n  The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has concluded that the \nevidence of global warming is now unequivocal and apparent on every \ncontinent of our planet. It is plain in erratic weather patterns, in \nshrinking wildlife habitat, and the melting of the permafrost.\n  Just last week, a new report commissioned by the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture and written by some of our top environmental researchers \nreached the same conclusion. They wrote:\n\n       There is robust scientific consensus that human-induced \n     climate change is occurring. Observations show that climate \n     change is impacting the nation's ecosystems in significant \n     ways, and those alterations are very likely to accelerate in \n     the future.\n\n  The result? Ocean levels are rising, glaciers are melting, and \nviolent weather events are increasing--we have seen some recent ones in \nmy State--and soon entire species will be threatened.\n  This is not just an environmental danger, it is also an economic \ndanger.\n  First, we can see what we would predict as we see increases in \ntemperatures in this world. The estimates are that temperatures will go \nup somewhere from 3 to 8 degrees in the next 100 years. To put it in \nperspective, it went up 1 degree in the last 100 years. We have already \nstarted seeing changes. That doesn't sound like a lot. It has only gone \nup 5 degrees since the height of the ice age. And the prediction from \nour EPA is 3 to 8 degrees.\n  Here we go when we look at the increasing of temperature: A 1-degree \nincrease means increasing mortality from heat waves, floods, and \ndroughts. This is predicted by 2020; a 2-degree increase, millions of \npeople face flooding risk every year; a 3-degree increase, global food \nproduction decreases, and so on.\n\n  I can tell you in my State people are already seeing these changes. \nThey have seen the economic impacts of these changes. Lake Superior is \nnear its lowest level in the last 80 years, and that is an average. It \ngoes up and down a little. It went up a little, fortunately, this year. \nBut overall, we have seen decreasing levels so that overall it is at \nits lowest level in 80 years. That has impacted our barges, it has \nimpacted the economy because we need more barges because they are \nsinking lower.\n  Why is that happening? The ice is melting quicker and so the water \nevaporates and we see lower levels in places such as Lake Superior.\n  We also have seen changes for our ski resorts. Overall, when we look \nat the trends, we have seen decreasing snow which means less money for \nthem. Those are just some small examples of the economic costs of \nclimate change.\n  We can see that the insured and uninsured costs of weather-related \nclimate change events are going up and up, and we are all paying the \nprice. A problem so serious demands a serious response.\n  This is a chart showing the weather-related economic losses and how \nthey have increased. Look at the decades from 1960 to 1969, 1970 to \n1979, 1980 to 1989, and then look at the last 10 years. These are \neconomic losses. These are the amounts that are insured, and then this \nis the total of economic losses due to weather-related issues.\n  A problem so serious as this demands a serious response. I believe \nthat as a Nation, we are up to it. Look at a little history. In the \n1970s, after the first OPEC oil embargo caused world oil prices to \nquadruple, Congress passed the first CAFE standards, fuel economy \nstandards for the Nation's cars and trucks. At first, the skeptics said \nCongress had overreached and the CAFE standards were unrealistic. Then \nbusiness put its mind to the challenge. Auto companies developed more \nefficient engines and lighter automotive components, and they competed \nto meet customer demand for fuel-efficient cars.\n  Recently, the National Academy of Sciences estimated that those CAFE \nstandards have now saved our country\n\n[[Page S5153]]\n\n2.8 million barrels of oil a day and cut oil consumption by 14 percent \nannually. With the higher fuel economy standards we adopted last year \nafter many years of inaction to build on that initial CAFE standard, \nestimates are for an average family, depending on the price of gas, \nthey could save $1,000 a year. We will continue to save, but we must \nset those standards so we have an example where when those standards \nwere set, business went to the challenge, and we actually saved money.\n  That is not the only example. In 1987 and 1992, the Government \nadopted new energy-efficient standards for household appliances. Again, \nthe American business community responded, competing to develop new \ntechnologies and energy-efficient products. I call it building a fridge \nto the next century. Soon you could walk into any appliance store and \nfind efficient ENERGY STAR air-conditioners that give consumers even \nhigher quality but at much lower energy consumption.\n  Look at this chart on light bulbs. We can see, if every American home \nreplaced just one light bulb with an ENERGY STAR qualified bulb, we \ncould save more than $600 million in annual energy costs and prevent \ngreenhouse gases equivalent to the emissions of more than 800,000 cars.\n  Now we are starting to develop all kinds of technologies to save \nmoney for consumers and make big reductions in carbon emissions. The \nAmerican Council for Energy Efficient Economy estimates these higher \nenergy-efficient standards saved consumers $50 billion from 1990 to \n2000 and will cut U.S. electricity consumption by 6.5 percent within \nthis decade.\n  What did all of these examples have in common? The public sector and \nthe private sector worked together in a partnership in which each \nperformed at its best. The Government took leadership, set high \nstandards, and provided a nationwide mandatory framework so everyone \nplayed by the same rules. Then the private sector responded to that \nsignal using a classic American combination of technological innovation \nand market competition.\n  The challenge of climate change presents us with the same \nopportunity--an opportunity for technology with wind, with solar, with \nenergy efficiency, with the potential of nuclear, and with the \npotential of clean coal technology. It is a long list with great \npotential. We must meet this challenge, and we can. If we set standards \nfor the country, the investment, technology, and innovation will \nfollow.\n  On the Environment and Public Works Committee, my colleagues, Senator \nBoxer, Senator Warner, and Senator Lieberman have written landmark \nlegislation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and I am proud to be a \ncosponsor. This measure establishes mandatory economy-wide, science-\nbased limits on carbon dioxide and other global warming gases so we can \ncut emissions 20 percent by the year 2020 and nearly 70 percent by the \nyear 2050.\n  To achieve those goals without disrupting our economy, it would \nestablish a market-driven cap-and-trade system that provides economic \nincentives for reducing emissions. Now, we did the same thing with acid \nrain years ago and it worked well.\n\n  To make this system work, however, we need to have full and accurate \ninformation about the sources and amounts of greenhouse gas pollution. \nThat is what I want to take a few minutes to talk about today, because \nof the fact that this was in the first title of the bill, and one that \nI authored, along with Senator Olympia Snowe of Maine.\n  The famous British scientist, Lord Kelvin, felt the same way about \nhaving to measure things before you do anything. He once observed:\n\n       When you can measure what you are speaking about, and \n     express it in numbers, you know something about it; but when \n     you cannot measure it, when you cannot express it in numbers, \n     your knowledge is of a meager and unsatisfactory kind.\n\n  Believe it or not, we don't have full, accurate information on \ngreenhouse gas emissions right now. In fact, I was contacted a few \nmonths ago by a National Public Radio reporter who was trying to figure \nout who was the biggest greenhouse gas emitter in the United States. \nYou would think that would be something that would be easy to find out, \nbut in fact it is not because we don't have the kind of accurate \ninformation we need.\n  The EPA collects a lot of data on energy production and consumption, \nbut the quantity and quality of those data varies greatly across \ndifferent fuels and different sectors. For example, data on crude oil \nand petroleum product stocks is collected weekly for selected oil \ncompanies, while data on energy use in the industrial sector are \ncollected only once every 3 years through surveys. In some cases, the \nEPA itself collects the data, while in other cases the data are \ncollected through State and other Federal agencies. Some industries \nreport to the EPA and others report to the Energy Department. Some are \nreporting every year and some are reporting every 3 years. In short, it \nis a mishmash.\n  Last week, the Brookings Institution here in Washington issued its \nown report on carbon emissions in different cities around the country. \nThey too tried to make a comprehensive study, but they admitted they \ncould only estimate emissions from homes to vehicles, not factories or \nplanes or railroads or government buildings.\n  Then there are State efforts. Thirty-one States, representing 70 \npercent of the country's population, have formed a carbon registration \nsystem of their own. It is a bipartisan project with support from \nGovernors such as Janet Napolitano of Arizona and Governor \nSchwarzenegger of California. Together, they recently issued a \nstatement saying,\n\n       The State climate registries are another example of how \n     States are taking the lead in the absence of Federal action \n     to address greenhouse gas emissions in this country.\n\n  While these State projects are very well intentioned, they are a poor \nreplacement for a national standard. Remember years ago how Justice \nBrandeis, in that famous decision, talked about how the States could be \n``laboratories of democracy''? He talked about how one State could have \nthe courage to move ahead, but I don't think, when he said that, he \never meant inaction by the Federal Government. But that is what we have \nhad in the area of climate change, and that is certainly what we have \nhad in the area of trying to measure what is going on here.\n  We are never going to make progress against global climate change \nunless we can answer the question of how much people are emitting with \ngreenhouse gases, where they are emitting them, and until we can give \nan answer with accurate, complete information.\n  This problem plagued the European Union 2 or 3 years ago. They \nactually beat us in establishing a comprehensive cap-and-trade system \nto cut greenhouse gas pollution. But because they didn't start with a \ngood comprehensive registry of the sources and quantities of greenhouse \ngas emissions, they miscalculated their initial caps and permits and \nwound up wasting a lot of money and time before they got their cap-and-\ntrade system right.\n  That is why Senator Snowe and I worked together last year to write \nthis legislation, which is the first title of the bill, establishing a \ngreenhouse gas registry. You can see what this means. It is accurate, \ncomprehensive data on carbon emissions. It requires reporting of \ngreenhouse gas emissions to the EPA, it requires third-party \nverification, it does have exemptions for small businesses--because we \ndon't want to do anything that is too burdensome--and it also makes the \ndata publicly available on the Internet. I think we know how much \npeople are interested in this issue, and they have a right to know \nabout it.\n  In addition to setting the stage for cap-and-trade solutions to \nglobal climate change, one comprehensive national registry, instead of \nall the States doing their own, would help the States by streamlining \nadministration costs. It would also help business. Before long, they \nare going to have to start cutting their own greenhouse gas emissions, \nand they can't make the right investments or adopt the right \ntechnologies without having good data on their own carbon emissions. In \nfact, some of the Nation's leading corporations have endorsed the \nnational carbon registry. They include: Alcoa, Boston Scientific \nCorporation, General Electric, NRG Energy, Caterpillar, Johnson & \nJohnson, Pacific Gas and Electric, and many more. These executives have \nnow teamed up with some of the country's leading environmental groups, \nincluding the Nature Conservancy, the National Wildlife Federation, and \nthe National Defense Council,\n\n[[Page S5154]]\n\nto form the U.S. Climate Action Partnership. They recently issued a \nstatement calling on the Federal Government to quickly enact strong \nnational legislation to require significant reductions of greenhouse \ngas emissions. They took this historic step because they understood the \nthreat of climate change and they recognized the need for Federal \naction. These leaders are right. The time has come for us to act.\n  As I close, I think about the complexities of this historic \nchallenge, and I like to recall a prayer from the Ojibway people of \nMinnesota. Their philosophy told them that the decisions of great \nleaders are not made for today, not made for this generation, but for \nthose who are seven generations from now.\n  That is part of our burden and part of our challenge as we approach \nthis climate change issue. That is why today I urge my colleagues to \nsupport cloture on this bill, to not only start measuring what the \nproblem is, but to actually give this country and this world a \nsolution.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REED addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Would the Senator yield for a moment?\n  Mr. REED. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that after the \nSenator from Rhode Island concludes his remarks I be recognized next.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, reclaiming my time, I am informed that we \nare attempting to alternate between the Republican and Democratic side, \nand so I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from New Jersey be the \nnext Democrat to speak, because we are informed somebody is coming from \nthe Republican side.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I didn't know we were alternating.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to Senator Menendez \nfollowing Senator Reed?\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, let me do this. I will accede my position \nto Senator Menendez to speak, and I ask unanimous consent that I follow \nthe next Republican speaker.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I thank my distinguished colleague \nfrom Rhode Island. I have a time pressure, and so I appreciate his \ncourtesy.\n  I thought this debate would be a watershed moment, a moment when we \nwould finally move beyond Republican attempts to deny that global \nwarming exists. But as this debate has evolved, we see we have not \ngotten very far. Instead of deny, deny, deny, the Republican playbook \nhas shifted to delay, delay, and delay.\n  The time to act is actually now. We are not going to be able to \ntransition from a fossil fuel-based economy to a green, renewable \nenergy-based economy overnight, and therefore it is critical that we \nact as soon as possible to begin this transition.\n  I thank my colleagues who have worked so hard to get this legislation \nat least to the floor. The mere fact that we are having this debate \ngets us closer to actually enacting a policy to cap greenhouse gas \nemissions.\n  I do hope that in time we can support much stronger legislation. I \nhave concerns about whether this bill speeds our transition to a \ncarbon-free economy quickly enough because of the cost containment \nmeasures and the large numbers of offsets in the bill. I am worried \nsome companies might be able to delay cutting back their emissions for \nover a decade. I also believe we can go even farther in supporting \nrenewable sources and energy efficiency.\n  I was hoping I would have the opportunity to offer a few amendments \nto improve upon this legislation. I certainly want to offer them--we \nhave offered them--and I know we will probably not get to them under \nthe procedures we are in the midst of pursuing, but I think they are \nmarkers for the future.\n  The first amendment I had hoped to offer, along with Senators \nLautenberg and Sanders, would have shifted transition assistance \nfunding from big oil to renewable energy generators. At a time of \nrecord oil company profits, I do not think we need to allow oil \ncompanies to pollute for free, especially when that money could be used \nto help jump-start the development of clean, renewable, affordable \nAmerican energy.\n  The second amendment I offered, along with Senator Snowe, would have \nboosted funding to help developing nations to adapt to changes in the \nclimate they had little to no part in creating in the first place. \nMaking investments to help vulnerable nations isn't just a necessary \nstep to secure an effective international climate treaty, or a way to \nadvance U.S. national security interests, it is a moral imperative.\n  The third amendment I filed with Senator Kerry would help nations \nwith tropical forests lower their rates of deforestation, a cost-\neffective way of keeping CO2 out of the atmosphere. \nApproximately 20 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions come from \ndeforestation, and if we hope to secure an effective climate treaty, we \nmust be willing to help forested nations create the tools they need to \neffectively address the problems.\n  Finally, the fourth amendment I offered, also with Senator Kerry, \nwould require the Government to calculate the cost of inaction on \nglobal warming, from the cost of drought to flooding to storm damage. \nMany of my friends on the other side of the aisle have spent a lot of \ntime this week bemoaning the alleged cost of solving global warming, \nbut they have completely ignored the horrendous cost of ignoring global \nwarming. We need this study so we are not always looking at half the \nbalance sheet on this issue.\n  Many of my colleagues on the Republican side of the aisle are \nrejecting out of hand any efforts we might propose. They argue that \nalmost anything will cost too much. They suggest any effort to go green \non the scale necessary would be too expensive. Saying we can't invest \nin renewable energy because there is a dollar figure attached sounds \nlike telling someone with a fatal disease that the cure is too costly, \nor saying to a crime victim that we can't afford to put police on the \nstreets because it has a cost.\n  There were some who argued it would be too expensive to reinforce the \nlevees in New Orleans, and when Hurricane Katrina hit, we found out \nwhat the true cost of that decision was. We can't fail again to be \nmindful of the words of John F. Kennedy, when he warned us that ``the \ntime to repair the roof is when the sun is shining.''\n  The question isn't whether an investment needs to be made. The \nquestion is whether we want to make that investment now, while we can \ndo it safely, gradually, and inexpensively; or later, when we have to \nmake wholesale changes to our economy in a matter of years rather than \ndecades.\n  In other words, what we are deciding is not whether to put a cap on \ncarbon emissions. The question is whether we do it now or whether we \nwait. Do we do it now, when it is cheaper to do it and we can set \nourselves up to compete with Europe and Japan in creating new \ntechnologies, when we can create jobs in the midst of an economic \nturndown; or do we do it when our hand is forced, when Americans have \nalready felt the catastrophic effects of climate change, when our \ncoasts are flooded, when storm surges damage our houses and droughts \nthreaten our harvests, when the costs become enormous because we have \nto change so quickly?\n  It is going to be far harder and far more expensive to have to stop \ncarbon emissions overnight than to do it now. If we want to slash our \ncarbon emissions 80 percent by 2050, we simply cannot wait until 2030 \nto get started, unless we want to risk the economic and environmental \nfuture of this country.\n  Today, with the rising price of gas we have to pay at the pump, we \nsee the result of waiting to act until disaster strikes. In the 1970s, \nbecause of the Arab oil embargo, we drastically improved the fuel \nefficiency of our passenger vehicles. In 1976, our cars and trucks got \n13 miles per gallon. By 1981 our fleet had improved to 21 miles per \ngallon. From 1981 to 2006, the average fuel economy of our passenger \nvehicle fleet actually declined to 20 miles per gallon.\n\n  If we had been gradually improving efficiency standards instead of \nwaiting for high gas prices to force our hands, we would all be better \noff today. If we had increased fuel economy a modest 2 percent per \nyear, our new fleet of vehicles would now average 34 miles per gallon.\n\n[[Page S5155]]\n\n  Astonishingly, if we had followed this course, our current demand for \noil would be over one-third less than it is today, down over 2 billion \nbarrels of oil per year. Cumulatively, we would have saved over 30 \nbillion barrels of oil, and 30 billion barrels of oil is more oil than \nthe entire proven oil reserves remaining in the United States. With \nsuch a reduced demand for oil, imagine how much less we would be paying \nfor gas today.\n  Some of my colleagues on the Republican side of the aisle have been \nsuggesting that taxing carbon emissions would cause energy and gas \nprices to go up. The reality is, anyone can tell you that prices have \nbeen going up and that they will continue to go up under the present \npolicy of this administration unless we end our dependence on oil. That \nmeans transitioning to free, renewable fuels, such as wind and solar. \nWe do not have to pay Saudi Arabia for the rights to use the Sun to \ngenerate power. We don't have to send money to Nigeria for the right to \nharness the power of wind. The more we improve the technology that can \nrun our renewable fuels, the cheaper every kind of fuel will be.\n  Solving global warming is not just about protecting us from \ncatastrophic weather and hostile foreign regimes, it is also about \njobs. Renewable energy industries are perhaps the single greatest \nopportunity to create new, good-paying jobs this country has seen in a \ngeneration.\n  If we want to put up millions of solar panels, it is going to take \nhundreds of thousands of workers to install them, and those jobs are \ncreated at home, unlike what happens when we continue to rely on oil, \nwhich is that we create jobs in the Middle East, in Nigeria, and \nVenezuela, to name a few.\n  I am proud in my home State of New Jersey we are No. 2 in the Nation \nin terms of solar capacity, behind only California. We have seen new \njobs created because of it.\n  Global warming is a challenge that faces us all. It is a challenge we \nmust face together. It is not enough to sit back and watch as tragic \nstories unfold, as heat waves and wildfires strike, as we see floods \nand droughts more severe, hurricanes, species disappearing, ice caps \nmelting, glaciers melting, sea levels rising. It is not enough to sit \nback and watch because we have a human moral imperative to take action. \nIt is not enough because someday the door on which tragedy knocks could \nbe our own.\n  Great change always has its opponents. Instead of arguing that we \nshould be innovative, they will argue that we should be afraid; we \nshould do all we can to hold on to the ways of the past instead of \nhaving the courage to prepare for the future.\n  The American people are tired of being told what they cannot achieve, \nand they are tired of being told they should be satisfied with the \nstatus quo. It is time to put aside our fears, unleash our powers of \ninnovation, and rise to meet one of the defining challenges of our \ntime. For this and future generations of Americans, what the Senate \ndecides ultimately is going to determine the course of our country in \nways that are so significant--from the course of the environment that \nwe collectively share both in America and across the globe, from the \nquestion of economic opportunity, from the question of national \nsecurity--not depending on the oil of countries that have totally \ndifferent views and values than we have. That is all wrapped up in the \ndebate and the votes we will be taking.\n  I hope we have the courage to move in a direction that ultimately \nmeets all of those challenges and that we act as good stewards for \nfuture generations of Americans so we can look at this moment and say \nhistory will judge us and ultimately will say we did what was our \nresponsibility to do.\n  I thank my colleague from Rhode Island for his courtesy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, first of all, I note this legislation has \nnothing to do with ending our dependance on foreign oil. It does have \nsomething to do with ending our dependence on oil. In fact, what this \nlegislation would do is make it much more difficult for Americans to \nenjoy the standard of living we do by making it much more costly to \nindulge in any consumption of energy in any form, including driving \nvehicles, including turning on the lights or the air-conditioning in a \nbuilding. All of these things are deliberately made much more expensive \nin this legislation--deliberately because the point of it is to make \nenergy consumption so expensive that we will not consume as much of it. \nThat way the Earth will somehow not be warmed as much because we will \nnot be consuming as much energy.\n  That is the whole point here. It is not about ending our dependence \non foreign oil. This legislation has nothing to do with that at all.\n  People might ask, What is cap and trade? Why are we talking about \ncap-and-trade legislation? The cap and trade contemplated in this bill \nhas the Federal Government creating something of value--carbon emission \nallowances--and they are equal to the cap on emissions set by the \nFederal Government each year. The Federal Government says: Americans, \nyou can only drive so much or you can only consume so much electricity \nand the people who produce that product are going to have to pay for \nthe right to produce the energy that you are consuming. Then, of \ncourse, they are going to pass that cost on to you.\n  Some of these allocations are to favored groups. Others are auctioned \noff. But the cost of the allowances is passed on to the consumers, as I \nsaid. And these outstanding allowances can be traded. That is why it is \ncalled cap and trade. So you have a group of speculators, then, who are \nable to buy some of the allowances and sell them at a profit, even \nthough they produce nothing of value in the meantime.\n\n  While it is referred to as cap and trade, we should appreciate the \nfact that in reality it is very clearly nothing more than another tax \non American consumers. A very good article in the Washington Post by \nRobert Samuelson points this out. He says:\n\n       The chief political virtue of cap-and-trade . . . is its \n     complexity. This allows its environmental supporters to shape \n     public perceptions in essentially deceptive ways. Cap-and-\n     trade would act as a tax, but it is not described as a tax. \n     It would regulate economic activity, but it is promoted as a \n     ``free market'' mechanism. Finally, it would trigger a tidal \n     wave of influence-peddling, as lobbyists scramble to exploit \n     the system for different industries and localities.\n\n  The Congressional Budget Office itself, the nonpartisan group \nrepresenting the Congress, acknowledges that businesses would pass on \nmost of the costs imposed by a cap-and-trade system to American \nconsumers. This would amount to a regressive stealth tax that would hit \nlow- and middle-income families the hardest.\n  What does the proposal cost? According to the Congressional Budget \nOffice, the Boxer substitute amendment before us would take out of the \nprivate sector $902 billion between 2009 and 2019. Of that amount, the \nBoxer substitute manages to spend all but $66 billion--$836 billion of \nallowances are distributed not only to favored technologies and \nutilities but also to buy off interests that would use funds in ways \nthat do not decrease carbon, such as for farming practices, endangered \nspecies, Indian tribes, State governments, and to other countries for \ntheir forests.\n  The Congressional Budget Office considers the distribution of these \nfree allowances the same as distributing cash, and indeed that is \nexactly what it is.\n  Over the longer term, the Environmental Protection Agency projects \nthe amendment would redistribute $6.2 trillion from the private sector \nto the Federal Government by the year 2050, through these allowance \nauctions that energy producers and manufacturers would be required to \npurchase in order to be able to continue their operations--meaning \ncontinue to provide energy for us. Another $3.2 trillion would be \nauctioned off by States and others.\n  According to the administration, the nearly $10 trillion cost would \nmake this bill the single most expensive regulation in the history of \nthe United States of America.\n  If a cap-and-trade system like the one in the Boxer substitute is \nimplemented, a number of economists believe it would add significant \ncosts to the production side of the economy and would likely have a \nsevere negative impact on long-term U.S. economic growth, despite \nhaving a very modest impact on worldwide carbon levels. The\n\n[[Page S5156]]\n\ncap-and-trade system is intended by design to raise the cost of gas and \nelectricity, as I said in the very beginning. Raising the cost of gas \nand electricity will change people's behavior. They will use less \nenergy and, as a result, theoretically emit less carbon. The cap-and-\ntrade program cannot achieve its goals unless it increases the cost of \nenergy, and the proponents do not deny this.\n  So when you are thinking about the high cost of gasoline today, think \nabout the additional cost that is going to be imposed by this \nlegislation. The proponents say it is going up anyway. You do not have \nto make it go up more than it would otherwise, and that is what this \nlegislation would do.\n  The American Council for Capital Formation projects that under this \ncap-and-trade system, gasoline prices would rise from about $4 a gallon \ntoday to $5.33 a gallon by 2014 and $9.01 by the year 2030.\n  As I noted, businesses would have to pass on most of the costs \nimposed by a cap-and-trade system to their consumers. One must \nrecognize that the demand for energy is relatively inelastic. In other \nwords, even as prices rise, individuals find it difficult to switch to \nalternatives. It is very hard to engage in any activity that does not \nuse energy. As a result, individuals would be forced to bear the cost \nincreases imposed by the system. They might use less energy, drive \nless, live in colder homes during the winter, or turn off air \nconditioners in the summer. Those are the choices.\n  When individuals use less energy, they buy less, travel less, and in \neffect curtail overall economic activity. The gross domestic product of \nthis country would be roughly 1 percent lower at the end of 2014 and \n2.6 percent lower by 2030 under this legislation. That is a huge \nreduction in the economy of the United States and therefore the well-\nbeing of the American people. As economic activity slows, employers are \nnot going to hire as many workers. In fact, employers would create \n850,000 fewer jobs by 2014, and 3 million fewer jobs by 2030. My home \nState of Arizona would lose 63,500 jobs by 2023, roughly speaking. \nIronically, this bill would become an economic stimulus for China and \nIndia, as they would meet the manufacturing demands that we could no \nlonger produce competitively. Perhaps more striking is the cost on \nAmerican household incomes.\n  Cap-and-trade legislation would, on average, reduce income adjusted \nfor inflation by $1,000 in 2014 and by $4,000 by 2030. My home State \nresidents in Arizona would see their income fall by $3,400 by 2030.\n  However, not everyone will bear the same burden. Cap and trade is \nincredibly regressive in its impact, since low-income households spend \na higher fraction of their income on energy. According to the \nCongressional Budget Office, just a 15-percent cut in carbon emissions \nwould cost low-income households almost twice as much as high-income \nhouseholds. Cap and trade reduces the after-tax income of those in the \nbottom fifth of the income distribution by 3.3 percent. The top 20 \npercent of the income distribution would see their disposable income \nfall by 1.7 percent.\n  It is important to note that the amendment of Senator Boxer claims \nthat it would reduce carbon emissions by 66 percent by 2050 or more \nthan four times the amount CBO estimated. Of course, we obviously \nbelieve that CBO is far more correct in its assessment. But assuming \nthe Senator were correct, then one might expect the amendment to reduce \nindividuals' incomes four times as much as CBO estimated as well.\n  Think about that--$12,000 to $15,000 reductions in income.\n  I mentioned before that this creates winners and losers. Part of this \nis based on the whims of Congress. We would have the authority to make \nthe distinctions that would enable some people to be better off than \nothers.\n  The amendment before us would redistribute $836 billion of allowances \nover the 2009-to-2018 period to various special interest groups. Just \nimagine that, Congress being in charge of redistributing $836 billion. \nAnd we are going to do that without any influence of special interests? \nI think not.\n  Robert Samuelson noted in the article I quoted from earlier:\n\n       Beneficiaries of the free allowances would include farmers, \n     Indian tribes, new technology companies, utilities and \n     States. Call this environmental pork, and that would be just \n     a start. The program's potential to confer subsidies and \n     preferential treatment would stimulate a lobbying frenzy. \n     Think of today's farm programs and multiple by ten.\n\n  The tax-and-spend system, in other words, would create arbitrary \nwinners and losers. Over the life of the bill, it would give away \nallowances valued at approximately $3.2 trillion for auction by States \nand other entities.\n  Let me conclude with this point. While having all of this dramatic \nnegative impact, the benefits are questionable at best. They do not \nmeet any rational cost-benefit analysis. A recent editorial in the Wall \nStreet Journal aptly summed up cap and trade as follows:\n\n       Trillions in assets and millions of jobs would be at the \n     mercy of Congress and the bureaucracy, all for greenhouse gas \n     reductions that would have a meaningless impact on global \n     carbon emissions if China and India don't participate. And \n     only somewhat less meaningless if they do.\n\n  So it is doubtful that a cap-and-trade system would actually \naccomplish the goal of reducing emissions and decreasing global \ntemperatures.\n  A report released by the EPA indicates that even with a cap-and-trade \nsystem in place in the United States, there would still be a net \nincrease in carbon emissions over the next several decades.\n  Indeed, other cap-and-trade efforts have been unsuccessful. For \nexample, the Kyoto Protocol, an international cap-and-trade system \naimed at controlling and reducing greenhouse gases, has largely been \nconsidered a failure. The European trading system has not only failed \nto reduce emissions as contemplated, it has constrained growth in \ndeveloped countries and has enhanced unrestricted development in \ncountries such as China and India.\n  So before we sacrifice the U.S. economy and American jobs, we need to \nquantify the benefits of having a relatively slight reduction in \ngreenhouse gases, and compare it to the huge costs imposed on the U.S. \neconomy and American families.\n  In sum, the amendment before us would increase energy prices, harm \nAmerican families, and likely have a negative impact on long-term U.S. \ngrowth. Moreover, it is questionable whether the legislation would even \nmake a perceptible dent in carbon emissions and decreasing global \ntemperatures.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Thank you, Madam President. We are engaged in an \nextraordinarily important debate here. It is somewhat disappointing \nthat the debate has been shortchanged due to procedural maneuvers by \nthe minority party, which forced the clerk to read the entire bill and \nforced the majority to file a cloture petition.\n  I think what Senator Kyl and many others have said, I might not agree \nwith, but it is important to have this vigorous debate. I am somewhat \ndisappointed that it has been curtailed.\n  But now we are engaged in something that will impact this country and \ngenerations to come in a significant way. Seldom have we debated such \nan issue with global ramifications over decades and decades and \ndecades.\n  We talk about many times the burden that our children and \ngrandchildren will bear as a result of the Federal debt.\n  But there is an equally daunting burden placed on generations to come \nif we fail to come to grips with carbon emissions.\n  Each ton of heat-trapping carbon dioxide that human activity releases \ninto the atmosphere remains there for 100 to 500 years, amplifying the \nwarming effect on our planet, changing the climate, and fundamentally \naltering ecosystems, landscapes and public health.\n  The more carbon that is piled onto this ecological debt today, the \nmore drastic the consequences will be in the future. According to the \nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the IPCC, the atmospheric \nconcentration of greenhouse gases is now the highest it has been in \n650,000 years, and it continues to grow.\n  Madam President, what we do or what we fail to do with respect to \nclimate change will have an impact not only on our country but on life \non this planet into the next century and beyond. Seldom has this body \ngrappled\n\n[[Page S5157]]\n\nwith an issue with such sweeping global ramifications.\n  We frequently talk about the burden that is placed on our children \nand grandchildren by the Federal debt, but an equally daunting burden \nwill be placed on generations to come if we fail to come to grips with \ncarbon emissions. Each ton of heat-trapping carbon dioxide that human \nactivity releases into the atmosphere remains there for 100 to 500 \nyears, amplifying the warming effect on our planet, changing the \nclimate, and fundamentally altering ecosystems, landscapes, and public \nhealth. The more carbon that is piled onto this ecological debt today \nthe more drastic the consequences will be in the future.\n  According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, the \natmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases is now the highest it has \nbeen in 650,000 years and it continues to grow. With near scientific \ncertainty, the IPCC tells us that the high level of greenhouse gases in \nthe air has led to the increase in global temperatures that has \noccurred since the beginning of the 20th century. This increase has \naccelerated in the last 50 years, making the years 1995-2006 the \nwarmest on record. Indeed, global temperatures may now be the hottest \nobserved in the last 1,300 years.\n  The impacts of climate change are already observable:\n  Higher ocean temperatures have led to an increase in the number of \nintense hurricanes in the North Atlantic over the last century.\n  In Rhode Island's Narragansett Bay, the water temperature has climbed \n4 degrees Fahrenheit in the last 40 years, coinciding with declines of \nwinter flounder and lobsters.\n  Permafrost is thawing and becoming unstable, causing buildings to \ncollapse in the Arctic region.\n  In 2007, the extent of Arctic sea ice was 23 percent less than the \nprevious all-time minimum observed in 2005.\n  Snowpack and glaciers are diminishing and are melting earlier in the \nspring. This, in turn, is causing a decline in the health of rivers and \nlakes and is threatening habitat for endangered species.\n  There has been an effect on human health, with increased mortality \nfrom extreme heat and changes in infectious disease vectors. For \ninstance, in Rhode Island this has meant an increase in the incidence \nof tick-borne disease.\n  The best science tells us that we must begin to curb emissions within \nthe next decade in order to stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations and \navoid the catastrophic effects of climate change. If we fail, \ntemperatures will continue to rise with dramatic results:\n  With an increase of 2 degrees Celsius, millions more people will \nexperience coastal flooding each year.\n  An increase of 3 degrees will result in the loss of 30 percent of the \nworld's wetlands.\n  An increase of 1-5 degrees will place 30 percent to 40 percent of \nspecies at risk of extinction.\n  Hundreds of millions of people, including up to 250 million people in \nAfrica, will lose access to reliable water supplies.\n  But this is not a debate solely about plants and animals. It is not \nmerely about feeling better about how we treat the Earth. At its heart \nthis issue is tied to the fundamental national security challenge of \nthis century, energy and our dependence on imported fossil fuels. \nChanges to the environment do not occur in a vacuum and will have far-\nreaching impacts on our national interests and our national security.\n  The U.S. intelligence community has recognized the threat and is in \nthe midst of conducting a national intelligence assessment on the \neffect of climate change on our security.\n  Last year, the CNA Corporation's Military Advisory Board, consisting \nof 11 former general and flag officers, led by former Army Chief of \nStaff, GEN Gordon Sullivan, called for action to stabilize global \ntemperatures. They warned:\n\n       Climate change acts as a threat multiplier for instability \n     in some of the most volatile regions of the world. Projected \n     climate change will seriously exacerbate already marginal \n     living standards in many Asian, African, and Middle Eastern \n     nations, causing widespread political instability and the \n     likelihood of failed states.\n\n  Just this week, NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer \nreiterated that the alliance must prepare for new threats that stem \nfrom the impact of global warming, saying: ``climate change could \nconfront us with a whole range of unpleasant developments--developments \nwhich no single nation-state has the power to contain.''\n  Regrettably, we have already witnessed the political ramifications of \nclimate change. In writing in the Washington Post last summer, U.N. \nSecretary General Ban Ki-moon noted that ``[a]mid the diverse social \nand political causes, the Darfur conflict began as an ecological \ncrisis, arising at least in part from climate change.'' As Secretary \nGeneral Ban notes, a protracted drought, likely brought on by climate \nchange, served to spur conflicts over resources and fuel the hatreds \nthat brought genocide to this region.\n  With so much at stake, the United States cannot fail to lead. In \nfact, we have a special obligation. As noted NASA climate expert James \nHansen recently wrote, carbon dioxide from the beginning of the \nIndustrial Revolution is still present in the atmosphere today, \ncontributing to the warming our planet is experiencing. He estimates \nthat the responsibility of the U.S. for the level of greenhouse gases \nis three times greater than any other country.\n  These are the imperatives that bring us to this debate.\n  I commend Senator Boxer for her efforts to bring this legislation to \nthe point where it is today. Certainly, there must be compromise on \nlegislation of this magnitude. As we engage in this debate, I want to \nhighlight some areas of concern.\n\n  First, we should be setting more aggressive targets for emission \nreductions so temperature increases are contained within an acceptable \nrange. In that regard, I'm concerned that the bill will reduce \nemissions, at most, by 63 percent by 2050. The IPCC has estimated that \nwe may need to reduce emissions by as much as 85 percent in order \nstabilize carbon. Sixty-three percent leaves very little room for \nerror. Given the stakes, I believe we should be setting a higher \ntarget. As a cosponsor of the Global Warming Pollution Reduction Act, \nS. 309, which sets a final reduction target of 80 percent, I believe \nthis is the goal we should set in this legislation. I am pleased to \njoin as a cosponsor of Senator Sanders' amendment to reach this goal. I \nam also pleased to join Senators Kerry and Feinstein in their amendment \nto require a scientific review by the National Academy of Sciences to \nensure the goal we are pursuing is sufficient to stabilize carbon \nconcentrations and to require new legislation to be proposed by the \nPresident if we are projected to fall short.\n  Second, because we must ensure that emissions begin to decline no \nlater than 2020, we must implement the carbon cap as quickly as \npossible. I think we should begin implementation in 2010. Equally \nimportant, I have serious concerns about the bill's cost-containment \nprovisions which would allow the auction of allowances borrowed from \nfuture years in order to provide additional allowances in early years. \nAlthough unlikely, this mechanism creates the potential for a situation \nin which there could be almost no reduction in U.S. emissions through \n2028. Even if it is remote, it's not a possibility we should accept.\n  Third, we should ensure that the needs of consumers, particularly \nlow-income consumers are recognized in the policy that we enact. I was \ndisappointed to see that auction proceeds that were dedicated to the \nWeatherization Assistance Program, WAP, and Low-Income Home Energy \nAssistance Program, LIHEAP, under the committee-reported bill were \nremoved. As this debate progresses, I plan to offer an amendment that \nwill again provide funding for these programs, which not only help \nconsumers pay their energy bills but also make important strides in \nreducing energy consumption and carbon emissions.\n  Fourth, I appreciate the steps that are taken to promote and \ncoordinate market oversight among various regulatory agencies, but I am \nconcerned about the capacity of the EPA to lead the effort to provide \noversight to a market of this size.\n  Fifth, we need to make sure that in any climate change bill we \naddress the very real impacts that capping carbon\n\n[[Page S5158]]\n\nwill have on everyday Americans living paycheck to paycheck. That is no \nsmall task, but no climate change bill will be a success unless we find \na way to provide help to middle class families already struggling in an \never more competitive global economy. They must be afforded the same \nkind of transition assistance that many on the other side want to \nprovide to carbon emitters.\n  Make no mistake, addressing climate change will not be easy. It will \ninvolve change and sacrifice, but it also offers opportunity and hope. \nWe hold the power to unshackle ourselves from the dangerous energy \nresources of the fossil age and develop an economy based on new, clean \nenergy sources and technologies. Instead of becoming increasingly \nbeholden to foreign energy suppliers, we have the opportunity to become \nan exporter of energy technology and to bring light to the 2 billion \npeople in the developing world who lack access to reliable energy. By \nmaking the choice to face the reality of climate change, we will help \nleave the world a better place for our children, grandchildren, and \ngenerations to come.\n  While I hope that we can continue to make improvements to the bill, I \nbelieve that this is an essential debate to have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, before my friend Senator Reed leaves the \nfloor, if I can have his attention, this morning, Senators Warner, \nLieberman, and I and Senator Kerry held a press conference with GEN \nGordon Sullivan, whom you mentioned in your remarks, and ADM Joseph \nLopez. We had the most extraordinary testimony from them in terms of \nhaving to act. It was chilling in a way because they said: You never \nknow something with 100 percent certainty.\n  They said: But what we learned on the battlefield is if you wait \nuntil you have 100 percent certainty, horrible things can happen.\n  It was chilling. They warned us to act. So I think my friend brought \nit home this morning with his remarks.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Allard speak off his side's \ntime--how many minutes?\n  Mr. ALLARD. For 10 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. This is up to you.\n  Mr. ALLARD. For 10 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. And then Senator Sanders for 7, and then Senator Bennett \nfor 5, and then Senator Baucus for 10. I know Senator Craig would like \n10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Madam President, thank you. I am prepared to discuss the \nLieberman-Warner climate change bill that was amended by the Boxer \namendment. In general terms, I wish to take a moment to discuss climate \nchange because that is obviously the main topic on the floor today. I \nhave concerns about the science that some people are claiming here on \nthe floor of the Senate.\n  I think that obviously if we are going to have good policy, we have \nto have good science. But let me say that from the reports I have seen, \nI think it is unclear as to what the long-range trend is as far as the \ntemperature of the Earth is concerned. I admit that right now we are \ngoing through a warming period, but in the last few years we may have \ncooled a fraction of a degree.\n  I am recalling when I was in high school in the late 1950s, that we \nhad magazine articles, National Geographic and everyone were writing \nabout how we were into a cold trend, and we were heading toward an ice \nage.\n  Now we are heading toward the trend in the headlines where we have \nglobal warming. I have listened to some of the comments here on the \nfloor. One comment was that: We are at the highest temperature on \nrecord--the problem is, the record we have of the Earth's warming and \ncooling is a relatively short period of time when you look at the total \nhistory of the Earth. If you go back to the year around 1,000, for \nexample, measuring based on some scientific evidence that has been \nobtained from our polar caps, by going down through the depths of the \nice and analyzing it, some scientists have come up with the conclusion \nthat actually it was warmer in the year 1,000 than it is now. You \ncannot blame that on human action. So the question comes up whether \nthis is a trend, a natural cycle, that happens, that is related to \nsunspots or volcanic activity or whatever natural phenomena might be \nhappening.\n  I happen to agree that we probably contribute some to global warming. \nThe question is, how much? That has not been adequately identified \neither.\n\n  I am here to raise some questions. Obviously, if we absolutely know \nwe are headed for catastrophe, the sooner we act, the better. But on \nthe other hand, we don't want to overreact. We could cause problems for \nthe economy and for Mother Earth if we react in the wrong way without \nhaving good scientific evidence.\n  I am rather disappointed we will not have an opportunity to debate \nand amend this legislation, as we should. No piece of legislation is \nperfect. Obviously, there needs to be an opportunity for bills to be \namended when they come to the floor. I am disappointed the majority \nleader has filled the amendment tree and filed for cloture, rather than \nallowing for the full and healthy debate that is such a rich part of \nthe Senate's history.\n  Since this bill has been introduced, we have record-high gas prices. \nThere is pain at the pump. The common solution we have heard time and \ntime again, whenever we have high petroleum prices, is: You need to \nraise taxes. You need to limit supply. You need to blame corporations. \nYou need to somehow control international cartels. You can't control \nwhat isn't part of America. We can't pass laws and tell them when they \ncan form a cartel and what they can do. It is beyond our reach. But we \ncan take care of corporate misbehavior. We have had hearings time and \nagain trying to blame oil companies for overcharging. Over the years, \nthe conclusion is, there has not been any misbehavior as far as \ncorporations setting prices. They are responding to supply and demand. \nThey are responding to the cost of the product, taking a reasonable \nprofit and putting that product on the market. I happen to believe \nsupply and demand has the greatest impact on our prices at the pump to \ndate.\n  Obviously, this is not a perfect process. It is not a perfect bill. \nWe need to bring the bill to the floor, provide an opportunity for \nsubstitutes to be brought forward, and then an opportunity to amend \nthose. I am disappointed we will not have an opportunity to do that. \nThat seems to be the trend this year. Republicans are not having the \nopportunity to bring up issues they believe are important on \nlegislation that comes to the floor. That has happened time and again. \nThen the other side blames Republicans for somehow blocking the \nprocess. If you don't have an opportunity to offer amendments to the \nlegislation, that is a serious concern to those of us who have to work \nin the minority in an institution such as the Senate, where there are \nspecific minority rights.\n  I would like to address some of the concerns of the Boxer amendment \nto the Warner-Lieberman climate change bill. My foremost concern is the \nscience on which the entire bill is based. But because the ranking \nmember of the Environment and Public Works Committee has asked us to \nleave science aside and focus on the legislation itself, I will start \nthere.\n  Based on many reports I have seen, it is unclear what, if any, effect \nclimate change legislation would have on global temperatures. However, \nits potential economic impacts are absolutely staggering. The primary \ntool this bill uses to reduce greenhouse gases is a cap-and-trade \nprogram. It should more accurately be called a cap-and-tax program \nbecause it is essentially a camouflaged energy tax increase.\n  Many of the proponents of this bill have said it is just like the \nprogram the Government instituted to control acid rain. But unlike \nsulfur dioxide in the acid rain program, there is no widely deployable \ncontrol system for CO2 removal, nor do we expect this \nequipment to exist in the reasonably foreseeable future. This will \nresult in significant increased cost to electric utilities, their \nconsumers, as well as affected industries and their customers. That is \nthe taxpayers. Thus, the cost of compliance will have a significant \nnegative economic impact on electric consumers statewide and Colorado's \nmanufacturing industries.\n\n[[Page S5159]]\n\n  A recent study produced by the Heritage Foundation Center for Data \nAnalysis found that enacting this bill would cost Colorado almost 7,000 \nagriculture-based jobs and over 21,000 manufacturing jobs. That is over \n27,000 lost jobs in Colorado alone. The same study found that \nstatewide, Colorado would have a personal income loss of around $2.162 \nbillion.\n  This bill also contains a provision in section 201 which was \noriginally formulated for the acid rain program. This provision \nspecifically denies that emissions allowances, which will be given out \nby the Government, are to be considered a property right. The provision \nalso allows the administrator to limit or revoke the allowances at any \ntime. Specifying that allowances are not property is, therefore, the \nGovernment's way to avoid a ``taking'' in the inevitable instance that \nthe administrator does revoke allowances.\n  How do we justify this? Government enables itself to give a product, \nsets up a scheme for buying and trading that product but can, at any \ntime and for any reason, revoke that product without compensation. \nWhile there is certainly legal precedent, that does not make it right. \nIn my view, this challenges assertions the bill's sponsors are making \nthat their cap-and-trade approach is a market-based one.\n  I will propose an amendment, if given the opportunity--I filed it by \nthe 1 o'clock deadline--to fix this by specifying that emissions \nallowances are property rights, and while the Government could still \nlimit or revoke allowances, it would have to compensate the owners of \nallowances in order to do so. It is only fair that the Government would \nhave to follow the same rules it sets out for industry to follow when \nbuying and selling allowances.\n  If we allow this legislation to go forward in its current form, we \nwill see energy prices go up. The national cost of gas today averages \naround $4 a gallon. This will only go up if we pass the climate change \nbill. Coloradans are currently feeling pain at the pump, but if we pass \nthis bill, they will feel it in their homes also. One of Colorado's \nmunicipally owned utility providers has informed me that when this bill \ntakes full effect in 2012, their customers will immediately see their \nutility bill jump above 25 percent.\n  Another utility, Tri-State, which provides electric power for 1.2 \nmillion rural electric customers in a 4-State area, has projected that \ntheir costs to comply with the requirements laid out in this bill will \nbe $12.6 billion in 2012 to 2030. This is based on the assumption that \ncarbon credits would cost $50 per ton.\n  It is entirely possible that cost projection is very conservative, \nand these are just rural electric cooperative impacts.\n  I also have very real concerns related to the fact that anyone--not \njust covered emitters--can buy, sell, hold, or retire emissions \nallowances. Anyone with a large enough pocketbook could purchase a \nsignificant share of allowances and hold them to push the allowance \nprice up or retire them. That would put our Nation at risk of economic \nmanipulation, should another nation decide to step in and buy those \nallowances. Additionally, if an investor wants to make a lot of money \noff of the carbon trading market, they could just purchase and hold \nthose allowances until the price gets high enough to make them want to \nsell.\n  In any of these scenarios, the end result will leave the consumers as \nthe ones paying the price.\n  In closing, I reiterate that this bill is, in my opinion, not the \nright way to approach the issue of climate change. A far more effective \napproach would be for the Federal Government to continue to provide \nincentives for the development of greenhouse gas neutral technologies \nand technologies that do not produce greenhouse gases. Incentivizing \ntechnology development would get us to the same place without the \neconomic hardship that this bill would impose. A good example of doing \nthis has been the significant increases in renewable energy production \nthat have resulted from the production tax credit, clean renewable \nenergy bonds--called CREBs--and with incentives for clean coal \ntechnology.\n  There will, of course, be a need for a larger Federal incentive \nprogram in all these areas to move the ball forward, but this will \nstill be at much less cost to consumers than the $325 increase in \naverage annual household energy cost that the Energy Information \nAdministration has projected this bill could bring about.\n  This is a poorly thought-out piece of legislation. We need to have an \nopportunity to legislate, to offer amendments, and move forward with \nthis important debate. This is a comprehensive piece of legislation. It \nis important. It involves lots of Americans. I am disappointed we will \nnot have an opportunity, under the current process, to amend this \nlegislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized for 7 \nminutes.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, today we are discussing two issues \nwhich, in fact, are related to each other. No. 1 is the outrageously \nhigh cost of oil and gas. The second is the planetary crisis we face as \na result of global warming. There are some people who think we have to \naddress the price of high oil prices today and not worry about global \nwarming. Some people think we have to worry about global warming and \nignore the reality facing millions of people who cannot afford oil and \ngas. I think we are actually smart enough to walk and chew gum at the \nsame time. We can and must address both these important issues.\n  My office has recently published a small book. It is called ``The \nCollapse of the Middle Class, Letters from Vermont and America.'' It \ntalks about what is going on not only in my State but all over this \ncountry, where the middle class is declining, people are working longer \nhours for lower wages, losing health care, pensions, their good-paying \njobs. After all that, when you have gas at $4 a gallon at the pump, \nhome heating oil outrageously high, many people throughout the country \nhave now fallen over the economic cliff.\n  In terms of oil and gas prices, the time is now for the Congress to \ntell our friends at ExxonMobil and other oil companies enjoying \nrecordbreaking profits--last year ExxonMobil earned more profits than \nany corporation in the history of the world; last year the head of \nOccidental Oil, a major oil company, had enough money to provide $400 \nmillion in compensation for their CEO--to stop ripping off the American \npeople. It is time for us to pass a windfall profits tax which says: \nEnough is enough.\n  But it is not only the oil companies that are ripping off the \nAmerican people. The other day at the Commerce Committee, there was an \nimportant hearing in which George Soros and major economists testified \nit is not only oil company greed but speculators on Wall Street who are \ndriving prices up, which results, perhaps, in a 35-percent increase in \nwhat the price of a barrel of oil should be. We have to deal with that \nissue as well. This is the so-called Enron loophole. Right now, through \nhedge funds, through unregulated markets, there is a massive amount of \ntrading on oil futures which is driving up oil prices. We should be \nregulating that speculation. It should be transparent. In the process, \nwhen we do that, as was the case with Enron and electricity, as was the \ncase with propane gas, as was the case with natural gas, if we begin to \naddress speculation in terms of oil futures, we can drive down oil \nprices.\n  Bottom line: We have to do that. In my State, as in rural States all \nover this country, where people are traveling long distances to work, \nthey cannot afford, on limited incomes, to pay $4 for a gallon of gas. \nWhen the weather gets 20 below zero in Vermont, people cannot afford to \npay twice as much this year as they did a couple years ago for home \nheating oil. So let us have the courage to take on the speculators. Let \nus have the courage to take on the oil companies and fight to lower oil \nand gas prices.\n  In addition, we can't ignore the crisis in global warming. My friends \ncome to the floor and say: Well, the scientific evidence is not clear.\n  That is not true. Virtually every leading scientist who knows \nsomething about the issue, including the Intergovernmental Panel on \nClimate Change, has said, with 100 percent certainty, global warming is \na reality. In fact, what they have told us is the situation is more \ndire than they had previously predicted. If we are concerned about\n\n[[Page S5160]]\n\nthe drought we are seeing today which will only get worse, if we are \nconcerned about the hunger we are seeing as a result of that drought \nwhich will only get worse, if we are worried about the severe weather \ndisturbances we are seeing right now, if we are worried about flooding, \nabout disease, it is absolutely imperative we address the crisis of \nglobal warming and address it now.\n  Some people say: There may be economic dislocation if we do it. There \nmay be, and we have to address that. But I believe there are enormous \neconomic opportunities. I believe the evidence is clear we can create \nmillions of good-paying jobs as we move toward energy efficiency, as we \nproduce automobiles, not that get 15 miles per gallon but hybrid plug-\nins which get 150 miles per gallon, as we rebuild our deteriorating \nrail system so people do not have to get into a car to go where they \nwant to go but can get on good rail, that we deliver cargo via rail.\n  There is enormous opportunity not only in terms of energy efficiency, \nin saving huge amounts of fossil fuel, but also in sustainable energy. \nI have tremendous optimism in what we can do with the technology that \nis already on the shelf, not to mention the technology that will be \ncoming in the near future.\n  In terms of solar thermal plants which are now being built in the \nsouthwestern part of this country, as well as all over the world, you \nhave plants, solar thermal plants, that are being built which can \nprovide as much electricity as small nuclear powerplants, with no, or \nvirtually no, greenhouse gas emissions. We are talking about producing \n15, 20 or more percent of the electricity the United States needs right \nfrom solar thermal plants.\n  In addition to that, as Germany is doing, as California is now doing, \nthere is tremendous opportunity with photovoltaics. We can put \nphotovoltaics on 10 million roofs in this country. The more we produce, \nthe more the price goes down, and we create jobs in the process.\n  Wind is the fastest growing source of new energy in the world and in \nthe United States. It is also becoming less and less expensive. I am \nnot just talking about large wind farms in Texas, in the Midwest. We \nare talking about small wind turbines that can be placed in people's \nbackyards all over rural America.\n  Geothermal, biomass--there is huge potential. We must go forward for \nthe sake of our kids and our grandchildren.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 7 minutes.\n  The Senator from Utah is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Madam President, I thank the sponsors of this \nlegislation and the leadership of the Senate for bringing this debate \nforward. I think it is warranted. I think the issues are serious. I am \nnot a naysayer who would say that global warming is not taking place or \nthat human beings are not contributing to it.\n  However, when I start discussing this with my constituents with \nrespect to the present bill, they hit me immediately with one single \nquestion: What is it going to cost me?\n  So before I get into any of the aspects of global warming, I want to \nanswer that question. We know we have had a wide range of costs cited \non the Senate floor. They have said the increasing gasoline price will \nbe anywhere from 11 percent to 140 percent. We have heard that the \nincrease in cost to electricity will be anywhere from 44 percent to 500 \npercent. We have heard that the increase in cost in natural gas as a \nresult of this bill would be anywhere from 35 percent to 87 percent.\n  I do not want to pick a number between those two wide ranges in each \ncase. I went to Utah, and I went to the Utah Petroleum Association and \nsaid: All right, you have looked at this bill. What will this cost Utah \nmotorists if this is passed? Do not give me 2030 estimates. Do not give \nme numbers that are in a wide range. Tell me, what will drivers in Utah \nhave to pay at the pump if this bill passes?\n  They gave me a range: somewhere between 32 and 34 additional cents \nprice at the pump. How did they calculate that? They said the total \ncost to Utah's oil refineries of the bill would be $500 million in the \nfirst year of implementation. They can extrapolate that $500 million \ninto the price at the pump.\n  On electricity, I got a wider range. A Utah company estimated it \nwould have to raise electricity rates somewhere between 100 percent and \n500 percent in order to cover the cost of their purchasing the carbon \nallowances.\n  So we start with this debate answering the constituent question: What \nwill it cost? These are what it would cost in Utahns approximately 32 \nto 34 more cents at the pump and somewhere between 100 and 500 percent \nin their electricity bill.\n  Now, let's get to the heart of the problem. I would like to make a \npoint I think everybody ignores. This is a global problem, and the bill \nattempts to solve it with a national solution.\n  On this chart I have in the Chamber I have two lines. The blue line \nis the projection of what is going to happen in carbon emissions \nglobally. The red line is what is going to happen in carbon emissions \nin the United States. You can see, the blue line is going up \ndramatically, whereas the red line is virtually flat.\n  Now, if the bill passes, and everything works as its sponsors say it \nwill--everything comes to pass in the best possible way--what will be \nthe impact? The dotted line in red shows what will be the impact in the \nUnited States. The dotted line in blue shows what will be the impact \nglobally.\n  The impact globally will be minimal because increasingly the U.S. \nshare of global emissions is going down. So that is why I am opposed to \nthis bill.\n  I close with a comment from Daniel Botkin, Ph.D., professor emeritus \nof the University of California, Santa Barbara. He says in his \nstatement:\n\n       You may think I must be one of those know-nothing naysayers \n     who believes global warming is a liberal plot. On the \n     contrary, I am a biologist and ecologist who has worried \n     about global warming, and been concerned about its effects \n     since 1968. . . .\n\n  Then he says:\n\n       I'm not a naysayer. I'm a scientist who believes in the \n     scientific method and in what facts tell us. I have worked \n     for 40 years to try to improve our environment and improve \n     human life as well. . . .\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent for an \nadditional 30 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BENNETT. This is his summary:\n\n       My concern is that we may be moving away from an irrational \n     lack of concern about climate change to an equally irrational \n     panic about it.\n       Many of my colleagues ask, ``What's the problem? Hasn't it \n     been a good thing to raise public concern?'' The problem is \n     that in this panic we are going to spend our money unwisely, \n     we will take actions that are counterproductive, and we will \n     fail to do many of those things that will benefit the \n     environment and ourselves.\n\n  That is the irrational panic I think we would move to if we do this \nbill without serious amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized for 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, today, the Senate is addressing the most \ncompelling environmental issue of our time--global warming.\n  President Teddy Roosevelt once said:\n\n       I recognize the right and duty of this generation to \n     develop and use our natural resources, but I do not recognize \n     the right to waste them, or to rob by wasteful use, the \n     generations that come after us.\n\n  We all have a basic moral duty: a duty to leave this Earth to our \nchildren and our grandchildren in as good a shape or better shape than \nwe found it. We should not rob future generations of a healthy climate \nand all the benefits that come from it. What will history say about us \nif we rob future generations of the chance to fish in cold water trout \nstreams or see glaciers in Glacier National Park?\n  By reasserting America's moral leadership and enacting a cap-and-\ntrade program, we can leave a different legacy. We can protect our \noutdoor heritage, make our economy more competitive, and create more \ngood-paying jobs.\n  In Montana, we are already transitioning to a new green economy. We \nhave increased our wind-generating capacity more than seventyfold in \nthe last 2 years. The potential for this clean energy is huge. We can \nreplicate this success with solar, clean coal technology, with carbon \ncapture and sequestration, and other clean forms of energy.\n\n[[Page S5161]]\n\n  We must begin the process of developing the next generation of energy \ntechnologies at home. A cap-and-trade program will spur cleaner \ntechnologies and create good-paying jobs.\n  We already know that a cap-and-trade system can work. It is a market-\nbased solution that harnesses the power of America's ingenuity and \nentrepreneurship.\n  In the year 1990, I chaired the conference committee that completed \nthe Clean Air Act amendments designed to address acid rain. At the \ntime, there were a lot of gloom-and-doom predictions about the costs \nthat the Clean Air Act amendments would impose on the economy. Certain \nindustry groups claimed that the Clean Air Act amendments would cost \nindustry more than $5 billion every year. The actual cost to industry \nwas less than one-third of that. And the public benefits of cleaner air \nhave amounted to more than $78 billion a year.\n  A cap-and-trade system for greenhouse gases will be much more \ncomplicated, clearly. But I am confident that by using a market-based \nsolution, we can stop global warming as well.\n  We have a moral imperative to act. We have no choice. But we must \nalso work to get the policy right. We have no choice there either. This \nmeans designing a cap-and-trade system that stops global warming. But \nit also means doing it in a way that enhances our economic \ncompetitiveness, creates good-paying green jobs, and avoids harm to \nworking families.\n  Setting the cap determines whether we meet our environmental goals. \nWhat we do with the money the cap-and-trade program raises will \ndetermine whether we enhance our American competitiveness and help \nworking families.\n  By establishing a cap-and-trade system, we are creating a market for \ngreenhouse gas emissions. Under the cap-and-trade system, emitting \ngreenhouse gases will come at a price. Allowances will govern the right \nto emit greenhouse gases. The bill before us gives away some of the \nallowances but auctions others in an auction system. The bill auctions \nfewer allowances in the earlier years and more in the later years of \nthe program, through the year 2050.\n  The auctioning of these allowances will generate receipts. According \nto the Congressional Budget Office, enacting this substitute will \ngenerate an additional $902 billion in receipts over the next 10 \nyears--close to $1 trillion.\n  The bill we are considering allocates the money generated from the \nauction through a variety of trust funds. There are 15 of them in all. \nThey are directed toward different needs anticipated from dealing with \nglobal warming. For example, the bill sets aside funding for such \nthings as wildlife adaptation, creation of a new worker training \nprogram, and energy technology.\n  All of these are worthy causes. But are they the best way to use the \nreceipts in order to increase our competitiveness and help working \nfamilies? Should we auction all of the allowances, more of the \nallowances, or fewer? Rather than spending the receipts through the \nvarious trust funds, should we return more of the money to the people \nin tax cuts?\n  This bill also safeguards American economic competitiveness by \nrequiring importers to buy carbon allowances for products imported from \ncountries that have not made commitments to reduce greenhouse gases. \nThis requirement can serve as an effective incentive for other \ncountries, particularly the rapidly developing economies in China, \nIndia, and Brazil to join us in the fight against global warming.\n  Of course, our trading partners will watch closely any proposal that \nimposes an assessment on imports. It is important we adopt such \nmeasures in a manner that respects international trade rules. The \nproposal before us has been carefully crafted to take these rules into \naccount.\n  As a member of the Environment and Public Works Committee, I \nsupported the Lieberman-Warner bill in both the subcommittee and full \ncommittee. I believed it was very important to move forward on global \nwarming.\n  As chairman of the Finance Committee, I have additional \nresponsibilities. Those include directing the revenues generated by the \nFederal Government, overseeing U.S. trade policy, and helping those \ndisplaced by trade to retool and retrain. The bill before us today \ninvolves these and many other matters. This is a complex and \nchallenging issue involving many committees within the Congress.\n  We in the Senate have finally woken up to the moral imperative of \naddressing global warming. Now we must acknowledge the imperative to \nget the policy right. I applaud Senator Lieberman, Senator Warner, and \nSenator Boxer for bringing this issue before the Senate so we can begin \nto debate and improve the policy.\n  I want to continue to work with my colleagues to get it right, as \nchairman of the Finance Committee, as a member of the EPW Committee, \nand as a Montanan and a concerned American. We owe it to our children \nto act and to get it right.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized for 10 \nminutes under the previous order.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Thank you, Madam President.\n  Let me recognize at the beginning of my comments that yesterday I was \non the Senate floor to talk about the incorporation of good forest \npolicy as it relates to rejuvenating America's forests to increase \ntheir capability of sequestration of carbon out of the atmosphere. I \nsaid at that time there would be an amendment. That amendment has the \ncosponsorship of Senators Domenici, Allard, Crapo, and Barrasso and has \nbeen filed. It is an important amendment, if we ever get to that phase \nof this debate, where we will be able to effectively craft and shape a \npolicy for our country.\n\n  We deal with striking the international intent within this bill to \ntake our money to help others before we help ourselves. We define \nbiological sequestration. We think that is extremely important because \nwe know how to do that now at the Federal level. It is not the old \nbusiness-as-usual model; it is establishing a baseline and being able \nto effectively measure from there. We allow forests to get credits from \nmeaningful sequestration, and I think this is tremendously important to \nbe able to do. It is not about the volume of a stand of timber; it is \nabout the ability of that stand to sequester. If you have 400 trees per \nacre, you have overpopulated that area by as many as maybe 250 or 300 \ntrees per acre. But that is the measurement of the Boxer amendment. It \nis absolutely counterintuitive to modern forest science. We change it \nto where we are and to where we know our forest scientists are today.\n  We use existing monitoring and measuring tools, which is very \nimportant. It is a product of 1992 legislation when we charged the U.S. \nForest Service and their laboratories to get at the business of being \nable to effectively measure. We use internationally recognized \nsustainable forest management standards. We use RFS and productive tax \ncredits for biomass and biomass removement, and of course we use \nstewardship contracting, which is critically important.\n  Let me take the Presiding Officer and those who might be listening \ntoday on a very interesting journey that starts at America's gas pump. \nLet me assume that the Presiding Officer has just driven up to a gas \npump somewhere in America. You stick the hose in your car, you activate \nthe pump, you slide your credit card, and you begin to fill. Depending \non the size of your vehicle and the price--anywhere from let's say \n$3.85 a gallon for regular to maybe $4.44 in California--you begin to \ngrow annoyed as the calculator on the pump goes: 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, \n60, 65--oops, you have maxed the pump and you have to get more by \nreactivating the pump to fill your SUV. Your anger is optimal now. You \nhave just paid 100 bucks or somewhere near that, and you have never \ndone that before. You move your view up to the pump and it says \n``Chevron.'' It says ``Shell.'' It says one of the major oil companies. \nYou focus your anger on that company and you say: It has to be their \nfault. They are making record profits. Somehow, there ought to be a way \nto stop them from doing what they just did to me and my pocketbook and \nmy family's budget.\n  Let me take you, the consumer, then, a step further and suggest to \nyou that you are part of a problem that has been growing in America for \na long while. Your demand for the use of energy has\n\n[[Page S5162]]\n\ngone nearly straight up over four decades as you have increased your \nconsumption of it. Why? Because the price was reasonable and you \nenjoyed it. The price was reasonable and your demand went up \ndramatically, but while that was going on, there were interests at work \nin our country that said: We are not going to produce any more, we are \ngoing to produce less, and we did. So our overall supply began to drop \nat about the time that our demand began to go up catastrophically. What \nhappened was an interesting scenario.\n  So now you have hung your hose up from the gas pump, you have just \npaid 100 bucks, and you are angry as heck. You are part of the demand \ncurve in our supply in our country that is dropping down, and you have \njust blamed Exxon or Chevron or Marathon or someone because you have \nspent 100 bucks to fill your SUV and you are not happy.\n  If you took all of these small companies and blamed them all and said \nthey have to be the problem, they would only represent about 6 or 7 \npercent of the problem. The problem these companies have is that they \nare buying a substantial amount of their oil from this side of the \nchart. They are buying their oil from countries--from countries that \ndon't give a darn about our problems. We have grown so dependent on \nforeign countries that now some 55 to 60 percent of our consumption \ncomes from them, and we pay a phenomenal amount for it, or should I say \nyou--you, the consumer who has just put up the hose on the gas pump and \nwho has grown angry, wanting to focus your anger on these companies.\n  Is it Canada you want to blame? Well, let's see now, at $125 a \nbarrel, we are paying Canada $280 million a day. Why should we blame \nthem? They are supplying our needs. There are no gas lines today. There \nis no diminishment in supply. It is a price problem. Well, then let's \nblame Saudi Arabia. Oh, yes. They are over here. They are the big boys. \nThe President just went over there, hat in hand, begging that they turn \ntheir valves on, and they said: No, Mr. President. Your problem, not \nours. You are going to keep buying our oil. You need it. We are paying \nthem $190 million a day. Maybe it is Venezuela, run by a little tinhorn \ndictator--$160 million a day flowing from our consumers' pocketbooks--\nor it is Nigeria at $140 million or it is Algeria at $70 million.\n  The bottom line is, well over $1 billion a day comes right out of the \nconsumers' pocket and goes primarily to one of these companies that buy \nfrom one of these countries. They buy the oil at the current world \nprice, and they are allowed to take some profit from it; sure they do. \nTheir profits are record highs because the charges are record highs, \nand the story goes on and on.\n  We search to blame. We have little alternative. The business of the \noil economy has little elasticity to it. We can't switch over to \nsomething else unless we park the SUV and get a bicycle. But you can't \nhaul your kids to the soccer game on a bicycle. You can't haul boxes of \ngroceries home on a bicycle. So the American economy and its consumers \nare questioning themselves right now, saying: What do we do?\n  Let me suggest there is somebody to blame besides ExxonMobil and \nChevron and Marathon. Why don't you blame the Senate? Why don't you \nblame the Congress of the United States which, by being subject to \nenvironmental pressure over the last 30 years, has largely denied the \nright of this country to effectively develop its oil reserves and \ncreate a less dependent relationship with all of these countries? That \nis what we ought to be doing, but we are not doing that.\n  Here is a map of the gulf region of Florida. In this region, we are \ndeveloping this right now. We have just opened this area after we spent \n2 years trying to get it open because politics would not allow us to \nopen it, and we think there are about 2.2 million barrels a day \nstarting in 2012 down here. This is lease sale 181. But over here, \nthere may be as much oil as there was or is here, but this is \npolitically off limits. We can't do it. Why shouldn't the consumers \nsay: Well, what is the politics of it? You are draining my pocketbook \ndry. Is there value in those politics? Why don't you develop your \nreserves? Well, Florida, Presidential politics--you name it. Floridians \nare awfully frustrated by the fact that you might be able to drill \nthere.\n  This area right down here is the Cuban basin, the northern Cuban \nbasin. Cubans are letting leases out to drill there. The U.S. \nGeological Survey would suggest that there is some oil there--maybe \nquite a bit of oil--but we won't get it. It won't traffic through Exxon \nor Chevron because we have a policy that denies us access to that \nregion of the world because, if you will, of the politics of Cuba, \nplain and simple.\n  So here is our problem with that and here is our problem with this \ninteresting picture. We have about 115 billion barrels of reserve in \ngas, about 29 billion known, about 5 billion undiscovered resources. In \ngas, we have about 633 trillion cubic feet, 213 trillion known, 419 \nunknown. Now, that is information that is 20 years old because \npolitically you dare not go out into any of these regions today with \nthe new seismic technology and explore because if you did and you found \noil, you might want to drill, and that would be environmentally \nunacceptable. Oh, how frightening.\n  I remember a time--and not all do unless you are about my age--come \n1969 when there was an interesting oil spill off the coast of Santa \nBarbara in southern California. It made national headlines because it \nwas one of the first major oil spills that did substantial \nenvironmental damage. I have oftentimes referred on the floor to our \ndenial to access the Outer Continental Shelf as the ghosts of Santa \nBarbara that lurk in this Chamber and hide in the background of \nenvironmental arguments. That was Santa Barbara in 1969. But what is \nfascinating about Santa Barbara is that while we didn't drill offshore \nSanta Barbara because of a moratorium on the Federal waters, we \ncontinued to drill offshore Santa Barbara in the State waters. Today, \noffshore Santa Barbara, CA, is producing 731,000 barrels of oil a day. \nThey just cut a new deal with some oil companies to drill in this area. \nWell, why aren't they allowing us to drill offshore further out in the \nContinental Shelf? Because California doesn't get the money. Oops. \nSorry, folks. Money trumped the environment. Remember that. In Santa \nBarbara today, they are drilling for oil if it is within the 3-mile \nlimit of the shoreline because that is State oil and that is State \nwater. But out in the Federal reserve, Outer Continental Shelf, no, no, \nno, no, can't do, must not do that, something about a problem.\n  Well, what the ghost of Santa Barbara and the 1969 oil spill did was \nshove us into a period of technology unprecedented. Today, we are \ndrilling offshore in the gulf, and the water is so deep that we didn't \neven imagine a decade ago we could be there. We are doing it \nappropriately and in a very clean fashion.\n  So here are the headlines in Los Angeles, April 20, 2008: Santa \nBarbara approves offshore drilling. Well, what happened to this picture \nhere? What happened in 1969 with this oil rig spilling oil, sea lions \ndying, fish dying, muck, oily muck along the shoreline? That is Santa \nBarbara, 1969. We were led to believe they stopped drilling altogether, \nbut they didn't. They just approved new drilling, but it is inside the \n3-mile zone.\n  Now, Californians are selective, apparently, about their environment. \nIf there is money tied to it, well, maybe we can drill, if we get all \nthe money, but if we don't get as much of it, we won't drill offshore. \nThat is the kind of politics that have gone on today.\n  So remember how I started these comments a few moments ago? You have \njust driven up to a gas pump, you just stuck the nozzle into the tank \nof your SUV, you just cranked out 100 bucks of regular at about $4.40 a \ngallon--in California, because of the boutique fuels of the Clean Air \nAct--and you have grown angry because somebody was ripping you off, and \nthat somebody had to be an Exxon or a Chevron or a Marathon or someone \nelse. But I hope I have been able to suggest to you some additional \nknowledge: That they represent maybe 6 percent of world production. It \nis the petropolitics of the world today where nearly 90 percent of the \nknown oil and the reserves are owned by foreign nations that are \nsticking it to us, and they are sticking it to us today because of our \nown interesting greed, because we grew luxuriously fat on cheap energy \nand we developed cars that take\n\n[[Page S5163]]\n\na lot. Now that we can't fill them for 20 bucks and it is costing us \n100 bucks, we are angry and we want to blame somebody. Blame Saudi \nArabia, blame Venezuela. But how about blaming us here in the Congress, \nbecause some of us have tried, but the body politic of America denied \nthat we should touch our own reserves, develop our own oil, and that we \nshould become dependent upon someone else.\n\n  So we have legislation on the floor today that doesn't help that. It \ncreates, in fact, greater dependency. It doesn't move us forward to \ndevelop those known reserves. It doesn't allow us to do the geological \nexploration in the deep waters of the Outer Continental Shelf with the \nnew technologies, in which we will find much more oil than we know is \nthere.\n  America, blame your Congress--blame your friendly Congressman or your \nfriendly Senator. Ask them how they voted. Ask them how they are going \nto vote on ANWR, on Outer Continental Shelf, on new development, on new \nrefinery capacity. Oil is not the answer for 50 years from now, but oil \nis the bridge that gets us from where we are to where we need to be \nwith new technologies. But our lack of foresight, our rush to be green, \nand our rush to deny the realities of the marketplace has produced the \nproblems we have today, and there are people to blame. We ought to \nstart right here with a Congress that would not listen.\n  But year after year, while I and others brought ANWR to the floor for \na vote, and while we tried to get into the Outer Continental Shelf, \npolitically, it was simply an unpopular thing to do, because some would \nsay this would be the picture. Fellow Senators, this picture I display \non the Senate floor is a picture of the past. This is of 1969 Santa \nBarbara. From that day forward, we began to apply technology to drill \nheads, to drill rigs, through our capability and talent. When Katrina \nhit the gulf and hit the coastline of Louisiana, parts of Alabama, \nMississippi, and Florida, offshore, not one drop was spilled. Thousands \nof wells were shut down. Rigs were sent adrift. But what is depicted in \nthis picture did not occur. This will not occur again because of the \ntriple safety devices and all of the kinds of things that have been \nincorporated as a result of this.\n  So California today drills happily away within the 3-mile zone, \nbecause they get 100 percent. But outside the 3-mile zone, no, no, no, \ncan't touch, might hurt the environment. Shame on us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Salazar). The Senator from Missouri is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                 Intelligence Committee Phase Ii Report\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, with some reluctance, I come to the floor \ntoday to continue the discussions that were begun this morning about \nthe Intelligence Committee's report that comes out today, called phase \nII.\n  I am somewhat embarrassed to have to highlight the partisan divisions \nand sloppy work of the Intelligence Committee that was discussed here. \nBack in July of 2004, the Intelligence Committee completed an \nexhaustive 2-year study of the inadequacies of the intelligence pre-\nIraq war. We looked at it. We had hundreds of interviews, brought \npeople in, and looked at all of the documents. Our staff analyzed all \nof these items and interviewed people. We came to the conclusion that, \ndespite what some people had said, the intelligence prior to the Iraq \nwar was flawed. It wasn't a question of the administration pressuring \nanalysts or the administration misusing intelligence. Those charges \nwere made and they were very volatile. They were all dismissed because \nthe intelligence was bad. We passed the bill out of committee \nunanimously. It was a true bipartisan work. It stands as a monument to \nwhat effective oversight could and should be. It helped reform the \nintelligence community, to make it better and improve the tradecraft of \nthe analysts, and to inspire more working together.\n  But today we have regressed significantly. What came out today as the \nphase II reports were, regrettably, highly partisan. When I became vice \nchairman of the Intelligence Committee, I had hopes we would be able to \nput behind us the corrosive atmosphere of partisanship that had taken \nover in the committee in previous years. I recommended that we work \ntogether on phase II to bring it to an end, because most of the work \nhad been done in 2006. The minority asked for extensive analysis and \ncollation and collaboration, and they prepared that. But the offer was \nrejected by the chairman.\n  Instead, two reports were written solely by Democratic staffers. No \nminority staffers participated in the writing of the report. They were \nshut out, unlike work on the phase I effort. It is an unfortunate \nexample of partisanship being alive and well on the committee.\n  The report released today is an attempt to score election year \npoints. I would have thought we would quit fighting the 2004 election, \nbut apparently we have not. It violates the committee's nonpartisan \nprinciples and rejects the conclusions unanimously reached in previous \nreports.\n  I think it is ironic that the majority would knowingly distort and \nmisrepresent the committee's prior phase I findings in an effort to \nprove that the administration distorted and mischaracterized the \nintelligence. In contrast, as I said, the phase I report of July 2004 \nconcluded that most of the key judgments in that NIE, National \nIntelligence Estimate, on Iraq's WMD programs either overstated or were \nnot supported by the underlying intelligence. And the committee found \nthat the Intelligence Committee failed to explain to policymakers the \nuncertainties behind the judgment. The report made it clear that flawed \nintelligence--not administration deception--was the basis for \npolicymaker statements and decisions.\n  Despite the Democrats' political theater on the floor today, none of \nthe facts in the phase II majority reports released today change that \nconclusion. There is no evidence in the information brought up today \nthat changes the conclusions of the phase I bipartisan 15-to-0 vote.\n  Now, the reports that came out today ignore the fact that many in \nCongress--Republicans and Democrats--examined the same intelligence as \nthe Bush administration, and they, too, characterized Iraq as a growing \nand dangerous threat to the United States.\n  The public report is replete with examples of statements by the \ncurrent chairman and by other Democrats. Let me report what was said by \nthe current chairman.\n  October 10, 2002:\n\n       There is unmistakable evidence that Saddam Hussein is \n     working aggressively to develop nuclear weapons and will \n     likely have nuclear weapons within the next 5 years. He could \n     have it earlier if he is able to obtain fissile materials on \n     the outside market, which is possible--difficult but \n     possible. We also should remember we have always \n     underestimated the progress that Saddam Hussein has been able \n     to make in the development of weapons of mass destruction.\n\n  He said this also:\n\n       Saddam Hussein represents a grave threat to the United \n     States.\n\n  Further on in the statement, he said on October 10, 2002:\n\n       The President has rightly called Saddam Hussein's efforts \n     to develop weapons of mass destruction a grave and gathering \n     threat to Americans. The global community has tried, but has \n     failed, to address that threat over the past decade. I have \n     come to the inescapable conclusion that the threat posed \n     to America by Saddam's weapons of mass destruction is so \n     serious that despite the risks--and we should not minimize \n     the risks--we must authorize the President to take the \n     necessary steps to deal with that threat. . . . There has \n     been some debate over how ``imminent'' a threat Iraq \n     poses. I do believe Iraq poses an imminent threat. I also \n     believe after September 11, that question is increasingly \n     outdated. It is in the nature of these weapons that he has \n     and the way they are targeted against civilian \n     populations, that documented capability and demonstrated \n     intent may be the only warning we get. To insist on \n     further evidence could put some of our fellow Americans at \n     risk. Can we afford to take that chance? I do not think we \n     can.\n\n  Those were the statements he made on the Senate floor. Frankly, I \nsaid many of the same things, because he was looking at the same \nintelligence I was, the majority of this body was looking at, and the \nexecutive branch was looking at when they made the distinction. We \ndecided to support the President to move forward. The intelligence was \noften flawed, but that was the intelligence we had at the time.\n  The report we have today was drafted entirely by the majority. The \nminority was entirely cut out of the process. Even with the majority-\nonly drafted report, the twisted statements of policymakers cherry-\npicks intelligence\n\n[[Page S5164]]\n\nand validates what we have been saying for years--that the intelligence \nwas flawed.\n  No. 2, the statements report excludes intelligence, including \ninstances in which the committee knew that policymakers' statements \nwere fact checked and approved by the IC. For example, the report does \nnot explain that the speech of Secretary of State Powell was not only \nchecked and rechecked by the IC, but that the first draft of the speech \nwas actually written by the CIA. This original draft included text that \nthe majority report claims was ``unsubstantiated.''\n  The report does not review any statements of Democrats.\n  The report distorts the words of policymakers to help make the \nmajority's case.\n  The majority didn't even seek to interview those whom they accuse of \nmaking unsubstantiated statements.\n  There is a second report, the Rome report, which was totally outside \nthe scope of the committee's authorization. The committee said we will \nlook at the Office of Special Plans and the PCTEG in the Defense \nDepartment, with reference to Iraq. The report they put out today has \nnothing to do with Iraq. It is about an Iranian talking about Iran. The \npeople whom they were talking to were not members of the Office of \nSpecial Plans or the PCTEG. It was not an intelligence operation. The \nUnited States had been contacted by somebody who wanted to speak to \nsomebody other than the CIA about information he had in Iran. It was \nfound not to be trustworthy or useful, and the National Security \nAdviser dismissed it and said it requires no further proceeding.\n  We wasted time, we wasted valuable effort, and we got nothing for it.\n  I regret to say this has injected partisan politics and does this \ncommittee and this body no useful purpose.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader is recognized.\n\n\n                   Unanimous Consent Request--S. 3036\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I notified the other side that I am \ngoing to propound a unanimous consent request to which I think they \nwill object. I didn't want to blindside them. I don't know who on the \nother side is available.\n  I see both leaders here. Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenate resume consideration of S. 3036, the Lieberman-Warner climate \nchange bill; that the motion to commit be withdrawn and the pending \namendment be temporarily set aside so that I may offer an amendment \nrelated to gas prices.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I think it is \npretty clear what the picture is here. After trying everything that we \ncould to have a regular debate on this bill, we were turned away at \nevery point.\n  My memory goes back to yesterday, with the unusual, untoward request \nand objection that we not be allowed to waive the reading of almost a \n500-page amendment. So we spent all day yesterday doing that. I think \nif my friend is interested in doing something about gas prices, that \nopportunity will come quickly, because we are going to have to vote \nTuesday morning on gas prices. It is a very direct, concise debate on \ngas prices. I hope we will get support from the Republicans on that \nissue.\n  It would seem to me, if they are interested in doing something about \ngas prices, they would vote cloture on that. If they wish to offer \namendments, that is the fine. But with all due respect to my friend, \nwho objected to even committees meeting today--committees meeting \ntoday--in addition to having the amendment read----\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Parliamentary inquiry: Is this an objection or a \nspeech?\n  Mr. REID. It is both. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has reserved his right to object.\n  Mr. REID. And I object, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator wish for the regular order?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I believe I have the floor, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader does have the floor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I take no pleasure in cutting off my friend, the \nmajority leader. I have the floor, and I propounded a unanimous consent \nrequest to which he objects, which is, of course, his right.\n  Let me make some observations about the amendment I would have \noffered had I been permitted to.\n  My good friend, the majority leader, was complaining about the \nreading of the amendment yesterday. I remind him it did not take nearly \nas much of the Senate's time as his reading passages from his own book \nback in 2003, which took up to 9 hours of the Senate's time, that, too, \nto make a point about the way judicial confirmations were being \nhandled. So it is certainly not unprecedented for Members of the body--\nnot the majority leader, not myself--trying to make points with regard \nto the displeasure, if you will, in the handling of judicial \nappointments.\n  With regard to the amendment I would like to have offered, I ask \nunanimous consent to have printed in the Record the amendment so people \nwill know what I would have offered had I been allowed to.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       On page 161, between lines 6 and 7, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 530. ACTION UPON HIGHER GASOLINE PRICES CAUSED BY THIS \n                   ACT.\n\n       (a) Determination of Higher Gasoline Prices Caused by This \n     Act.--Not less than annually, the Secretary of Energy, in \n     consultation with the Secretary of Transportation and the \n     Administrator, shall determine whether implementation of this \n     Act has caused the average retail price of gasoline to \n     increase since the date of enactment of this Act.\n       (b) Administrator Action.--Notwithstanding any other \n     provision of this Act, upon a determination under subsection \n     (a) of higher gasoline prices caused by this Act, the \n     Administrator shall suspend such provisions of this Act as \n     the Administrator determines are necessary until \n     implementation of the provisions no longer causes a gasoline \n     price increase.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, obviously, I am disappointed that the \nmajority has objected to allowing this amendment to become pending. \nEarlier today, the assistant majority leader said we should be voting \non amendments. I actually couldn't agree more. In a week in which gas \nprices have climbed to an all-time high, the Democratic majority in the \nSenate is pushing legislation that would send them up, at the very \nleast, another 53 cents a gallon.\n  Since the majority took over Congress 17 months ago, gas prices have \ngone up $1.66 a gallon. Since the beginning of this year alone, gas \nprices have gone up nearly a dollar--82 cents. Today, AAA reported a \nnew record-high average gas price nationwide of $3.99 a gallon. All of \nthis is hurting families, workers, truckers, farmers--it is hurting \nliterally everyone. Yet the majority has nothing to say about it. It \nhas done nothing, actually worse than nothing. It has repeatedly \nblocked efforts to increase production of American energy at home, as \nrecently as last month, when 48 Democratic Senators voted against the \nAmerican Energy Production Act.\n  Now, at the beginning of the summer driving season, it offers a bill \nthat would send gas prices up another 53 cents a gallon, for goodness' \nsake. People in the Commonwealth of Kentucky are paying, on average, \n$3.92 a gallon this week. They want to know what in the world is going \non around here. I am telling them to take a look at what is going on \nhere this very week. I am asking the same question they are: Why on \nEarth are we considering a bill that would raise gas prices even \nhigher--even higher--than they already are?\n  Our friends on the other side have no serious plan for lowering gas \nprices. Indeed, they seem intent on raising them even higher, which is \nwhy I have tried offering this amendment as a sort of emergency brake \non the majority.\n  This amendment says that if the Boxer climate tax bill does, in \neffect, increase gas prices, its provisions shall be suspended.\n  Let me say that again. This amendment I had hoped to be able to offer \nand get pending and voted on simply says, in fact, if the Boxer climate \ntax bill does, in fact, increase gas prices, its provisions shall be \nsuspended. Turn them off and take a time out.\n  Earlier this week, the junior Senator from Connecticut said the Boxer \nbill would reduce gas prices. His contention runs counter to every \nanalysis of the bill of which I am aware. But if he is right--if he is \nright--if the Boxer climate tax bill actually reduces gas\n\n[[Page S5165]]\n\nprices, then there is no reason not to support my amendment because my \namendment would not go into effect--if, in fact, the underlying bill is \ngoing to reduce gas prices.\n  If the Senator from Connecticut is right, then my amendment would not \nhave any effect on the cap-and-trade system outlined in this bill \nbecause, of course, gas prices would not be increased by the operation \nof the bill. If he is wrong, my amendment will protect those who are \nsuffering today from the high price of gasoline.\n  We should have an opportunity to ask Senators where they stand. Do \nthey believe, as I do, that gas prices are high enough already or do \nthey believe, as the sponsors of this bill do, that gas prices should \nrise even higher? What are they afraid of? Let's have votes on these \namendments. This is the kind of bill, as I have said repeatedly, \nnormally in the Senate would have been on the floor for weeks. This is \na big, complicated bill, described by my friend and colleague, the \nmajority leader, as the most important matter for the planet. I think \nwe would all agree that is a big deal.\n  If this issue is the most important issue confronting the planet, \nthen it is worth more than a few days. If we spent 5 weeks and \nconsidered 180 amendments and processed 130 of them on the clean air \nbill in 1990, this bill is certainly worth a multiweek, multifaceted \ndebate and consideration of amendments without preclearance on both \nsides.\n  What has evolved in the course of the last year and a half is the \nonly way you get to offer an amendment around here is if the other side \nagrees to let you. The majority leader and I have been around the \nSenate long enough to remember when that was not the way you operated \non major bills. We were both here in 1990, when Senator Mitchell was \nthe majority leader. The Democrats controlled the House, controlled the \nSenate, and there was a Republican in the White House. We were trying \nto do a clean air bill. We spent 5 weeks on it, considered 180 \namendments, passed 130 of them. Nobody was asking permission to offer \nan amendment. It was a freewheeling, wide-ranging, wide-open debate on \nan important issue at that time.\n  This strikes me as very similar in nature to that, and I don't know \nwhy we are afraid to spend time on this bill, why we are afraid to have \namendments on it. My goodness, filling the tree, filing cloture--it \nstrikes me my good friend, the majority leader, doesn't want anybody to \nvote on any of the amendments. We wish to go through a kind of 1-week, \ncheck-the-box exercise and move on. If this is, indeed, the most \nimportant issue confronting the planet, why are we not spending time on \nit?\n  So I would have liked to have had a chance to vote on that amendment. \nIt strikes me that if the position of the majority is this bill will \nnot raise gas prices, there would be no particular reason not to adopt \nit because, at the end of the day, it wouldn't become operative unless \ngas prices went up. GAO thinks gas prices will go up 53 cents a gallon. \nI hope this bill doesn't pass, but if it does, I hope they are wrong \nand that the Senator from California is right. In any event, as a good \nhedge against further raising gas prices on American consumers, it \nstruck me that the McConnell amendment would be a good way to go.\n  I regret it will not be possible to offer that amendment. It would \nhave been good for the Senate to have considered and to have voted on \nthis amendment. But apparently that will not be the case today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, look at this picture: My friend is \ncomplaining about judges. They did this yesterday because of judges. I \ngave a speech 7, 8 years ago that lasted 9 hours, so they can now say \nthat is fine, these many years later, we are going to force them to \nread a bill.\n  Keep in mind, all you people who are watching, we have the lowest \nrate in decades, some 30 years, of vacancies in the Federal judiciary. \nIs it an emergency? Of course not. These lifetime appointments make far \nmore money than the average American.\n  This judges issue they put into this global warming debate is a \ndiversion. President Bush doesn't acknowledge global warming exists, so \nit is obvious he is not concerned about global warming.\n  I so admire a few valiant souls, led by Senator Warner, on the other \nside who do believe it is a critical issue. I appreciate their \nvigilance and their courage for coming forward and supporting us in \ntrying to do something about global warming.\n  My friend, the Republican leader, is talking about gas prices having \ngone up while we have been in control of the Senate for less than 18 \nmonths. The President of the United States has been in power for 7\\1/2\\ \nyears. Gas prices have gone up 250 percent. Gas prices, since the first \nof the year, have gone up 82 cents.\n  This whole argument objecting to committees meeting--when the \nRepublicans were in power, there was not much going on with the \ncommittees, no oversight. We are having a little oversight. Maybe that \nis why they don't want us to do the committee hearings.\n  This whole issue dealing with global warming--we have a memo of \ntheirs saying they are going to play political games--the whole issue \nrelating to this reminds me of the old-time story where a person kills \nhis parents and then seeks the mercy of the court because he is an \norphan. That is what they are doing.\n  This argument is so transparent. After not having allowed us to do \nanything on this bill, they suddenly walk out here and say: We have \nsomething we would like to amend.\n  We have tried. We have tried. We have a cloture vote set on this \nissue. We are going to do it in the morning, to allow us to go forward \nand debate some amendments. We will see what happens on that vote.\n  The American people understand what the Republican minority has done \nto the Senate and to our country. It has even spilled over into the \nHouse of Representatives in three special elections. The former Speaker \nof the House of Representatives, the man Speaker Pelosi replaced, in a \nheavily Republican district in the State of Illinois, that district \nwent Democratic. Why? Because of this going on.\n  In Louisiana, a House seat that had been Republican for many years, \nthe Democrats won that seat in a special election. In Mississippi, they \nappointed a Senator to take Senator Lott's spot. There was a vacancy. A \nDemocrat won that. It is going to continue. The American people see \nthis picture.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, with respect to the judges issue--we \nare getting things kind of mixed in together--with respect to the \njudges issue, it was viewed with incredulity the suggestion that \nsomehow reading the amendment yesterday was without precedent. My good \nfriend clearly remembers his reading his own book on the floor of the \nSenate. According to Senate records, it was nearly 9 straight hours, \nlonger than it took to read the amendment yesterday. Interestingly \nenough, it had nothing to do with judges. At least reading the \namendment yesterday was a way to learn about the Boxer substitute, \nsince we had gotten it about 15 minutes before it was offered.\n  The fundamental issue on judges is keeping your word around here. \nLet's not obscure the point. The fundamental issue about judges is, Are \nyou going to keep your word?\n  At the beginning of this Congress, the majority leader and I agreed \nwe would achieve, working together, the average number of circuit \njudges of each of the last three Presidents, each of whom, to their \nregret, ended their terms with the opposition party in the majority. It \nwas not contingent on vacancy rate. There was no discussion of vacancy \nrate. It didn't have anything to do with anything other than a \nnumerical measurement of success.\n\n  When it became clear several months ago that there was no serious \neffort being made to keep that commitment, we had a conflict here on \nthe floor about another bill. In connection with settling that dispute, \nthe majority leader committed to me that we would do three circuit \njudges before Memorial Day toward the goal he and I had agreed on \nearlier. We did one. We did one.\n\n[[Page S5166]]\n\n  The only way this institution can function is that when we give our \nword, we ought to keep it.\n  Now, on a separate track, last night, in connection with a \nnominations package, the commitment was made to do three district court \njudges within the next week who are on the calendar right now and have \nbeen on the calendar since late April.\n  So now we have two commitments extant here. We have the commitment at \nthe beginning--well, three actually: the commitment at the beginning of \nthe Congress to reach the average for each of the last three \nPresidents, which would have been 17; then we had the commitment to do \nthree prior to Memorial Day, only one of which was done; and now last \nnight, in conjunction with a nominations package, we had a commitment \nto confirm three district court judges who have been on the calendar \nhere in the Senate since late April. And these are typically not even \ncontroversial. The chair of the Judiciary Committee was on the floor at \nthe time. So we will see if that commitment is to be kept.\n  So that is what this is about, Mr. President. It is about keeping \nyour word here in the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I understand that the order gave a period \nfrom 2 to 3 to the Senator from Virginia, the Senator from California, \nand the Senator from Connecticut. Am I correct on that?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. Recognizing that our leadership had important matters to \nbring to the attention of the body and that 15 minutes of that time was \nconsumed in that series of important messages, I ask unanimous consent \nnow that the entire calendar of scheduled speeches and so forth be \nmoved ahead 15 minutes to restore our time and thereby extend time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Presiding Officer, and I thank my colleagues.\n  Mr. President, I wish once again to express my appreciation to the \nchairman, Chairman Boxer, and my colleague, Senator Lieberman, in the \nlong voyage we have had. Senator Lieberman and I have been working on \nthis for nearly a year, the climate change bill and the security bill, \nas we call it, and then our chairman eventually joined and the \ncommittee acted and the rest is history.\n  I look upon this as being a very substantial contribution to this \ncontinuing debate on this very perplexing but essential subject to be \ncontinuously watched here in the United States of America, and the next \nCongress will take it up, and I think we will have laid a foundation \nfor the future work of the next President and the next Congress--an \nimportant foundation. I wish we would have had more debate, but I will \nnot get into the politics of what happened. It is clear to all. But I \nwill say that in the brief period we were on the bill, for example, I \ndid not hear any really substantial debate contesting the fundamental \nquestion: Is there adequate science to support--to support--the action \nby the Congress of the United States and then hopefully the President \nof the United States to address this issue? That seems to me to be put \naside now.\n  I think we can deduce from this limited debate we have had that each \nand every Member of this Chamber is genuinely concerned to some degree \nabout the effects of the erratic changes in our climate, in our \nweather, with the droughts and the floods, the tornadoes, and these \nother unexplainable variations in the historical--I repeat, the \nhistorical--benchmarks of these weather occurrences. So we are moving \nforward, and that was a very important building stone.\n  This morning, the chairman and the Senator from Connecticut and, \nindeed, the Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. Kerry--the four of us \njoined to introduce two very fine, distinguished, retired four star \nofficers--one a general and one an admiral. They are a part of a team \nof 11 members.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe names of all the members of the Military Advisory Board to the \nCenter for Naval Analysis, a national and internationally recognized \norganization which deals in a nonpolitical way on issues. They put \ntogether a very comprehensive report about the national security \nimplications from global climate change.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      The Military Advisory Board\n\n       General Gordon R. Sullivan, USA (Ret.), Former Chief of \n     Staff, U.S. Army; Chairman, Military Advisory Board.\n\n       Admiral Frank ``Skip'' Bowman, USN (Ret.), Former Director, \n     Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program; Former Deputy \n     Administrator-Naval Reactors, National Nuclear Security \n     Administration.\n       Lieutenant General Lawrence P. Farrell Jr., USAF (Ret.), \n     Former Deputy Chief of Staff for Plans and Programs, \n     Headquarters U.S. Air Force.\n       Vice Admiral Paul G. Gaffney II, USN (Ret.), Former \n     President, National Defense University; Former Chief of Naval \n     Research and Commander, Navy Meteorology and Oceanography \n     Command.\n       General Paul J.

Goodman, Executive Director, Military Advisory \n     Board, The CNA Corporation.\n\n\n                               Study Team\n\n       David M. Catarious Jr.\n       Ronald Filadelfo.\n       Henry Gaffney.\n       Sean Maybee.\n       Thomas Morehouse.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I will read first from the statement, and \nthen I will insert the full statement of General Sullivan in the \nRecord.\n  General Sullivan has had a 50-year career, in one way or another--on \nActive Duty or continuously working--with the U.S. Army. I have known \nhim a long time. I remember him coming to testify before the Senate \nArmed Services Committee many times in his capacity as the Chief of \nStaff of the Army. He stated as follows:\n\n       Having said this, I admit I came to the Advisory Board as a \n     skeptic and I'm not sure some of the others didn't as well. \n     After we listened to leaders of the scientific, business, and \n     governmental communities, both I and my colleagues came to \n     agree that global climate change is and will be a significant \n     threat to our national security. The potential destabilizing \n     impacts of global climate change include reduced access to \n     fresh water, impaired food production, health issues, \n     especially from vector and food-borne diseases, and land \n     loss, flooding and so forth, and the displacement of major \n     portions of populations. And overall, we view these phenomena \n     as related to failed states, growth of terrorism, mass \n     migrations, and greater regional and inter-regional \n     instability.\n\n  This is a totally pure, nonpolitical assessment of this problem.\n  How I wish we would have had the opportunity to have had further \ndebate, at which time we could have brought forth other testimony of \nmembers of this panel and addressed the security issues. Those were the \nissues that drew me, this humble Senator, to participate and to devote \nbasically a year of my career with my good friend from Connecticut, \nboth of us members of the Armed Services Committee. It is because of \nthe national security implications.\n  I would like to read a bit from the testimony of ADM Joe Lopez. Now, \nI have known Joe Lopez ever since he was a Navy captain, when I was the \nSecretary of the Navy. He has a remarkable career. He stated as \nfollows:\n\n       National security involves much more than just military \n     strength. National security is affected by political, \n     military, cultural, and economic elements. These elements \n     overlap, to one degree or another, and every major issue in \n     the international arena contains all of them. And climate \n     change has an impact on each of them. This will be \n     particularly more pronounced in the world's most volatile \n     regions, where environmental\n\n[[Page S5167]]\n\n     and natural resource challenges have added greatly to the \n     existing political, economic, and cultural tensions. These \n     instabilities that already exist will create a fertile ground \n     for extremism, and these instabilities are likely to be \n     exacerbated by global climate change.\n\n  Again, there is no politics in this. It is a clear statement from a \nman who has devoted over 40 years of his life to military service for \nour country, and there are nine others who participated in this panel.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe statements of General Sullivan and Admiral Lopez.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                            General Sullivan\n\n       My name is Gordon Sullivan. I have served America as a \n     soldier since 1955. My last duty position was as Army Chief \n     of Staff--1991 to 1995. I retired from active service in 1995 \n     and have been president of the Association of the United \n     States Army--Army's professional association--since 1998. \n     Thus, I have been in or involved with the Army for over 50 \n     years.\n       I am here as the chairman of the Military Advisory Board \n     for CNA. The Military Advisory Board consists of retired \n     three- and four-star flag officers from the Army, Navy, Air \n     Force, and Marines.\n       We were charged with looking at the emerging phenomenon \n     known as global climate change through the prism of our own \n     experience, and specifically looking at the national security \n     implications of global climate change.\n       Having said this, I must admit I came to the Advisory Board \n     as a skeptic and I am not sure some of the others didn't as \n     well.\n       After we listened to leaders of the scientific, business \n     and governmental communities, both I and my colleagues came \n     to agree that global climate change is and will be a \n     significant threat to our national security. The potential \n     destabilizing impacts of global climate change include \n     reduced access to fresh water, impaired food production, \n     health issues, especially from vector and food-borne \n     diseases, and land loss, flooding and so forth, and the \n     displacement of major populations. And overall, we view these \n     phenomena as related to failed states, growth of terrorism, \n     mass migrations, and greater regional and inter-regional \n     instability.\n       The findings of the board are:\n       First, projected climate change poses a serious threat to \n     America's national security. Potential national threats to \n     the Nation--potential threats to the Nation's security \n     require careful study and prudent planning.\n       Second, climate change acts as a threat multiplier for \n     instability in some of the most volatile regions of the \n     world.\n       Third, projected climate change will add to tensions even \n     in stable regions of the world.\n       Fourth, climate change, national security and energy \n     dependence are a related set of global challenges.\n       The recommendations of the board are, first, that we cannot \n     wait for certainty. In this issue, there maybe a lack of \n     certainty for some, but there is certainly no lack of \n     challenges. And in our view, failing to act because a warning \n     isn't precise would be imprudent.\n       Second, the United States should commit to a stronger \n     national and international role to help stabilize climate \n     changes at levels which will avoid significant disruption to \n     global stability and security, and third, we should commit to \n     global partnerships to work in that regard.\n       Climate change, national security, and energy dependence \n     are all inter-related. Simply hoping that these relationships \n     will remain static is simply not acceptable given our \n     training and experience as military leaders. I think hoping \n     that everything is going to be great probably won't work, at \n     least in our view.\n       I would say that most of us on the Military Advisory Board \n     were in the military service of the United States of America \n     for over 30 years, most of it during the Cold War. High \n     levels of catastrophe could have occurred if we didn't invest \n     in military preparedness and awareness of the threats we \n     faced.\n       In conclusion, you never have 100 percent certainty on the \n     battlefield. We never have it. If you wait until you have 100 \n     percent certainty, something terrible is going to happen. As \n     such, now is the time to act on the critical issue of climate \n     change.\n\n                             Admiral Lopez\n\n       My name is ADM Joe Lopez and my naval career has included \n     tours as commander-in-chief of U.S. Naval Forces Europe and \n     commander-in-chief, Allied Forces, Southern Europe from 1996 \n     to 1998. I commanded all U.S. and Allied Bosnia Peace Keeping \n     Forces in 1996; and served as deputy chief of naval \n     operations for resources, warfare requirements and \n     assessments in 1994 to 1996.\n       National security involves much more than just military \n     strength. National security is affected by political, \n     military, cultural and economic elements. These elements \n     overlap, to one degree or another, and every major issue in \n     the international arena contains all of them. And climate \n     change has an impact on each of them. This will be \n     particularly more pronounced in the world's most volatile \n     regions, where environmental and natural resource challenges \n     have added greatly to the existing political, economic and \n     cultural tensions. The instabilities that already exist will \n     create a fertile ground for extremism--and these \n     instabilities are likely to be exacerbated by global climate \n     change.\n       If you look at the Middle East, it has long been a tinder \n     box of conflict. The natural environment of this region is \n     dominated by two important natural resources--oil because of \n     its abundance, and water because of its scarcity. Climate \n     change has the potential to exacerbate tensions over water as \n     precipitation patterns decrease, projected to decline as much \n     60 percent in some areas. This suggests even more trouble in \n     a region of fragile governments and infrastructures and \n     historical animosities among countries and religious groups.\n       Another challenge of climate change is projected sea level \n     rise. Couple this threat with a predicted increase in violent \n     storms and the threat to coastal regions is real. Not only is \n     this a threat to homeland security as a response mechanism, \n     but some of our most critical infrastructure for trade, \n     energy and defense are located on our coasts. A more concrete \n     example of expected sea level rise affecting national \n     security and our strategic military installations can be \n     seen in low-lying islands, such as Diego Garcia, which is \n     a critical base of support for our Middle East operations. \n     Climate change is a ``threat multiplier.''\n       These are a few examples of how the expected effects of \n     climate change can lead to increased stress on populations \n     and increased strife among countries. We believe that climate \n     change, national security and energy dependence are a related \n     set of global challenges.\n       With my remaining time, I'd like to make three \n     observations:\n       The first is to highlight that link between climate change \n     and energy security. One can describe our current energy \n     supply as finite and foreign. Continued dependence on \n     overseas fossil fuel energy supplies, and our addiction to \n     them, cause a great loss of leverage in the international \n     arena. Ironically, a focus on climate change may actually \n     help us on this count. We should leverage technology and \n     extract and exploit our natural resources including coal to \n     make it safe and environmentally friendly. Nuclear power can \n     be exploited. The Navy has been safely doing this for years. \n     Key elements of the solution set for climate change are the \n     same ones we would use to gain energy security.\n       Second, this issues is great and the U.S. alone cannot \n     solve it. If we in our Nation do everything right--assuming \n     we know what is right--the hazards of global climate change \n     would not be solved. China and India are integral to the \n     global solution. We must engage them.\n       My third point: For military leaders, the first \n     responsibility is to fight and win. The highest and best form \n     of victory for one's nation involves meeting the objectives \n     without actually having to resort to conflict. It takes a \n     great deal of investment, planning, strategy, resources and \n     moral courage. But the prevention of conflict is the goal.\n       Finally, our security revolves around issues that are \n     political, economic, cultural and military in nature. We have \n     concluded that the potential effects of climate change \n     warrant serious national attention. As General Sullivan has \n     mentioned, national security and the threat of climate change \n     is real, and we can either pay for it now, or pay even more \n     for it later.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. So Mr. President, there again we have laid another \nbuilding block, bringing to the attention of the American people their \nown security here at home, their own armed services who are called upon \nto address these problems now and in the coming years.\n  Now, I have no basis and I will not state that the tragic weather \nchange that hit Burma and is taking tens upon tens of thousands of \nlives should be put in a category now of global climate change, but I \ndo point out that, at this very moment, we still have ships and \naircraft and men and women of the U.S. Armed Forces offshore ready to \nmove in with food and supplies and other things.\n  Our country, almost alone, is the one to which the world turns when \nthere is some sort of a crisis, and it is clear from the statements of \nthese two professionals that many of those crises can be generated by \nthese erratic climate changes.\n  Mr. President, I wish to yield the floor at this moment to my other \ncolleagues, but I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a \nseries of recognitions that the three of us want to state with regard \nto our staffs and to a number of organizations that have come forward, \nforemost among them the Pew Center--that was the one that provided us \nwith magnificent books on this--and many others across America that \ncame forward to participate in what we had hoped to be very extensive \ndebate on this issue. Nevertheless, they have laid the foundation, and \nthey will continue to lay a foundation upon which to build and build, \nuntil we finally come to grips with a framework of the solutions as to \nhow this Nation is going to lead and deal\n\n[[Page S5168]]\n\nwith the inevitable consequences of these climate changes.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Mr. President, my colleagues and I would not be here today \n     were it not for the incredible input and support from other \n     distinguished colleagues in the Senate, as well as a great \n     deal of organizations and companies that helped shape our \n     bill.\n       First, I would like to thank our esteemed cosponsors of the \n     Climate Security Act: Senators Dole, Coleman, Collins, Casey, \n     Bill Nelson, Cardin, Klobuchar, and Harkin. Their critical \n     input made the bill what it was.\n       I would like to thank all the members of the Environment \n     and Public Works Committee, but in particular, Senators \n     Baucus, Carper, Lautenberg, Barrasso and Isakson. Without \n     their help at critical junctures of the legislative process, \n     we would not have moved our bill to this point.\n       I would be remiss if I did not recognize my dear friends, \n     Senators Bingaman and Specter, whose bill we borrowed heavily \n     from and who highlighted such important issues as cost \n     containment and international competitiveness.\n       I thank our friends from the Northeast, Senators Kerry and \n     Snowe, who had their own bill that informed our process and \n     who adopted the substitute like it was their own, not only \n     cosponsoring the amendment, but drumming up support every \n     step of the way.\n       I thank my dear friend, Senator Alexander. While he doesn't \n     support our bill, he has contributed eloquently to the \n     debate.\n       Before I joined my partner Senator Lieberman, he had a \n     different partner. I must thank Senator McCain, who has been \n     a pioneer on this issue of global climate change.\n       This effort would not have been possible without my partner \n     and dear friend, Senator Joe Lieberman, and his fine staff, \n     in particular: David McIntosh, Joe Goffman, and Alex Barron. \n     I must thank Rayanne Bostick, who along with Anna Reilly of \n     my staff, helped coordinate so many meetings between myself \n     and the Senator from Connecticut.\n       I must thank our fearless chairman, Senator Boxer and her \n     staff: Bettina Poirier, Erik Olson, Eric Thu.\n       I thank the members of my own staff who worked tirelessly \n     on this bill: Carter Cornick, Chris Yianilos, Chelsea \n     Maxwell, John Frierson, Shari Gruenwald, Sandra Luff, Tack \n     Richardson, Mary Holloway, Hughes Bates, Bronwyn Lance \n     Chester, and Jonathan Murphy.\n       There were also a number of organizations and companies \n     whose input was invaluable to our work. The U.S. Climate \n     Action Partnership members were critical to our efforts. In \n     particular, I highlight: Alcoa, the Pew Center on Global \n     Climate Change, Exelon Corporation, Florida Power and Light, \n     General Electric, the National Wildlife Federation, NRG \n     Energy, BP America, DuPont, PG, and the Environmental \n     Defense Fund.\n       In addition, we received valuable advice from the Nicholas \n     Institute at Duke University and the National Commission on \n     Energy Policy.\n       If you were one of the numerous witnesses at one of our \n     full committee or subcommittee hearings, whatever your \n     perspective was, you informed the debate, and I thank you.\n       Mr. President, the problem with naming those who have \n     helped is that you inadvertently leave someone out. I am \n     eternally grateful for all the input we received.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I wish to thank my friend and colleague \nfrom Virginia, Senator Warner. He is an extraordinary man and a great \nSenator, and we are going to miss him. I wish I could convince him to \nrun again, but I think it is a little late, probably past the filing \ndates. But he has been an extraordinary leader in so many ways, \nparticularly on matters of national security.\n  We first worked together when we cosponsored the resolution \nauthorizing President Bush 41 to go into the gulf war in 1991. We \nserved together on the Armed Services Committee. I have never met a \nmore patriotic American, a more honorable man, and it meant everything \nto this whole effort when Senator Warner decided he wanted to be part \nof the solution to the climate change problem.\n  I often tease him--but it shows the strength of this man--that on the \ntwo times Senator McCain and I introduced an amendment on the floor to \ndo something about global warming, Senator Warner voted against it. And \nI was with him one day when somebody in the media said: Why did you \nchange your mind? And he said: Two words--science, grandchildren. That \nsays it all about this great man.\n  I appreciate what he has just said. Nothing has driven John Warner's \ncareer in the Senate and his service to America over decades more than \nhis commitment to protect our national security. And maybe I should add \na third word--science, grandchildren, national security--four words--\nbecause it is his understanding that climate change, if we don't do \nsomething about it, is going to compromise and threaten the national \nsecurity of the American people.\n  This conference we did this morning with General Sullivan and Admiral \nLopez I thought was stunning and stirring. These are two people who \nserved their country in uniform for decades. There was not a lot of \nrhetoric there, just stating the facts. One of them said--I forget \nwhich one; it might have been Admiral Lopez--``The best thing you can \ndo if you are a military person is to prevent conflict, prevent war.'' \nThey see this legislation as a way to do that.\n  I hope my colleagues consider that. There is so much on the line, \nwith so much work that has been done by so many people. I am not just \ntalking about Senator Warner and myself and Chairman Boxer, who made \nall the difference in her leadership. Our staffs, so many people \noutside the Senate--environmentalists, business leaders, labor leaders, \nhunters, anglers, leaders in the faith community--representing the \npublic will of the American people, asking us to do something to \nprotect them from global warming and its worst consequences.\n  The bill we brought forth, the Climate Security Act, none of us will \nsay it is perfect. Of course, it is not. I don't ever remember voting \nfor a perfect piece of legislation. But it is very good. It creates a \nframework, a structure that will allow our country to begin a decades-\nlong effort. This will go decades and decades to solve this problem. \nFuture Congresses will come back and fix this where it didn't quite \nwork out the way we hoped. We have a lot of mechanisms in here, which \nwe have described earlier, to create fail-safes to protect our economy, \nour environment, our national security.\n  With all that on the line, I have to say it is disappointing and \nfrustrating that parliamentary maneuvers and concerns about something \ntotally irrelevant to this once-in-a-career, once-in-a-lifetime \nopportunity to do something to deal with this extraordinary challenge \nfor our future--that those kinds of irrelevant issues are standing in \nthe way, potentially, of a full debate on this matter.\n  Tomorrow morning we come to a real turn in the road. I think the \nquestion is not whether you think this is a perfect bill but whether \nyou think it is a real good-faith effort to deal with the problem of \nclimate change and whether you want to say, by your vote, that you \nbelieve climate change is a real problem and a real threat to our \nfuture and you want to be part of a solution to the problem.\n  Some of my colleagues have said to me today, I wish to be part of the \nsolution to the problem, but I am now blocked from offering amendments. \nI always said I would vote for the bill if certain amendments were \nadopted.\n  That is not literally true. The fact is, as is the regular order in \nthe Senate, if you filed your amendment, as everybody was duly \nnotified, by 1 p.m. today, and cloture is granted tomorrow, that \namendment will be fully debated next week and in the days ahead.\n  But this is a moment to say the Senate is prepared, if not this year \nthen soon, to deal with this very real threat to our environment, our \neconomy, and our national security.\n  What is the rush, some people may say. Let me quote first from a \nstudy by the Environmental Defense Fund that has found that each 2-year \ndelay in starting emissions reductions doubles the annual rate at which \nwe will need to reduce emissions by 2020 in order to ward off a global \ncatastrophe. Because of the way the climate responds to the buildup of \ngreenhouse gases, these gases stay trapped in the atmosphere. That is \nthe whole problem. Then the heat from the Earth, as it bounces up, \ncannot go anywhere and it stays there and you have the greenhouse \neffect that is clearly warming the planet.\n  The truth is, our children and our grandchildren are already going to \nface, inevitably, consequences of global warming. What we are talking \nabout now is beginning to reduce the greenhouse gases, the carbon \npollution that\n\n[[Page S5169]]\n\ncauses the globe to warm, so the consequences that we, our children, \nour grandchildren and succeeding generations of Americans and people \nall over the world face are not disastrous or catastrophic, because \nthat is totally within the realm of the possible. Many scientists say \nit is not only possible, it is probable, if we do not do anything soon. \nSo the longer we wait to start reducing this carbon pollution that is \ntrapped up there, the more sharply we will need to reduce them in order \nto stay within our emissions budget, you might say.\n  Let me add, we have received an analysis from an economic modeling \nfirm called On Location. They used the model of the Energy Information \nAdministration of the Department of Energy of the Bush administration \non our Climate Security Act. Their analysis asks one simple question: \nWhat would happen if we wait 10 years to enact the exact same policies \nthat are involved in the Climate Security Act, the exact same bill, to \nachieve the same cumulative emissions reductions scientists say are \nrequired to protect the climate? The results are striking, unsettling, \nand I hope motivating for quick action.\n  Here is what this economic modeling firm found: That waiting 10 years \nto start on emissions reductions increases the cost of emissions \nallowances by 15 percent. Listen to this: It doubles the overall cost \nof global warming to our economy.\n  Whatever my colleagues are trying to say about the cost of this \ninnovation-driving, market-based entrepreneurial incentive policy, are \nthey prepared to double that number through delay? Are they prepared to \nsaddle the American economy and our progeny with the burden of \nincreasingly severe and essentially irreversible climate impacts?\n  Finally, I wish to draw the attention of my colleagues to this graph, \nthis chart, this description of what is happening. In previous debates, \nwe have referred to the summer Arctic ice, the polar icecap. When we \nstarted in our interest in whether there was global warming and what \nits consequences might be and whether we should do something about it, \nthat was in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Then-Senator Al Gore, I \nthink, held some of the first hearings on this subject in 1988. Senator \nKerry was involved at the time and shortly thereafter. We had to use \ncomputer models of projections the way the weather was going to go to \nsee what was happening and what might happen if we allowed the globe to \nwarm. But we now have technology, satellite pictures, and real evidence \nto show us what impact global warming is having. It is not a theory \nanymore, it is not a computer model anymore.\n  In earlier debates, these satellite pictures--this is from 2001--were \nused. Here is the North Pole at the green spot. The red line on the \noutside is where the polar icecap was in 1979. The white here is where \nthe polar icecap was in satellite pictures taken in 2003. It is 20 \npercent less than it was in 1979--20 percent of the polar icecaps in \n2003 had already melted away.\n  If that doesn't begin to stir your concerns enough about what is \nhappening, go over here to the 2007 satellite picture. Again, the \nexterior red line is where the polar icecaps were in 1979. Look at \nthis. In 5--well, 4 years but let's say 5 because there are parts of \nthose 2 years--in 5 years, the polar icecap has melted away to the \npoint where it is 40 percent less now than what it was in 1979. In \n2003, it had lost 20 percent; in 2007, it has lost 40 percent.\n  I asked the scientific fellow in my office, Alex Barron--I wish to \ngive him credit. I said: So this is now raising the sea levels? He said \nno. He taught me a lesson. I was one of those who at college took a \ncourse called Science for Nonscience Majors, so I am still learning.\n  He said: No, the ice melts as if it was ice in a glass--it sits as if \nit was ice in a glass. It has air in it, and when it ultimately melts, \nbecause the water is warming, the total amount of water will be about \nthe same because this ice is all in the water, the polar icecap is in \nthe water.\n  But here are two things. One is, the fact that the icecap is melting \nobviously shows something is happening there, that the warmth is \ncausing it to melt. But here is the danger. Here is Greenland. There \nthe ice is on land, it is not in the water. I have now been taught, \nwhen the polar icecap diminishes by 40 percent, the capacity of the \nice--just like wearing a white shirt--to reflect the sunlight and \nreduce the impact on the temperature diminishes. In other words, the \nwater warms and warms the entire environment and the real danger there \nis that the ice on land, in Greenland, will begin to melt. When that \nbegins to melt--which the scientists tell us will surely happen unless \nwe reduce the amount of carbon pollution we are putting into the \natmosphere--then we are in real danger because then sea levels will \nbegin to rise--some scientists say with a suddenness that will create \ncatastrophic results. I do not know that. But I can tell you some \ncredible scientists have told us that.\n\n  While the Senate fiddles, the globe warms. We can have these silly \nparliamentary debates, and we can get into side partisan fights about \nnominations, but this process is going on and getting worse, with \npotentially catastrophic consequences for the United States of America \nand particularly, of course, as Greenland would melt, to the enormous \ncoastal regions of our country.\n  There has been a pattern of human behavior in America over the last \ncentury. People are moving to the coasts. It is where they want to be. \nThey and their lifestyles are going to be threatened in the most \nconsequential way unless we do something about that.\n  We have come a long way in this year. I am not ready to give up about \nthe cloture vote tomorrow, but I understand the realities and I urge my \ncolleagues, as they consider how to vote on it, to see this as your \nopportunity to say--not whether this Climate Security Act is a perfect \nbill but whether you, No. 1, accept the reality of global warming; No. \n2, want to do something about it and believe that a cap-and-trade \nsystem--nobody has come out in this debate and offered any other way to \ndo it. As a matter of fact, a lot of our most severe critics have said \ncap and trade is actually the way to do it, but they don't like this \npart of the way we have done it or that part of the way we have done \nit. We welcome that debate. But this is a moment to say whether you \nwant to do something to stop this clear and present danger to the \nsecurity of the American people or whether you want to continue to \nfiddle while the globe burns.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska). The Senator from \nCalifornia.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, how much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 34 minutes remaining.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I would like to speak for about 20 minutes, and then I \nwould like to yield up to 10 minutes to Senator Salazar.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Colleagues, let me tell you where we are. Your \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee, for the first time, voted out a \nlandmark bill, the Lieberman-Warner bill. We did that after 25 \nhearings. We had everyone come before us. It was extraordinary. From \nthe leading scientists, to State government officials, to mayors, to \nbusiness leaders, to folks who run utilities, to religious leaders, it \nwas extraordinary--environmental organizations.\n  We listened and we asked questions and we voted. Now, the day that \nSenator Warner decided he believed part of his legacy on national \nsecurity had to include global warming, he stepped out and he came to \nme, after he had already talked to Senator Lieberman, and said: I want \nto be on this team. He said: I will be with you through thick and thin.\n  We have had thick and we have had thin. We have had great moments and \ntough moments. And we are kind of in a tough moment now because we so \nwant to complete work on this bill. It is going to be a very tough road \nfor us to be able to do that.\n  I went over to my friend, Senator Warner, and I told him, first of \nall, what a joy it has been to work with him on this because our lives \nin the Senate have kind of taken us in different directions. But now, \nwe finally had a chance to work together. You could not have a better \ncolleague. You could not have a more loyal friend.\n\n[[Page S5170]]\n\nWhen he says something, he sticks with it.\n  We have created this troika, a tripartisan troika, which I think has \nbeen a very good experience for all of us. I told him, because he has \nseveral months remaining in the Senate, that when he leaves, I hope he \nwill become a worldwide spokesperson for action in this area.\n  There are very few people who bring to the table the national \nsecurity experience and his new knowledge now that he has absorbed on \nthis issue of global warming or climate change. I do not know if he \nwill do that, but if he does it, I think it is going to make an \nenormous contribution as Senator Lieberman and I are here battling \nevery day with a new President of the United States to try to get \nsomething done. So I hope he will consider that.\n  So many people did help us. Senator Warner alluded to our staffs. I \nwant to name a few names now. This is just a few of the people: Bettina \nand Erik of my staff, David and Joe of Senator Lieberman's staff, and \nChelsea and Chris of Senator Warner's staff, and their staffs that \nreport to them.\n  There was extraordinary dedication, sleeplessness, early morning \nphone calls. To get to this point is so difficult. And not one second \nhas been wasted because as we get this landmark bill in place, we will \ntake off where we left, and where we left is just a tremendous amount \nof knowledge, so many of our Senators getting involved. It has really \nbeen a heart-warming experience.\n  That is why it is tough to get to the point where we are now because \nwe are ready, ready to finish this job, ready to work with our friends. \nBut we are going to try to see how many votes we can get for cloture. \nWe urge our friends and colleagues to please say yes to continuing this \nimportant topic.\n  Senator Lieberman, I think by showing these maps and showing us the \nice melt--by the way, many members of our committee, we led a trip to \nGreenland. Imagine. I say to my friends who might be listening to this, \nimagine this. An iceberg that is larger than the Senate Chamber, \nfloating, floating toward the ocean. The average age of this iceberg, \n9,000 years old. Imagine this. Average age, 9,000 years old. Within 1 \nyear, that iceberg will be nothing but water. And we know what that \nmeans. Seas will rise. It is happening faster than we thought.\n  When we have this debate, our opponents come down, and they do not \ntalk about climate change. They do not talk about it. They haven't \nchallenged us on our basic premise that we have a problem. They switch \nthe topic to what I think is a made-up topic. And it is sad because the \nSenate deserves more than that.\n  I don't know how many times I have said it, but I have to say it \nagain because there is a big advertising campaign against what is \ncalled the Lieberman-Warner bill. I suppose I am lucky they did not put \nBoxer in that one. They have said gas prices, because of this bill, are \ngoing to go to $8 a gallon, and this morning, $28 a gallon. These \npeople are making things up. These people are making things up. Even \nthe Bush administration, who opposes us, said the worst case scenario \nis 2 cents a year on the pump for 20 years.\n  We know because we have done the calculations that the fuel economy \nbill we passed will offset that increase. So this bill brings no \nincrease. Indeed, this bill will get us off foreign oil, will get us \naway from big oil. We will have alternatives for once, and we will be \nfree.\n  We will not have to have our President go to Saudi Arabia and hold \nhands with the Prince and beg. This is not necessary if we allow \ntechnology to move forward. So I am going to show you again. This is \nannoying that I have to keep doing this, but I think it is important.\n  In the last 7 years, we have seen gas prices go up 250 percent, 82 \ncents since January--82 cents.\n  My friends are coming down here, and suddenly the opponents of the \nbill are saying: Watch out, gas prices will rise. When truly, honestly, \nthey have not offered anything, in my view, to try and resolve the \nterrible increases we have seen until now. So let's get rid of that \nbogus issue.\n  We are on the precipice. We are on the moment. If we do this bill, we \nwill finally have alternatives to oil, and we will get off our \naddiction to oil, as the President said we should. We will have \ncellulosic fuel. We will be able to see new kinds of automobiles. We \nare really there right now. Senator Sanders was eloquent today. There \nis a plug-in hybrid that can get 150 miles to the gallon. That is all \ngoing to happen with a bill like this one. I want to thank also the \ngroups that have worked so hard to help us, the environmental groups, \nthe faith-based groups.\n  I thank right now GEN Gordon Sullivan who came to the press \nconference that both my colleagues alluded to this morning. I have a \ncopy of his statement. Did you place it in the Record, Senator?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I have placed into the Record the \nstatement of General Sullivan and Admiral Lopez.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I would think that General Sullivan's credentials are \nimpeccable. He said: Yes, climate change and national security and \nenergy independence are all interrelated. Simply hoping that these \nrelationships will remain static is not acceptable, given our training \nand experience as military leaders.\n  And then he says: Because, as you know, we have been told that the \nscientists have 90 percent certainty. He addresses that at the end.\n  He says:\n\n       In conclusion, you never have 100 percent certainty on the \n     battlefield. We never have it. If you wait until you have 100 \n     percent certainty, something terrible is going to happen. As \n     such, now is the time to act on the critical issue of climate \n     change.\n\n  Now this did not come from Senator Warner, Senator Lieberman, Senator \nBoxer; it did not come from Al Gore; it did not come from Tony Blair--\nall of whom are fighting hard. This came from a general with years of \nexperience on the battlefield.\n  We must act now. I think I would like to go to this chart. Waiting 2 \nyears to act will double the annual rate at which we must cut \nemissions. In other words, you have a problem, and the longer you wait, \nthe harder it is because the carbon goes into the atmosphere and stays \nthere.\n  So we get further and further behind. Look at this. A May 2008 study \nby Tufts University economists found that the annual costs of not \naddressing global warming, not addressing it, by 2100, could be $422 \nbillion in hurricane damage, $360 billion in real estate losses, $141 \nbillion in increased energy costs.\n\n  Let me say that again: $141 billion in increased energy costs if we \ndo not do something about it; $950 billion in water costs.\n  So if we do not act now, it is going to cost us. And we have to \ndevise a way, through cap and trade, which I will not go into the \ndetails of, that essentially says: Those who are the biggest emitters \nwill pay for permits to pollute.\n  What do we do with those funds? I have a chart to show you what we \nwill do with those funds. Most of it goes to the following: tax relief. \nIn the early years, we are concerned that we may see energy, \nelectricity costs go up before we get into the energy efficiency we \nwant.\n  The next big amount is consumer relief through utilities and State \nactions. That is second. So when our utility bills start going up, \nutility companies have the right to write on that bill ``credit'' so we \nstay whole.\n  Deficit reduction, that is another big piece. We wanted it to be \ndeficit neutral. I have to laugh--I think it was Senator Kyl and \nSenator McConnell who said this is a tax bill. Let me get this squared \naway. Our bill is a huge tax cut, huge consumer relief, not a penny of \na tax increase.\n  What else do we do? Workers assistance. We make sure our workers are \ntrained for new jobs. Local government action, they are going to do \nsomething. For example, if they are going to take their offices and \nmake them energy efficient, we want to help them.\n  Low-carbon technology and efficiency, we know what that means. We \nknow the low-carbon energy sources are going to get funds.\n  Agricultural resources and forestry are going to get funds. National \nsecurity and international are going to get funds. Transition \nassistance to emitters. In other words, we say to those who pollute, \nthose who emit: You are going to have to buy permits. But in the \nbeginning, we help them with that.\n  So, look, about more than half of this goes straight back to the \nconsumers\n\n[[Page S5171]]\n\nand the other parts go to technology. That is what this bill does.\n  Why are the opponents of this bill afraid to have a debate? I do not \nunderstand it. At first we heard they wanted the debate because they \nbelieved they could defeat us if they talked about how this bill would \nresult in higher gas prices.\n  Frankly, between Senator Warner, Senator Lieberman, Senator Snowe, \nmyself, Senator Kerry, the Senators who have been on the floor, I think \nwe definitely debunked that point. We said it is a humpty-dumpty \nargument. We are right on the precipice of getting off of foreign oil \nand big oil. We are on the precipice of these new technologies with \nthis bill.\n  We are on the precipice of moving toward energy independence finally. \nWe have been talking about it since I was a much younger person, and \nnow, finally, we can do it. And what happens. We have to cut the debate \nshort when we are ready to get the job done.\n  Well, this is a national security issue. It is a religious and moral \nissue. This is an issue of tremendous import for our grandchildren, for \nour children. This issue strikes me as one that is a win-win for \neveryone because when you address global warming and you save the \nplanet, which is what we must do, we finally have the impetus to get to \nthat energy independence. We finally have the impetus to say, you know, \nwe can be controlling, we can be controlling of our own future. It is a \ngreat picture for our children to see.\n  I honestly think if we do nothing, we will be on the wrong side of \nhistory. I want to say to my friends in State government, from the east \ncoast to the west coast to the middle of America, keep up what you are \ndoing. You are doing the right thing. You can't wait for us. It may not \nhappen today, but we are catching up with you.\n\n  I say to my friends at the Conference of Mayors, Republicans and \nDemocrats and Independents who support this bill: Thank you for your \nsupport. Keep on doing what you are doing. You are in the leadership. \nYou are on the ground. We are coming soon. We have two Presidential \ncandidates who care about this issue. When one of them gets to the \nWhite House, they will be here negotiating with us. That is going to \nmake a big difference, that is for sure.\n  I want to close by showing a great chart that says ``Yes.'' This is \nthe moment for us to say yes to energy independence, yes to our \nchildren, yes to the science, yes to a diversified energy future, yes \nto American manufacturing, yes to saving the planet, yes to consumer \nprotection, yes to new technologies, yes to a strong economy, yes to \nState and local action, yes to public health, yes to tax relief, yes to \ntransit, yes to a level playing field, and yes to American leadership--\nthere are a lot of yeses on here--and, of course, yes on the cloture \npetition which will allow us to get to the substitute and get to the \nbill.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time and turn now to Senator Salazar. I \nthank my colleagues all.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Klobuchar). The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Madam President, let me acknowledge the great work of \nChairman Boxer and my good friends and colleagues, Senators Warner and \nLieberman. They were two members of the Gang of 14 who brought the \nSenate back from the brink of disaster, now almost 2 years ago. I \nadmire them as good friends and as people who have helped lead us out \nof difficult times. Senator Boxer from California is unequaled in terms \nof her passion for our planet and environment. I appreciate the \nthoughtfulness, the bipartisan approach they have taken to deal with \nwhat is truly one of the central issues of our time.\n  I want to spend a few minutes, as we come to the end of our debate on \nglobal warming, to say how important this issue is for me. When I get \nup in the morning and I think of my job as a Senator, I think about the \nmajor issues we face around the world. We face issues of war and peace \nand how we have to deal with terrorism. We face the issue of how we \ndeal with energy independence. Many of us here have joined in a \nbipartisan effort, progressives and conservatives together, an effort \nwe describe as ``setting America free.'' We know the huge issue of \nhealth care which confounds and confronts so many people. But among \nthose issues, which are the greatest of our time, is the reality that \nwe are frying our planet, as many people have said. We have not \ndeveloped a framework to move forward to make sure we save our planet, \nthat we save civilization for our children and grandchildren. The world \nthey know, the planet they will know in 2050 and 2100, when none of us \nare here, will be the kind of planet where we have preserved what we \nknow as God's creation on Earth.\n  The importance of this issue is unparalleled. It is something I \nbelieve we should be able to move forward with.\n  I want to illustrate this in a couple of different ways. First, with \nrespect to water, for the State of Colorado and the arid West--and I \nknow in the State of the former Presiding Officer, Nebraska, because we \nshare the South Platte River and its waters--we know the importance of \nwater. Water is the lifeblood of the West. Without water, we know \ncommunities and fields will dry up and die. We have seen that happen in \nmany cases around the West.\n  This is a picture of a place in eastern Colorado where we have had \nsevere drought over the last 7 years. You see what happens to what \nwould have been a great crop of corn which a farmer planted, knowing \nthat he would harvest this crop of corn at some point in time. But \nbecause of severe droughts we have had on the eastern plains, this \nfield died. There are so many places in the arid West where that same \nstory could be told.\n  There are seven States that share the water of the Colorado River. \nMuch of that water is born in my State of Colorado, as the mother of \nmany rivers, including the Colorado River, and places such as Wyoming \nand Utah. As those seven States, with a population of 30 million \npeople, depend on the flow of water on the Colorado River, we are \nseeing challenges there that we have never seen before. The flows in \nthe Colorado River for the last several years have been at an all-time \nlow over the last 100 years because of the record drought we are seeing \non the Colorado River. Lake Mead, which is one of the controlling \nvessels on which we depend to regulate the flow of water on the \nColorado River, will never fill again. That is what the scientists are \ntelling us today.\n  So as we look at the reality of water across the West, it is \nimpressive that organizations that are not Democratic or left leaning \nor so-called environmental organizations are coming to me and saying: \nYou need to do something about global warming. You and the Congress and \nthe new President have to do something about the issue of global \nwarming.\n  The ski industry in Colorado, in places from Vail to Aspen to \nSteamboat, is saying: We are concerned about global warming because the \nsnow that is the essence of our having the best ski programs in the \nentire world is in danger. The water users, the Denver Water Board, the \nNorthern Water Conservancy District, the Southwest Water Conservancy \nDistrict, are telling us we need to do something about water.\n  I believe global warming has a lot of different consequences, if it \ngoes unaddressed. I am hopeful this Senate will have the courage to \nmove forward and address the reality of global warming. There is a \nconnection here to our planetary security, but also to our national \nsecurity in terms of energy. I agree there are some good things we have \nalready done as a Senate in a bipartisan way, under the leadership of \nSenators Bingaman and Domenici, with passage of the 2005 act and the \n2006 Energy bill and, most recently, with passage of the 2007 Energy \nIndependence and Security Act. The CAFE standards we included in that \nbill alone will save huge amounts of consumption of fossil fuels and \nwill save us from emitting thousands upon thousands of tons of carbon \ninto the atmosphere. Those are good things that we have done, but our \nwork is far from finished. We must do more.\n  The way of doing more is by making sure that we put a cap on carbon \nin the United States. Some people say: How can you do that in the \nUnited States, because you can't control China and the fact that they \nare building a coal-fired powerplant, one a week, or you can't control \nwhat is happening in India? But there is a reality for us as\n\n[[Page S5172]]\n\nAmericans: We must lead. We must have the courage to take the first \nsteps so that then the rest of the world will be able to follow us, so \nwe can address the issue of global warming in an effective way.\n\n  I don't believe this bill is a perfect bill. I have four or five very \nimportant amendments I want to be considered. I could not vote for this \nbill as it is currently structured, because there are improvements that \nhave to be made. But that is the nature of the legislative process. I \nwould like to have the opportunity to have my colleagues join us in a \ndebate so we could improve upon this bill and make it much better. I \nwill cite three areas where I believe we need to make improvements on \nthis legislation. I have others.\n  The first is renewable energy. I do not believe the allocation tables \nincluded in the Boxer substitute are the allocation tables that are \nappropriately supportive of a renewable energy future. I have seen a \nrenewable energy revolution taking place in Colorado over the last 3 \nyears, where we are now generating over 1,000 megawatts of electric \npower from wind, harnessing the power of the Sun, doing things with \nbiofuels we have never done before. I am proud of what is going on in \nColorado. I would like to see those allocation tables changed so we put \na much greater emphasis on renewable energy.\n  Secondly, coal for us, in many States, including the West, is very \nmuch what oil is to Saudi Arabia. We have vast amounts of coal, not \nonly in my State but obviously to the north in Wyoming and Montana. I \nbelieve there is a future for clean coal technologies through the \nmethods of carbon capture and sequestration. Yet it is money that has \nkept us from moving forward with a demonstration of those projects. \nThat technology shows great promise. It is my hope that we could amend \nthis legislation to move forward with carbon capture and sequestration \nin a more effective way.\n  Finally, I do not agree that there is sufficient recognition of the \ncontribution that farmers and ranchers can make with their bioproducts. \nIt is those products that end up consuming the very carbon dioxide we \nare now emitting into the atmosphere. We need to offer amendments with \nrespect to the agricultural offsets that are included in this bill to \nmake them a much more effective way of helping us address the carbon \nproblem we have.\n  Let me conclude by saying to my colleagues once again: I have the \nutmost and greatest respect for my leaders and my role models--John \nWarner, Joe Lieberman, Barbara Boxer--for the work they have done, for \nhaving brought us to this point on this legislation. If given the \nopportunity, and if we can have a robust debate on the floor of the \nSenate on global warming, we can make this bill a much better bill. We \ncan put the United States in a position of leadership where we address \nthe issue of carbon, we address the issue of global warming, and we \nsave our planet and civilization.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 6 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I wonder if I might take 3 and my \ndistinguished colleague from Connecticut, the senior partner of this \npartnership, would have the final few words to say.\n  I thank our colleague from Colorado. How much I have enjoyed, through \nthe years he has been here, how he has stopped at every opportunity to \ntalk about the land, the farm that is in his family, and his love for \nthe land and the outdoors. He speaks from the standpoint that he has \ntended that land and loves it. He wants to preserve that land for \nfuture generations. I commend him.\n  This debate has laid strong building blocks for the future. We have \nworked our way through the issues of the science. We have worked our \nway through how national security is linked to this subject. We have \nworked our way through the fact that technology must be encouraged in \nevery possible way to accommodate the capture, transportation, and \neventual sequestration of CO2, this greenhouse gas that is \naffecting the atmosphere. That technology needs a known, dedicated, \nconstant--underline ``constant''--stream of funding. Whatever global \nclimate exchange comes up, eventually the Congress of the United States \nmust put in a clear understanding that we are going to fund and have \nthat funding stream go to provide for the needs of the technology to \ncome up with the answer to this question. Our several States--another \nbuilding block--each of the States, in its own individual way, is doing \nthings. We commend them. But the United States must step up and lead.\n\n  Lastly, we must devise clearly a policy toward other nations in the \nworld--nations we trade with, nations we otherwise have relationships \nwith. We are all in this together. Sharing of the hardships must be \ncommon among those nations. We cannot ask the citizens of our Nation to \naccept a level of sacrifice greater than that which would be accepted \nby other leading nations of the world.\n  I am very proud of what has been done. I am humble to have had a \nsmall part in laying this foundation.\n  I yield the floor to my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, again, I thank my friend from \nVirginia. I get a kick out of him calling me his senior colleague on \nthis matter. We are at least equal. I say to my colleague, I consider \nyou to be the leader because without your decision to be part of the \neffort to come up with a solution to this problem, this bill would not \nhave moved out of committee. It is the first time ever that has \nhappened. So I thank you for your strong words. I thank you for \neverything you have done. We are going to keep you in this fight next \nyear. We are going to figure out a way to do it.\n  I also thank Senator Salazar.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I say to the Senator, you are the \nchairman of the subcommittee. Senator Boxer is chairman of the full \ncommittee.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Yes.\n  Mr. WARNER. I am the ranking member of the subcommittee.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Only in name. I consider you to be the person who made \nit possible for us to get where we are.\n  Madam President, I thank Senator Salazar for his statement. I think \nit perfectly summed up the decision that our colleagues in the Senate \nare going to have tomorrow on the vote on cloture, because Senator \nSalazar said it: This is a problem. He showed us the concerns he has \nabout the land and water of his beloved State of Colorado and the \nimpact of global warming on those necessary-to-life, fundamental-to-\nlife elements in Colorado.\n  He also said he basically thinks this is a good-faith approach. He \nlikes the basic architecture of our bill. But he has a lot of things he \nwould like to change about it to make it better. But he is going to \nvote for cloture tomorrow because he does not want to end the debate. \nHe knows all the amendments filed, as is our rule, prior to 1 p.m. \ntoday will come up for debate. They are presumably subject to second-\ndegree amendments as the debate goes on. He does not want the debate to \nend.\n  If it ends tomorrow, he wants his last statement this year, by his \nvote tomorrow, to be that he wants to be part of a solution to the \ncarbon pollution that is warming our globe and a lot of us believe is \nendangering the future of our country, our people, and the people of \nthe world.\n  So this is a big problem that requires a big solution. I hate to see \nit get stopped by small worries. We are here to legislate. We are here \nto debate. We are here to amend. The body can work its will. If you do \nnot think this is a perfect measure, come on out and make it better. \nThe only way you are going to be able to do that is by voting for \ncloture tomorrow.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nspeakers during this hour controlled by Senator Inhofe be the \nfollowing: Senator Bunning, Senator Vitter, Senator Corker, Senator \nSessions, Senator Domenici, and Senator Inhofe.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, please, this is a parliamentary inquiry \nand not to be taken away from the time of my friends. I just found out \nwhen we did our unanimous consent request it was not clarified that \nfollowing the Republican side, Senator\n\n[[Page S5173]]\n\nBoxer or her designee would have 5 minutes, followed by Senator Inhofe \nor his designee to have 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Very good.\n  Then, Madam President, one thing further: The Senator from Kentucky \ndid not mention the times. I want to make sure all of our speakers on \nour side know we are going to hold them to the times because we have \nmore speakers than we have time. Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request from the \nSenator from Kentucky?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Thank you, Madam President.\n  I am here on the floor today because this mandatory cap-and-trade \nbill represents the greatest threat to the American economy I have seen \nsince my fellow Kentuckians first elected me to represent them in 1986. \nWe have had 30 years to address the energy crisis in America. In 1974, \nwe got the first shot across the bow, and the balance of power in the \nworld shifted from the oil consumers to the oil producers. We looked at \ndomestic production and alternative fuels. But when the crash in the \n1980s came, so did our investment in future sources.\n  But what is the biggest achievement of this Congress? Stopping 70,000 \nbarrels of oil from going into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. We \ncould have had a million barrels a day right now from Alaska if \nPresident Bill Clinton had signed our legislation to open ANWR in 1995.\n  What about the need for clean nuclear energy? Thanks to the majority \nleader and environmental groups, we have spent decades working on Yucca \nMountain and still do not have the waste reserve we need for a strong \nnuclear energy industry.\n  The last thing America needs today is another energy mistake.\n  The reason this climate change legislation is on the floor today is \nsimple: It is fear. The Democrats in Congress want you to be afraid. \nThey want you to be afraid that manmade emissions will cause massive \nhurricanes, raise sea levels, prolong droughts, and kill off endangered \nspecies.\n  I am not standing here telling you we should not protect the \nenvironment or that manmade carbon emissions have not increased. I am \ntelling you that carbon emissions are a function of economic growth and \ntechnology. It means jobs, cars, and energy. When I look at these \nemissions, I do not know what role they play in overall climate change \nrelative to other natural effects such as solar radiation.\n\n  For a minute, let's say the carbon issue needs immediate action. What \nwill we get from passing this legislation? If all the world's \nindustrial nations were to completely comply with familiar or similar \nambitious goals, the climate change would be seven one-hundredths of 1 \ndegree Celsius cooler in 20 years. Such a small change occurs naturally \nall the time. From Sun spots to forest fires to volcanic activity, \nnature does much more on its own day to day.\n  So what is the point of the climate change bill? The Democrats in \nCongress want you to pay more for energy so you drive less, buy smaller \ncars, and use less electricity. They are telling Americans they know \nbetter and want the Government to manage their money for the good of \nthe environment.\n  This bill would raise $5.6 trillion for the Government over the next \n40 years. Let me say that again: $5.6 trillion. This money does not \nmagically appear in the Government coffers; it comes out of your \npockets. The supporters of this bill will try to tell you it comes from \noil companies, utilities, or any number of other people. But they are \njust straw men. That is not how our economy works. American consumers \nare going to get stuck with this bill. It means natural gas prices \ndoubling. It means gasoline prices 30 to 40 percent higher--and it \ncosts $4 a gallon for regular unleaded gasoline today--than they would \nhave been. It means electric costs between 40 and 120 percent more.\n  In my home State of Kentucky, the average family will spend $324 more \nfor electricity every year, $133 more for natural gas, and $397 more \nfor their gasoline. That is per year. So I want everyone in America to \ntake a look at your last month's bills. Can you afford to double your \nnatural gas bills, add a dollar for every gallon of gasoline you buy, \nand add $50 to the average electricity bill? Many of us cannot do it. \nNow, think about paying that money every month, every year, for the \nnext 40 years. That is your share of the $5.6 trillion Uncle Sam will \ntake because of this legislation.\n  What will happen to all of the money you send to us here in \nWashington? Under this bill, there is a $5.6 trillion cost over 40 \nyears, and the Government will spend it on new programs, $566 billion \nto the States--back to all 50 States--$237 billion for wildlife, $342 \nbillion to foreign countries--figure that one out. I cannot.\n  Let me make it clear: Democrats and the environmentalists are trying \nto scare Americans into adopting legislation that will take money out \nof their pockets to pay for new Government programs that could decrease \nglobal thermal temperatures by seven one-hundredths of 1 degree over 20 \nyears. And these changes are only estimates. They are not backed by \nconclusive evidence. Respected scientists disagree about the true \neffect increased emissions will have in coming decades. Just 20 years \nago, some of these same scientists came to the Capitol warning us of an \nice age. Can you believe that? Twenty years ago.\n  If this tax-and-spend plan based on incomplete science does not sound \nbad enough, it only gets worse. Based on several studies, nearly 4 \nmillion Americans will lose their jobs because of this legislation. A \ncap-and-trade program would force many industries, such as steel, \nautomotive, aluminum, cement, and others, to take their jobs to other \ncountries where energy costs are lower and environmental regulations \nare looser.\n  Let's look at the airlines as an example of what could happen to \nAmerican jobs because of this bill. Based on current projections, the \nairline industry expects to pay $62 billion for jet fuel in 2008. That \nis $20 billion more than they paid last year, or about a 50-percent \nincrease.\n  Let's look at this chart I have in the Chamber. In response to this \nprice shift, eight airlines have gone completely out of business in the \nlast 6 months and another is operating in bankruptcy. Eight are out of \nbusiness. Thirty cities lose service, and 9,000 jobs are eliminated. To \nmake it worse, the Democrats in Congress have stopped efforts to \naddress this crisis in the airline industry.\n  I have proposed incentives for coal-to-jet-fuel facilities that would \nproduce clean-burning aviation fuel with carbon capture technology at \nless than half of the current cost of oil: $65 a barrel. If we had \ninvested in alternative jet fuel technology, maybe we could have saved \nthe thousands of jobs that are now in jeopardy.\n  Think about what you would feel if you were laid off because of high \noil prices or if you had to choose between the grocery store and \nfilling your truck with gasoline. Now imagine your congressional \nrepresentative deliberately voted to make things worse. It is not just \nabout American jobs and dollars and cents. America could bring its \ngreenhouse gas emissions to zero and it would not reverse the growth in \nworldwide emissions, thanks to rapid expansion in China and India and \nother developing countries.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is notified that he has used 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent for 3 more \nminutes.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I have to object.\n  I am going to object, as I said earlier, to any of our speakers going \nover because they would be doing that at the expense of those who have \nnot had a chance to speak. So let me renew that unanimous consent \nrequest, that the times for the next speakers will be Senator Vitter \nfor 10 minutes, Senator Corker for 10 minutes, Senator Sessions for 5 \nminutes, Senator Domenici for 15 minutes, Senator Inhofe for 10 \nminutes, then Senator Boxer for 5 minutes, and Senator Inhofe for 5 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Before the Senator from Louisiana speaks, the Chair wishes to make an \nannouncement.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/05/senate-section/article/S5174-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5174]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S5174]]\n CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET FOR THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT FOR FISCAL YEAR \n                        2009--CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I rise to discuss this very important \nclimate change legislation and amendments I would have brought to the \nSenate floor for consideration. Now, unfortunately, I said ``would have \nbrought'' because this entire process has been short-circuited, cut \noff, blocked by the actions of the distinguished majority leader. I \nfind that very regrettable.\n  Whatever side of the debate we are on, whatever we think about this \nbill, it is beyond debate that this is enormously significant \nlegislation that would have dramatic impacts on our economy. I believe \nit is the most significant bill that would have the most drastic and \ndramatic impacts on our economy of any since I have come to the Senate, \nwhich has only been about 3 years, but we have considered a lot of \nbills. Yet we are operating, apparently, under a procedure now where \nnot one amendment will be considered before the significant cloture \nvote tomorrow morning. The distinguished majority leader has filled the \namendment tree, so not a single amendment could ever be considered \nwithout his acquiescence and consent. That is flat out ludicrous. That \nis flat out offensive.\n  I came to the Senate from the House. In doing so, I heard from so \nmany different sources so many stories, so many examples of how the \nSenate is a place of great unlimited debate; the ability to bring ideas \nand amendments to the Senate floor on the big issues of the day, in \ncontrast to the House. Unfortunately, our distinguished majority leader \nhas turned that on its head. He has made that exactly the reverse, \nwhere debate is completely shut down, where we have no amendments \npossible to be considered before the cloture vote on the most dramatic \nand significant bill to impact our economy that I have been able to \nconsider here in the Senate. That is ludicrous.\n  On this topic, former Vice President Al Gore made a very famous \nmovie: ``An Inconvenient Truth.'' I ask what the distinguished majority \nleader is afraid of. Why not have a full debate. He seems to be \nconcerned about an inconvenient debate or a series of inconvenient \namendments. Again, I express extreme regret that we are having a \ncloture vote tomorrow morning before a single amendment is called up on \nthe floor to be debated, before there is any opportunity--any \nsecurity--for amendments to be considered, at least unless they have \nthe majority leader's acquiescence and support.\n  I would have called up at least three amendments. These three \namendments go to the heart of my concerns about the legislation. When I \nlook at virtually all legislation, I look at the costs of the \nlegislation and the benefits, and I ask: Do the benefits outweigh the \ncosts. In this case, I believe the costs are very severe. First, costs \nrelating to gasoline. The Louisianans whom I represent, as Americans \nare all over the country, are struggling under the weight of enormously \nhigh gasoline prices right now. They have risen from about $2.33 when \nthis Congress came into office, to almost $4 at the pump now. Yet this \nbill could increase that burden significantly by as much as a dollar a \ngallon. That is a big cost.\n  I also look at the cost of other energy prices: natural gas prices, \nelectricity prices. Again, that is a big additional cost this bill \nwould be putting on American citizens.\n  Finally, I look at the cost of shipping more jobs overseas, because \nthis bill would put dramatic onerous controls on American industry, \nAmerican businesses, and American jobs, but wouldn't do anything \ncomparable with regard to jobs overseas, including China and India. \nThose are big costs. The benefit? Well, the benefit, I believe, would \nbe slim to none because of the factors I have mentioned, because of \nwhat this bill would do to burden our industry, our companies, our \njobs. Those jobs would be pushed overseas, largely to countries without \nthese controls--to countries that would not change their policies, that \nwould not follow our lead, particularly China and India.\n  So what would we do with regard to the global issue of climate \nchange? It is certainly global and not localized. We would be \naccomplishing virtually nothing.\n  My amendments, had I been allowed to offer them, would have addressed \nthese onerous costs. First, I would have presented an amendment that \nsaid if the price of gasoline at the pump reaches $5 a gallon--forget \nabout $4 where we are already--if it reaches $5 a gallon, then we would \nallow exploration and activity on our ocean bottoms off our coasts, but \nonly under two conditions: first, if the host State off whose coast \nthat activity would happen would want the activity; the Governor and \nthe State legislature of that State would say yes, we want this \nactivity off our coast, we want to help meet the Nation's energy needs. \nSecondly, if that happened, that State would get a fair revenue share--\n37.5 percent--building off the precedent we set 2 years ago with \nrevenue sharing in the Gulf of Mexico; and important Federal programs \nand important Federal priorities, such as LIHEAP and the Highway thrust \nFund and the Adam Walsh Act, would also get guaranteed funding. That is \na significant and important amendment that should be part of this \ndebate.\n  My second amendment would discuss electricity prices, particularly \nnatural gas, and it would say that if natural gas demand went up, if \nthe price went up because of this bill, then again it would pull a \ntrigger and allow that exploration and production on our ocean bottoms \noff our coasts under the same conditions that I outlined with regard to \nhost States.\n  Finally, my third amendment would address the significant jobs cost \nthat this bill presents. Natural gas-intensive sectors of our \nmanufacturing industry would be particularly hard hit by this bill. So \nmy amendment, had I been allowed to present it, would have said that we \nwill have annual reports describing whether this bill would displace \nmore than 5,000 employees in natural gas-intensive sectors of the \nmanufacturing industry such as the fertilizer industry, the \npharmaceutical industry, the chemical industry. If that happened, if we \nwent over that threshold, then the EPA Administrator, in consultation \nwith the Secretary of Labor, would have to increase the number of \nallowances necessary to preserve those jobs.\n  Those are important topics in this debate. Yet they were completely \nshut out from consideration on the Senate floor. Once again, I have \nenormous regret and concern for this body based on the precedent the \ndistinguished majority leader has set. This is an enormously important \ntopic and bill, yet not allowing a single amendment to be called up and \nconsidered before our vote on cloture tomorrow morning, and filling the \namendment tree so not a single amendment could ever be considered \nwithout the acquiescence and support of the majority leader himself.\n  As I said a few minutes ago, Al Gore talked about an inconvenient \ntruth. I believe the majority leader is concerned about an inconvenient \ndebate, inconvenient amendments, but that is exactly what the American \npeople deserve: a full and fair debate and consideration of amendments.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I think it is very clear. Our speakers--\nmyself included--all we are asking for is to debate our amendments and \nget votes on our amendments.\n  I now yield to Senator Corker from Tennessee 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. CORKER. Madam President, if the Chair could let me know when \nthere is 2 minutes left on my time, I would appreciate it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will be so notified.\n  Mr. CORKER. Madam President, thank you very much for the opportunity \nto rise and speak about the Climate Security Act. I think all of us \nrealize what is getting ready to happen.\n\n[[Page S5175]]\n\nUnfortunately, in the morning, there will be a cloture vote and \nobviously the bill will not have the votes for cloture and it will \nfail. Hopefully, we will return to a debate on the bill. I think the \nlikelihood of that is very low.\n  I wish to say that as one Senator who has spent a tremendous amount \nof time on this issue, I am extremely disappointed in the process we \nhave followed as it relates to this most important piece of \nlegislation. Yesterday at about 11:15, a 492-page amendment was placed \non the desk--492 pages. It is 150 pages longer than the original bill. \nYet tomorrow we have a cloture vote. I would say that almost no Senator \nin this building has had the chance to fully read this bill as it now \nis. So again, the cloture vote will fail tomorrow at about 9 o'clock.\n  I got up this morning and I turned on the coffee pot early. I read \nthe paper. I rode the elevator down and ran on the Mall and came back, \ngot dressed, got in my car and came to work here, and I realized that \nevery single process I had gone through this morning in some form or \nfashion would be affected by this bill if it were to pass. This is one \nof the most important pieces of legislation we have ever debated in \nthis Senate Chamber. The fact that we have allowed such little time for \ndebate, to me, is a tremendous disappointment.\n  I know many proponents of this bill will say that those who vote \nagainst cloture tomorrow will vote against cloture because they do not \ncare about climate change; they do not care about climate security. I \ncan tell my colleagues that in my case, nothing could be further from \nthe truth. Over a year ago, I spent time with Jeff Bingaman in \nBrussels, Paris, and London, meeting with carbon traders, meeting with \nmembers of the European Commission, meeting with utilities, meeting \nwith cement manufacturers, meeting with everybody who had a stake in \nwhat occurred in Europe when they put this process in place.\n  This last July, with a group of Senators led by Senator Boxer from \nCalifornia, I went to Greenland and saw firsthand the poster child, if \nyou will, of what we have all been talking about. I met with Danish \nscientists. I met with scientists from our country. I have read \ntremendously about this issue throughout the years. Every time I have \nread a book or a magazine that was a proponent, I read one that was an \nopponent, if you will.\n  I have gotten both sides of this issue. Our staff has spent \ninordinate amounts of time on this. We have offered amendments. I have \nactually sent a letter to every single Senator in this Chamber with \ndetailed amendments and the background and the reason we were offering \nthem. I have never on this Senate floor used any degree of demagoguery \nto talk about this issue. I have only spoken about the facts of the \npolicies we are debating.\n  The reason this bill is going to fail tomorrow is not because of the \nprocess. This bill is going to fail because it has serious flaws. \nAgain, the process we went through to get to this point is one that is \nso inappropriate. Typically, when you have a portion of a bill, for \ninstance, that relates to money, it goes to the Finance Committee. \nTypically, when you have a portion that relates to energy, it goes to \nthe Energy Committee. That didn't happen. Most people on the EPW \nCommittee itself candidly--as a matter of fact, almost every Member \ndidn't even see this massive bill until it came to the floor yesterday. \nHowever, that is not even the reason it is going to fail. That is \nreason enough, but this bill has serious flaws. We have tried to point \nthat out from day one. We have been totally transparent in the process. \nWe have met with environmental groups that have been so involved in \npushing this legislation; we met with their boards and pointed out \nalong the way the three serious flaws we have seen in the bill. Other \nSenators have wonderful contributions to make to the bill, including \nSenators Domenici, Inhofe, Bingaman, and others; they have tremendous \ncontributions to make.\n  Let me mention the three flaws we have talked about before. No. 1, \nthe proponents of the bill, whom I respect tremendously--and I believe \ntheir hearts are in the right place--I thank them and their staffs for \nthe work they have done on this bill because I know they spent a lot of \ntime. Unfortunately, the politics of climate change itself and of \nsolving the environmental problem was not good enough. Instead, the \nproponents had to take trillions of dollars in the Treasury and then \npre-prescribe through the year 2047--and then 3 years after in a \ndifferent way--how the money was going to be spent. We haven't had a \nbill such as this since Medicare or Social Security. I don't think we \nhave done something this pervasive that affects everybody in America on \na daily basis. Instead of just focusing on the policy and letting the \npolicy of cap and trade work as a potential market system, this bill \nhad to be turned into a huge spending bill on the backs of the American \npeople, driving up energy prices, driving up food prices, driving up \nclothing prices. Instead of returning that money to the American \npeople, the proponents decided to spend every penny--almost--of the \nmoney taken in.\n  The second thing is, marketable securities, as everybody knows, are \ncreated the day this auction process begins. Those marketable \nsecurities are called carbon allowances. They are transferred to people \nin this bill. It is a transference of wealth. It would be like if I had \n10 shares of IBM stock and my good friend, Jeff Sessions, was over \nhere, and I said, Jeff, I am going to give you these 10 shares of IBM \nstock; they are worth money and are marketable. He can sell them that \nday. The policy of focusing on climate wasn't enough. This bill had to \ntake the extra step of not just spending trillions of dollars but also \ngiving trillions of dollars away to people--by the way, this is the \nbest part----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. CORKER. That has nothing whatsoever to do with emitting carbon. I \nhave no idea why that is done.\n  Thirdly--and maybe most offensive--this bill sets in place something \ncalled international offsets. Others have talked about the burden on \nU.S. companies competing here if this bill is passed. This bill doesn't \njust create those burdens, which I acknowledge; it also pays them by \nallowing them to invest more inexpensively in other countries. I find \nthat reprehensible, and I cannot imagine why any process such as that \nwould be part of this bill.\n  Most importantly, though these three flaws exist, no doubt, this bill \ndoesn't include an energy title to cause our country to be energy \nsecure. I think we have missed a tremendous opportunity at a time when \npeople have a passion about dealing with the climate in our country. \nAmericans are feeling vulnerable, as they should, as it relates to \nenergy. I think we have missed a tremendous opportunity to bring those \ntwo groups together and solve, once and for all, the problems that \nexist in our country in a meaningful way.\n  I came to the Senate to work on the big issues of our country. I am \nvery disappointed that we will leave tomorrow having accomplished \nnothing, having accomplished nothing as it relates to climate, nothing \nas it relates to energy security, and nothing to ensure that \ngenerations who come after us will have a better way of living.\n  With that, I will close by saying I hope in the very near future we \nwill put aside our differences, and I hope this cloture vote tomorrow \nwill not lock people into places they don't want to be, to show \nromance, if you will, as it relates to the issue.\n  I hope that over the course of the next few months, we will be able \nto come together and do something that is appropriate for the American \npeople.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, what is the time agreement?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is allocated 5 minutes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, I appreciate Senator Corker for his hard work and \nbringing his capable mind to this incredibly complex piece of \nlegislation. He has been able to explain, in simple language, some of \nthe fundamental flaws that exist. I also agree with him, having \ntraveled my State hard in the last month or two and talking to a lot of \npeople who are concerned about gas prices. They want us to do \nsomething. My belief, and what I have said for some time now, is let's \nget busy and let's do the things that work. Let's not make a mistake \nand take wrong steps. Let's do things that work.\n\n[[Page S5176]]\n\n  We need to accelerate biofuels. We have seen progress with wind, and \nmaybe more could be made there. Solar is not right and hasn't proven \nitself as a major source yet, but maybe we can see that. And there are \nfuel cells and hydrogen. A lot of things are possible. This past week, \nI visited a Mercedes plant in Alabama that has a diesel engine that \nruns 35 to 40 percent better for mileage than a gasoline engine.\n  I visited, in Huntsville, AL, a plant that incinerates garbage and \ncreates steam to provide to the military base, and it has been doing so \nsince 1984. Yet not another city in Alabama has such a steam plant.\n  I visited an Alabama power company incinerator, where switchgrass and \nwood chips are blown in with coal, reducing the amount of coal used, \nburning more biofuels.\n  I visited the transport center at the University of Alabama, which is \nworking on a more complete combustion of our fuels, fuel cells, and \nplug-in hybrids.\n  I visited Auburn University, where they are converting wood products, \nbiofuels, to gases and then to liquids we can burn in our automobiles.\n  All that is happening in my State right now. I say, let's get busy \nand see if we cannot accelerate those things. Let's not create a \nmonumental bureaucracy. As a former U.S. attorney, I am familiar with \nthe Code of Federal Regulations. I am not sure a lot of people are. But \nthis 400-plus page statute that we are about to pass has within it 35 \ndirect requirements that various agencies of the U.S. Government will \nissue regulations on, and the regulations frequently are far more \nextensive, more complex, and detailed than the laws we pass. But every \nbusiness in America will be bound by them. If they violate them, they \ncan be fined $25,000 a day. Somebody will have to enforce them. Who is \ngoing to do that? The EPA says they know they will need perhaps 400 new \npeople right off the bat to keep these programs up and going. But the \nDepartment of Agriculture, the Department of Treasury, and Department \nof Commerce have requirements, and they are going to have to have \npeople, among other agencies.\n  But who will have the most? What area of our economy will be required \nto hire the most people to comply with these regulations? I submit it \nis the private businesses that are going to have to hire accountants, \ntechnicians, have monitoring stations, hire people to figure out what \ncredits to buy and what credits to sell and try to project the market \nand see what the future is going to be on credit and where to get these \ncredits. It is going to be an incredibly complex thing.\n  This 492-page legislation has 35 different specific directions to \nvarious agencies to issue regulations.\n  My time has expired. I thank the Chair and point out that this has \nhuge ramifications throughout our economy. I am pleased to listen to \nSenator Domenici, our fabulous leader for so many years on these \nissues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I ask that you advise me when I have 3 \nminutes remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will do so.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I am sorry, but it gets difficult to keep track of the \ntime. I thank the Senate for permitting me to speak a few moments \ntoday.\n  We are just 3 full days into the Boxer bill, and several important \nquestions have arisen. Unfortunately, the majority leader has filled \nthe tree. That sounds like something you do around Christmastime, but \nthat is not what it is. It means last night the majority leader decided \nthis bill, when we return to it--if we do, which I don't think we \nwill--would not be amendable. He has put amendments in every place you \ncould amend so you cannot amend any further. So we would not have a \nchance to fix this.\n  So everybody will understand, 3 days for a bill such as this in the \nSenate is unheard of. This Senator is serving his 36th year and happens \nto be fortunate that I was here when the Clean Air Act of America was \npassed. It was a new regime for trying to clean our air. We were on the \nfloor of the Senate, with Ed Muskie as chairman, for 5 weeks. Over 160 \namendments were brought up, and over 100 were approved, or voted on. \nThat is debating a bill--not 3 days.\n  As we consider this bill, we have to ask ourselves if a cap-and-trade \nregime is our only option, or even our best option, for reaching the \nbipartisan goal of reducing global greenhouse gas emissions. The \nCongressional Budget Director recently testified before the Committee \non Finance and the Committee on Energy that a carbon tax would be five \ntimes more efficient, that a rigid cap-and-trade regime would, \nconversely, be only one-fifth as effective as a carbon tax. So, \nobviously, we have set about to do something far more difficult than \ndirectly attacking the problem with a carbon tax because we fear it. \nBut the American people should know what we are doing to them, in this \nroundabout way, is far worse on them, their families, and their future \nthan a carbon tax, which everybody says we should leave alone and \nforget about.\n  It is also appropriate to ask how this bill was written and why it \nhas been written several times. The bill leaves us with more questions \nthan answers. One that immediately comes to mind is, why allowances \nunder this bill are not considered property. This bill mandates that \nentities pay for the allowances. Then it refuses to extend the rights \nof ownership to those allowances.\n\n  The distinguished junior Senator from Tennessee has spoken eloquently \nabout this whole business of allowances and what is wrong with the way \nwe are treating it. He has mentioned, but I mention again, the bill \nspecifically says they are not property rights. Why do you pay for \nthem? If you pay for them, you think you own them. If you don't own \nthem, they are worth nothing because anybody can do what they like with \nthem if they are in a position of authority and you receive nothing. If \nyou try to sell them and an administrator decides you cannot, you have \nno rights because you don't own anything.\n  This bill mandates the entities pay for them and, I repeat, refuses \nto extend the ownership rights. I don't know why this is written this \nway, but I hope we will have a chance to consider an amendment. Perhaps \nthe Senator from Tennessee would have joined me in an amendment to \nstrike that provision, but we will not have a chance to do that because \nthe leader has filled the tree.\n  I repeatedly heard false claims that this bill will create a market-\nbasket approach to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. For a marketplace \nto operate, its participants must own the products they seek to trade. \nProperty is a fundamental right in a well-functioning market. The right \nof ownership should not rest with the bureaucrats at EPA. It should \nrest with the purchasers of the allowances.\n  Additionally, it is not credibly explained how Americans will comply \nwith this bill. There are a number of resources and technologies that \ncan significantly reduce carbon emissions, but often they are not \ncommercially viable or, worse, are blocked from being licensed.\n  Our Nation currently has 104 nuclear powerplants. According to the \nEIA, Energy Information Agency, we need to build an additional 264 \ngigawatts of nuclear capacity by 2050 to comply with this bill. Another \nFederal agency found that only 44 gigawatts of nuclear would be built \nand that our needs would, instead, be largely met by 81 gigawatts of \ncoal with sequestration and 61 gigawatts of renewable power. An MIT \nstudy found that we would meet our obligations with 236 gigawatts of \ncoal with sequestration. This technology has potential, but it has not \nyet been commercially demonstrated.\n  The point I am making is, some of the assumptions as to how we will \nreach this goal under this bill are stated by the experts in our \ncountry that they cannot be achieved because some of the things they \nexpect to use cannot be used or cannot be done.\n  In the years ahead, will those who now support this bill strongly \nadvocate the construction of the infrastructure and facilities \nnecessary to comply with it?\n  More than 20 organizations went on record last November in opposition \nto the National Interest Electric Transition Corridor. These corridors, \nestablished in the Energy Policy Act, which we together wrote and \npassed on the floor of the Senate, are essential to addressing electric \ntransmission constraints or congestion across the country. But an \nattitude of ``not in my\n\n[[Page S5177]]\n\nbackyard'' has resulted in vocal opposition in many localities. Yet \nthat would be absolutely necessary for this bill to work.\n  According to Greenpeace's Web site, carbon capture and sequestration \nis ``an unproven, expensive, and inefficient technology'' that \ntaxpayers should not be asked to subsidize. But according to EIA, it is \nnot available. The result is almost a doubling of the negative impacts \nof economic growth.\n  As recently as 2005, a leading proponent of this bill said in the \nSenate:\n\n       Nuclear power is not the solution to climate change, and it \n     is not clean.\n\n  Friends of the Earth, a large environmental group active in 70 \ncountries around the world, describes nuclear power as a ``false \nsolution'' that ``is simply a diversion'' from the progress of reducing \ngreenhouse gas emissions. The fact is, nuclear power is our only \ncarbon-free source of baseload generation, and the 104 nuclear reactors \nnow in our country around the Nation displace as much carbon dioxide--\njust this one source of energy--as nearly all the passenger vehicles on \nthe roads of America. That is a pretty good exchange for 104 nuclear \npowerplants that are old and doing the job.\n  The opposition to energy infrastructure that we need to reduce \ngreenhouse gas emissions overlooks a fundamental truth that is \nunderscored by nearly every study in this bill. Without these resources \nand technologies, it will be impossible to meet the targets outlined by \nthis bill. So supporting a cap-and-trade regime is insufficient. The \nbill's advocates must also pledge to support and work hard for energy \ninfrastructure, which we have just discussed, for years to come.\n  Perhaps the most important question in considering this bill is \nwhether it will accomplish its stated purpose. Listen carefully. The \nfirst stated purpose of this bill is ``to establish the core of a \nFederal program that will reduce the United States greenhouse gas \nemissions substantially enough to avert the catastrophic impacts of \nglobal climate change.'' First purpose.\n  The United Nations IPCC--that is the technical hierarchical leader--\nprojects that if the global concentration of greenhouse gas increases \nby 90 parts per million, global air temperature will rise by roughly 1 \ndegree. These are the projections cited by the advocates of this bill. \nAccording to the EPA, however, this legislation would only decrease \nglobal concentrations by 7 to 10 parts per million by the year 2050, \nenough to reduce temperatures by only one-tenth of 1 degree Celsius.\n  As I stated earlier in this debate, such an increase will fail the \ntest outlined in this bill. Its impact will not be substantial enough \nto avert a catastrophic impact of global climate change as stated by \nthe proponents of this bill, cited by the advocates of cap and trade, \nto say it another way.\n  Their own rhetoric does not match the reality of what this bill would \naccomplish. The biggest purpose would not even come close to being \naccomplished. If we did it, it wouldn't come close to what is \nnecessary. I just gave the numbers.\n  The second stated purpose of this bill is divided into seven \nsubsections. First, it is intended to reduce greenhouse gas emissions \nwhile ``preserving robust growth in the United States economy.'' \nEconomic studies across the board have found that this bill fails in \nthis regard. The studies find that this bill will have a negative \nimpact on gross domestic product, our basic test of collective \nproductivity, in the range of trillions of dollars.\n  Next, the bill is intended to create new jobs in the United States. \nWhy then is so much attention given to retraining assistance for \nworkers in this bill? A study by the SAIC estimated that 3.5 million \njobs would be lost by 2030 as a result of this legislation. And there \nis no credible study that says this bill, on a net basis, will create \njobs in America.\n  Third, this bill seeks to ``avoid the imposition of hardship on U.S. \nresidents.'' Given the projections of lower economic growth and job \nlosses, this is simply not possible.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico has 3 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Chair.\n  The fourth subsection states that this act is intended to ``reduce \ndependence of the United States on petroleum produced in other \ncountries.'' Last year, I introduced the American Energy Production \nAct. I plan to offer this as a complete substitute for this bill. There \nis no one who could doubt that it would do more to reduce our \ndependence on foreign oil than this bill.\n  The fifth states that the act will ``impose no net cost on the \nFederal Government.'' This stated purpose omits the massive cost that \nconsumers and businesses will incur. The number has been placed at $6.7 \ntrillion, which represents an unprecedented transfer of wealth to be \ncarried out at the discretion of the Federal Government. This is the \nmost expensive authorization bill in my 36 years in the Senate.\n  Sixth, the bill states that it seeks to ``ensure the financial \nresources provided by the program established by this act for \ntechnology deployment are predominantly invested in development, \nproduction, and construction of that technology in the United States.'' \nWhy then does the bill include an entire title for international \noffsets and allowances? That has been stated by the distinguished \nSenator from Tennessee eloquently.\n  Further, uncertainties of numerous kinds remain that I am unsure this \nact is capable of being administered, but I am not sure exactly how \nthat can be done. CBO estimates an increase of $3.7 billion in \ndiscretionary spending at EPA between 2009 and 2018 just to administer \nthis bill--$3.7 billion. That is nearly a 50-percent increase compared \nto their entire current budget.\n  This bill would require more than 50 new reports and studies, many of \nwhich recur on a monthly, quarterly, or annual basis. It includes \ndirections for 39 new regulations and rulemakings and would establish \n56 new program initiatives, funds, and similar Federal entities. This \nchart behind me shows just how complex this bill would be. I ask that \nmy colleagues look at it because it is accurate.\n  It should be clear that any reasonable amount of time studying this \ncap-and-trade proposal leads to more questions than answers. While that \nmay be acceptable for scientific endeavors, it is not a very sound \nfooting for making law.\n  On a global scale, this bill would provide minimal, if any, \nenvironmental benefit by the end of this century. But even to achieve a \nsmall reduction here at home, we may subject America's economy, \nprosperity, and global competitiveness to irreparable harm, while \ncreating greater emissions abroad. The capp-and-trade system envisioned \nby this bill is simply not the answer we seek for reducing our \ngreenhouse gas emissions. I hope in the future we can move this debate \nin a direction toward solutions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, it is my understanding that I have 10 \nminutes and then the distinguished junior Senator from California will \nhave 5 minutes and then I will have 5 minutes in rebuttal.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, please tell me when I have 1 minute.\n  All Republicans want just one thing, and that is to debate this bill, \nbring it out in the open, let the light shine on it. Every Republican \nwho has spoken has talked about the various amendments they want. All \nwe want to do is discuss, debate amendments, have recorded votes on the \namendments, and then have a recorded vote on final passage. That is a \nvery reasonable request.\n  The Senator from New Mexico said on a couple of occasions that--\nreferring to the amendments of 1990--there were 180 amendments that \nwere offered at that time in 5 weeks of debate. Now we are talking \nabout 3 days. I don't want anyone walking away when they pull the bill \nand say the Republicans had anything to do with it because all we want \nto do is debate it.\n  One of the amendments I want is to set up a mechanism we put down in \na very reasonable way that would protect truckers, small businesses, \nand farmers from higher diesel prices caused by the Lieberman-Warner \nbill. I still want that amendment, and I hope there is a change of \nheart someplace and we will be allowed to do it.\n  It is important in these last few minutes to talk a little bit about \nthis 53 cents a gallon they have estimated. They have said it is not \ngoing to be 53 cents a gallon, but the EIA, the Energy\n\n[[Page S5178]]\n\nInformation Agency, has estimated that it would be 53 cents. But they \nsay we are underestimating. They said first they acknowledge their \nmodel does not take into account cost of allowances for refineries, it \ndoes not account for more production going overseas, and it does not \naccount for supply-side changes in the market, which means as \nproduction costs go up, supply will get tighter. That is a conservative \nestimate.\n  Since our junior Senator from California has returned, let me one \nmore time talk about the tax increase. This is a massive tax increase \non the American people. At a press conference on June 2, Senator Boxer \nsaid this is tax relief. Later on, she said in the same press \nconference: We also have in this bill a very large piece, almost $1 \ntrillion of tax relief. So when we see some increases in energy costs, \nwe can have tax relief. Then she talks about tax relief.\n  What does the bill say? The bill says the tax relief referred to is \nnonbinding; it is sense of the Senate. That just means it is \nconversation. It says it should be used to protect consumers. It \ndoesn't authorize it, it doesn't direct it, it doesn't provide anything \nis paid. So what we are talking about is that $800 billion is not going \nto happen. But assuming it did--that is after we have taxed the \nAmerican people $6.7 trillion--then we might give them back $800 \nbillion. That means that for every $8 we tax them, we give them back \n$1.\n\n  Next, nuclear. Certainly, the Senator from New Mexico has been a \nleader on this, and we have talked about trying to get more nuclear \nenergy for quite some time. I will say this about the McCain-Lieberman \nbill. One of the reasons I don't believe Senator McCain is for this \nbill is that it doesn't have a nuclear component. His bill had a \nnuclear component, a recognition that we are not going to solve this \nproblem in this country without a nuclear component. So this bill has \nno nuclear component.\n  When you look at other countries, such as France, they get 80 percent \nof their energy from nuclear energy. We are getting 20 percent. It is \nclean, abundant, cheap, and safe, and we ought to be doing more of \nthat. I think we are on the road to start doing that, but not in this \nbill. It is not in this bill.\n  Next, the gas price, the 53 cents, I would suggest that is not just \nconservative, it is incredibly conservative because that is assuming \n268 new nuclear electric powerplants by 2050. That is assuming we have \n268 new nuclear plants. Well, according to the Electric Power Research \nInstitute, and everybody else, the most we could have would be 64. So \nthat is one-fourth the amount. That means the increase in the cost per \ngallon most likely would be closer to $2 a gallon instead of 53 cents a \ngallon.\n  On the $6.7 trillion tax increase, this is one where they say: Well, \nwe are going to give part of this back. Even if they gave back $2.5 \ntrillion over that period of time, this would still be a $4.2 trillion \ntax increase.\n  Now, you might say: What is all that money going for? Look behind me. \nThere are 45 new or expanded bureaucracies that would be recorded or be \nestablished by this bill. In other words, if we do this bill, yes, we \nare going to be taxing the American people $6.7 trillion, and it is \ngoing to be going toward expanding and creating new bureaucracies--45 \nof them. I can assure you that none of that money would be returned to \nthe people of Oklahoma.\n  Now, it is hard to explain what $6.7 trillion means. It has so many \nzeros, people's heads start to swim. The analysis by Charles Rivers \nAssociates says that each family of four in my State of Oklahoma will \nhave their taxes increased by $3,300 a year--$3,300 a year. That is a \nmassive tax increase. If you go back and look at the last major tax \nincrease we had in this country--it was the Clinton-Gore tax increase \nof 1993--where the taxes went up, Americans were taxed by some $32 \nbillion. This would be closer to in the trillions. It would be 10 or 12 \ntimes more than that.\n  The last major thing to talk about is jobs. I don't know how anyone \ncan look at this logically and come to the conclusion that this is not \ngoing to be the killer for jobs in America. I listened to my friends \nfrom Ohio and other States in the Midwest. We in Oklahoma don't really \nhave that much of a problem, but in the manufacturing belt of the \nMidwest--Ohio, Michigan, Illinois--they are losing their manufacturing \njobs. They have lost, by some estimates, up to 25 percent of their \nmanufacturing jobs because we don't have adequate amounts of energy to \ntake care of those things.\n  Well, this bill, according to the analysis that was done, would \nincrease the loss of jobs in the manufacturing sector by 9.5 percent. \nIn other words, it is not going to lose a few thousand jobs but many \nthousands. If the manufacturing sector is going to be dropping another \n10 percent, it is devastating.\n  Now, where are these jobs going to go? They are going to go to Mexico \nand they are going to go to India and China. There are a number of \ndifferent places they will go. This is the interesting thing--and I \nthink the Senator from Wyoming, Mr. Enzi, gave a speech on this that I \nthought was very good. In the speech, he talked about what happens when \njobs go to China. When jobs go to China, they do not have any emissions \nrestrictions in China, so the problem we will have there is that it is \ngoing to increase the amount of CO2 in the air.\n  I have agreed going into this debate that we would assume that it is \ntrue that manmade gases--anthropogenic gases, CO2, methane--\nare a major cause of climate change. I don't believe that is true, but \nwe wanted to assume it because if we didn't do that, this debate would \nbe all about science. We might end up winning the debate but not in the \nshort time the leadership has given us for this bill. So if we were to \nhave the time to do that and to talk about these losses and where these \nlosses are coming from, it would be much more meaningful.\n  But the bottom line is this: You can't worry about what is going to \nhappen if we lose the jobs without realizing that even if this bill \nwere to pass, it will end up costing the atmosphere. We will end up \nwith a lot more CO2 being emitted into the atmosphere. It is \nonly logical we are going to lose these jobs to developing nations, \nsome of which I have mentioned, and those developing nations don't have \nany restrictions on their emissions. So what happens? We pass the bill, \nemissions increase, and America goes through this economic disaster.\n  For those reasons, we can't do it, and for those reasons, we are \ngetting all kinds of editorials all around the country saying we can't \nafford to do it and saying things such as:\n\n       This is easily the largest income redistribution scheme \n     since the income tax.\n\n  And saying things such as:\n\n       The only thing it will cool is the U.S. economy.\n\n  And saying things such as:\n\n       The Boxer climate tax bill would impose the most extensive \n     government reorganization of the American economy since the \n     1930s.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Our only request is to let us debate the bill, debate the \namendments, vote on the amendments, and vote on the bill. It is a \nreasonable request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. My Republican friends are fierce defenders of the status \nquo. They are desperate defenders of the status quo. They are clinging \nto the past and turning away from solving one of the major challenges \nof our time. All they say is no, no, no, for the status quo. And the \nreason is they know we are so close with this bill to finally getting \nus off foreign oil, finally getting us off big oil, and that is whom \nthey defend here every single day.\n  They talk about working people. When is the last time they stood up \nand argued in favor of working people? Let me show you the working \npeople who are supporting us.\n  They stand up: Oh, we are going to lose jobs, lose jobs, lose jobs. \nIt simply isn't true. We have businesses, we have working people. Why \ndon't they go and tell the people who are supporting the Boxer-\nLieberman-Warner bill, from the International Union of Operating \nEngineers, from the building and construction trades, from the \nAssociation of Bridge, Structural, Ornamental and Reinforcing Iron \nWorkers, from the heat and frost insulators, to the plumbers, to the \nroofers, to the plasterers, to the painters and the allied trades, to \nthe teamsters and truckdrivers, to the\n\n[[Page S5179]]\n\nbrick layers. They stand here and scare people. These working people \nknow where the jobs are. The jobs lie in the new economy, the new green \neconomy, the economy that gets us off of foreign oil, that gets us off \nof big oil.\n  Then they have the nerve to talk about how we are going to raise gas \nprices. Take a look at what has happened to gas prices since George \nBush became President. And what did they ever do about it, Bush and \nCheney? Oh, they were the oilmen and they were going to be able to deal \nwith the oil companies. I will never forget it. Under George Bush, a \n250-percent increase, a 250-percent increase in a gallon of gas in the \nyears he has been in office, and all he can do is go to Saudi Arabia \nand hold hands with the Saudi Prince and beg. It doesn't work. What is \ngoing to work is a climate security act such as the one we have before \nus, and this is the pie chart I can show you.\n\n  Look at this. My friend from Oklahoma, he makes up things about this \nbill. He says it is about raising taxes. That is false. We give back \nalmost $1 trillion in taxes. We give back much more than $1 trillion in \nconsumer relief. All of this yellow is what most of this bill does, and \nhere we invest. We invest in low-carbon technologies so that we can get \noff oil.\n  They do not want to get off oil. They have friends in the oil \nindustry. Who do you think is opposing us and making up untruths about \nour bill? That is what happens. We don't have any tax increases, we \nhave tax cuts.\n  And then Senator Bunning says scientists disagree. Yes, there were a \nfew people who still said the world was flat. There are a few people \nwho still say cigarette smoking doesn't cause cancer. But the vast \nmajority of scientists from the IPCC, the most brilliant scientists all \nover the world gathered, including our own here in America--11 American \nNational Academies of Science say global warming is unequivocal.\n  You can put your head in the sand. You can divert attention by saying \nthis is a tax when it is not. How do we get the funding? We get it from \nthe largest emitters of greenhouse gas emissions.\n  I am looking at the Presiding Officer sitting in the chair. She wrote \nthe first section of the bill that deals with a greenhouse gas registry \nso we can measure that. And what do we say to them? You are going to \nhave to get permits to pollute. Polluters pay. And we help them with \nthat in the early years, and we take that money and we give most of it \nback to the people, OK? Then the rest of it, the rest of it we put to \ndeficit reduction and investments of technology.\n  We hear others get up and say: Drill, drill, drill. You can't drill \nyour way out of this problem. I don't want to drill in a wildlife \npreserve that Dwight Eisenhower, a Republican President, set aside. \nThat is ridiculous. It only has 6 months of oil. It is better to have a \nlong-term solution where we have the alternatives ready, the cars \nready, the different fuels ready.\n  Senator Corker complains about the process and he complains about the \nprocess. I say to Senator Corker: Vote for cloture. We will have \namendments, we will debate the bill, and we will move forward.\n  So it seems to me we are hearing a lot of falsehoods here. Vote for \ncloture. Let's get off of big oil and foreign oil. Let's have a good \neconomic future and solve the crisis of global warming.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I have heard the same thing, and I have \na great deal of respect for our chairman of the committee and her \npeople's information. I used to chair that committee when the \nRepublicans were in the majority. We are not a majority now, so it is \nSenator Boxer. But I wanted to cover the three things she covered.\n  First, gas prices, that somehow gas prices are not going to be going \nup as a result of this, and blaming that on the President, the \nadministration, whether it is Cheney-Bush or whoever it is. Let's keep \nin mind that gas prices went up when the Democrats controlled the House \nand Democrats controlled the Senate.\n  Now, if anyone doubts who is at fault for this, go to the Web site \nfor Environment and Public Works, epw.senate.gov, and look it up. What \nI have done is document the votes all the way back to 1995. Every time \nwe tried to increase the supply of energy in America and every time we \ntried to increase our refining capacity, it was killed by the \nDemocrats, right down party lines. Look it up. It is there. I have \nprovided it for you so you don't have to find it yourself. It is there.\n  Now, I don't know how many times I can refute this; the distinguished \nSenator talks about the fact that she doesn't believe this is a tax \nincrease and it is going to be a tax decrease by almost $1 trillion. It \nis $800 billion. But let us remember, as I said before, this bill takes \n$6.7 trillion from Americans in the form of a consumption tax on \nconsumable goods and on energy. Now, the bill says we should give back \n$800 billion. That means for every $8 we are taxing the American \npeople, we might be giving back $1.\n  The third thing is on jobs. You know, this is such a logical thing \nthat I don't believe we should have to go into all this. If you do away \nwith energy and dramatically cut energy in America, jobs have to go \nsomeplace. It is estimated that almost 10 percent of manufacturing jobs \nwill go overseas. They will be gone.\n  She talks about the labor unions. Let me read what the labor unions \nsay. The National Mining Association wrote:\n  Contrary to representations made of the Boxer substitute, S. 3036 \ndoes not provide sufficient funding or incentives for CCS and advanced \ncoal technologies. Under the Boxer substitute, the advanced coal \nresearch program proposed is replaced with a kick-start program. In \nother words, they are opposed to it.\n\n  How about United Auto Workers? The last time I checked, that was a \nunion. They said in a letter to her and to me:\n\n       The legislation still contains serious defects that would \n     undermine the environmental benefits while posing a threat to \n     economic growth and jobs. Accordingly, the UAW opposes this \n     bill in its current form. We urge you to insist that the \n     legislation must be modified to correct for these defects.\n\n  That is the UAW.\n  Again, the last thing the distinguished Senator said is we need to \nget to final passage, we need to pass this thing. I only hope that the \nDemocratic majority of the Senate will let us vote on amendments and \nlet us vote on final passage. If we take this bill down, I don't know \nwho you want to point a finger at, but I am standing here right now \nbegging with the leadership, let us debate the amendments and let us \ndebate final passage, let us have public record votes on the amendments \nand votes on the bill so the light will shine brightly and everyone \nwill know who is responsible if this bill goes down.\n  I yield the remainder of my time and yield the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I have a unanimous consent request that \nI may have printed in the Record a statement of Senator Barack Obama \nwhich says if he were able to be present, he would vote to invoke \ncloture.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Madam President, I will not be present for tomorrow's \n     cloture vote on the substitute amendment to the climate \n     change bill (S. 3036). However, were I able to be present, I \n     would vote to invoke cloture. Thank you.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I seek recognition to announce that due \nto my chemotherapy treatment in Philadelphia tomorrow, I will \nnecessarily be absent from the expected cloture vote to end debate on \nthe Boxer substitute to the Lieberman-Warner Climate Security Act, S. \n3036. If I were present, it would be my intention to oppose cloture at \nthis time.\n  As I stated earlier today on the Senate floor, I am sorry to see that \nthe majority leader has filled the so-called amendment tree on the \nglobal warming bill, thereby blocking all amendments. This is the 12th \ntime he has employed this legislative tactic in the 110th Congress. It \nis a sad state of affairs in the U.S. Senate when we take up \nlegislation on such a pressing matter as global climate change and 4 or \n5 days later find ourselves being asked to end debate when the debate \nhasn't even begun in earnest.\n  I was looking forward to really focusing my attention and that of my \ncolleagues on the very crucial issues that are part of this extremely \ncomplex bill. As I have said repeatedly, I believe we\n\n[[Page S5180]]\n\nneed to take action on global warming, and I have felt this way for \nmany years. In 2001, Senator Collins and I wrote to President Bush \nrecommending that he re-engage in the Kyoto process because the U.S. \nshould lead on this issue and have a seat at the international table.\n  My commitment to fighting global warming is also evidenced in the \nwork I have done with the chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural \nResources Committee, Senator Bingaman. During the energy bill debate of \n2005, we offered the Bingaman-Specter sense-of-the-Senate amendment \nthat put the Senate on record for the first time supporting mandatory \nclimate change legislation--a 54 to 43 vote. In the intervening years, \nwe worked diligently to craft a bill that balanced the concerns so many \nof our colleagues have had on both sides of the aisle. Our Low Carbon \nEconomy Act, S. 1766, would establish mandatory emissions caps while \nprotecting the economy and encouraging international action. Whatever \neventually passes Congress and is signed into law will have to meet \nthese difficult tests.\n  We have spent this week debating whether to proceed to the Lieberman-\nWarner bill. Many Senators filed amendments starting Wednesday \nafternoon, which was the first opportunity to do so. I filed four \nsubstantive amendments today. However, despite the repeated urging of \nSenators, including me, the majority leader decided to fill the so-\ncalled amendment tree, which has the practical effect of blocking any \namendments from being officially offered, debated, and voted on the \nSenate floor. This has set up a scenario where Senators are being asked \nto vote for cloture--to end debate--on the underlying Boxer substitute \nwithout ever having the opportunity to amend it. This begs the question \nof whether the Boxer substitute is so perfect that nothing in its 492 \npages should be scrutinized--or whether more pages should be added.\n  This kind of process puts Senators in a difficult position. I have \nstated my desire to pass legislation combating global warming. I \nrepresent a State with 12 million people and a very diverse electorate \nand economy. There are many Pennsylvanians who would like me to vote \nfor the Lieberman-Warner bill. There are also many who want me to \noppose it. I have met with citizens, companies, faith leaders, \nsportsmen, conservationists, environmentalists, union officials, and \nothers who have expressed a broad range of opinions. What I have tried \nto do is take all of these concerns and work with my colleagues such as \nSenator Bingaman to craft sound public policy that exerts U.S. \nleadership in tackling the very real environmental problems we are \nfacing, but also recognizes the uncertainty with creating the Nation's \nfirst economywide cap-and-trade program.\n  On Monday, June 2, I presented a detailed floor statement on my past \nactivities on climate change and on my concerns with the Lieberman-\nWarner bill. Some of the questions and concerns I raised included \nwhether the Lieberman-Warner emissions caps are technologically \nattainable, whether the bill adequately protected the economy, whether \nthe bill strongly adequately addressed the competitiveness of domestic \nmanufacturers, and whether the bill fairly treats process gas emissions \nfrom steel production, to which there are no alternative methods. I \nfiled four amendments dealing with these issues, but, again, none of my \namendments nor any others will be permitted by the majority. Now, it is \nimportant to note that I am not set in stone on anything. I am open to \nrethinking my position on various elements of a climate change bill. I \nalso think I deserve the opportunity to state my case and have my \nopinion and ideas considered.\n  Given the current legislative situation and lack of proper \nconsideration of this incredibly important legislation, I do not \nsupport the effort to invoke cloture on the substitute at this time. I \ncommit to continuing to work with my colleagues to find a solution to \nthe very serious issue of climate change. We should be acting with the \nspeed and deliberation that this massive yet essential undertaking \ndeserves.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I would like to briefly discuss the \nClimate Security Act and indicate how I would vote if I were going to \nbe present for tomorrow's cloture vote.\n  There can be no question that climate change is real. The scientific \nconsensus is clear. Human activity is increasing the concentration of \ngreenhouse gasses in the atmosphere, warming the planet, melting the \npolar ice caps, and causing severe weather events across the globe. The \neffects that we have seen to date are small in comparison to what \nscientists say are the likely consequences of continued warming. These \ndevelopments have very serious implications for this country, and for \nthe world.\n  We need only to look to the droughts in my part of the country over \nthe last few years or the increased frequency and ferocity of severe \nweather events across the country to see the very real effects of \nglobal climate change.\n  We have an obligation to current and future generations to take \nmeaningful action to reduce our emissions of greenhouse gasses, and I \nvery much appreciate the efforts of Senator Lieberman, Senator Warner, \nand Senator Boxer to address this issue.\n  However, this is a very complicated piece of legislation that will \nhave far-reaching effects on our economy, our competitiveness, and the \neconomic security of the people I represent. It is critically important \nthat we understand these effects and ensure that we have minimized the \neconomic costs of the bill.\n  Our economy depends on affordable, reliable, and abundant sources of \nenergy. Whether that means renewable sources of power like wind, solar, \nand biomass, or power derived from natural gas, petroleum, or coal, we \nhave a responsibility to ensure that our businesses, manufacturers, and \nhouseholds have access to energy sources at reasonable costs. We rely \non energy in almost everything we do in the course of a day, from \nturning on the light in the morning, to driving our cars to work, to \ncooking our dinner at the end of the day. During my time in the Senate, \nI have remained committed to keeping energy costs affordable for all \nNorth Dakotans and all Americans.\n  The bill before us could reduce the affordability of these sources of \nenergy. Over time, it will require companies that produce and use \nnatural gas, petroleum, and coal to acquire credits for each ton of \ngreenhouse gas emissions for which they are responsible. According to \nestimates from the Department of Energy's Energy Information Agency, \nthe cost of allowances will range from approximately $20 in 2012 to \nbetween $60 and $80 in 2030 for each ton of emissions. I am very \nconcerned about what these costs will mean for consumers in my state, \nwhere over 90 percent of our electricity comes from coal.\n  I am also concerned about the effects of these cost increases on our \ninternational competitiveness. In the absence of a binding \ninternational agreement, other nations that are leading emitters of \ngreenhouse gasses will not be subject to strict emissions controls. We \nwould risk putting U.S. manufacturing--which relies on affordable \nenergy--at a significant competitive disadvantage with the rest of the \nworld. We have already witnessed the loss of jobs to manufacturers in \nMexico and China. I recognize and appreciate that the authors of this \nbill have sought to address competitiveness concerns. But we must do \nmore.\n  Unfortunately, the tactics of some of our colleagues have made it \nimpossible to have a full debate on these issues. There will be no \nopportunity to offer amendments that would address these concerns and \nimprove the bill. I will be necessarily absent tomorrow for a long-\nplanned and critically important meeting with senior Air Force \nleadership at Minot Air Force Base in my state. However, if I were \nhere, I would have no choice but to oppose cloture.\n  This legislation will not be the final word in the Senate on this \nsubject. As this debate resumes, we need to continue working for a \nsolution that carefully balances the need for action with the concerns \nabout the impact on our economy and our competitiveness. We need to \ncarefully consider impacts on States with energy dependent economies, \nsuch as North Dakota. We need to carefully consider the impact on \ndifferent types of energy and make sure we do not put some forms of \nenergy--such as lignite coal, which is the leading source of power in \nmy State--at an unfair disadvantage. We need to carefully weigh the \nimpacts that any plan\n\n[[Page S5181]]\n\nwill have on energy consumers. And we need to make sure this \nlegislation is part of a global effort, so that countries such as China \ndo not derive an unfair competitive advantage from our action. I very \nmuch hope to be a part of finding innovative and creative solutions \nthat achieve this necessary balance.\n  Getting climate change legislation right will require an enormous \namount of additional, careful work. I look forward to working with \nSenators Boxer, Lieberman, and others to address this very real \nproblem.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I would like to explain the purposes \nof the amendment I have filed today with Senators Klobuchar and Snowe \nto the greenhouse gas registry provisions of the Climate Security Act.\n  This amendment attempts to clarify the relationship between the \ngreenhouse gas registry provisions in the Climate Security Act, and \nexisting law requiring greenhouse gas reporting. The existing law is a \nprovision that I included in the fiscal year 2008 omnibus \nappropriations legislation, Public Law 101-161.\n  The fiscal year 2008 omnibus appropriations legislation requires the \nAdministrator of EPA to do the following:\n\n     publish a draft rule not later than 9 months after the date \n     of enactment of this act, September 26, 2008, and a final \n     rule not later than 18 months after the date of enactment of \n     this act, June 26, 2009, to require mandatory reporting of \n     greenhouse gas emissions above appropriate thresholds in all \n     sectors of the economy of the United States.\n\nThus, under existing law, by June 2009, EPA must publish a final rule \nrequiring mandatory reporting of greenhouse gas emissions.\n  Sections 101 and 102 of the Climate Security Act build on these \nprovisions in existing law. The Administrator of EPA must complete a \nnew rulemaking within 2 years of enactment of the Climate Security Act.\n  As clarified in my amendment, this new rulemaking shall establish a \nFederal greenhouse gas registry that ``builds upon the regulations \ncompleted pursuant to [existing law].''\n  The new regulations will make ``changes necessary to achieve the \npurposes described in section 101,'' which includes the substantive \nrequirements for the new registry set forth in section 102(c).\n  Finally, the new regulations will ``require emission reporting to \nbegin no later than calendar year 2011.'' This final provision \nacknowledges that emission reporting will likely begin in 2010 under \nexisting law, given that the Administrator must complete regulations by \nJune 2009 requiring mandatory emission reporting. Emission reporting \nthat is fully consistent with the provisions of the Climate Security \nAct will then begin no later than 2011.\n  I would like to thank Senators Klobuchar and Snowe for their \ndedicated leadership in support of the greenhouse gas registry \nprovisions in this bill. It is a pleasure to work with them on this \nissue.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, I wish to take a few moments to \ndiscuss an amendment I have filed to the underlying Boxer substitute \namendment to the Lieberman-Warner climate change bill.\n  I feel very strongly that, in any responsible attempt to address the \nvery real threat of global climate change, one of the very first orders \nof business must be to ensure that our economy comes out of the process \nas strong or stronger after the enactment of carbon constraints as \nbeforehand. Our economy, as I have said many times since coming to the \nU.S. Senate, is inextricably tied to coal. Some may not appreciate it \nstill, or may let it slip to the back of their minds until another \ntragedy in the coalfields, but the fact is, coal provides about half of \nall of our electricity. Some months a little more, and some months a \nlittle less. But in almost every scientific or economic analysis I have \nseen, our dependence on coal to keep our economy functioning is going \nto continue to increase--and this is true even under the aggressive \napproach of the climate change bill before us.\n  That projected growth in the use of coal probably is a function of \nlong-term economic growth and the relative difficulty and high cost of \nbuilding generation alternatives. Coal can provide us with many \ndecades--some experts say many centuries--of cheap, reliable, domestic \nenergy. But as this country moves to address climate change, as I \nfervently believe we must, the future for coal--and I reiterate, the \nhealth of the American economy--depends on the ability of our electric \nutilities to use coal in a cleaner way than ever before, which includes \ncapturing and permanently storing carbon emissions.\n  This is why I am proposing an amendment that will dramatically \nincrease in the size and the scope of the carbon capture and storage, \nCCS, programs already underway in the Department of Energy. It is my \ngoal with this provision--which will authorize $650 million for CCS \nresearch, development, and deployment through the end of fiscal year \n2014--that a program already underway, but plagued by much-lower \nfunding that is really required, can move beyond the baby steps \ncurrently being taken, and move us closer to a day when coal can \ndeliver on the promise those of us in West Virginia and other coal \nstates have always understood it to have.\n  But my CCS amendment neither begins nor ends with merely increasing \nfunding of current R programs. In fact, while I have no doubts about \nthe quality of the work being done by fossil fuel researchers at West \nVirginia's National Energy Technology Laboratory and their scientific \ncollaborators at West Virginia University, Marshall University, and \nother fine schools around the country, I am not convinced the \nbureaucratic nature of DOE is the right or only environment in which to \nmake the best use of the science to bring about the cost-effective, \ncommercial-scale CCS, technologies we know we need. I believe that the \nmen and women working in our National Labs can produce great results, \nbut my grave concern is that government tends to move slowly and simply \ncannot afford to wait the several decades that are anticipated by the \ncurrent technology roadmap. That is why I am proposing an additional--\nand I believe, transformational--means at arriving at commercial-scale \nCCS much more rapidly.\n  The cornerstone of this amendment is the creation of a nearly $20 \nbillion quasigovernmental corporation, which I am calling the Future \nFuels Corporation. The Future Fuels Corporation is intended to push the \nenvironmentally responsible use of coal for electricity and the \nproduction of carbon products--transportation fuels and industrial \ninputs--in a process called ``polygeneration,'' while also moving us \nfurther and faster toward a time when commercially viable CCS \ntechnologies make using coal, our most abundant domestic fuel source, \nno more environmentally worrying than deriving electricity from the \nwind or the sun.\n  What separates the Future Fuels Corporation from other CCS research \nand demonstration projects, those underway or new programs being \nproposed as part or in reaction to the underlying bill, is that when \nthe corporation comes into being it will be funded by the Federal \nGovernment, but run by an independent board of directors, each of whom \nis an energy expert in his or her own right. These experts will be \nnominated by the President, confirmed by the Senate, but responsible to \nthe taxpayers for realizing the goals of the Future Fuels Corporation \nwithout the heavy hand and bureaucratic meddling that can be the \nunfortunate byproduct of the program administration of any government \nagency. The Future Fuels Corporation will have to deliver results. The \nscientists and researchers brought onboard the Future Fuels Corporation \nwill carry out their activities with a ``do it right, but do it fast'' \nbusiness mindset, and not the measured academic pace of traditional R \nprograms that could keep important CCS developments from being realized \nas fast as we need to have them up and running.\n  I am firm in my belief that the United States must do something \nsignificant to slow and ultimately reverse the carbon-induced climate \nchange that an unimpeachable scientific consensus shows us is already \nhappening. We must not hesitate to engage internationally, and when we \ndo, the effort cannot be allowed to let off the hook developing nations \nthat are fast becoming significant sources of atmospheric carbon. Our \naction must be scientifically justified, but must always acknowledge \nthe economic implications\n\n[[Page S5182]]\n\nfor workers in carbon-intensive industries, and for the poor and middle \nclass families who will find it even harder to pay their bills when \ncarbon constraints raise energy prices. Similarly, we cannot exacerbate \nthe competitive advantage enjoyed by manufacturers in foreign \ncountries. We must aggressively enforce our own trade laws, and address \nthe fact that many of our trade competitors do not regulate carbon.\n  I have serious reservations about the underlying bill. The President \nquickly issued a veto threat. For myself, I will continue to support \nprocedural votes to keep this debate moving forward, but let me be \nclear--I cannot support the bill in its current form. My amendment will \nimprove the bill, but I believe the need for major, urgent, front-\nloaded CCS research, development, and deployment transcends the bill \nbefore us. I intend to bring it back on other legislation moving in the \nfuture, and we should not hesitate to act on CCS as soon as possible, \nregardless of the outcome of this debate.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, over the past 5 years there has been a \nsea-change in the way we talk about climate change. I was hoping that \nthis debate would serve as an opportunity to constructively discuss the \nissue. Unfortunately, we are unable to offer amendments or probe into \nthe contents of this legislation. That is a real missed opportunity and \nI will be forced to oppose cloture.\n  Make no mistake about it; the Senate needs to discuss climate change. \nWe need an in-depth debate about climate change legislation which will \nhave profound environmental and economic impacts. Senators must be able \nto offer amendments in order to improve the legislation. That last time \nthe Senate considered legislation with as broad an environmental scope, \nthe Clean Air Act, we spent a total of 5 weeks debating the bill and \ntook close to 180 votes. With this legislation, we are taking less than \na week and voting on zero amendments.\n  I applaud the work that Senators  Warner and Lieberman have done on \nthis issue. The bill certainly advances the climate issue and they \ndeserve our appreciation. This legislation marks a truly comprehensive \neffort to address this issue.\n  Despite their best intentions, the Boxer substitute amendment that is \non the floor right now has some provisions that are troubling and omits \nimportant solutions to climate change that need debate.\n  Of particular concern to me was the inclusion of a provision in the \nlegislation that limited the number of credits rural electric co-ops \nwere eligible to receive. These credits were further narrowed by a \npilot program that diverted 15 percent of the remaining credits to co-\nops in Virginia and Montana. Co-ops and municipal power generators must \nbe treated equitably with investor owned utilities, IOUs. In 2005, we \npassed an energy bill that left out co-ops and municipals from seeing \nthe benefit of a nuclear production tax credit and federal loan \nguarantees. We need to be sure climate legislation does not do the \nsame.\n  Additionally, the legislation that we are debating has no references \nto nuclear power. I had planned to address this through the amendment \nprocess but unfortunately, we were unable to advance the debate on this \nbill. However, make no mistake, if we are to seriously address climate \nchange, nuclear must be part of the solution. The founder of \nGreenpeace, Dr. Patrick Moore, said it best:\n\n       Nuclear energy is the only large-scale, cost-effective \n     energy source that can reduce these emissions while \n     continuing to satisfy a growing demand for power. And these \n     days it can do so safely.\n\n  When it comes to climate change legislation, I am not a scientist and \nI don't pretend to be. So instead of focusing on the science of the \nissue, I would like to focus on what I know. And that is: we have an \nobligation to limit what we emit into the atmosphere.\n  Additionally, there is growing alarm over the national security \nimplications of climate change. From scarcity of food to increasing \nenergy dependence, the imperative to address this issue is growing. We \nneed to use climate change legislation as a driver for the new \ntechnologies that will enable us to break free from dependency on \nforeign energy sources.\n  There is a lot of concern over the economic impact of climate change \nlegislation. This is an important debate. We have to be honest; \naddressing this issue will have a significant cost and significant \nbenefits associated with it. However, I do believe that we can craft \nlegislation that can achieve our goals in a manner that benefits both \nour environment and our economy.\n  Manufacturers of components for nuclear power plants, windmills, and \nsolar power are looking to Washington to ascertain what the market will \nbe for their products. Climate change legislation can send the signals \nto the market that will foster innovation and drive technology \ndevelopment; especially in the area of nuclear power.\n  Ultimately the Senate will come together in the next few years to \nthoughtfully address this issue. I look forward to being a part of that \ndebate, and a part of the solution.\n Mrs. CLINTON. Madam President, the scientific consensus is \nclear: strong and swift action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is \nneeded to prevent catastrophic effects of climate change. That is why \nthe debate this week in the Senate about the cap-and-trade bill crafted \nby Senators Boxer, Lieberman and Warner is so important. This bill \nmakes steep reductions in emissions, encourages the development and \ndeployment of clean energy technology, provides assistance for American \nfamilies, training for workers that the clean energy industry will \ndemand. I congratulate Chairman Boxer for moving this bill to the \nfloor. It is a first step toward Congress enacting a cap-and-trade bill \nas part of a broad, comprehensive effort to combat global warming and \nreduce our dependence on foreign oil, including aggressive steps to \nimprove energy efficiency and deploy renewable energy that will benefit \nour economy and help create millions of new jobs. I believe that we can \nand should make this bill even stronger, and I hope that we can do that \nas we continue to consider the bill. For now, we need to move forward \non this important legislation. That is why I would vote for cloture on \nthis legislation if I were able to be present in the Senate for the \nvote. The time is now to move forward and deal with global warming, and \nI urge my colleagues to vote for cloture.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. What is the present business before the Senate?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/05/senate-section/article/S5182-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5182-S5188]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               FOOD, CONSERVATION, AND ENERGY ACT OF 2008\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to the consideration of H.R. 6124, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 6124) to provide for the continuation of \n     agricultural and other programs of the Department of \n     Agriculture through fiscal year 2012, and for other purposes.\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Madam President, I believe under the unanimous \nconsent, Senator Harkin and I have 10 minutes equally divided, Senator \nCoburn has 20 minutes, Senator DeMint has 30 minutes; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. I believe the Senator is correct.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. At this time I believe Senator Coburn requests the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I appreciate the cooperation of Senator \nHarkin and Senator Chambliss on allowing us to have some discussion on \nthe farm bill. The attempt was made to pass this by unanimous consent. \nUnanimous consent means that every Senator in the body agrees with the \nbill, agrees it should be passed, agrees it should not be amended, and \nshould not be debated.\n  I will offer no amendments in working with Senator Chambliss and \nSenator Harkin. However, I think it is very important, especially in \nlight of\n\n[[Page S5183]]\n\nthe recent WTO ruling which allows Brazil to administer approximately \n$5 billion in punitive penalties on American products going to Brazil \nbecause we are WTO noncompliant. I come from a farm State and I want to \ntell you I think this bill is not good for my farmers. As a matter of \nfact, I know it is not good for my farmers, especially when we think \nout in the distance.\n  Input costs have more than doubled for production agriculture in this \ncountry and the assumption--not implicitly, but nevertheless in this \nbill is the assumption of good prices in the future. Anybody who has \nbeen around farm community for any period of time recognizes that farm \nprices are erratic. My thoughts are what do we have in the farm bill \nwhen corn prices are back at $3 a bushel, when wheat prices are back at \n$2.50 or $3 a bushel, and when soybeans are back down at $5 a bushel \nwith input costs doubled? What we have done is we have cut $3.5 billion \nfrom the commodity title in this program.\n  The one thing that WTO says is compliant is direct payments. We have \ncut them by $313 million. I don't want farmers to get anything if they \ndon't need it, but food is important to us and I do not disagree that \nwe will use agriculture to help us in our energy needs. But I think in \nthe long run we have not done what we need to do for the American \nfarmer.\n  More importantly, and this is not to degrade the very hard work that \nwas done by the Agriculture Committee and the conference committee, is \nthat we have missed an opportunity to be good stewards with Americans' \nmoney. How can that be so? One is the bill extends ethanol provisions \nas livestock producers and consumers are struggling to pay for higher \nfeed costs. It takes 2 pounds of feed to gain a pound of weight in a \nchicken. It takes 4 pounds of feed to gain a pound in a hog. So the \ninput costs on food have risen dramatically.\n  We didn't eliminate the import duty on ethanol. If we think ethanol \nis an important aspect of our freedom in terms of energy independence, \nwhy do we have an import duty on ethanol coming into this country? Why \ndid we not fix the dollar blending for biofuels, biodiesel? Now large \nquantities are coming into this country. A small quantity of diesel is \nbeing blended to it, they are collecting $1 from the Federal Government \nand shipping the biodiesel fuel to Europe where they can get more money \nfor it. What in fact we did not eliminate is the subsidy to European \nbiodiesel in this bill.\n  This is basically a food bill, it is not an agricultural bill. Madam \nPresident, 73 percent of this bill goes for food and there are \nabsolutely no metrics on what we are doing in terms of our food \nprograms. There is no measurement, there are no performance indicators, \nthere are no qualifications as to are we meeting the needs? Is the \nmoney we are spending accomplishing our goal? We have no metrics in \nthat. There are none.\n  The bill steals money, much to the chagrin of the leaders in the \nSenate, for true agricultural programs and puts it into things that are \nnot agricultural at all. We took $250 million in an earmark in this \nbill for the Nature Conservancy to buy land in Montana for one person. \nWe are constructing a Chinese water garden in Washington, DC, in the \nArboretum, from a gift from the Chinese--but now we are going to pay \nfor it. We are spending $3.7 million in a noncompetitive grant for the \nUniversity of the District of Columbia to upgrade agriculture and food \nscience facilities. Granted, it is a land grant college. Why should not \nit have to compete? How do we know that is the best place to spend the \n$3.75 million?\n  We are spending money, at a time we are going to come close to a $1 \ntrillion deficit, on historic barn preservation? We are going to \npreserve falling-down barns at the time we add $3,000 per man, woman, \nand child in this country to their debt? We create a farm and ranch \nstress assistance network. After this bill they are going to need it. \nThey are going to need it--especially if crop prices fall. The safety \nnet is gone.\n  We have the highest prices historically we have ever had for \nasparagus and yet we put $15 million for asparagus prices from 3 years \nago in this bill.\n  We have $50 million for the Sheep Industry Improvement Center that \nhas two employees in Washington, DC. It halts a previous law that was \ngoing to privatize the center.\n  We also have a wonderful study to study methane release from \nlivestock operations. I would like for us to know, in the natural \nphysiologic condition of cattle, how we are going to eliminate \nflatulence? How we are going to spend money? We know it is there. We \nknow how much is there based on how many head of cattle there is. We \nare going to spend money to study it.\n  More importantly, this bill offends one of the most cherished beliefs \nof farmers and ranchers, and that is property rights--a guaranteed \nright in this country is put at risk under this bill. In addition to \nthe $250 million for the Nature Conservancy to buy more land, this bill \nauthorizes the Community Enforced and Open Space Conservation Program, \nwhich will give grants to local governments--Federal money; we don't \nhave it but we are going to give grants--and tribes, to buy up private \nforest land and put it into the hands of the Government. We are not \ngoing to have an option. We are going to let the Government agency give \ngrants and we are going to take land away from private landowners. That \nis what we are going to do. That is ultimately what will happen.\n  We added 100 million acres in Government land in the last 5 years in \nthis country. We added 100 million acres. What was the purpose for \nthis? The guise of protecting water supply, hunting opportunities and, \nin the bill itself, preventing obesity. We are going to prevent obesity \nby buying land.\n  Finally, the bill fails to rein in the USDA. It is the fifth largest \ncorporation in the world. It has 115,000 employees--11,000 here in DC. \nWe are still going to have a top-heavy bureaucracy and we are going to \nspend money on the bureaucracy instead of on the production of food, \nefficiency in the farm, and guaranteeing that Americans will have a \nsafe and secure food supply.\n  This is not to denigrate my colleagues. Most of this they didn't \nagree with. They had to trade to keep a half-way commonsense bill, so I \ndon't want Senator Harkin or Senator Chambliss to think--and I know \nthrough my conversations with them that this is stuff they had to \nswallow, coming out of a conference committee. This bill was never \ngoing to be easy. Yet after nearly 2 years of debate, Congress is going \nto pass a bill that fails to prioritize agricultural spending in any \nmeaningful way and what I believe, and it is my opinion, that what in \nthe future will be is life very much more difficult for the American \nfarmer and rancher.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Madam President, in a few minutes the Senate will once \nagain vote on a farm bill that expands the Federal Government's \nmanagement of farm and food programs while spending over $600 billion \nduring the next 10 years. I do not want to diminish in any way all the \nhard work of my Republican and Democratic colleagues and their very \ncapable staff, but I rise today to ask my fellow Senators to stop and \nthink about what we are doing to our country--not go just with this \nbill but what we have done as a Congress and as a Federal Government \nover the last few decades.\n\n  The farm bill is a symptom of a bigger problem. We are often so \nfocused on specific problems and issues and legislation that we fail to \nsee the cumulative effect of our work over many years. We can start \nwith what we have done to our culture and the character of our people. \nFor several decades, this Congress and our courts have turned right and \nwrong upside down and encouraged all kinds of costly and destructive \nbehavior. Our welfare programs have encouraged an epidemic of unwed \nbirths that cost our country over $150 billion a year and is the major \ncontributor to child abuse, crime, poverty, and school dropouts.\n  Our courts have ruled that pornography, abortion, and gay marriage \nare constitutional rights. The Federal Government has expanded casino \ngambling by legalizing it on Indian reservations, even in States where \ngambling is illegal. All these decisions and policies have proved \ndestructive and costly to our country.\n  The Federal Government's attempts to manage America's institutional \nservices and economy have been equally devastating. Over the past 10 \nyears, while I have been in the House and the\n\n[[Page S5184]]\n\nSenate, I have seen this Congress attempt to manage many aspects of our \nlives and our economy.\n  I will start with education. The quality of American education has \ndeclined since the 1970s, when the Federal Department of Education was \nestablished. By the year 2000, when President Bush took office, our \nGovernment-run education system was clearly not preparing our children \nto compete in the global economy.\n  No Child Left Behind expanded the Federal role and Federal spending \neven more. But there has been little discernible progress. We see some \nprogress in charter schools and specialty schools and other types of \nschools that break away from the Federal mold.\n  But this Congress continues to restrict the flexibility of States and \nthe freedom of parents to choose a school that works for their \nchildren.\n  We should also talk about what this Congress and the Federal \nGovernment has done to our health care system. Medicare and the \nGovernment fixed-rate system control virtually all the health care in \nAmerica today. A few years ago, this Congress decided to add \nprescription drug coverage to Medicare, even though the program was \nalready going broke.\n  Now, the program is hopelessly underfunded, and we continue to cut \nwhat Medicare pays doctors and hospitals to see our senior citizens. \nThe problem is fewer and fewer doctors want to see Medicare patients \nbecause they lose money when they treat them. So they charge their \npatients with private insurance more so fewer Americans can afford \nprivate insurance.\n  And fewer and fewer students are going into medicine because it is \nclear they are not going to be paid enough to make a decent living. So \nwe now expect and predict a physician shortage crisis as millions of \nbaby boomers are retiring. The solution for us is to make sure every \nAmerican has an insurance plan they can afford and keep, not to try to \nmanage health care from Washington.\n  Social Security is another example of Government mismanagement. \nInstead of saving the taxes we take from workers for Social Security, \nCongress has spent every dime, trillions of dollars. Now, in less than \n10 years, Social Security taxes will not be enough to pay benefits to \nseniors. Congress refuses to even talk about it.\n  Let's not forget what the Federal Government has done to our energy \nsituation in this country. Congressional attempts to manage America's \nenergy industry have been disastrous. To supposedly protect the \nenvironment, the Democrats shut down the development of new nuclear \npowerplants back in the 1970s. So America burns a lot more coal, while \nother countries expanded nuclear and reduced their coal consumption.\n  Now, the Democrats want to add huge taxes on coal to protect the \nenvironment, while still stalling development of nuclear generation. Go \nfigure. Two years ago, in the name of the environment, this Congress \nmandated a massive increase in the use of ethanol and gasoline. Since \nthen, the price of gasoline has nearly doubled and food prices have \nincreased dramatically around the world.\n  Why do I mention all these things that do not appear to relate to the \nfarm bill? I do it to remind my colleagues and all Americans that this \nCongress cannot manage any aspect of our country, and it is not \nintended to. Our job is to create a framework of law where freedom can \nprevail.\n  Instead, we attempt to manage where we cannot, and there is no \nevidence we have ever created any program that effectively or \nefficiently managed any aspect of the American economy or any aspect of \nour lives. Why do we continue to produce these massive Government \nprograms and spend trillions of dollars with the pretense that they \nwill actually work and make America better?\n  This Congress reminds me of Steve Urkel from the 1990 sitcom series \n``Family Matters.'' Steve and his clumsiness regularly created a \ndisaster wherever he went. He would always turn around and look at the \ndestruction he caused and ask innocently: Did I do that?\n  Well, colleagues, when you look at the price of gasoline, the \ncondition of our economy and our culture, the answer is: Yes, you did \ndo that.\n  America is the greatest Nation in the world. We have been blessed in \nways other nations can only dream of. Yet our future is uncertain. We \nface deficits as far as the eye can see. We are staring down the barrel \nof a looming financial crisis that threatens to bankrupt our country. \nYet we continue to spend money like there is no tomorrow.\n  If action is not taken soon, we will reach a tipping point in our two \nmajor entitlement programs, Social Security and Medicare, in which the \nprograms will pay out more money than they take in.\n  Our national debt is over $9 trillion today. And still, Washington \nwill spend over $25,000 per household this year. We are hopelessly \naddicted to spending. It is no wonder Congressional approval numbers \ncontinue on a downward spiral. Nobody trusts us anymore, and, frankly, \nwe do not deserve the trust of the American people because we continue \nto blindly spend their hard-earned tax dollars while racking up hedge \ndebts for our children and grandchildren that they will be forced to \nrepay.\n  Now, here we are again, taking a brief break from the climate tax \nbill that would cost the American people trillions of dollars to \nreconsider another big-spending boondoggle. The farm bill which weighs \nin at over $600 billion over the next 10 years, is chock-full of pork \nand excessive subsidies for favored and special interests groups.\n\n  The bill has numerous wasteful spending provisions. I will name a \nfew: New programs for Kentucky horse breeders, Pacific Coast salmon \nfishermen, and spending to help finance the dairy industry's ``Got \nMilk?'' campaign, so we should see more commercials soon.\n  It increases the price supports for the sugar industry and guarantees \n85 percent of the domestic sugar market at these guaranteed prices. \nThere is a $257 million tax earmark for the Plum Creek Timber Company, \nwhich is the Nation's largest private landowner, and a multibillion \ndollar company with a market capitalization in excess of $7 billion. \nThey are better off than we are as a government.\n  The language requires the U.S. Forest Service to sell portions of the \nGreen Mountain National Forest exclusively to the Bromley Ski Resort. \nThere is $1 million for the National Sheep and Goat Industry \nImprovement Center; politically targeted research earmarks for \nagricultural policy research centers at specific universities instead \nof allowing all universities and colleges to fairly compete for funding \nbased on merit.\n  According to Citizens Against Government Waste, this farm bill \nincludes $5.2 billion annually in direct payments to individuals, many \nof whom are no longer farming, without any regard to prices or income, \n60 percent of which go to the wealthiest 10 percent of recipients.\n  From where I stand, this bill looks like another big-spending \nWashington, DC, giveaway to special interests. Do we not understand the \nmess we are in?\n  Total Government spending has now reached more than one- third of \nAmerica's economy. U.S. tax rates keep getting more burdensome. Our top \ncorporate tax rate and income tax rate is 35 percent, while Europeans \nare undercutting American companies by lowering their rates \nsignificantly.\n  Recently, a front-page article in USA Today found that American \ntaxpayers are on the hook for a record $57.3 trillion in Federal \nliabilities to cover the lifetime benefits of everyone eligible for \nMedicare, Social Security, and other Government programs.\n  USA Today's analysis went on to point out that this is nearly \n$500,000, $\\1/2\\ million, for every American household. When \nobligations of State and local governments are added, the total rises \nto $61.7 trillion, or $531,000 per household. That is more than four \ntimes what Americans owe in personal debt such as mortgages.\n  While we are spending and taxing our way to reelection, many of our \nglobal competitors are lowering their tax rates and streamlining their \neconomies. Countries such as Ireland are lowering their tax rates and \nencouraging economic growth within their borders.\n  As a result, they are growing their economies and creating jobs. And \nwe wonder why we are falling behind? We are falling behind because of \npolitical mismanagement. This is what happens\n\n[[Page S5185]]\n\nwhen politicians think more about their next election than they do \nabout the next generation. When this happens, it becomes all about us \nand not about the American people.\n  This big-spending farm bill is a perfect example of this kind of \npolitical mismanagement. The leadership of this Congress was in such a \nhurry to pass a big-spending giveaway to special interests that they \nactually violated the Constitution to do it. Even a schoolchild knows \nthe Constitution requires the House and the Senate to pass the same \nbill and then present it to the President for his signature.\n  But, apparently, the Constitution is not as important to some as \npassing a $600 billion spending bill. The farm bill that was presented \nto the President for his signature or veto was not the bill passed by \nthe House of Representatives and the Senate.\n  The bill Congress voted on differed materially from the version that \nwas presented to the President. It contained a whole additional title, \nspanning 35 pages, dealing with international aid shipments and foreign \ntrade. Quite simply, what the President vetoed and what the House and \nthe Senate held a veto override vote on was not the bill Congress \npassed. It, therefore, failed the requirements of the Constitution and \ncould not be treated as law. That is why we have this new bill on the \nfloor today.\n  Regardless of the reasons for this constitutional, I will not say \ncrisis, but mess, the fact is an officer of the House and an officer of \nthe Senate usurped the will of the two bodies and materially changed \nthe content of legislation.\n  Even worse, by holding a veto override, Congress attempted to make a \nbill it never passed the law of the land. This is why I voted \n``present'' on the farm bill. Once we were aware of the mistake, we \nshould have stopped and passed a temporary extension. This abuse of \npower or sloppiness may only be the consequence of incompetence, but if \nwe do not draw the line in the sand and demand that our bills meet \nconstitutional requirements, what will stop even greater, and possibly \neven more malicious, abuses of power?\n  The Senate needs to reject this bill, pass a year-long extension of \nthe farm bill, and go back to the drawing board so the policy and the \nprocess are something we can be proud of and that will truly strengthen \nour Nation.\n  We must come to grips with the fact that our actions are hurting the \nAmerican people. We cannot continue to spend and spend and expect our \neconomy to remain strong and free. Already our spending is catching up \nto us. I hope we will think long and hard about our actions. What we \nare doing will hurt future generations.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against the bill. I ask unanimous \nconsent to have printed in the Record some information regarding \nenrollment and the problems we have been having with getting our bills \nsent to the President in the correct order.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     To: House Republican Members.\n     Fr: Roy Blunt.\n     Dt: May 22, 2008.\n     Re: The Democrat Majority's Farm Bill Foul Up.\n       We all know that mistakes happen, but it is how you respond \n     to a mistake once you are aware of it that matters. The \n     attached memo outlines some of the most disturbing aspects of \n     how the Democrat Leadership is handling the enrollment errors \n     surrounding the Farm Bill.\n     What Did They Know, When Did They Know It, and What Did They \n         Do About It?:\n       It appears the Democrat Leadership was informed by the \n     Office of the Law Revision Counsel and the Committee on \n     Agriculture that the bill sent to and vetoed by the President \n     was erroneous PRIOR to consideration of the veto override.\n       Despite this knowledge and despite requests from staff from \n     the Republican Leader's office, the Democrat Leadership \n     proceeded with the veto override of a bill they knew was not \n     the bill passed by both Houses of Congress.\n       Importantly, there were opportunities to correct the \n     enrollment error consistent with past practice and in a \n     constitutionally sound manner if the Democrat Leadership had \n     not rushed ahead with the veto override. Once they moved \n     forward, however, they foreclosed those opportunities.\n       When confronted on the House Floor by the Republican \n     Leader, Whip, and Rules Ranking Member, the Majority Leader \n     defended the Leadership's actions and professed a \n     constitutional theory that so long as both the House and \n     Senate had passed the same language, it didn't matter whether \n     or not the Speaker sent the whole bill passed by the House \n     and Senate or simply parts of it to the President.\n     The Dangers of the Democrats' New Theory:\n       Under the theory espoused by the Majority Leader, the \n     Speaker of the House can simply pick and choose (either \n     overtly or as a result of a mistake made by an enrolling \n     clerk) which parts of final bills to send to the President. \n     If she is uncomfortable with a provision that was included as \n     part of a compromise, she could in theory exclude it from the \n     bill when she sends it to the President.\n       Importantly, the Speaker's decision to omit language if \n     challenged by Members of the House through a question of \n     privilege, can simply be tabled by the majority.\n     Who Pressured the Enrolling Clerk to Quickly Complete the \n         Enrollment:\n       In a memo prepared by the House Clerk on May 21, 2008, the \n     Clerk asserts that part of the mistake was a result of a ten-\n     year-old flawed enrolling process, yet she goes on to state \n     that ``During a review of this process, Enrolling Division \n     staff expressed a concern in receiving direct calls from \n     Leadership and the Committee to accelerate the enrolling \n     process.'' Who pressured the enrolling staff?\n                                  ____\n\n     To: Hon. Nancy Pelosi, Speaker;\n     Hon. John Boehner, Republican Leader;\n     Hon. Steny Hoyer, Majority Leader.\n     Form: Lorraine C. Miller, Clerk.\n     Re: Farm Bill Omission.\n     Date: May 21, 2008.\n       Today's issue with H.R. 2419, Food Conservation and Energy \n     Act of 2008, was the result of a ten year old flawed \n     enrolling process. The process did not validate the parchment \n     copy of the bill against the Committee Conference Report.\n       Normally when a bill is received by the Enrolling Division \n     in multiple sections from a Committee, it is assembled, \n     printed on regular white paper and proofed against the \n     original Committee Conference Report. Once the bill has been \n     reviewed it goes through an electronic conversion process and \n     is printed on parchment paper but not compared to the \n     Committee Conference Report again. We believe that Title III \n     was dropped during the conversion process.\n       The current process of proofing the white paper copy was \n     adopted ten years ago as a cost saving measure due to the \n     high cost of parchment paper. That process has been rescinded \n     effective immediately. We are instituting a new process \n     whereby we will proofread the parchment copy of the bill \n     against the Committee Conference Report instead of the white \n     paper copy. This procedure will eliminate potential issues \n     with the document conversion process. We have begun a review \n     of the electronic conversion process to insure that problems \n     are identified early.\n       During a review of this process, Enrolling Division staff \n     expressed a concern in receiving direct calls from Leadership \n     and the Committee to accelerate the enrolling process. In \n     order to effectively move the enrolling process of bills, we \n     strongly urge that all communication is funneled through the \n     Speaker's Office, thus allowing the Enrolling Division to \n     have an orderly process.\n       We are working diligently to make sure it will not happen \n     again.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                     [From Roll Call, June 5, 2008]\n\n                     Farm Bill Glitch Stalls House\n\n                         (By Steven T. Dennis)\n\n       Two days before the Memorial Day recess, the House devolved \n     into chaos Wednesday night over a technical error in the way \n     the farm bill was sent to President Bush, who vetoed it on \n     Wednesday morning.\n       According to House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-Md.), the \n     enrolling clerk inadvertently omitted the entire Title III \n     section of the bill after the House and Senate had both \n     passed it, but before it was sent to the president.\n       The mistake was not noticed by lawmakers or President Bush \n     until after he had vetoed it. The House proceeded to override \n     Bush's veto, 316-108, late on Wednesday.\n       But House GOP leaders quickly objected, raising \n     constitutional issues and harkening back to Democratic \n     protests over a $2 billion enrolling error in the Deficit \n     Reduction Act signed by Bush in 2006. That action resulted in \n     a slew of lawsuits.\n       House Agriculture Chairman Collin Peterson (D-Minn.) said \n     he hoped his bill would avoid that fate.\n       ``There better not be any damn lawsuits. I'm tired of it,'' \n     he said of the bill.\n       But Republicans were not so sanguine, with House Minority \n     Leader John Boehner (Ohio) saying he might even make a motion \n     to vacate the override vote.\n       ``What's happened here raises serious constitutional \n     questions,'' Boehner said. ``I don't know how we can proceed \n     with the override as it occurred.''\n       ``Nor do I think we should proceed with some attempt to fix \n     it until such time as we understand what happened, what are \n     the precedents of the House and how do we move forward,'' \n     Boehner said.\n       Hoyer suggested that leadership from both sides of the \n     aisle meet to hammer out a compromise with the current farm \n     bill expiring on Thursday and a one-week recess set to start \n     Friday night.\n       Noting that Title III was not controversial, Hoyer \n     suggested that the House take it up under suspension of the \n     rules on Thursday and then send it on to the president. He \n     did not see any constitutional issues at first glance, the \n     Democrat noted, because both\n\n[[Page S5186]]\n\n     the House and Senate passed an identical farm measure.\n       But House Minority Whip Roy Blunt (R-Miss.) contended that \n     a president could not selectively veto portions of a bill, \n     and said such a move raised all kinds of constitutional \n     questions.\n       ``The concept that we can start sending bills over \n     piecemeal . . . is a flawed concept,'' Blunt said.\n       Blunt later told reporters that the House and Senate should \n     redo the farm bill in its entirety to avoid legal problems.\n       ``I'd like to see a farm bill pass that no judge can say is \n     not the farm bill,'' Blunt said.\n       Boehner conceded that mistakes happen, but said that the \n     House should not have moved forward with an override vote \n     once the mistake became clear.\n       ``In deference to all Members, we could have waited before \n     consideration of the override so all Members could understand \n     what they're dealing with,'' Boehner said.\n       Peterson learned of the glitch late Wednesday, after \n     President Bush vetoed the bill.\n       ``For some reason, the machine didn't print it out and \n     nobody noticed it,'' Peterson said. Peterson said he was told \n     the president's staff noticed the error after he vetoed it.\n       Title III of the farm bill, dealing with trade and foreign \n     aid provisions, was omitted as a result.\n       Peterson said that they had asked the Parliamentarians if \n     they could simply re-enroll the bill and send it to the \n     president, but the Parliamentarians objected.\n       ``After all I've been through, I thought, `What can happen \n     today? ' Peterson said.\n       Peterson predicted that the provision on its own would \n     still have enough support to override a veto, although he \n     held out hope that Bush might sign it.\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, the Constitution requires Congress to \nobserve certain processes to make statutory law. Contrary to the \napparent assumption of some in this body, Congress does not possess the \npower to intentionally ignore requirements provided in the \nConstitution's text. Article I, Section 7, prescribes a bicameral \nrequirement to present a bill to the President. H.R. 2419, as enrolled, \ndid not pass both chambers of Congress.\n  The House and Senate passed Farm Bill included Title III. A clerical \nerror omitted the entirety of Title III in the enrolled bill presented \nto the President. The bill sent to the President, no matter the \nsignificance of the error, did not receive the consent of both chambers \nof Congress, and therefore fails to fulfill the necessary predicate to \npresentment contained in the Presentment Clauses of Article I. In fact, \nthe measure sent to the President does not qualify as a ``bill'' at all \nunder Article I, Section 7. I implore the President to disregard H.R. \n2419 as an unconstitutional measure, without the status of law.\n  Despite the dubious status of the Farm Bill, the Majority Leader \nassured the Senate that:\n\n       We have a good legal precedent going back to a case . . . \n     in 1892, when something like this happened before. It is \n     totally constitutional to do what we are planning to do. So \n     no one should be concerned about that.\n\n  The Majority Leader alluded to Marshall Field & Co. v. Clark, in \nwhich the Supreme Court announced the ``enrolled bill rule,'' to \nassuage any constitutional consternation held by Senators. However the \nSenator from Nevada mischaracterizes the Supreme Court's ruling in \nMarshall Field, as the decision relates only to the:\n\n     . . . nature of evidence upon which a court may act when the \n     issue is made as to whether a bill, originating in the house \n     of representatives or the senate, and asserted to have become \n     a law, was or was not passed by congress.\n\n  The Marshall Field Court did not adjudicate the constitutionality of \nan improperly enrolled bill, but rather only reached the question of \njusticiability. The Court did not find the issue of constitutionality \njusticiable. Marshall Field merely expressed the Supreme Court's \ndeference to a ``coequal and independent'' department's internal \nauthentication processes. A bill signed by the Speaker of the House and \nthe President of the Senate, ``in open session . . . is an official \nattestation by the two houses'' that a bill received the consent of \nboth chambers for the purpose of justiciability.\n  Marshall Field received renewed attention in recent years as courts \ngrappled with circumstances similar to those presented by the Farm \nBill. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 generated litigation that \nchallenged the Act's constitutionality because ``it did not pass the \nHouse in the form in which it was passed by the Senate, signed by the \nPresident, and enrolled as a Public Law.'' The litigation did not \nprovide any ruling on the merits; the ``enrolled bill rule'' \npromulgated in Marshall Field precluded the district courts from any \nexamination of ``congressional documents . . . to ascertain whether the \nlanguage in the enrolled bill comport[ed] with versions that appear in \nlegislative sources which precede[d] enrollment.'' The ``claim of \nunconstitutionality for a violation of Article I, Section 7, `is not \nlegally cognizable where an enrolled bill has been signed by the \npresiding officers of the House and Senate as well as the President.' \n''\n\n  The judiciary's reluctance to entertain the merits of claims under \nArticle I, Section 7 does not bar members of the House and Senate from \nconsideration thereof. President Jackson explicated the authority of \neach branch to interpret the Constitution independently:\n\n       The Congress, the Executive, and the Court must each for \n     itself be guided by its own opinion of the Constitution . . . \n     It is as much the duty of the House of Representatives, of \n     the Senate, and of the President to decide upon the \n     constitutionality of any bill or resolution which may be \n     presented to them for passage or approval as it is of the \n     supreme judges when it may be brought before them for \n     judicial decision. The opinion of the judges has no more \n     authority over Congress than the opinion of Congress has over \n     the judges, and on that point the President is independent of \n     both.\n\n  Upon election and in cases of subsequent reelection, every Member of \nCongress swears allegiance to the Constitution of the United States in \nan Oath. Members ``solemnly swear . . . [to] support and defend the \nConstitution . . . [to] bear true faith and allegiance to the same . . \n. and . . . [to] well and faithfully discharge the duties of the \noffice'' to which elected. The Oath of Office imposes an obligation on \nMembers of Congress to interpret the Constitution and act within its \nframework.\n  The Presentment Clauses of the Constitution require the assent of \nboth chambers for each bill presented to the President. Article I, \nSection 7, Clause 2 provides:\n\n       Every Bill which shall have passed the House of \n     Representatives and the Senate, shall, before it become a \n     Law, be presented to the President of the United States; If \n     he approve he shall sign it, but if not he shall return it, \n     with his Objections to that House in which it shall have \n     originated . . .\n\n  Article I, Section 7, Clause 3 elaborates:\n\n       Every Order, Resolution, or Vote to which the Concurrence \n     of the Senate and House of Representatives may be necessary \n     (except on a question of Adjournment) shall be presented to \n     the President of the United States . . .\n\n  The two clauses stipulate ``the exclusive method for passing federal \nstatutes.'' Bills enrolled and presented to the President must have \nreceived the assent of both the House and Senate, irrespective of \nauthentication by the Speaker of the House and the President of the \nSenate.\n  So we've had bicameralism without presentment for the engrossed bill. \nAnd we've had presentment without bicameralism for the enrolled bill. \nNeither is sufficient. Contrary to the position of the Speaker of the \nHouse and the Senate Majority Leader, authentication of an invalid bill \ndoes not displace the bill's nugatory status; the signatures of the \nSpeaker of the House and President of the Senate do not represent the \nwill of the House and Senate and fall short of the bicameral \nrequirement in the Presentment Clause. Congress may not jettison or \nsuspend disagreeable parts of the Constitution. The Bill, as presented \nto the President, did not receive the consent of both chambers. As \nsuch, the bill is null and void, for it does not meet the requirements \nset forth in the Constitution. Shall this Congress crucify the \nConstitution on the cross of agribusiness?\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, for consideration of this version of the \nfarm bill, I reference and reiterate the statements I made for the \nRecord regarding the farm bill's nutrition assistance title when the \nSenate overrode the President's veto.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I am sorry we have to be back on the \nfloor again with the farm bill. I was hoping we might have a voice \nvote, since we have all voted on this twice before; I am sure no votes \nwould change.\n\n[[Page S5187]]\n\n  But I did wish to at least explain for the Record and for Senators \nwhy we are here. Now, the Senator from South Carolina talked about the \nmissing title, and how it rendered the veto override process \nunconstitutional.\n  Well, I am as upset about it as anyone else. I know Senator Chambliss \nis too. We are all upset about this. But let me try to put it in \nperspective as to what happened. The House passed a bill, we passed a \nbill. We got to conference. We worked it all out.\n  It went to the enrolling clerk in the House. How this happened I \ndon't know. But somehow the enrolling clerk, in enrolling it, dropped \ntitle III. There are 15 titles to this bill. One title was left out. \nFor some reason no one caught it. So the bill was held by the enrolling \nclerk for 3 or 4 days. The President was overseas. He came back on \nMonday night, on May 19th I believe, and the enrolling clerk then sent \nthe bill down to the White House the next day. The White House didn't \ncatch it either. The President vetoed the bill, sent it back down to \nthe Hill. It was only then, before it came up for a veto override in \nthe House, that it was realized that one title was missing. I don't \nbelieve there was any maliciousness to this. Nothing was materially \nchanged. When the Senator from South Carolina spoke about this problem, \nit sounded as if there was some underhanded effort to materially change \nthe bill. That was not the case. It was simply a mistake the enrolling \nclerk made. Again, why that happened and how, there has been a lot of \ntalk about that. I don't know. I am fairly convinced that it was an \ninadvertent clerical error.\n  Secondly, I want to correct one other misstatement by the Senator \nfrom South Carolina. When we overrode the President's veto on 14 of the \n15 titles, the Parliamentarian basically told us that those titles did \nbecome law. They are the law of the land. So 14 of the 15 titles are \nlaw. What is not law is title III that was left out. It was decided \nthat rather than only taking up title III and passing it, we would take \nthe whole bill back, include title III in it, as it was before, and \nsend it back to the President. That is what we have before us. We have \nbefore us basically exactly what we voted on before, no changes. It is \nexactly what we voted on before in the conference report on May 15. I \nwanted to make that clear, that nothing has been changed. It is the \nsame exact bill on which we had 81 votes in the Senate; 81 Members \nvoted for the conference report that is exactly what we have before us \ntoday.\n  I wanted to take a couple minutes to underscore the critical \nimportance of doing this and enacting the missing title. The other \ntitles are law. It is critical that we enact title III which covers \ntrade and international food aid programs. These provisions not only \nreauthorize but they reform a lot of our programs. As we speak, an \nemergency summit on the consequences of high food prices organized by \nthe Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations is \nwrapping up in Rome. The specific food aid programs authorized in this \ntitle are the title II Food for Peace program; the Food for Progress \nprogram; the McGovern-Dole Food for Education Program; and the holding \nof food stocks for emergency purposes under the Bill Emerson \nHumanitarian Trust.\n  Although authority for most of these programs expired on May 23, a \nshort-term lapse, as I have talked with the U.S. Agency for \nInternational Development, does not cause serious problems. A longer \nlapse, however, would impede our ability to provide food aid. The new \ntrade title needs to be enacted for these programs to be operational \nagain. Right now, according to the USAID administrator, we cannot enter \ninto any new agreements for assistance under the title II program. \nUSAID has identified need for emergency assistance in Ethiopia and \nSomalia, and recently finalized a deal with North Korea for proper \noversight of food aid provided to that country. None of these \nactivities can move forward until we enact the trade title into law. \nUSAID wants to provide additional food aid under title II to the people \nof Burma in the aftermath of the cyclone, but they can't do that until \nwe enact this title. Were an event, God forbid, of the magnitude of the \n2004 East Asian tsunami to occur or an earthquake or some other natural \ndisaster, the United States Government would not be able to respond \nimmediately with food aid unless we pass this title. That is why it is \nso important that we do this.\n  I might also add that the Government Accountability Office had given \nus numerous recommendations for reforming our food aid programs. I \nwon't go through all of those, but there were three basic \nrecommendations needing statutory changes. All three of those are \naddressed in the trade title. All in all, the provisions of this title \nare noncontroversial and needed to ensure the continuity of U.S. food \naid and trade promotion programs.\n  I hope we can complete this debate and get this title enacted into \nlaw as soon as possible.\n  I thank so much my colleague and friend from Georgia, Senator \nChambliss, for all his hard work on this bill. It has been a long \ngrind, but we have a good bill. We have a farm bill that is supported \nby every major farm organization in the country, a bill that is \nsupported by emergency food groups, the food banks, the religious \ngroups. This was a broadly supported bill. It is a good bill. It is \ngood for our States. It is good for our farmers and ranchers. It is \ngood for the people of America. I thank Senator Chambliss for all his \nhard work in bringing this bill to fruition.\n  To all Senators, I apologize that we have to be back here again. As I \nsaid, this was a mistake made by the clerk in the House, not by the \nSenate. Therefore, we have to be here again.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 5 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I yield 1 minute to the Senator from North Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank Senator Chambliss for this minute. \nI thank the chairman of the committee as well for his leadership in \nbringing this bill back because of the unfortunate clerical error made \nin the House that necessitates it. I wanted to report briefly to our \ncolleagues on the budget circumstances, because we have seen \nmisreporting in the press, and it needs to be made abundantly clear the \nbudget circumstance we face.\n  The conference report on the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act that \nwas overwhelmingly supported on a bipartisan basis in both the House \nand Senate is fully paid for over both the 5- and 10-year periods. That \nis not my determination; that is the determination of the Congressional \nBudget Office. They say over the first 5 years, it saves $67 million; \nover 10 years, it saves $110 million. The farm bill is fully pay-go \ncompliant. It is fully paid for. It does not add a dime to the debt. \nThe bill is identical to the conference report already passed and \nscored by CBO. The spending contained in the original bill has already \nbeen assumed. Therefore, this legislation has no additional cost.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. We have passed it \noverwhelmingly before. I wanted to make certain that this is in the \nRecord so it is understood that this bill is fully paid for. It adds \nnothing to the debt.\n  Again, I thank our colleagues: the chairman of the committee, for his \nvision and leadership; and to our very able ranking member, the Senator \nfrom Georgia, who has been such a rock as we have gone through this \nprocess. We appreciate so much what they have done. This is good for \nthe country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, here we are, as Senator Harkin said, \nback again for one more vote on the farm bill. As I told my colleagues \nat lunch today, I wish I thought this would be the last one. We may \nhave one more, if the President vetoes this bill. We may be back here \nagain. But what a great opportunity it has been to work with Chairman \nHarkin and Senator Conrad, who is my dear friend. We became much closer \nfriends during this process because we spent a lot more time together \nthan we did with our spouses as we got through final negotiation. What \ngreat assets they have been for American agriculture.\n  I appreciate my colleague from South Carolina and my colleague from\n\n[[Page S5188]]\n\nOklahoma. I told them to come down and talk about anything they wanted \nto. They talked about the same things we have talked about over the \nlast three debates on this bill. Is this a perfect bill? It absolutely \nis not. Farm bills are always massive pieces of legislation. It is a 5-\nyear bill. It spends $600 billion over 10 years. I had my staff check, \nthough, and while I appreciate the comments of the Senator from South \nCarolina, the 2002 farm bill spent $800 billion over 10 years. So we \nare $200 billion below the 2002 farm bill on a 10-year basis.\n  Again, it is not perfect. But what it does do is provide a school \nlunch program to needy kids as well as kids who can afford to pay. We \nare providing food stamps to people in this country who would go hungry \notherwise. We are providing a food bank supplement to our food banks \naround the country that provide such great, valuable services to hungry \npeople in America. We are providing the right kind of tax incentives in \nthe form of reforming the Endangered Species Act in a positive way. We \nhave been trying to reform the Endangered Species Act in all of my 14 \nyears in Congress. This is the first time we have been able to do it. \nWe did it with 250 organizations supporting it. We have good tax \nprovisions that allow the perpetuation of land so it can't be developed \nforever. My children and my grandchildren will have the ability to \nenjoy farmland in my part of Georgia that they might otherwise not have \nthe opportunity to enjoy.\n  So is it a perfect bill? No. Do we provide a safety net for farmers? \nYou bet we do. Prices are not always going to be high. We depend today \non foreign imports of oil for 62 percent of our needs. We can never, \never afford to depend on importing food into this country in the same \npercentage that we import oil today.\n  While it is not a perfect bill, while there are things that, if I had \nto write it by myself, I might not have written it this way, overall it \nis a very good piece of legislation. It covers a broad swath of \nAmerica, from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving \ngood tax policy.\n  With that, I ask for passage of this bill. On behalf of Senator \nDeMint, who is not here--and I know a lot of my folks would like to \nhave a voice vote, but because I know Senator DeMint wants the yeas and \nnays, unfortunately, I will have to ask for the yeas and nays on behalf \nof Senator DeMint and ask for a recorded vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, first of all, let me just speak as a \nconservative as we address the farm bill. First of all, I have been \nranked as the most conservative Member, so I don't think I should have \nto prove my credentials.\n  Here is one of the things that people should understand: They should \nunderstand that the vote today on the farm bill was not a vote on this \nfarm bill or another farm bill; it was a vote on this farm bill or \nreauthorizing the 2002 farm bill.\n  A couple of things that are in here that people should know in a \nconservative way are, No. 1, under the previous farm bill that would \nhave been reauthorized, a farmer could be making up to $2.5 million and \nstill get subsidies. This takes it down to a half million.\n  Secondly, the three-entity rule is out in this farm bill. Previously, \nsomeone could be claiming these benefits under three different farms; \nnow they can't do that. So there are many reasons to vote for this bill \nother than those things that people have been talking about during the \ndebate. I believe that is a conservative vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the third reading and \npassage of the bill.\n  The bill (H.R. 6124) was ordered to a third reading and was read the \nthird time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the \nquestion is, Shall the bill pass?\n  The yeas and nays are ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Delaware (Mr. Biden), \nthe Senator from West Virginia (Mr. Byrd), the Senator from New York \n(Mrs. Clinton), the Senator from Massacusetts (Mr. Kennedy), the \nSenator from Illinois (Mr. Obama), and the Senator from Virginia (Mr. \nWebb) are necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nDelaware (Mr. Biden) would vote ``yea.''\n  Mr. KYL. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire (Mr. Gregg) and the Senator from Arizona (Mr. \nMcCain).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I think coming from a State such as Alaska where we can see \nthe effects of climate change on the ground in my home State, it is a \nvery important issue for me, and so I feel compelled to share with my \ncolleagues some of my thoughts about what we are seeing up north.\n  We appreciate that there is not quite a consensus in Alaska about \nwhat is causing the change we are seeing. Most Alaskans, however, do \nseem to agree that something is happening. We are seeing a change in \nthe north, and we have been seeing it for a period of decades. The \nresults are having a significant impact on the lifestyle of Alaskans.\n\n[[Page S5189]]\n\n  One of the things we are seeing in a northern State, an arctic State \nsuch as Alaska is that our winters are warmer. We are seeing breakup \ncome earlier in the spring, although this spring it has been actually \nextra snowy, so it is tough to say that it is always that way, but we \nare seeing breakup coming earlier. Our summers seem to be hotter. The \nstorms we are seeing, particularly along the coastline, are stronger. \nWe are seeing a migration. We are seeing wildlife habitation and \nmigration patterns that are different. The oceans, the lakes, the river \nice--we are seeing this form later in the year. We are also seeing that \nit forms and it is weaker than we have seen. It is melting sooner in \nthe spring. We are seeing permafrost thawing in some places. All of \nthis has an impact on hunting, on fishing, on the roads as we travel, \ncertainly, on the construction that is underway in the State, and \nsometimes on our very way of life.\n  Last week, the National Science and Technology Council released its \nlatest assessment of what has been happening due to climate change. \nWhile this report has already been mentioned by several on this floor \nalready, I wish to concentrate on its findings for Alaska. In that \nreport, it finds that temperatures in the State of Alaska have \nincreased 3 to 5 degrees Fahrenheit on average, and in the winters, \nwhat we are seeing is that the winters are 7 to 10 degrees warmer over \nthe past 50 years. That warming has a number of impacts.\n  Mr. President, these are important for all Members to hear. When we \ntalk about the ice in the Arctic sea icepack, the pack ice up north has \nshrunk by an area which is twice the size of Texas. This reduction in \nthe ice has occurred since 1979. So within this time period, about 30 \nyears, we have seen an area shrunk that is twice the size of Texas. \nBetween the years 2005 and 2007, 23 percent more of the ice has melted. \nMore important, what we are seeing is that the thick, multiyear ice has \nbeen steadily thinning, having reduced by about 3 feet from 1987 to \n1997, which means more of the Beaufort Sea is open by late summer, \nwhich increases the danger of the coastal erosion from the storms. More \ntroubling, it helps to warm the water and thus the environment even \nmore.\n  We have nearly a dozen coastal villages in the State of Alaska that \nneed major assistance. In some cases, it is more than assistance in \nshoring up an eroding coastline, it is relocation of whole villages to \nhigher ground. This is at a cost of hundreds of millions of dollars per \nvillage. Ask the residents of villages such as Shishmaref, Kivalina, \nUnalakleet, and Newtok--to name four--about the changes they have \nwitnessed in the climate over the past two decades. We are seeing that \non the coastline.\n  The report says the permafrost base in Alaska has been thawing at a \nrate of up to 1.6 inches a year since 1992. This thawing of the \npermafrost impacts the base for roads, pipelines, houses, sewer lines, \nand other surface features. We also know our lakes are drying up. This \nis probably because the permafrost that holds their water is melting.\n  We know the Alaskan tree line is creeping northward, moving about 6 \nmiles over several decades. The Federal report, while it predicts more \nsummer precipitation in Alaska, also predicts more summer heat. That is \nincreasing the threat of Alaska wildfires, increasing the threat of \nhigh stream temperatures that could harm our salmon, and increasing the \nthreat of new types of diseases entering Alaska.\n  Scientists who have worked on the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on \nClimate Change believe the ultimate cause is an increase in manmade \ncarbon dioxide and other so-called greenhouse gases added to the \natmosphere since the dawn of the industrial revolution.\n  Yet there is also a great deal of natural variation--Mother Nature at \nplay here--which affects the Earth's climate. In April, the Journal of \nNature printed a study suggesting that rising atmospheric temperatures \nare slowly, and perhaps have already stopped, rising--at least \ntemporarily--and may remain that way for up to 7 more years as the \nnatural variation cycle toward colder weather masks the heat.\n  It may seem counterintuitive to be arguing that climate change is \nintensifying after a very cold and snowy winter in Alaska. But I look \nat climate change legislation as an insurance policy, as a policy to \ntake action to cut carbon emissions where we can, without harmful costs \nto our economy and way of life.\n  The fact that I am a cosponsor of the Bingaman-Specter carbon cap-\nand-trade bill is proof that I am willing to take action but not \nnecessarily action at any price. I am not afraid of a cap-and-trade \nsystem, but let's make sure we have it right.\n  I do support the cap-and-trade concept because I believe it offers \nthe opportunity to reduce carbon, at the least cost to society. The \nsignal about future prices sent to electric powerplant operators will \nhopefully stimulate spending on low- and zero-carbon renewable energy \nplants now.\n  A price signal will make gasification technology more attractive as a \nmeans of producing petrochemicals for the future. It will spur research \nand new technology to allow for the commercial-scale plants needed to \ncapture and store carbon underground. I believe a price signal will \nalso generate new technology and new jobs--hopefully, more than will be \nlost in fossil industries and from an overall slowdown in the economy \ncaused by the potentially high cost of industry buying carbon emissions \nat auctions and passing the costs on to each one of us.\n  When you listen to all the suggestions and ideas out there, you may \nthink: What is it I am looking for in a perfect carbon bill? I guess my \nperfect bill would set a price signal only high enough to encourage \ntechnological change but without driving the poor and lower to middle-\nincome Americans into a state where they cannot afford to get to work \nor they have to make choices between paying the heating bill or setting \nfood on the table.\n  My perfect carbon bill would ``front-load'' the research and \ntechnology costs, with the Federal Government picking up a large share \nof that initial tab, until we perfect that new technology that permits \nthe new energy sources to come on line at only slightly higher costs--\nprices high enough to encourage energy efficiency and conservation but \nnot so high as to fundamentally alter American society.\n  My perfect carbon bill would set up clear procedures to help finance \nthat new technology and development. Senator Domenici has proposed a \nclean energy bank concept. This is not included in this measure, but it \nhelps to set up those procedures that can allow us to move this \ntechnology forward.\n  It would encourage all low- and zero-carbon technology, especially \nnuclear power, which is the only technology we have today at scale that \ncan provide baseload power economically without carbon.\n  A perfect carbon bill, for me, would set the guidelines for carbon \nreductions but only standards that we have the technology to meet. It \nwould not set unreasonable, early guidelines simply to punish the \ncarbon emitters. It would have a workable ``safety valve'' to ease the \nregulations, if technology cannot come through quickly enough with \nmeans for our society to meet the lower carbon standards at a \nreasonable price. This is where--when you look at the Bingaman-Specter \nbill and the safety valve they have incorporated in that legislation--\nit provides for a level of assurance in terms of how bad is the \nsituation going to be in terms of the cost and the impact to the \nindustry. You kind of want to know how bad the bad is going to be so \nyou have a level of certainty.\n  My perfect bill would generate enough revenue to help States and \nlocal governments deal with the costs of adaptation. If the scientists \nare right on this, the carbon that we have and are going to continue to \nrelease into the atmosphere until the new technology can come on line \nis going to continue to increase for a number of years. There will be \ncosts that come with that.\n  In Alaska, the University of Alaska's Institute of Social and \nEconomic Research has estimated that Alaska's governmental \ninfrastructure--the roads, villages, ports, runways, and the schools--\nare already facing about $3 billion of damage due to coastal erosion \nand melting permafrost. They anticipate that tally, that cost, will \nrise to $80 billion by 2080, just for the governmental structures. Only \nthe Federal Government has the resources to meet those types of costs.\n\n[[Page S5190]]\n\n  I believe the substitute we have before us is making a major mistake \nin cutting the funding for the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance \nProgram and in cutting funding for the State-Federal weatherization \nprograms that promote energy conservation. When you look at the current \nsubstitute--and I have issues in many areas--these two are ones I am \nnot able to reconcile why, as we are trying to help people around the \ncountry deal with high energy costs, we would remove funding for LIHEAP \nand the weatherization programs.\n  I am also concerned that the substitute's cost-containment mechanisms \nare not flexible enough to keep companies from having to bid up the \nprice of auction allowances. That will hurt average Americans who \ncannot afford the current price of energy, much less the future price \nof energy.\n  People around the country are hurting when they go to the pump, when \nthey heat their homes, when they have to fill up with home heating \nfuel. We don't need to be adding more to their costs unnecessarily.\n  Regardless, for any climate bill we enact to make a difference, it is \ngoing to require that China, which has overtaken America as the world's \nleading carbon emitter, and India, along with the developing world, \nparticipate too. If they are not participating and working with us, the \nU.S. economy is going to become less competitive, and we will have \nspent money without any necessary benefits to the global environment. \nSo we have to be in partnership on this initiative.\n\n  Already on the floor, we have heard about the varying computer \nmodels. They are all over the board. They say the average American will \npay either $446, $739 or $1,957 more per household for energy in 2020 \nor $1,257, $4,377 or $6,750 more come 2030 or 2050. You look at it, and \nyou are almost embarrassed to tell your constituent the range is \nsomewhere between $446 per household by 2020 or close to $2,000 per \nhousehold. We don't know. We simply don't know. My constituents say: \nLisa, you have to do better than that. You have to give me some idea \nbecause, right now, in Aniak, that village's people are paying $5.53 \nfor their gasoline. It went up this week because the spring barge came \nin. I am going to say to them we have this legislation that will help \nreduce emissions in this country, we think, if other nations \nparticipate, but I don't know how much it will cost you or how high gas \nis going to go in Aniak. Right now, you are paying $6.50 for diesel. I \nhave to be able to provide more to my constituents than that.\n  What is important is for the Senate to take its time to understand \nwhat the Boxer substitute would do and, perhaps, think more about what \nwould work at the least cost and would actually make a difference in \nthe world's climate. The more I look at it, the more I think the \noriginal Bingaman-Specter bill, with changes, is worthy of renewed \nconsideration.\n  I said in a speech last week at home in Alaska that never before have \nMembers of Congress been asked to take action on a bill that could have \nsuch a profound effect on our country, with so much difference of \nopinion about how much this bill is going to cost, and whether it will \nactually be worth the amount the American consumer will pay because of \nit. We have to be able to demonstrate that these are the ranges and \nthis is the benefit so Americans can understand what we are doing.\n  How much this bill will cost Americans is purely dependent upon the \nforecasts, and the Congressional Research Service said in testimony \nbefore the Energy Committee a couple weeks ago that all these forecasts \nshould be viewed with ``attentive skepticism,'' especially in the \noutyears. That is an interesting way to put it. But whether this bill \nwill cost $3.3 trillion until 2050, as the bill's sponsor said last \nweek, or more than twice that amount that other models predict, we know \nthis bill will be the most expensive and complex measure ever before \nconsidered by any government on the planet.\n  I do know that, even though my constituents want us to do something \nin Congress, they are going to want it to be something that works. I \ndon't want to support a bill until I am convinced that measure offers \nthe best possible chance of protecting against climate change impacts \nbut at the least possible cost, while still stimulating new \ntechnology--which will make the difference--that is the ultimate \nsolution to carbon emission reductions.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Florida). The Senator from \nCalifornia is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am glad the Senator from Alaska came to \nspeak because she is at ground zero, and she explained that what is \nhappening in her State is very serious. She knows it. She is close to \nit. Where I simply don't agree with her is she says our bill is going \nto lead to higher gas prices. We are back to that same old-same old \nstuff. The fact is--I will reiterate it; I have said it so much, it is \nprobably extremely boring to those who have listened to me, but I will \nsay it again--President Bush sent down a veto promise on this bill, and \nin it he said gas prices are going to go up 50 cents over the 20-year \nperiod. That is 2 cents a year. That is 12 percent over 20 years. What \nhe didn't say is that because we passed fuel economy standards, all \nthat is offset for our people because the fuel economy standards are \ngoing to mean you actually can go farther on a gallon of gas. So there \nis no increase in gas prices.\n\n  As a matter of fact, what is going to happen is, we are going to get \nthe alternatives we need. Senator Murkowski's people, my people, \nSenator Warner's people, Senator Reid's people, and Senator Schumer's \npeople at the end of the day are going to say: Thank goodness, we are \nfinally off foreign oil; we don't have to be dependent on a President--\nthis one or the next one--going to Saudi Arabia and begging. That is \nthe whole point of the bill.\n  The whole point of the bill is to get those technologies, and the \nbill essentially does this. We say to the people who are emitting \ncarbon: You have to buy permits to pollute. We take half that money--\nmore than half of it goes back to consumers through a tax cut or \nthrough the utility companies that give you credit right on your bill.\n  This is a good bill. This is a bill that will create jobs. This is a \nbill that will create the technologies.\n  Senator Warner got into this whole issue because his legacy is \nnational security. Our leaders tell us we have to act now. To have \npeople come to this floor with a bogus argument that makes no sense is \nunfortunate. If we vote cloture on this bill, we will be able to amend \nit and move forward.\n  I wish to show how many people are supporting us and the groups that \nare supporting us. We hear a lot of my Republican friends say: We are \ngoing to lose jobs. Yes, the miners came out with a statement. They \nsaid the bill needed work. So did the UAW, the bill needed work. And we \nare open to that. Senator Warner and I, Senator Lieberman, and Senator \nKerry said we are ready to meet with our colleagues and fix the bill. \nBut oh, no, all they want to do really is drive this bill off the \nfloor.\n  I have a list of working people who endorse this bill. So don't come \nhere, I say to my colleagues--Senator Murkowski didn't do this, but \nothers have done it--and say, oh, we are going to lose jobs. You tell \nthat to the International Association of Bridge, Structural, Ornamental \nand Reinforcing Iron Workers. Tell that to the insulators and the \nallied workers. Tell that to the shipbuilders. Tell that to the \nbricklayers. Tell that to the elevator constructors. Tell that to the \npainters. Tell that to the plasterers. Tell that to the journeymen. \nTell that to the sheet metal workers, the teamsters, the operating \nengineers, and the building and construction trades. They all see what \nthis bill will mean. It means building a new infrastructure for a new \nday with new energy.\n  The faith communities are supporting us. I am so grateful to them. It \nis as if I prayed for help and they came forward--the Evangelical \nEnvironmental Network and the Evangelical Climate Initiative, U.S. \nConference of Catholic Bishops, National Council of Churches, Religious \nAction Center of Reform Judaism, Jewish Council of Public Affairs, the \nInterfaith Power and Light Campaign. Why? Because they feel so strongly \nthat the planet is threatened and God's creation is threatened.\n  We cannot wait forever. We do not have a perfect bill. We want to get \nit started, and we cannot. It is a very sad state of affairs.\n\n[[Page S5191]]\n\n  I will be happy to yield to my friend.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator.\n  I would just like to say to my distinguished colleague from Alaska, \nwe had a number of conversations in the course of the deliberation on \nthis bill. I first want to say this colleague worked very hard and very \nconscientiously. There are honest differences of opinion on this \nsubject. Her State, which she is so proud to represent, is quite \nunique. It has been severely affected by what I believe are some \nmanifestations of climate change that are somewhat unique and without \nprecedent. But I think in this instance, I say on behalf of my \ncolleague, this is a decision where people of good intentions can have \ndifferent views.\n  All I know is this colleague worked very hard to deliberate through \nher thinking process. I will be gone, but I will have to leave it to \nher, being in a leadership position next year one way or another, \nhopefully one of the most powerful Senate committees. I know she will \napply the same amount of careful thought and consideration when that \ncommittee--I believe it is Energy; am I not correct? I am certain it \nwill have a major role and voice in collaborating with the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n  I yield the floor. I wanted to make that observation.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I reclaim my time. I thank my colleague. \nYes, I have had wonderful conversations with the Senator from Alaska. \nThe reason there is a bit of frustration in my voice is because I don't \nthink we have much time to waste. I am very worried about delaying. I \nlook forward to working with my colleague from Alaska.\n  I want to put into the Record also the businesses that support our \nbill just as it is: Alcoa, Avista, Calpine, Constellation Energy, E2, \nEntergy Corporation, Exelon Corporation, Florida Power and Light, \nGeneral Electric, National Grid, NRG Energy, PG, Public Service \nEnterprise Group.\n  We have broad support of governments: the U.S. Conference of Mayors; \nthe National Association of Clean Air Agencies; Climate Communities, \nwhich is a national coalition of cities, towns, counties, and other \ncommunities.\n  The people in the cities, the counties, and the States, I want to \nsend them a message today: Don't lose heart if we don't win this vote \ntomorrow. We are building support. We are building support in the \ncommunity, we are building support in the Senate, and the next \nPresident of the United States, regardless of whether it is Senator \nMcCain or Senator Obama, supports global warming legislation.\n  So my friends on the other side of the aisle can say no, no, no, \nstatus quo, status quo, and they may win the day. But at the end of the \nday, they will not win because 89 percent of the people of America want \nus to tackle this problem.\n  Let's take a look at what the scientists are telling us. Eleven \nnational academies of science, including the U.S. National Academies of \nScience, concluded that climate change is real. It is likely that most \nof the warming in recent decades can be attributed to human activities. \nThe Nobel Prize-winning IPCC concluded in 2007 that global warming is \nunequivocal; there is a 90-percent certainty that humans have caused \nit.\n  Today, Senator Warner, Senator Lieberman, and I had an amazing press \nconference with a former general and a former admiral. It was really \nsomething to hear them. They said some chilling things in this global \nwarming debate. When they ended it, they said: When we are out on the \nbattlefield, we cannot wait for 100 percent certainty. The scientists \nhave given us 90 percent certainty. You wait, you are going to face \ndanger, trouble, horrible things can happen. They look at it as a \ncampaign to stop something quite dangerous.\n  Let's look at the human health impacts, I thank my friend, Senator \nNelson, who is in the chair, for all the work he has done on this \nissue. His magnificent State is another place which is ground zero. I \nflew with my friend--first of all, we went to the Everglades. It was an \nextraordinary experience and one which I shall never forget. We went \nwith my spouse and Senator Nelson's spouse. We went through this gift \nfrom God, which is what the Everglades is. It is impossible to \ndescribe. It is like a river of grass. That is what it is called, a \nriver of grass. A remarkable place. When we went up in our helicopter \nand flew over the State, I held my breath. This magnificent State. But \nif those sea levels rise? There cannot be enough protection. We \ncouldn't do it. So we have to stop the problem, and that is what \nthe Boxer-Lieberman-Warner bill does.\n\n  Look at the human health impacts of global warming in North America: \nincrease in the frequency and duration of heat waves and heat-related \nillness; increase in waterborne disease from degraded water quality. \nWhy? Because certain amoebas and bacteria can live in warmer waters. As \na result, these are new kinds of creatures. We had a child in Lake \nHavasu get an infection in one of these warmer waters. The infection \nwent to the brain. This is the kind of thing the Bush administration \nhealth officials are telling us.\n  Dr. Julie Gerberding came before our committee. It was mind boggling \nwhat she was telling us we can expect. By the way, unfortunately, a lot \nof her statement was redacted. Even though it was redacted, it was \npowerful. She basically was saying to us: Please act now.\n  Increased respiratory disease, including asthma and other lung \ndiseases from increased ozone and smog, and the children and the \nelderly are especially vulnerable. I say to my brothers and sisters, \nmen and women of the Senate, children and the elderly are vulnerable. \nThis is America. We take care of the most vulnerable. They cannot do \nthis.\n  We all believe in our great economic system, the free-enterprise \nsystem. There are certain things our Government has to do, which is to \nmake sure people can have healthy lives. Part of it is that the planet \nbe healthy. We have to act now.\n  I will conclude my remarks in the next 2 minutes and then will yield \nto my colleague for 2 minutes to do a quick Executive Calendar.\n  I want to talk about job growth because, again, we heard all along: \nOh my goodness, this bill is going to kill job growth. In California, \nwe have a law like this. It has done wonders. For example, we have 450 \nnew solar energy companies. As we see a decline in the housing area--\nand I know my friend in the chair has seen this in Florida--a lot of \nthe workers who would have been laid off are being grabbed up and going \nto work in these solar energy companies. We are so fortunate we had \nthat, in a way, a safety net. People are so excited.\n  If you come to California, if you go to the Silicon Valley, the \nentrepreneurs there want to invest in new technologies. They will not \ndo it until there are laws in place because they need certainty.\n  I will close with this: A study of the impacts of my State's law says \nthere will be 89,000 new jobs created by 2020. There are more than 450 \nsolar companies--I mentioned that--hiring electricians, carpenters, and \nplumbers. And the top manufacturing States for solar are Ohio, \nMichigan, California, Tennessee, and Massachusetts. That is interesting \nbecause we are seeing these new manufacturing jobs being created across \nAmerica.\n  In closing, I will show my favorite chart of all and the one I want \nto end with. Let's say yes for once around this place. Let's say yes to \nsomething good, to a clean energy future, to clean green jobs, to \nscience, to clean air, to saving the planet, to consumer protection, to \na big tax cut, to a strong economy, and to the Boxer-Lieberman-Warner \nbill.\n  I thank you so much, Mr. President, and I really do thank you for \nyour leadership in Florida and here as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the distinguished presiding officer.\n  Mr. President, I, once again, recognize the strong leadership given \nby the distinguished Senator from California on this legislation. It \ncomes from the heart and a strong conviction that she thinks we are \ndoing the right thing, and I am pleased to be a part of the team that \nhelped engineer getting this bill prepared and to the committee and to \nthe Senate floor.\n  And I don't fear the consequences of the vote tomorrow. No one can \npredict what it will be, but I think both of us\n\n[[Page S5192]]\n\nwill walk out with a sense of satisfaction we did our best. It may well \nbe we will go on next week. Time will tell, subject to this vote \ntomorrow. As we say in the Navy: Well done, sir.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/05/senate-section/article/S5192-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5192]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n      NOMINATION OF STANLEY A.

Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal\n\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the distinguished Presiding Officer, a member of \nthe Senate Armed Services Committee. This nomination is for General \nMcChrystal. General McChrystal is well-known to many of us in the \nSenate. I recall very vividly the period when our Nation was building \nits force structure to go into the situation in Iraq. And putting aside \nall of the honest debate on that decision to go in, I think the \nprofessional soldiers like McChrystal did their job.\n  McChrystal used to come every morning that the Senate was in session, \nat 8 o'clock, and brief Senators in S. 407. I know the Presiding \nOfficer was there on a number of occasions. He was accompanied by COL \nBill Caniano, who is currently on my staff, and they answered the \nquestions, kept the Senate informed as to the buildup of that operation \nas our forces built up tempo and moved into the Iraq situation. A very \nfine officer.\n  He has been in Iraq now--well, I don't think you add up the number of \ntours because he has basically been there almost constantly over 2\\1/2\\ \nyears; one of the longest serving members, whether it is a general \nofficer or a private, in the Iraq theater.

Mr. President, I probably will not be more than 10 \nminutes, but I appreciate the will of the Senate if I need a few more \nminutes.\n  Today, I pay tribute to the victims of the devastating tornado that \nripped through northeast Iowa a week ago Sunday. This would have been \nMemorial Day weekend. That is a weekend that traditionally offers a \nthank-you to veterans who have given their lives. It is a time of \nbackyard barbecues, and in the Midwest it is when swimming pools open \nfor business. But late afternoon on May 25, 2008, Mother Nature \nunleashed a tragic beginning to a summer vacation. It was a kind of \nnatural disaster that makes people realize the perils of pettiness and \nappreciate what really matters the most.\n  A history-making twister produced winds in excess of 200 miles per \nhour. It tore across Butler County--that is my home county--Black Hawk \nCounty, Delaware County, and Buchanan County. It paved a 43-mile path \nof destruction. The severe storm system virtually ripped the town of \nParkersburg in half. It destroyed 22 businesses, leveled 222 homes, and \ndamaged 408 others in a community of only 2,000. The storm system \ninjured 70 individuals. The fatalities attributed to the tornado have \nnow risen to eight Iowans.\n  But the statistics don't do justice to the heartbreak and to the \nhurt. Natural disasters have wrought havoc on humanity since the \nbeginning of time. In recent years, the 2004 tsunami in Southeast Asia \nclaimed more than 100,000 lives and displaced millions of victims from \ntheir homes. In September 2005, a category 5 hurricane ravaged the \nAmerican gulf coast, causing $11.3 billion in damages. Last year, in \nGreensburg, KS, a tornado leveled the entire community of 1,400, \ncausing an estimated $267 million in damage. The financial estimate of \ndamage from the May 25 tornado in my home area from storms and flooding \nhasn't been calculated yet, but the pricetag will not do justice to the \nheartbreak and to the hurt.\n  Whether it is an earthquake, a hurricane, or a tornado, a natural \ndisaster leaves behind massive debris and destruction. The physical and \nfinancial tolls shouldered by the victims arguably pale compared to the \nemotional scars and personal losses left in the aftermath of a killer \nnatural disaster.\n  This tornado was what they call an F-5 tornado, the worst they get. \nIt struck terror into the hearts and minds of northeast Iowans over \nMemorial Day weekend, and it also hit close to home as well. From the \nlawn on my farm near New Hartford, I watched what I thought was nothing \nbut a dark storm cloud blackening the sky as the tornado made its way \nacross Butler County from Parkersburg--population, as I said, about \n2,000--to my hometown of New Hartford, population 600.\n  It was the first F-5 tornado to strike Iowa since 1976, so tornadoes \nlike this don't happen every day in our State. Maybe they do in \nOklahoma, but they do not every day in my State. And it happened to be \nthe deadliest tornado in the State since the 1968 tornado in Charles \nCity, IA. I believe that tornado claimed about 13 lives compared to the \n8 so far here.\n\n  In some ways, the storm may serve as a wake-up call to those of us \nwho have become somewhat complacent about severe weather warnings. The \nday after the storm, I visited with residents of Parkersburg and New \nHartford and toured the damage, along with Senator Harkin and Governor \nCulver, and Congressman Braley was there. It was an unimaginable scene.\n  In Parkersburg, the tornado ripped apart the Aplington-Parkersburg \nHigh School. This is a picture of that devastating damage. It will cost \n$14 million to rebuild. Thank God they were well insured, I have been \ntold. I haven't heard that directly but indirectly.\n  It destroyed the Parkersburg City Hall, crushed the town's only gas \nstation, and crumbled the grocery store. If you watched CNN yesterday, \nyou were able to find some pictures from the cameras that guard the \nbank during the night and over the weekend, and you saw, before they \nwent blank, sucking everything up. And you know where a lot of those \nbank papers landed, and a lot of pictures from various homes? In \nPrairie Du Chien, WI, 100\n\n[[Page S5193]]\n\nmiles away. And those people in Prairie Du Chien, we are told by \ntelevision, are collecting all those valuables and are someday going to \nbring them back to Parkersburg, IA.\n  In the afternoon of this tragedy, seven people sought refuge and \nsurvived by going to a produce cooler in one of the restaurants there. \nThat is just one example of what people do. So more life could have \nbeen taken. I have been told by some people that as the Weather Bureau \nor the government agencies that measure this stuff and tracked the \nstorm, that this damage to 220 homes in Parkersburg, IA, could have \nbeen done in just a few seconds, like 20, 30 seconds. Some people on \nthe scene said it had to be less than 45 seconds. But in just a few \nminutes or a few seconds, whatever you want to say, a mile-wide tornado \nwiped away a lifetime of treasured belongings, furniture, and family \nmemorabilia. There are no parts of homes sitting around. There is only \nsticks sitting around, and a lot of that landed in farm fields miles \naway. There are uprooted trees. There is not a tree with a leaf, maybe \na limb or two. The trunk maybe still stands, or maybe the trunk is \ndown. We have mangled vehicles. Some people didn't know where their \nvehicle ended up. Maybe today they do, but they didn't a week after the \nstorm, they told me. It killed a lot of livestock in the rural areas, \nripped away roofs and walls, mowed down neighborhoods, shredded solidly \nbuilt homes like toothpicks, and knocked out the city's infrastructure.\n  I saw this debris. I am told that there were 60,000 tons in \nParkersburg alone left behind in the wake of the tornado. I suppose \nthat is a rough guesstimate, but the people who know about the tragedy \nknow how to estimate some of this stuff. This picture of the high \nschool, once again, probably isn't the best picture I could produce \nabout how much of a wilderness the southern half of this small town is, \nand I don't think this captures the wreckage, but it is a small \nglimpse. It is nearly inconceivable to understand the awesome force of \nMother Nature.\n  Thankfully, the resiliency and the compassion of human nature also \nhas proven that it can withstand floods and droughts and famines, and \nso it shall be in my home State. After seeing the devastation \nfirsthand, it still made me wonder that the fatalities have thus far \nbeen kept in single digits considering that 70 people were \nhospitalized. And I commend the emergency preparedness plans put into \naction by city and county authorities and during the storm. The civil \ndefense people came from the adjoining counties without hardly even \nbeing called to come. They knew we needed help. And thanks to the \nwarning systems, countless lives were saved.\n  In fact, rising above the call of duty, volunteer firefighters in my \nhometown of New Hartford raced up and down the streets after the power \nhad gone out alerting people with their vehicle sirens, just to show \ntheir commitment to letting everybody know that just a few minutes away \nwas a terrible weapon of destruction.\n  Exactly 1 week after the storm blazed its trail through the region, I \nreturned to Parkersburg. I am pleased to report relief and recovery \nefforts underway. I saw fire departments coming up to serve the \ncommunity and the surrounding communities from 100 miles away--the \nsuburbs of Des Moines, IA, is an example.\n  I hope you know there is a great deal of resilience in the people of \nParkersburg and New Hartford. Like a beacon of hope, I want to show you \nwhere people were, what they were doing 6 days after this tornado hit \nthrough. This doesn't give justice to all the debris that still has not \nbeen picked up, but there were people constructing new buildings right \naway. Except for a generation of trees being gone--because 25 years \nfrom now you will be able to go down this 43 miles and you are going to \nknow where this tornado went--except for that, Parkersburg and these \nother communities will be back in a few months. I give this as evidence \nof the resilience of the people, only 6 days after this damage took \nplace.\n  The cleanup operation, of course, will take a long time. Bulky \nmachinery will do the heaviest lifting. That is after people have an \nopportunity to paw through all of the strewn things that are there, so \nthey can take out some of their valuables in the sense of \nremembrances--pictures, photographs, maybe some important documents \nthey might find. There may be some of those important documents up in \nPrairie Duchene.\n  The scoreboard for this high school ended up 70 miles in Decorah, IA, \nas an example. Maybe it was part of the scoreboard, but this tells you \nhow it is.\n  It is going to take countless hours of manpower to orchestrate this \nmassive undertaking to get the job done. The seemingly impossible task \nis being made possible, thanks to the tireless commitments of Butler \nCounty's first responders, administrators, emergency crews, and legions \nof volunteers, but in addition to my county, counties around it. You \ncan't believe the number of trucks that came in Sunday to haul away \ndebris, as an example.\n  We have had the donation of food, water, clothing, and other supplies \npoured into the tornado-ravaged region. I wish to mention a few notable \nexamples of neighbors and strangers lending a hand during the recovery \nweek. There is no count of construction crews and heavy equipment \nvolunteers coming in from as far as Tennessee. I have thanked Senator \nCorker I have not thanked Senator Alexander yet, for people coming all \nway from Tennessee with very heavy equipment. People who were cleaning \nup from tornadoes in Oklahoma the night before spent the night on the \nroad to come up and help people in Parkersburg, IA.\n  Separately, we had a group of traveling volunteers known as the \nMassage Emergency Response Team from California--people who are \nphysical therapists who came in to rub the backs of people working day \nand night. They offer assistance to those who need stress and tension \nrelief from their recovery work.\n  We had a group of 90 high school students, mostly football players \nfrom the Catholic high school, Dowling, in Des Moines, traveling 100 \nmiles to help with the recovery work at the Aplington-Parkersburg High \nSchool athletic fields. If you want to know how this little town of 200 \nis proud of its football team, this little town has four NFL players, \nright now--I mean not right now today playing football, but still \nsigned up. These Dowling High School people pitched in to rake up glass \nand debris.\n  The Salvation Army has set up mobile canteens serving 1,000 hot meals \neach day to the Parkersburg residents and relief residents, and in New \nHartford as well. And the Red Cross, as you would expect because of \ntheir good reputation, was immediately on the job and is still present.\n  The tornado, storm, and flood damage over Memorial Day weekend in \nIowa has received Federal declaration of disaster assistance, and \npeople have come in from FEMA, from Sacramento, CA; from Pennsylvania \nand from New Jersey; maybe from a lot of other places that I had a \nchance to meet on that Sunday afternoon. So the Federal people are \nworking well, as they should.\n  Residents in these communities will need help rebuilding and I know \nIowans appreciate that help. So I am here to say thank you to \neverybody.\n  I listed only a few people. If I knew everybody who was helping out, \nthere wouldn't be any help there. You can't keep on top of everybody \nwho is stressing out. When I was in church in Cedar Falls, IA, one \nSunday we had people there from North Carolina--Franklin Graham. We had \npeople there from the Billy Graham organization in Minneapolis.\n  Looking out across the countryside near my home, our corner of the \nworld looks turned upside down. Utility polls, shingles, siding, \ninsulation, uprooted trees are strewn across the farm fields. The \ncleanup will take time, but I know Iowans are in this for the long \nhaul. I and other Grassleys were fortunate in this damage, because I \nlive 1\\1/2\\ miles south of where the tornado went through on a farm. My \nson and grandson farm with me. They live a mile and a half north of \nwhere the tornado went through. I thank God for that.\n  We lost friends. A person named Norman who worked at the New Hartford \ngrain elevator will not be there because he was killed in this tornado. \nSo Norman, who always greeted us when we would go to the elevator to \nunload our grain in the fall--his friendly face will be missed.\n\n[[Page S5194]]\n\n  The outpouring of support from neighbors, friends, and strangers from \nnear and far has given a jump-start to the necessary healing process. \nIt underscores the decency of human nature rising above catastrophic \nforces of Mother Nature. The selfless sacrifice by literally scores of \nheroes will help mend the immeasurable heartbreak and hurts that I saw \nduring my visits to these communities.\n  I say with gladness in my own heart, the F5 tornado did not \nextinguish the hope and pride of residents of the midwestern \ncommunities who call Parkersburg, New Hartford, Hazleton, and Dunkerton \nhome.\n  I suppose maybe it is a little bit ambitious on my part to take the \nfloor of the Senate to acknowledge this and to praise the Lord for what \ncan be done now, and the people who have not been hurt. I suppose every \none of my colleagues, particularly in the tornado channel that I most \noften hear about, of Kansas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Kentucky, Tennessee, \nand I guess yesterday damage around here as well--maybe every Senator \ncould tell the story I tell. But, frankly, tornadoes are not as common \nin my State as they are in these other States and there is a lesson to \nbe learned from this. There is an appreciation to be learned from it. \nWe all ought to remember how lucky--and then we need to remember how \nunlucky--some people and families are, in our daily life.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I will want to sympathize with the Senator \nfrom Iowa, Senator Grassley. Two weeks before Hurricane Katrina, a \ntornado came through the town of Wright, WY, which is 30 miles south of \nthe town I live in. It happened to be during a recess so I got to go \nout there and see what had happened and see what kind of response there \nwas and see what the Government is supposed to do and what they do do. \nWhat I was most impressed with is the spirit of community, the way the \npeople got right after it and started cleaning up and helping each \nother out. People poured in from towns and other States to help.\n  It is a great country we live in, where people will do that and help \nout where it isn't any concern of theirs. But they recognize that is \nwhat we do in America. I think that is a difference from many other \ncountries, too. I appreciate your sharing that with us.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/05/senate-section/article/S5194-2", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5194-S5198]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the legislation we have \nbeen debating and that we are going to be precluded from debating, \nshould cloture happen tomorrow. The reason I say precluded from \ndebating is we are not being allowed to do any amendments. The whole \nstage has been set: One amendment so far; it is a take-it-or-leave-it \namendment. My experience in the 11\\1/2\\ years I have been around here \nis that bills that come to us that way do not pass.\n  That is what the whole Senate was designed for, to see that take-it-\nor-leave-it stuff doesn't make it through here, that the opinions of \n100 people get to be reflected in legislation. The longer we are here, \nthe quicker we think we ought to be able to get bills done. The longer \nwe are here, the more complicated the issues. This is a very \ncomplicated issue. There are things people are doing. There are things \npeople need to be doing. But to make it very prescriptive and to not \nallow the opinions of 100 people who could point out some of the flaws \nand some ways it could be better is wrong.\n  The majority leader and a number of Members on the other side have \ncalled climate change the ``greatest environmental threat facing our \nworld.'' I am not hearing big arguments against that. But if that is \nthe case, we should put our heads together and come up with a plan to \nprotect us from this massive threat. We should spend time amending it, \nironing out any problems, and determining what we will have to pay.\n  There is a huge disconnect in America, thinking that we can solve \nthis problem and it will not cost the consumer anything. We are \nactually promulgating that myth here, now. I heard the fuel economy we \nare going to get is going to offset any of the costs. I know a few guys \nout there who are getting ahold of me on a regular basis because they \ndrive trucks. They do contract work. I am pretty sure they didn't put a \nlittle clause in there that gave them a fuel escalation break. Some of \nthe big companies might have thought of that. The little companies \ndidn't. So far as I can tell, they are not planning on trading that \ntruck in for a more fuel-efficient truck because they can't afford to \ndo that. New trucks cost more money. They have a contract that limits \nwhat they can do. So the offset is not going to pay to the person who \nis paying the bill. It may go to somebody else.\n  We do need to encourage better mileage. We need to encourage less \ntravel--although somebody the other day pointed out to me that if we \nhave less travel--for instance, if I rode my bike back and forth from \nhome to work, although I usually walk, that consumes calories. And to \nreplace those calories, I have to eat food. And that food probably is \ntransported in somehow, so I am still adding to the climate problem. It \nis not solving it just by doing some alternatives. I hadn't thought \nabout that.\n\n  But what I am talking about tonight is that the debate has been shut \ndown; the amendment tree has been filled. That means a little \nparliamentary procedure around here has already put some amendments, \nwith relatively insignificant changes in them, so nobody else can bring \nup an amendment and have it voted on. It is getting to be a very common \nthing around here.\n  Now, I understand partly why it is being done. The majority has had \ntwo people out on the Presidential campaign trail, and now Senator \nKennedy is not able to be with us. That is the loss of three votes. It \nis a 51-to-49 Senate. So I sympathize with the leader in trying to \ncontrol votes when some of the people are not here, because with our \none Presidential candidate gone and three of their people gone, it \nwinds up with a tie. I have noticed the Vice President usually votes \nwith me.\n  But what we are trying to do, I think around here, is get bills done \nand get them done in a logical process and actually finish them. But I \ndo not think that is what we are doing. The amendment tree got filled. \nThe greatest threat of our time, the greatest deliberative body is not \nallowed to deliberate, to be deliberative. Something is wrong with that \npicture.\n  Now, I have some amendments that are important. I think they are \nimportant to anybody who might be listening, especially my colleagues. \nDo not think that not paying attention to or being interested in \npolitics is going to shield anyone from the consequence of this bill if \nit were to pass. It could change our way of life. The bill is going to \ncost money, and you have a right to know how much it is going to cost \nyou.\n  I filed an amendment that requires utilities to include on the bill \nthey send you, the consumers, the amount it is costing to comply with \nthis legislation.\n  I would like to take a look at a part of the bill that is very \nsignificant for Wyoming residents; that is the coal portion. Coal is \nour Nation's most important and abundant energy source. Wyoming's coal \nis the cleanest coal in the Nation. We ship to every State in the \nNation.\n  They mix it with their coal to meet the clean air standards. I want \nthe lights to stay on in Wyoming and the rest of the Nation. California \nrelies heavily on electricity from Wyoming. Without coal, that is not \ngoing to happen.\n  Now, China understands energy. China understands that the future \neconomy of the world depends on energy. They have already bought all \nthe oil supply, they have bought up gas supplies, they are in the \nprocess of buying up coal supplies.\n  How do I know about that? They are buying coal in Campbell County, \nWY, and shipping it to China. Now, a lot of it is in the test burn \nstage, and I suspect they may be burning that in the powerplants right \naround Beijing, which will clean their air for the Olympics.\n  I do not know how long the contracts are, and I do not know how \nexpensive it\n\n[[Page S5195]]\n\nwill be. But I suspect that coal will be sold, and I know, by the way, \nbecause of rotation of the Earth, the direction the wind blows. The \npowerplants in Wyoming do not put anything in California, but the \npowerplants in China, of which they are building one a week, it takes \nlonger, but they are opening one a week, that air will blow to \nCalifornia. China is not going to be part of this.\n  I have had an opportunity to sit down with some of the Chinese \ndelegation who are at the global warming conferences. They do point out \nthey are a developing nation. I have asked them, as a developing \nnation, is there any point in the future at which they would do \nsomething to cut down their pollution? They have assured me they will \nalways be a developing nation and will always come under those \nprovisions. So do not count on China to help out in this.\n  Now, I filed another amendment with my colleagues from Missouri, \nOhio, and Oklahoma that is an approach to making cleaner coal. I have \nalso cosponsored another amendment with my fellow Senator from Wyoming, \nan amendment, that was filed by Senator Dorgan from North Dakota taking \nanother approach to greening up coal so we can more efficiently harness \nits power while minimizing its impact on the environment.\n  I have cosponsored multiple approaches because it is vital we improve \nthe bill by improving the way we use coal. Half our electricity comes \nfrom coal. There is no short-term substitute for coal. We need to come \ntogether and come up with a real solution, hopefully one that does \nplace a little bit of confidence in the ingenuity of the American \npeople.\n  If there is a problem, they can solve it; not always immediately and \nnot always without some kind of incentive. There are a number of ways \nof providing that incentive. We have not gotten to discuss those, and \nthe majority is not going to let us do that today. I cannot even call \nup my amendments to let other Members debate them because the majority \nleader has used a parliamentary tactic to prevent us from offering \nchanges to this bill.\n  The majority leader has decided we cannot fully debate what he calls \nthe greatest environmental threat facing the world. Is he serious? \nWell, I am. But apparently the proponents of this bill are not. If they \nwere, they would be working to come up with a solution to this problem \nrather than playing another inning of ``gotcha'' politics.\n  This is a complex piece of legislation. I am not sure anybody knows \nexactly how it works. The bill we originally talked about came through \ncommittee. The substitute we are doing now did not come through \ncommittee, so it hasn't had the same look everything else had.\n  Anytime we go to a bill that hasn't been through committee and we \ninvoke cloture so amendments cannot be done, the bills do not make it \nhere. I appreciate my colleagues' approach on that. I have seen it \nhappen, though, regardless of who was in the majority. That is the way \nit works. People get upset when they cannot do amendments.\n  Now, I do know people who buy coal from my State say this bill will \nbe a real punch in the gut. I do know the vast majority of studies say \nthis bill will take money out of your pocket because you will have to \npay higher energy prices. These are issues that need to be addressed. \nBut we are not being allowed to address them. There is this sudden \nurgency that if it does not pass this week, the world will not exist \nnext week. I think that is a lit bit of an exaggeration.\n\n  I have a list of people who were supporting this legislation \napparently as it is. I think they were generally supporting the concept \nof cleaning up the environment. But I did notice the list of supporters \nincluded those who have figured out a way to make some money off this. \nThat is how it works in America. But it does leave out those who are \ncurrently having a job in these areas.\n  Now, it is baffling to me that we are being precluded, that it is \nbeing cut off early. I hope my Senate colleagues will not do that. When \nthe Senate considered the Clean Air Act amendments in 1990, and it was \nvery important for them to consider that, because prior to that time we \nhad a one-size-fits-all approach in the United States. It needed to be \ncorrected.\n  Those clean air amendments of 1990 passed, and they made corrections \nto it. They made a system that worked, or at least worked better. There \nis no such thing as perfect legislation. We spent 5 weeks on the bill. \nThere were 180 amendments that were considered, and 130 were processed.\n  Usually, we are asked if we cannot get our amendments down to two or \nthree or five. No, you cannot. The reason you cannot is that if you \nhave a series of amendments that deal with the smaller topics, people \nunderstand them better.\n  You will have one section 3 people will object to, another one 11 \npeople will object to, another one 4 people will object to, and pretty \nquickly you are at 51. It is a pretty good philosophy if you do not \nwant an amendment to pass, you cram them all together, so you can \ngenerate enough animosity over each of the parts so it adds up to 51 \nvotes against and it never makes it.\n  On the other hand, if you are serious about making changes, then you \ndo it such as we did with--I was not here at that time--the Clean Air \nAct of 1990, where there were 180 amendments and 130 were processed.\n  We have been debating this bill for less than a week at this stage, \nwith lots of interruptions. We have considered exactly one amendment, \nand that is the substitute amendment from the Democratic chair of the \ncommittee that dramatically changes the bill from what came out of \ncommittee.\n  That is not the way to conduct business in the Senate. It is not the \nway to get anything done. But, then again, that is probably apparent \nthat if there was a real desire to get something done, this bill would \nbe debated in the regular order.\n  When the Senate was less polarized, it was because there was more \ndebating in the regular order. The bill we were debating had gone \nthrough committee, S. 2191; but the bill S. 3036 did not. I do not know \nanyone who believes this bill is going to be signed into law. I am not \neven sure anybody wants it signed into law considering the process it \nis going through.\n  I think it is an effort by the majority saying: Oh, woe is us. We \nneed to have 60 on our side of the aisle so we can cram these ideas \ndown the other side's throat. That is not the Senate. The majority, in \nfact, is saying, until we have 60 votes on our side, we are not going \nto let anything pass. They take this approach, even though the energy \ncrisis is the main concern of the American people.\n  Oh, but that is right, this bill is not going to do anything for \nenergy prices, particularly in the short run. I am disappointed with \nthe situation the majority leader has put the Senate in today that will \nactually happen tomorrow morning--it is happening at 9 o'clock--which \nmeans there is going to be debate before the vote, it will be rather \nlimited, probably between the two leaders.\n  I do not think this bill is ready for debate, so I voted against \nproceeding to this bill. However, now that we are on the bill, we do \nhave to consider its merits. That is what I have done on all this. That \nis why I filed two amendments to it. Unfortunately, we are not truly \ndebating the bill because the parliamentary procedure, the \nparliamentary tactics are going to cut off all the amendments.\n  Oh, there will be some conversation about how there will be 30 hours \nto do things after cloture is done. I follow the proceedings around \nhere. Now, you can stall through 30 hours and make sure not a single \nvote happens. So anybody who votes for cloture means voting to preclude \namendments, and anybody who says: Oh, there will be an open debate on \nit and an opportunity for amendments, ought to check the history on \nthis and see if they have actually talked to anybody who would allow \nthat to happen because it will be a new one on me.\n  So the whole purpose right now is to do ``gotcha'' politics, avoid \nthe committee to bring it to the floor, have a motion to proceed \nintroduced on Friday, we vote on Monday followed by 30 hours, while we \nare waiting for people to show up to vote during the week because they \nare out on the campaign trial, and then filing a final cloture motion \nto make it be a one-size-fits-all, take-it-or-leave-it bill.\n  I think it is very unfortunate that we have come to this point. I \nwill oppose\n\n[[Page S5196]]\n\nfurther tactics designed to shut Senators out in the cold while the \nproponents are inside making their own global warming plan.\n  The ``take it or leave it'' has never been a successful approach \naround here. I am willing to bet it will not be a successful approach \ntomorrow.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders). The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I listened to my friend from Wyoming, and \nI will tell anyone who was listening, first, he says the bill is not \nready for debate. Now he wants to debate.\n  You know, my friend voted not to go to the bill in the first place. \nHe does not want a global warming bill, neither do most of the people \non that side of the aisle, with some exceptions.\n  Their answer is: No, no, no, no, status quo. That is why they keep \nlosing seats all around the country. Now, 89 percent of the people want \nus to take up this legislation. Now, you can say you are against this \nfor technical reasons and procedural reasons. I wish to talk about \nthat, I do, because our leader went to the Republican side and said: We \nare ready to come up with a good plan to move forward on this bill. And \nhe said to the other side: Let's start off with doing two amendments a \nside.\n  No, that wasn't good enough.\n  OK. Let's make an agreement for 3 amendments, 10 amendments, germane \namendments. No. It was obvious from the start. No. Well, we think it is \ntime to say yes, to stand and tackle the problem of global warming. \nThey do not think it is time.\n  I don't think they will ever think it is time.\n  What is really remarkable is that the States out there have started. \nThe western Governors have gotten together. They have signed a western \nclimate initiative. Why? The American West is heating up more rapidly \nthan the rest of the world. That is where my friend comes from. I \ndidn't hear him talk about global warming. I heard him talk a lot about \nChina. I don't know what he was saying, whether he is so happy that \nChina keeps building these dirty coal plants. I will tell him, the \npeople of China can't breathe. There was a whole series about this. We \nwant to have a clean coal future. That is why the Boxer-Lieberman-\nWarner bill invests heavily in clean coal. We understand there is 200 \nyears worth of coal in America, and we want to make sure we get the \ntechnologies moving. That is why we want this bill, so we get to the \nday where we can have clean coal.\n  I want to tell my friend, he got up and criticized the way this bill \nwas handled and the rest. I wish to speak about what we have done on \nour committee.\n  The Presiding Officer serves on that committee and is an active \nmember who has supported even stronger legislation than this. We are \ngetting attacked because they say it is too strong. The bottom line \nis--my friend will attest because he was part of this--we had 25 \nhearings, one of which I remember well which he chaired, since the day \nI took the gavel, inclusive. The bill was written in the subcommittee. \nThe bill was worked on. It got to the full committee. I remember my \nfriend in the chair was not happy with the bill in the subcommittee. He \nworked very hard. We changed it. Yes, we changed it, because that is \nwhat legislating is about. There isn't one person in this Chamber who \nhas all the answers. I certainly don't. This has to be a collaborative \napproach.\n  Then a wonderful thing happened. Senator John Warner said: I am \nbreaking the stalemate. I have kids. I have grandkids. I am a national \nsecurity expert. The national security people are saying we need to do \nsomething about global warming. It is going to be one of the biggest \ncauses of wars in the future. This is a big issue. Senator Warner came \nand said he wanted to work with us. That meant we could get legislation \nout of the committee. Senator Baucus comes from a huge coal State. He \ntook the lead in the coal provisions. We worked very hard.\n  When the bill came out of the full committee, we took it to our \ncolleagues in the Senate. We did an unprecedented thing. We had open \nhearings for every Senator. I don't know if Senator Enzi came to any of \nthose. Maybe he did. My staff is sitting here next to me. No, he \ndidn't. I remember Senator Bennett came. I remember many Senators came. \nThey asked the experts the questions. We had the IPPC, the leading \nexperts. We had the Bush administration come to talk about public \nhealth problems. We opened a transparent process to all. We asked \nSenators: Can I come to your office? I went to probably 30 offices. \nSenator Lieberman did. Senator Warner did. Anyone who wanted it did. \nTransparent. What do you need? What do you think? How can we do this \nbetter? How can this work? That is the way legislation ought to be \ndone. That is what leadership is.\n  This is a tripartisan piece of legislation--a Democrat, a Republican, \nand an Independent. I will say this: When you say no to this and when \nyou divert attention to gas prices, which have gone up 250 percent \nunder George Bush--250 percent--and when you say this bill is going to \nmake it worse, you don't really know what you are talking about because \nif you look at the modeling that was done--and George Bush confirmed \nthis--the modeling says under a worst-case scenario, gas will go up 2 \ncents a gallon per year for 20 years. It is a 12-percent increase \nattributable to this bill which we know will be entirely offset by the \nfuel economy. In other words, that 2 cents will be offset by the fuel \neconomy bill. So this bill will lead to lower gas prices. Why? Because \nit will spur technology. That is the point of the bill.\n  If we could look at the pie chart, what you see is that most of the \nmoney that is generated in this bill from the permits bought by the \n2,100 biggest emitters of carbon goes to tax relief for our people, \nconsumer relief for people, deficit reduction, more than half, and the \nrest goes to investments. A little bit goes to help the emitters in the \nearly years. The rest goes to national security, and international \nagricultural resources and forestry, low-carbon technology efficiency, \nand local government action. We want to help local governments. That is \nwhy the U.S. Conference of Mayors has endorsed this bill.\n  I have to say, what amazes me about what I hear from the other side \nis there is nothing about the issue of global warming or climate \nchange. You don't hear anything, very little except from the supporters \nof our bill. Senator Snowe, Senator Warner, yes, we hear from them. But \nfor the most part, we have heard no words that let us understand where \nwe can sit down and talk.\n  As far as China is concerned, to hold them up as some kind of model, \nif that is what my friend was doing, let me say that I don't want to be \na party to it. I want to be a party to leading China, leading India, \nleading the world, not following countries where the people are so sick \nthey can't even breathe. That is not what we want. We heard the same \nthing when we passed the Clean Air Act, Safe Drinking Water Act, the \nClean Water Act, the Endangered Species Act--this is the end of the \nworld. They made all kinds of excuses why we should not act.\n  Tomorrow, we have a chance. I hope we will get a good vote. I don't \nknow what we will get. But I do want to put into the Record some very \nimportant letters from our colleagues.\n  First, I am very touched to tell my colleagues that we have a letter \nfrom Senator Kennedy. I am so happy to say that. It reads:\n       Dear Chairman Boxer: I commend you and Senator Lieberman \n     and Senator Warner for your leadership on the Climate \n     Security Act. At long last, significant legislation long \n     needed to address this growing crisis is ready for Senate \n     action, and I wish very much that I could be there for this \n     landmark debate.\n       Regrettably, I'm unable to participate, but I hope my \n     colleagues will support the Act by voting for cloture, as I \n     would if I were able to do so.\n       With respect and appreciation and all great wishes,\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Edward M. Kennedy.\n\n  Ted, if you or your family is watching, we received this letter with \nsuch pride. We thank you so much, and we send you our heartfelt prayers \nand hopes for a speedy recovery. We miss you so much.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter from \nSenator Biden:\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S5197]]\n\n\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 5, 2008.\n     Senator Barbara Boxer,\n     Chairman, Committee on Environment and Public Works,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Boxer: As we discussed, I regret that a \n     longstanding speaking commitment will cause me to be absent \n     for the scheduled cloture vote on your substitute amendment \n     to S. 3036, the Lieberman-Warner Climate Security Act.\n       I write to make it clear for the record that, had I been \n     present, I would have cast my vote in support of cloture.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Joseph R. Biden, Jr.,\n                                                     U.S. Senator.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. We thank Senator Biden. I again thank Senator Obama. He \nsent a similar letter that he would, if he were here, vote for cloture. \nAnd a beautiful statement from Senator Clinton from which I will read \nin part:\n\n        . . . I would vote for cloture on this legislation if I \n     were able to be present in the Senate. . . .The time is now \n     to move forward and deal with global warming, and I urge my \n     colleagues to vote for cloture.\n\n  Continuing from her letter:\n\n       This bill makes steep reductions in emissions, encourages \n     the development and deployment of clean energy technology, \n     provides assistance for American families, training for \n     workers whom the clean energy industry will demand.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to have the letter printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       M. President, the scientific consensus is clear: strong and \n     swift action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is needed to \n     prevent catastrophic effects of climate change. That's why \n     the debate this week in the Senate about the cap-and-trade \n     bill crafted by Senators Boxer, Lieberman and Warner is so \n     important. This bill makes steep reductions in emissions, \n     encourages the development and deployment of clean energy \n     technology, provides assistance for American families, \n     training for workers that the clean energy industry will \n     demand. I congratulate Chairman Boxer for moving this bill to \n     the floor. It's a first step toward Congress enacting a cap-\n     and-trade bill as part of a broad, comprehensive effort to \n     combat global warming and reduce our dependence on foreign \n     oil, including aggressive steps to improve energy efficiency \n     and deploy renewable energy that will benefit our economy and \n     help create millions of new jobs. I believe that we can and \n     should make this bill even stronger, and I hope that we can \n     do that as we continue to consider the bill. For now, we need \n     to move forward on this important legislation. That's why I \n     would vote for cloture on this legislation if I were able to \n     be present in the Senate for the vote. The time is now to \n     move forward and deal with global warming, and I urge my \n     colleagues to vote for cloture.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. She congratulates us on the bill. It is with great pride \nthat I add these letters to Senator Obama's letter.\n  I do hope my colleagues will give us a ``yea'' vote. We know that \nunder the rule, we can have amendments. Absolutely, we can. We hope we \nwill get a good cloture vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I compliment the Senator from \nCalifornia for her leadership on the Environment Committee and on this \nimportant legislation. It is time to face up to it. One cannot find a \nmore critical environmental issue facing this Senate, our country, or \nour world than fighting global warming. We need legislation that faces \nthis problem head-on. Inaction here endangers our children, our \ngrandchildren, and future generations who can never understand the \nopposition and unwillingness of the Senate to deal with this problem. \nYet, as we stand here now, Senators on the other side of the aisle are \nfilibustering this legislation. We are losing precious time. The \npatient is sick, and we have to start providing the meds. We have \nalready lost over 7 years under a President who has ignored science and \nquestioned the very existence of global warming. We have seen other \nMembers of this body do the same thing, even calling global warming a \nhoax.\n  As we sit here and wait for leadership from our President and from \nthis Congress, our world is literally paying the price. As temperatures \nrise, our world suffers. In the United States, the glaciers in Glacier \nNational Park are shrinking. The park's largest glaciers are one-third \nof their 1850s grandeur. The oceans are being altered. Ocean levels are \nrising, threatening coastlines far across the globe and here at home, \nincluding, in my State, the New Jersey seashore, where the very \nsurvival of the State's residents is at stake. Defense experts see \nsecurity risks from global warming. A Pentagon report says that large \npopulated countries could become nearly uninhabitable because of rising \nseas. Megadroughts could affect the world's breadbaskets, such as \nAmerica's Midwest, and future wars could be fought over the issue of \nmere survival in this new climate.\n  The American people sent us here to take real action and to confront \nthese problems. We need to take some bold steps to reduce greenhouse \ngas emissions to match the research of the world's best scientists. \nThis bill would be a critical step forward. It would reduce emissions \nby 15 percent by the year 2020 and by nearly 70 percent by the year \n2050.\n  It will do so by placing a cap on our emissions and giving industry \nthe flexibility it needs within a cap-and-trade system. We already know \nthat a cap-and-trade system works. We used it in the 1990s to \nsuccessfully combat acid rain, and we should be doing the same thing \nnow to fight global warming.\n  I ask my colleagues, please join us in taking this landmark step \nforward, and do not let politics interfere with our obligation to \nprotect our families.\n  As we move forward, we have to listen to those scientists who \ndedicate their lives to the pursuit of fact and truth, not raw \npolitics. We have to make sure scientists in our country can freely do \ntheir work and tell the truth to the American people without having \ntheir research suppressed--suppressed--by a President and an \nadministration with a political agenda.\n  President Bush, his administration, and many here in Congress have \nsquandered precious years, ignoring the reality of global warming. Even \nworse, they hindered and outright suppressed, as I mentioned, the work \nof Government scientists who were sounding the alarm about global \nwarming's effect on our planet and all of us who inhabit it.\n  The United States is expected to be a leader in the world. Yet, while \nthe 2,500 scientists from 113 countries were collaborating on the most \nrecent United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report \non global warming, the President of the United States was still \nunwilling to hear the truth.\n  The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report found that:\n\n       Warming of the climate system is unequivocal.\n\n  And human activity is to blame.\n  Beyond the importance of what the report said is the fact that the \nreport relied on uncensored, unaltered science to say so. In contrast \nto the integrity and accuracy of the IPCC report, the Bush \nadministration has censored the conclusions of the U.S. scientists to \nadvance a political agenda. The administration has blocked or delayed \nthe release of Government reports on global warming. It has deleted key \nwords such as ``global warming'' from public documents. And it has \ndenied scientists the ability to freely discuss their conclusions with \nthe public.\n  Mr. Phil Cooney, the former Chief of Staff for the White House \nCouncil on Environmental Quality, was one of the architects of this \ncampaign of scientific suppression.\n  Mr. Cooney--not a scientist--weakened or edited out scientific \njudgments from Federal climate change reports. These changes made the \nthreat of global warming seem less serious. In the 2002 climate change \nreport ``Our Changing Planet,'' the original text read, ``Earth is \nundergoing a period of relatively rapid change.'' Mr. Cooney changed \nthat to, ``Earth may be undergoing a period of rapid change''--totally \naltering the significance of this statement. Mr. Cooney later left the \nadministration to go to work for ExxonMobil.\n  In 2006, 13 other Senators joined me in asking the inspectors general \nof NOAA and NASA--both agencies--to investigate the Bush \nadministration's suppression of science on global warming. The report \nfrom NASA just came out this week and found that political appointees \nin NASA's press shop had manipulated the work of scientists. The \ninspector general stated that political appointees at NASA had \n``reduced, marginalized, or mischaracterized climate change science \nmade available to the general public.''\n\n[[Page S5198]]\n\n  It is incredible to believe. It is simply unacceptable for the \ngreatest democracy in the world to stifle the findings of scientists \nfor political and ideological reasons. It is common sense to listen to \nthe best scientists in the world and to act on their research. And \ntheir research is telling us that global warming is getting worse and \nit is time for us to act.\n  It is disappointing beyond words that our colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle are preventing us from moving forward with this bill. \nIn this place--the Senate--and at this time, some Members of the Senate \nare putting special interests and politics ahead of the safety and \nwell-being of our people. We have to act now, and this bill is the \nright place to start. We dare not let this time pass without action.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/05/senate-section/article/S5198-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5198]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THANKING THE SENATE PAGES\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, today is the last day of service for our \ncurrent page class. On behalf of all Senators, I thank them for the job \nthey do every day for us--running these documents all over the Capitol, \nrushing around here to make sure amendments are filed appropriately \nand, for me, often filing cloture motions. They do a lot. The glass of \nwater I have here, as for every Senator, they know whether they want \nsparkling water, water with ice, cold water, warm water.\n  These are wonderful, intelligent young men and women. It would have \nbeen a wonderful experience to be a page when I was a boy. I hope my \nvision of the time they have had is appropriate in that they really do \nhave the time I think they are having.\n  They have seen this body, the greatest deliberative body in the \nhistory of the world, debate some very difficult issues. They have seen \nus succeed at times, maybe not succeed at other times. But I hope they \nalways believe we approach our job with sincerity, of having different \nviews but always striving to make our country stronger.\n  It is lost on no one that more than a few of our Senators who have \nserved here and served in the House have been pages. Chris Dodd from \nConnecticut was a Senate page. I talked to him about it today. That was \nthe beginning of his career.\n  Mr. President, I have in my office right across the hall pictures of \nmy two first grandchildren--two beautiful little girls, little babies. \nThey could not sit up. They were so small, they were propped up against \nsomething. One of them was born in September and the other was born in \nNovember. Ryan and Mattie--beautiful little babies. But I have in front \nof that picture a picture of my two oldest grandchildren in their \nSenate page uniforms. They were Senate pages. Being Senate pages \nchanged their lives, and I am not exaggerating. It was a wonderful \nexperience for my two grandchildren.\n\n  I hope the experience for every one of these pages is half as good as \nfor my granddaughters. When I say it changed their lives, I am not \njoking. Take Ryan as an example. She did not read newspapers. She was \nnot really interested in what was going on in Government. But she now \nis. She reads, watches the news, and sees people come through the \nSenate whom she used to work with.\n  It does not hurt my feelings--and it should not hurt the other 98 \nSenators--to accept the proposition that their favorite Senator is \nRobert Byrd. Now, Robert Byrd is frail and not as strong and vigorous \nas he was when I first came to the Senate. But the pages, when my \ngranddaughters were here, voted for which Senator they liked most, and \nit was Robert Byrd.\n  Well, I am confident that as a result of these young men and women \nbeing here, they will have a new enthusiasm for public service. I know \nthe Presiding Officer and I believe in government. Government is good. \nWhen people are in trouble, where can you go for help? Mr. President, \n9/11 said you can look to your God, whoever that might be, you can look \nto your family, and you can look to government. There are very few \nplaces to go other than that. And for government, we need good people, \nin appointive office and in elective office. I do not think there is a \nhigher calling than public service. I personally feel so fortunate \nevery day to be a public servant. Do we make all the money that people \ncan make on the outside? No. But we make enough money. We make plenty \nof money. So I hope these young men and women find ways, big and small, \nto serve and honor the country that we love and they love.\n  I have the honor in the morning of being able to speak at the pages' \ngraduation. I look forward to doing that. I am going to do that at 10 \no'clock in the morning.\n  But, Mr. President, for today, I wish to enter the names of all of \nthis semester's pages in the Record in honor of their service. The \nfirst two names I read off tonight are a couple Nevadans: Danae Moser, \nSparks, NV; Andrew Solomon, Gardnerville, NV.

Mr. President, it is a privilege today to submit to the \nRecord an essay by Jan Hartke, my friend and the son of our late \ncolleague, Senator Vance Hartke of Indiana.\n  William Butler Yeats famously wrote: ``my glory was I had such \nfriends.'' To know Vance Hartke as a cherished friend, as an ally to \nall who are not just unashamed but actually proud to seek peace, as a \nfellow Navy man, and particularly as a mentor, protector, and champion \nfor those of us who returned from Vietnam to oppose the war--really, \nthat was all the glory or honor any of us ever really need or deserve.\n  Vance's passing hit me like a punch to the gut; I was driving in New \nHampshire in July of that long hot summer of 2003, in the middle of a \nPresidential campaign, when the jarring news came to me--and brought \nback memories of my earliest years as an antiwar activist, and of a \npublic servant who shared our cause and our concerns. Then and \nthroughout his life, Vance was compelling in the absolute sincerity of \nhis character. He was spurred to soul-searching by America's disastrous \nintervention in Vietnam. He found himself asking, as many now ask of \nIraq, not just ``How do we end this war?'' but ``How do we learn from \nour mistakes and end the mindset that got us into war?''\n  It was a profound moral compass that led Senator Hartke to work with \nSenators Mark Hatfield, Jennings Randolph, Sam Nunn, and Spark \nMatsunaga on legislation to found the U.S. Institute of Peace, whose \ncontinued work studying conflict and building understanding has become \na testament to the nobility of Vance's aspirations and the life he \nlived in support of them.\n  With the groundbreaking of a beautiful new building, the organization \nbuilt to house Senator Hartke's ideas finally has a home worthy of its \nfounder.\n  Here, for the Senate Record, is a powerful essay--which captures \nVance's vision as only his son could--in honor of this historic event.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have the essay to which I referred printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  New Peace Building on Nation's Mall\n\n       A new building dedicated to international peace will begin \n     to rise in Washington, D.C. between the Lincoln Memorial and \n     the Kennedy Center at the northwest corner of the\n\n[[Page S5199]]\n\n     National Mall during a groundbreaking ceremony on June 5, \n     2008. President Bush and Speaker Pelosi will offer remarks.\n       The building will house the U.S. Institute of Peace (USIP), \n     with its headquarters and public education center, an idea \n     whose roots can be traced back to President George Washington \n     and the framers of the U.S. Constitution.\n       The building will not be a monument to an individual or \n     commemorate a significant event in our nation's history. \n     Rather, it will be a place where the hard work of peace goes \n     on, where globally recognized experts on conflict resolution \n     will seek ways to prevent accidental and unnecessary wars, \n     limit their scope and severity, and identify and facilitate \n     exit strategies. The USIP building will symbolize America's \n     most cherished ideal--enduring peace on earth.\n       The design of this historic building by world-renowned \n     architect, Moshe Safdie, is in perfect harmony with its noble \n     purpose. From its imaginative white roof shaped like the \n     wings of a dove, to its open and transparent glass atrium, \n     the USIP building seems infused with the hope and promise and \n     work of peace.\n       The idea for the USIP arose during the Vietnam War, when \n     Senator Vance Hartke tried to make the case to his friend, \n     President Johnson, that the war was a terrible mistake, based \n     on a misinterpretation of history, culture, and geopolitics. \n     Unfortunately, President Johnson interpreted his dissent as \n     disloyalty to him and his Administration. Nor did the other \n     institutions make the case for peace. Even the State \n     Department was for war.\n       At that point, Senator Hartke realized that something was \n     missing from the Nation's decision-making apparatus on the \n     great issues of war and peace. He saw the need for a non-\n     partisan entity with analytical depth and institutional heft \n     whose sole mandate was to advance the cause of peace. Joined \n     by Senator Mark Hatfield, they introduced legislation that \n     laid the cornerstone for the eventual creation of the USIP.\n       The legislation was moved forward through a commission \n     headed by Senator Spark Matsunaga, whose members were \n     appointed by President Carter. Public hearings were held \n     across the country. The upshot was that experts from a wide \n     variety of fields were offended by the notion that the search \n     for peace was wishful thinking and futile. With a sweeping \n     charter, the bi-partisan legislation was passed and signed \n     into law by President Reagan in 1984.\n       ``The somewhat radical notion underlying USIP's creation,'' \n     Corine Hegland wrote in a perceptive article in the National \n     Journal,'' was that the science of peace could be studied, \n     refined, and taught in much the same manner as military \n     skills and strategies had been consciously honed for \n     centuries.''\n       ``We got it wrong after 9/11,'' as USIP's Executive Vice-\n     President Patricia Thomson sees it. ``We restructured our \n     homeland-security institutions, but we should have \n     restructured our foreign-policy institutions.'' The current \n     work of the USIP still encompasses basic research but \n     increasingly its storehouse of best peace practices has been \n     used and applied in countries around the world, wherever hot \n     spots flare. USIP's Chairman, Robinson West, and President, \n     Richard Solomon, have mobilized their staff of 142 employees \n     to rethink conflicts with a bold view toward preventing and \n     ending them.\n       The body of work of USIP shows an evolving institution \n     whose basic values lie at the heart of civilization, whether \n     it is recruiting statesmen like Lee Hamilton and James Baker \n     III to lead the Iraq Study Group, or the efforts to implement \n     the Dayton Peace Accords led by former Chairman Chester \n     Crocker.\n       Forty years after he envisioned the creation of USIP, \n     Senator Hartke's challenging and prophetic words still ring \n     true: ``I have the unshakable conviction that we have it \n     within our power to end this war (Vietnam) and the syndrome \n     of war itself. . . . For in the end, it is the dreamer who is \n     the greatest realist.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/05/senate-section/article/S5199-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5199-S5200]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                MILLENNIUM CHALLENGE CORPORATION FUNDING\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I had the fortunate opportunity to travel \nto Africa and South America over the Easter recess, and I want to take \na moment to share some of my observations with my colleagues.\n  Mali receives significant U.S. foreign assistance totaling $45 \nmillion in fiscal year 2007, $55 million in fiscal year 2008--and $461 \nmillion in Millennium Challenge Corporation, MCC, funding.\n  While Mali appears headed in the right direction, I worry that the \nMCC is going down the wrong path, specifically by funding a $90 million \nrenovation project for Bamako airport's runway and terminal. I \nunderstand that this project may have been formulated through a \nconsultative process, but it seems to me that it should be funded \nthrough the African Development Bank or by private investment. I expect \nthe MCC to justify to the State, Foreign Operations Subcommittee the \nnecessity for U.S. taxpayers to fund the airport project, and to \nconsult on the reprogramming of funds required by the derailed $90 \nmillion industrial park project.\n  The funding disparity and contrast between our traditional \ndevelopment agency--the U.S. Agency for International Development, \nUSAID--and the MCC was glaring in Mali. Where USAID--could benefit from \na slight increase in overall funding, the MCC was struggling to \ndetermine how best to reprogram $90 million. I am very concerned that \nMCC may not live up to its billing as a more effective aid delivery \nprogram, and its deep pockets may create unintended opportunities for \ncorruption.\n  I had the opportunity to visit the U.S. Embassy and learned of the \nloss of air conditioning for a lengthy period of time which was a \nburden to American and local staff. This is not the first time I've \nheard of problems at our newly built embassies, and I encourage the \nState Department to make sure that no patterns exist at these \nfacilities because of subpar contractors or equipment.\n  Like Mali, Nigeria receives significant U.S. assistance primarily \nthrough a new initiative, the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS \nRelief, PEPFAR. Assistance in fiscal year 2007 totaled $350 million and \n$491 million in fiscal year 2008, of which $282 million and $410 \nmillion are for HIV/AIDS activities, respectively.\n  On paper, Nigeria is wealthy country with significant oil reserves, \nand, we were told, an estimated $57 billion in an excess crude account. \nCorruption is unfortunately a cancer that stymies development and \npolitical progress in that country; Transparency International's \nCorruption Perception Index, 2007, ranks Nigeria 147th out of 179th.\n  Nigeria is a PEPFAR focus country, with a 3.9 percent prevalence rate \namong adults. Given Nigeria's significant natural resources, it is \nimperative that the AIDS Coordinator begin a process of transitioning \nfrom U.S. to Nigeria-funded programs. America can help the Government \nof Nigeria spend its health dollars, but I question the efficacy of \nU.S. funding for HIV/AIDS programs in that country. I will have more to \nsay on this issue when the Senate considers the reauthorization of \nPEPFAR, perhaps later this year.\n  Namibia is also a PEPFAR focus country, and received $86.9 million in \nfiscal year 2007 and $103 million in fiscal year 2008 for HIV/AIDS \nprograms. Unfortunately, other programs for Namibia, specifically \nsupport for democracy activities, has been in steady decline over the \npast few fiscal years and is being zeroed out. Given that the ruling \nSWAPO party is no longer a monolith, and splinter parties are forming, \nthe Administration's reduction in assistance to Namibia may be ill \ntimed and ill advised.\n  My staff and I are exploring ways to ensure that sufficient funding \nexists for non-HIV/AIDS programs for Namibia, including immediate \nsupport for domestic election monitoring activities in that country, \nand like Nigeria, I encourage PEPFAR personnel to explore sustainment \nstrategies for U.S.-funded HIV/AIDS programs.\n  I am also concerned that the United States is not supporting enough \nexchange programs with countries in Africa. I intend to increase these \nprograms in upcoming appropriations bills.\n  South Africa is also a PEPFAR focus country and received $398 million \nin fiscal year 2007 and $547 million in fiscal year 2008 HIV/AIDS \nfunding. South Africa is running a budget surplus--in this case \ntotaling $2.4 billion.\n  I am very pleased that our U.S. Ambassador understands the need for \nSouth Africa to assume greater financial responsibility for HIV/AIDS \nprograms, and it is unfortunate that certain South Africa government \nofficials have not been aggressive in addressing this issue. Any future \nsupport for HIV/AIDS programs in South Africa should be conditioned on \nthe development and implementation of sustainment strategies to ensure \nthat the Government of South Africa assume the care for its infected \npopulations.\n  Crime remains a significant challenge to everyone in South Africa, \nand given the increased personnel requirements associated with PEPFAR, \nit may make sense to allow the use of PEPFAR funds for administrative \nand operational expenses at the U.S. Embassy, including for security \npurposes. New initiatives create increased desk\n\n[[Page S5200]]\n\nand office space needs, and I've asked my staff to take a closer look \nat this issue in anticipation of marking up the fiscal year 2009 State, \nForeign Operations Appropriations bill.\n  I also intend to continue to work with Secretary of State Rice on \nresolving travel issues impacting members of the Africa National \nCongress, which is an unnecessary irritant in U.S.-South African \nrelations.\n  Finally, although Argentina is not a major recipient of U.S. foreign \nassistance--some $2 million was provided in fiscal year 2008--relations \nbetween our countries have been historically good. I encourage my \ncolleagues to continue to follow counterdrug and counterterrorism \ndevelopments in that country--and region.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/05/senate-section/article/S5200-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5200]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            ILLEGAL LOGGING\n\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, the extension of the Lacey Act within this \nlegislation to cover imported timber and wood products sends a strong \nsignal that the U.S. Congress is serious about supporting the \nPresident's Initiative Against Illegal Logging.\n  The practice of illegal logging--both in the United States and \nabroad--is a deplorable act that poses environment threats as well as \nthreats to legitimate businesses that operate within the rule of law.\n  It is crucial, that as this legislation is implemented, a clear \ndistinction be drawn between ``innocent'' owners in the supply chain \nwho in good faith trade in wood products that they believe to be \nlegally harvested abroad, and those who knowingly traffic in illegal \nmaterial.\n  It is the concern of Congress that this line be clearly drawn when \nprosecutions occur under this act.\n  Therefore, I support the provision included in this act that places \nthe burden of proof in civil forfeiture cases on the government, as \nprovided by the Civil Asset Forfeiture Reform Act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/05/senate-section/article/S5200-2", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5200]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        TRIBUTE TO RALPH JACKMAN\n\n Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure to \nbring to the attention of the Nation, and my colleagues in this body, \nthe remarkable career of Ralph Jackman of Vergennes, VT, who has served \nthat small city as its volunteer fire chief for the past 54 years. \nWhile it is difficult to confirm this fact definitively, it is my \nunderstanding that Ralph Jackman is the longest serving fire chief in \nthe history of this country. This historic longevity of service is \ndeserving of celebration, as is the quality of leadership he has \nbrought to his community, his State and this Nation.\n  In much of rural America, volunteer firefighters are not just first \nresponders, but the heart of their communities, an essential part of \nthe glue that holds those communities together.\n  Everywhere across America, young people hear, and for decades have \nheard, the call to serve their communities; everywhere across America, \nand most certainly in Vermont, they answer that call at an early age. \nLike so many volunteer firefighters, Ralph joined his department when \nhe was in his early twenties.\n  In 1953, at the age of 30, Ralph Jackman was named chief of the \nVergennes Fire Department. He has served in that capacity for over half \na century, protecting the citizenry and their property in this city \nnear Lake Champlain. In large part owing to Mr. Jackman's leadership, \nthe department was able to successfully upgrade its fire station, \nrecruit many new members and acquire the large array of vehicles, \nequipment, and apparatus that his fire department needed.\n  Testimony to his leadership are the positions he has held and the \nhonors he has received: two-time past president of the Vermont State \nFirefighters Association, past president of the Addison County \nFirefighters Association, ACFA, the Robert B. King Fire Chief of the \nYear and as the Frances J. Shorkey Fire Chief of the Year.\n  Today, even though he is in his eighties, Ralph Jackman continues to \nserve as the active fire chief in Vergennes and manages all the day-to-\nday operations of the department.\n  Not content with his service as a firefighter, and desiring to serve \nfurther, in addition to his role as fire chief, Ralph Jackman answered \nhis Nation's call: he is a World War II veteran, and served in the Army \nReserves from 1946 to 1972. He is also a member of the American Legion \nPost 14, continues to serve as Vergennes fire warden, and has been a \nmember of the Rotary Club for 55 years. He has also been an organizer \nfor Meals-On-Wheels.\n  I am proud of the work that Chief Jackman has done for the city of \nVergennes, the State of Vermont and for the spirit of public service \nand volunteerism in this country. Mr. Jackman's dedication to his \nfamily, to his fellow volunteer firefighters, the fire service, and to \nthe people of his community is worthy of commendation, and today I \ncommend him in the highest terms.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/05/senate-section/article/S5200-3", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5200]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  A TRIBUTE IN MEMORY OF JIM McCRINDLE\n\n Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure to \nrecognize a dedicated public servant and a patriotic American from my \nhome State--Mr. James ``Jim'' McCrindle. Jim passed away on June 1, but \nhis legacy lives on through all that he accomplished and all those he \ntouched.\n  In 1961, Jim immigrated to America from Ayr, Scotland, to pursue an \neducation and earn his piece of the American dream. He joined the U.S. \nArmy in 1962 and attained the rank of specialist five.\n  Following his military service, Jim began serving our Nation in a \ndifferent capacity through his involvement in the Department of \nDefense's Morale, Welfare & Recreation, MWR, services and programs. His \nwork helped to enhance the lives of these employees by promoting \nfitness, good health, and camaraderie.\n  Jim went on to fulfill his goal of receiving an education by \nattaining a degree in hospitality management from Cornell University. \nHe would use these skills to support the soldiers he greatly respected \nand admired.\n  Throughout his life, Jim strived to bring comfort to members of our \narmed services. Among his many accomplishments, he managed the Armed \nForces Recreation Center--Europe, helped to plan and execute the \nDepartment of Defense's R program during Operations Desert Shield and \nDesert Storm, and was instrumental in the development of Shades of \nGreen--a Walt Disney World Resort for members of our military.\n  Jim served as the hotel's manager and helped it to achieve great \nsuccess. Since its opening in 1995, Shades of Green has routinely \nachieved one of the highest occupancy rates of any American hotel.\n  Jim managed Shades of Green up until his passing early this month. It \nwas truly his pride and joy, and was one of his many contributions to \nour Nation. I applaud his steadfast commitment to improving the lives \nof others. On behalf of Florida and the people of the United States, I \nwould like to honor this great American for reminding us all of what \nmakes our Nation great.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/05/senate-section/article/S5200-4", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5200-S5201]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        CONGRATULATING THE AMERICAN BUSINESS WOMEN'S ASSOCIATION\n\n Mr. BUNNING.

Local ABWA chapters continuously contribute to the \nprofessional development of their members through educational programs, \nalong with charitable opportunities, networking, and scholarships.

A concurrent resolution adopted by the Senate of \n     the State of Mississippi urging Congress to support the \n     passage of the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-\n     Determination Act; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \n     Resources.\n\n                  Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 556\n\n       Whereas, in December 2000, the Secure Rural Schools and \n     Community Self-Determination Act, a Federal act, was signed \n     into law; and\n       Whereas, the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-\n     Determination Act provides federal funds to counties and \n     school districts with national forest lands located within \n     the county boundaries; and\n       Whereas, 33 counties have substantial tracts of land in \n     public ownership which can neither be developed nor taxed to \n     generate revenue from economic activity or taxation; and\n       Whereas, these counties have United States National Forests \n     within its boundaries and have received critical funds for \n     roads and schools based on revenues generated from these \n     forests; and\n       Whereas, the payments provided to these counties have been \n     a consistent and necessary source of funding for the schools, \n     teachers and students; and\n       Whereas, in December 2007, the United States Congress \n     removed the reauthorization of the Secure Rural Schools and \n     Community Self-Determination Act from the Energy Legislation \n     to which it was attached. This legislation was subsequently \n     passed and signed into law without reauthorization for the \n     Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act; \n     and\n       Whereas, the funding provided through the Secure Rural \n     Schools and Community Self-Determination Act will \n     significantly contribute to the local economy of these \n     counties by providing the necessary funds for schools and \n     roads, which is vital for sustained economic development; and\n       Whereas, these counties depend on the funding from the \n     Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act and \n     unless the funding is secured through legislation as deemed \n     appropriate by the Mississippi congressional delegation, \n     these counties will lose critical funding that it has \n     received for decades:\n       Now, Therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate of the State of Mississippi, the \n     House of Representatives concurring therein, That we, the \n     members of the Legislature of the State of Mississippi, \n     respectfully request that the United States Congress pass the \n     Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act so \n     that these Mississippi counties may continue to adequately \n     maintain the roads and schools and sustain economic \n     development in the state.\n       Be it further\n       Resolved, That the Secretary of the Senate is directed to \n     transmit copies of this resolution to President George W. \n     Bush, the Secretary of the United States Senate, the Clerk of \n     the United States House of Representatives, the Governor of \n     the State of Mississippi, each member of the Mississippi \n     congressional delegation, and that copies be made available \n     to members of the Capitol Press Corps.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-363. A resolution adopted by the Senate of the State of \n     Michigan urging Congress\n\n[[Page S5203]]\n\n     to enact the Clean Boating Act of 2008; to the Committee on \n     Environment and Public Works.\n\n                       Senate Resolution No. 179\n\n       Whereas, in September 2006 the U.S. Northern District Court \n     Court of California issued a ruling that required the \n     Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to regulate ballast \n     water discharges. Ocean-going vessels moving from port to \n     port are largely responsible for the spread of aquatic \n     invasive species through the discharge of ballast water. \n     Although intended to address only ballast water discharges \n     from ocean-going vessels, the court ruling encompassed all \n     discharges from all vessels, including recreational boats. \n     Under the ruling, all vessels would be required to have a \n     federal permit for discharges to the water beginning \n     September 2008; and\n       Whereas, recreational boat discharges are already regulated \n     under numerous federal and state laws. Non-polluting, \n     incidental discharges such as weather deck runoff, grey \n     water, uncontaminated bilge water, and engine coolant water \n     should not require a federal permit. These discharges occur \n     during the normal operation of a recreational vessel and are \n     completely different from the discharges of a commercial ship \n     that were intended to be affected by the District Court \n     ruling; and\n       Whereas, with almost 1 million registered recreational \n     boats, Michigan is one of the top boating states in the \n     nation. With 40,000 square miles of Great Lakes waters and \n     thousands of inland lake boating opportunities, boating is \n     one of the largest outdoor recreational activities in which \n     our residents take part. Requiring Michigan recreational boat \n     owners to obtain the federal discharge permit will be a huge \n     economical burden and inconvenience to Michigan boat owners; \n     and\n       Whereas, Congress has before it the Clean Boating Act of \n     2008 (S. 2766), which will restore the 35-year-old EPA \n     exemption for these non-polluting discharges from \n     recreational vessels. Immediate action on S. 2766 will \n     prevent owners of small, recreational boats from having to \n     purchase the same, expensive discharge permits required of \n     commercial vessels beginning in September, and\n       Whereas, it is critical that owners and operatores of \n     recreational boats must continue to abide by Michigan \n     Department of Natural Resources' recommendations for the \n     proper treatment of their vessels, including voluntary \n     practices such as a thorough washing of their vessels when \n     moving from one body of water to another to minimize the risk \n     of the spread of invasive species; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate, That we memorialize the Congress of \n     the United States to enact the Clean Boating Act of 2008; and \n     be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the Secretary of the United States Environmental Protection \n     Agency, the President of the United States Senate, the \n     Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, and \n     the members of the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-364. A resolution adopted by the Legislature of the \n     State of Utah urging U.S. withdrawal from the Security and \n     Prosperity Partnership of North America; to the Committee on \n     Foreign Relations.\n\n                         House Resolution No. 1\n\n       Whereas, President George W. Bush established the Security \n     and Prosperity Partnership (SPP) of North America with the \n     nations of Mexico and Canada on March 23, 2005;\n       Whereas, the gradual creation of such a North American \n     Union from a merger of the United States, Mexico, and Canada \n     would be a direct threat to the United States Constitution \n     and the national independence of the United States and would \n     imply an eventual end to national borders within North \n     America;\n       Whereas, on March 31, 2006, a White House news release \n     confirmed the continuing existence of the SPP and its \n     ``ongoing process of cooperation'';\n       Whereas, Congressman Ron Paul has written that a key to the \n     SPP plan is an extensive new North American Free Trade \n     Agreement (NAFTA) superhighway: ``[U]nder this new \n     `partnership,' a massive highway is being planned to stretch \n     from Canada into Mexico, through the state of Texas.'';\n       Whereas, this trilateral partnership to develop a North \n     American Union has never been presented to Congress as an \n     agreement or treaty, and has had virtually no congressional \n     oversight; and\n       Whereas, state and local governments throughout the United \n     States would be negatively impacted by the SPP and North \n     American Union process, such as the ``open borders'' vision \n     of the SPP, eminent domain takings of private property along \n     the planned superhighways; and increased law enforcement \n     problems along those same superhighways: Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved, That the House of Representatives of the state of \n     Utah urges the United States Congress, and Utah's \n     congressional delegation, to use all of their efforts, \n     energies, and diligence to withdraw the United States from \n     any further participation in the Security and Prosperity \n     Partnership of North America.

Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. TESTER (for himself, Mr. Crapo, Mr. Baucus, and Mr. \n        Craig):\n  S. 3085. A bill to require the Secretary of the Interior to establish \na cooperative watershed management program, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Cooperative \nWatershed Act of 2008 with my colleagues Senators Crapo, Baucus and \nCraig.\n  This is an important piece of legislation because it deals with being \ngood caretakers of our water.\n  Water is life. It is as simple as that folks. If we do not manage \nwhat we have, well then people are going to be in trouble. In Montana, \nwe are currently suffering through almost a decade of drought, and with \ngrowing demand, increased pollution, and a changing climate, our water \nresources will only become more stressed in the coming years.\n  Now folks in Montana are not the type to sit back and wait for \nsomeone else to come along and fix a problem for them. No, folks in \nMontana have long since started coming together to form local groups to \nensure their water resources are properly managed. These groups consist \nof irrigators, farmers, environmental groups, scientists, and \ngovernmental officials all working together. Unfortunately, these \ngroups often are limited by a lack of funding for projects and a full \ntime administrator. These groups hold so much potential, but are being \nheld back by the simple lack of funding. That is why I, along with \nSenators Crapo, Baucus, and Craig, have introduced the Cooperative \nWatershed Act of 2008.\n  The Cooperative Watershed Act of 2008 sets up a granting program \nunder the Department of the Interior to help local stakeholders come \ntogether and form or expand watershed-wide management groups that can \ncooperatively manage their local water resources. The funds in this \nbill will help these groups build the capacity to act as grassroots, \nnonregulatory entities to address local water availability and quality \nissues within a watershed.\n  By getting all the different stakeholders involved in the management \nprocess, these groups will help reduce the need for Federal regulation \nand litigation, and result in the best overall use of the available, \nand often limited, water supply. Make no mistake, in Montana we \nunderstand that local stakeholders are in the best position to manage \ntheir own resources, but Federal support must play a role in helping \nthem establish the capacity to do so.\n  Now in granting funds, this bill takes into account that different \nstrokes are needed for different folks. To accommodate the varying \nstages of development of different groups, the grant program is divided \ninto three phases: an initial planning phase to help new groups form \nand begin to formulate ideas and project proposals, a pilot project \nphase to help semi-established groups gain the capacity to conduct \nprojects and studies, and an implementation phase to help fully formed \nand functioning groups undertake large-scale, multi-year projects.\n  Montana has been a leader in implementing water resources planning on \na watershed scale for years, and the funding provided in this bill will \nallow Montanans and other interested States to increase their capacity \nto effectively manage their vital water resources as we move into the \nfuture.\n  Mr. President, I ask by unanimous consent that the text of the bill \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3085\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the antitrust laws to ensure competitive \nmarket-based fees and terms for merchants' access to electronic payment \nsystems; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Credit Card \nFair Fee Act of 2008. This legislation will provide fairness and \ntransparency in the setting of credit card interchange fees. This bill \nis companion legislation to a bipartisan bill introduced in the House \nof Representatives by Chairman John Conyers of the House Judiciary \nCommittee and Representative Chris Cannon. The Conyers-Cannon bill \ncurrently has an additional 19 Democratic and 16 Republican cosponsors.\n  This legislation is supported by the Merchants Payments Coalition, a \ncoalition of retailers, supermarkets, convenience stores, drug stores, \nfuel stations, on-line merchants and other businesses. The coalition's \nmember associations collectively represent about 2.7 million stores \nwith approximately 50 million employees.\n  Interchange fees may not be well known to most Americans, but they \nshould be. Last year, U.S. retailers, and by extension their customers, \npaid approximately $42 billion in interchange fees to the banks that \nissue credit cards. The billions that are paid in interchange fees each \nyear significantly cut into the profit margins of retailers and pinch \nthe pocketbooks of consumers. And neither retailers nor consumers have \na say in how these interchange fees are set within the Visa and \nMasterCard systems, which together account for over 70 percent of the \ncredit and debit card market. The current lack of meaningful \ncompetition, negotiation and transparency in the setting of interchange \nfees represents a market failure, one that affects every American \nretailer and every American consumer.\n  My legislation takes a measured approach to address this market \nfailure. My bill would identify credit and debit card payment systems \nthat have significant market power, and would permit the retailers who \nuse those systems to collectively negotiate with the providers of the \nsystems over the fees for system access and use. If the retailers and \nproviders are unable to agree voluntarily on a consensus set of fees, \nthe bill would direct an impartial panel of judges to consider the two \nparties' fee proposals, and to select the proposal that most closely \nreflects what a hypothetical perfectly competitive market would \nproduce. As I will discuss further below, this approach will protect \nretailers and consumers by preventing credit card companies from using \ntheir market power to charge unreasonable fees through an unfair \nprocess.\n  So what are interchange fees, and why do they pose a problem? \nWhenever a consumer uses a credit or debit card to make a purchase from \na retailer, the banks and credit card companies involved in the \ntransaction charge a number of fees that are passed on to the retailer \nand ultimately to the consumer. The interchange fee is one such fee. It \nis a fee charged by the card-issuing bank to the retailer's bank.\n  Here is an example of how an interchange fee is charged. When a \nconsumer buys $100 in goods from a retailer using a Visa or MasterCard, \nthe retailer first submits the transaction information to the \nretailer's bank (the ``acquiring bank''). The acquiring bank submits \nthis information, via the Visa or MasterCard network, to the bank that \nissued the card to the consumer, the issuing bank. The issuing bank \neither authorizes or denies the transaction. If the transaction is \nauthorized, the issuing bank sends to the acquiring bank, via the Visa \nor MasterCard network, the purchase amount minus an interchange fee \nthat is retained by the issuing bank.\n\n  As a result of the interchange fee and other processing fees imposed \nupon the retailer by the acquiring bank, collectively, these fees are \nknown as the ``merchant discount fee,'' the retailer typically only \nreceives approximately $97.50 out of the $100 sale. In order to cover \nthis cost and continue to make a profit, retailers typically raise the \nretail price of their goods, meaning that consumers must pay more \nregardless of whether they pay with cash or plastic.\n  Visa and MasterCard set the interchange fee rates for all the banks \nand all the retailers that participate in the Visa and MasterCard \nsystems. Those interchange rates are frequently charged as a percentage \nof the sale amount plus a flat fee; for example, an interchange fee \nmight equal 1.75 percent + 20 cents per transaction. The interchange \nfee rate varies for certain types of Visa and MasterCard cards and \ntransaction categories, and is typically higher for cards that involve \nrewards programs for cardholders.\n  What is the rationale for assessing interchange fees? According to \nVisa, MasterCard, and the banks that issue them, these fees are used to \npay for important functions within the credit and debit card systems. \nFor example, interchange fees can be used to cover the costs of \nprocessing and authorizing credit card transactions, including the \ncosts of ensuring data security and safeguarding against fraud. \nInterchange fees can also help protect an issuing bank from the risk \nthat a consumer may not pay his or her credit card bill, which would \nleave the issuing bank on the hook for the amount that it gave to the \nacquiring bank at the time of a credit card transaction.\n  In addition to covering these costs and risks, interchange fees have \nbeen used to generate income for issuing banks. This income can be \nretained by the issuing banks as profit, or can be devoted to other \nuses such as consumer marketing campaigns or rewards programs for \ncertain cardholders.\n  In addition to the benefits that interchange fees provide for issuing \nbanks, Visa, MasterCard and their participating banks argue that \ninterchange fees have also provided benefits to retailers and consumers \nby helping to make credit and debit card transactions more efficient \nand more prevalent. Visa, MasterCard and the banks claim that the \ngrowing use of credit and debit cards saves retailers from certain \nexpenses involved with transacting business with cash or\n\n[[Page S5209]]\n\nchecks. They also claim that their cards bring benefits to consumers, \nincluding extra convenience, the availability of short-term credit, and \nrewards programs that are offered to some cardholders.\n  It is clear that interchange fees do play an important part in the \ncredit and debit card systems, and that overall these systems have \ncreated efficiencies and benefits for banks, merchants and consumers. \nHowever, it is also clear that those who must ultimately pay \ninterchange fees--retailers and their consumers--have no say in \nnegotiating how much the interchange fees should be. As a result, \ninterchange fees are being set at rates that would not be agreed upon \nin a competitive market, and that may favor banks to the detriment of \nmerchants and consumers.\n\n  Why are retailers unable to negotiate changes in Visa's and \nMasterCard's interchange fee rates? There are several reasons. First, \nbecause of Visa's and MasterCard's market power, the overwhelming \nmajority of American retailers have no choice but to accept Visa and \nMasterCard as a method of payment. Credit and debit cards are currently \nused for over 40 percent of all transactions in the U.S., and that \npercentage is increasing, in part due to extensive marketing by the \ncard companies and the banks. Visa and MasterCard control over 70 \npercent of the market for credit and debit cards. Most retailers simply \ncannot survive unless they agree to accept those cards.\n  Second, within an electronic payment system the only party with whom \nretailers are able to negotiate effectively is the retailer's acquiring \nbank, and interchange fees are not covered in those negotiations. In \ntheir efforts to obtain retailers' business, including the business of \nprocessing the retailers' credit card transactions, acquiring banks \nwill negotiate and compete over many of the component fees that make up \nthe merchant discount fee. However, the interchange fee is typically by \nfar the largest component of the merchant discount fee, and acquiring \nbanks do not negotiate with retailers on interchange rates nor do they \ncompete to offer retailers lower interchange rates. Instead, \ninterchange rates are set by Visa and MasterCard, who claim that their \nrates are set without the involvement of the banks. Accordingly, the \nacquiring banks tell their retailer customers that the interchange rate \ncomponent cannot be negotiated or reduced below the level set by Visa \nand MasterCard.\n  The interchange fee thus serves as a de facto price floor for the \noverall merchant discount fee--a floor that is fixed in a \nnontransparent, nonnegotiable fashion by card companies with \nsignificant market power. Although I have asked the credit card \ncompanies on several occasions for information that would help me \nunderstand the cost components that contribute to their interchange \nrates, it is still unclear how much profit margin is built into that \nfloor. The margin may be significant, and as long as issuers and \nacquirers are happy with it, there is no incentive for card companies \nto help merchants and consumers by reducing it. Additionally, it should \nbe noted that many if not most acquiring banks also serve as issuing \nbanks, and therefore have almost no incentive to compete to lower the \ninterchange rates that they themselves receive. Because the acquirers \nand issuers are often the same banks, no one negotiates with issuers \nabout interchange fees on the retailers' behalf, and the retailers are \nleft to negotiate for themselves.\n  Third, while some retailers may try to negotiate directly with Visa \nor MasterCard to lower the interchange fee component of their merchant \ndiscount fees, most retailers have no leverage in these negotiations \nsince at the end of the day they will likely have to agree to accept \nVisa and MasterCard in order to stay in business.\n  As a result of this vast disparity in negotiating power, Visa and \nMasterCard can essentially impose interchange rates upon retailers and \nthose retailers have no choice but to accept them. Furthermore, Visa \nand MasterCard also frequently impose take-it-or-leave-it contractual \nterms and conditions on retailers, such as acceptance rules that \nrequire retailers to honor all cards issued by that credit card \ncompany, even if the card is a rewards card with a higher interchange \nrate.\n  Because there is no competition and no real retailer negotiation \ninvolved in the setting of interchange fees, it is not surprising that \ninterchange fees are being charged at levels that would not be agreed \nupon in a fair and competitive market. This has been demonstrated in a \nnumber of ways.\n  For example, as economies of scale and advances in technology have \nbrought down the cost of credit card transaction processing in recent \nyears, normal market pressures would suggest that interchange rates \nwould have similarly decreased. But as noted in a March 29, 2008 Wall \nStreet Journal editorial, ``The Visa interchange fee has increased over \nthe past decade to 1.76 percent from an average of 1.5 percent. \nEconomies of scale should be driving fees down, as in most other \nservice-fee industries.'' In March 2006, the American Banker reported \nthat ``according to the credit card industry newsletter The Nilson \nReport, interchange rates for Visa and MasterCard International have \nrisen steadily every year since 1997.''\n  Also, interchange fees continue to be charged as a percentage of the \nsale price, so even though the cost of processing a $1 credit card \ntransaction is comparable to processing a $1,000 transaction, the \ninterchange fee paid on that $1,000 sale is much higher and much more \nlucrative for the issuing bank.\n  Additionally, Americans are paying higher interchange fees than are \nconsumers in other countries who use the same Visa and MasterCard \ncards. According to a report by the Federal Reserve Bank in \nMinneapolis, U.S. interchange fees average around 1.75 percent, while \nin other industrialized countries such as Britain interchange fees \ntypically average around 0.7 percent.\n  In 2001, the total amount of interchange fees collected in the U.S. \nwas $16.6 billion. By 2007, that amount grew to approximately $42 \nbillion, an increase of over 150 percent since 2001. What are banks \ndoing with the tens of billions of dollars they are collecting in \ninterchange fees each year? There is a serious lack of transparency on \nthis issue, but one study indicates that only around 13 percent of \ncollected interchange fees are devoted to covering the cost of \nprocessing credit card transactions. According to this study, the \nmajority of the collected fees went toward profits for the issuing \nbanks, rewards programs that benefit mostly affluent cardholders, and \nmarketing campaigns.\n  Visa and MasterCard and the banks that use them argue that their \ninterchange fee rates are set at levels that best balance benefits and \ncosts to card issuers and to merchants. If the card companies and the \nbanks truly believe that interchange fee rates are already set at a \nlevel that is fair to merchants, it seems they should have no objection \nto formalizing a process for setting interchange rates that is fair and \ntransparent and that gives merchants a legitimate voice in the process.\n\n  That is what the Credit Card Fair Fee Act would do. This legislation \nwould apply to widely-used credit and debit card systems. Recognizing \nthat these electronic payment systems have become nearly as important \nto our consumer economy as cash and that most retailers cannot stay in \nbusiness without accepting them, the bill would ensure that retailers \nhave access to these electronic payment systems at fair rates and \nterms.\n  Under the bill, if any electronic payment system has significant \nmarket power, i.e., 20 percent or more of the credit and debit card \nmarket, retailers would receive limited antitrust immunity to engage in \ncollective negotiations with the providers of that electronic payment \nsystem over the fees and terms for access to the system.\n  The bill would establish a mandatory period for negotiations between \nthe retailers and providers over fees and terms. If the negotiations \nbetween the retailers and providers do not result in an agreement, the \nmatter would be brought before a panel of expert Electronic Payment \nSystem Judges, who would be appointed by the Department of Justice \nAntitrust Division and the Federal Trade Commission.\n  These Judges would conduct a period of discovery during which \ninformation about fees, terms, and market conditions for electronic \npayment systems\n\n[[Page S5210]]\n\nwould be disclosed. At the end of the discovery period, the Judges \nwould order a mandatory 21-day settlement conference to facilitate a \nsettlement between the retailers and electronic payment system \nproviders. If the settlement conference failed to result in an \nagreement, the Judges would conduct a hearing where each side would \npresent their final offer of fees and terms. The Judges would then \nselect the offer of fees and terms that most closely represented the \nfees and terms that would be negotiated in a hypothetical perfectly \ncompetitive market where neither party had market power.\n  After choosing between the two offers put forth by the parties, the \nJudges would enter an order providing that these fees and terms would \ngovern access to the electronic payment system by the merchants for a \nperiod of 3 years, unless the parties supersede this agreement with a \nvoluntarily negotiated agreement. Decisions by the Judges would be \nappealable to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  The Credit Card Fair Fee Act is modeled after the Copyright Royalty \nand Distribution Reform Act of 2004, which created a similar system for \nthe use of copyrighted music works.\n  Credit card companies and banks may claim that this legislation \ninvolves government price setting, but this is not the case. This \nlegislation does not permit the government to establish on its own \naccord what the fees and terms for retailer usage of credit card \nsystems ought to be. Rather, it sets up a process whereby retailers \nwould be able to make their case as to what fees and terms are fair, \nand if the retailers and credit card providers fail to agree \nvoluntarily on those fees and terms, independent judges would evaluate \nthe parties' offers and select the offer that most closely resembles \nwhat the result would be in a fair and competitive market. In contrast, \ncurrently Visa and MasterCard can use their overwhelming market power \nto establish non-negotiable interchange fees and terms, and retailers \nare forced to abide by these fees and terms or else be denied access to \npayment systems that account for a huge percentage of all U.S. \ntransactions. This type of unaccountable fee-setting runs far more risk \nof harm for retailers and consumers.\n\n  Under my legislation, if the credit card companies and the banks are \nable to persuade the Judges that current interchange rates are \njustifiable, then the rates would remain as they are today. If, on the \nother hand, the retailers are persuasive in arguing that current \ninterchange rates cannot be justified by competitive market dynamics, \nthen the Judges would likely rule that alternative interchange rates \nwould better represent the result of a perfectly competitive market. In \neither case, at a minimum the interests of retailers and consumers \nwould be much better represented in this fundamentally important \nmarket.\n  My legislation represents a measured approach to addressing the \ncurrent market failure with interchange fee-setting. Other countries \nhave addressed the problem of unfair interchange fees through far more \ndrastic solutions. For example, Australia has imposed a system of \ndirect regulation of interchange fees through its central bank, and \nMexico's central bank has negotiated rate reductions with the card \ncompanies. My legislation represents a middle ground between the \ncurrent flawed system and these aggressive foreign regulatory \nframeworks.\n  In short, the Credit Card Fair Fee Act would address the market power \nimbalance between retailers and credit card companies in setting \ninterchange fee rates. It would create a forum where these fees can be \nfairly negotiated by parties with equal bargaining power. It would \nensure that interchange fees and terms are fair to both banks and \nretailers. And if retailers are able to negotiate interchange rates \nthat reduce the transaction cost of doing business with plastic, it \nwould be beneficial to consumers as well.\n  How do we know that retailers will not just pocket any savings they \nget through any reduction in interchange fees that they are able to \nnegotiate? We know because unlike the credit card interchange rate-\nsetting process, the retail industry is highly competitive, and that \ncompetition is largely based on price.\n  Also, sometimes we hear the banks and card companies argue that if \ninterchange fees are reduced, they will have to raise fees and \npenalties on cardholders to make up for the revenue shortfall. If these \ncompanies stand by this argument, I would expect them to stand by its \nconverse and reduce their cardholder fees and penalties whenever their \ninterchange fee collections increase. However, interchange fee \ncollections have increased 150 percent since 2001, and we have seen no \ncorresponding decrease in fees and penalties imposed upon all \ncardholders. Unless you are one of the small percentage of cardholders \nwith a current balance, no annual fees, and a lavish rewards program, \nyour issuing bank is probably taking two bites at your wallet--one with \ninterchange fees and one with the fees on your statement.\n  The Credit Card Fair Fee Act will protect consumers and retailers by \npreventing credit card companies from using their market power to \ncharge unreasonable fees through an unfair process. This is important \nlegislation, and I urge my colleagues to support its passage.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE:\n  S. 3087. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to make \ncertain improvements in the home loan guaranty programs administered by \nthe Secretary of Veterans Affairs, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that \nwould expand and strengthen the guaranteed home loan program \nadministered by the Department of Veterans' Affairs. This action is \nparticularly timely given the many readjustment challenges faced by our \nveterans and their families in this time of war, challenges that have \nbeen compounded for veterans by the current subprime mortgage market \ncrisis and credit crunch. Mr. President, this legislation is intended \nto be the companion legislation to H.R. 4884, Helping Our Veterans Keep \nTheir Homes Act of 2008, introduced in the House by Chairman Filner of \nthe House Veterans' Affairs Committee.\n  For some time, we have heard from many veterans that the current \nstructure of the VA Home Loan guarantee program has not been responsive \nto the needs of veterans in today's market. For example, the current \nhome loan limit is $417,000. Unfortunately, in many states with the \nlargest population of veterans, reservists, and active duty personnel, \nthe average home price is well above the national average and above the \ncurrent loan ceiling. In contrast, the Federal Housing Authority home \nloan program constrains the loan dollar value by State and county. I \nstrongly believe that veterans and service members should not be \npenalized for geographic differences in the housing market--\nparticularly when, for many, where they live is not of their own \nchoosing but directed by the military organization in which they are \nserving in the defense of the Nation.\n  We have also learned that for veterans and lenders, the VA loan \nprocess can be costly, both with respect to personal finance and time. \nThe fees that are required for participation in the program impose \ncosts on the veteran and family that reduce the financial \nattractiveness of the VA loan. In fact, it has been suggested that \nthose fees, the bureaucratic red-tape, and the loan dollar value \nconstraints that I previously noted, contributed to the conditions that \nresulted in far too many veterans being steered toward subprime loans \nin the first place.\n  Equally disturbing are reports that veterans and reservists did not \nhave access to prime rate loans because of the tumult created in their \nlives due to repeated deployments to Iraq, Afghanistan, or both. \nUnbelievably, despite their wartime service, these patriots were \nassessed to have less than the desired level of personal financial \nstability sought by prime rate lenders and received low credit scores. \nWith access to prime loans limited, subprimes became an option of \nnecessity for many veterans.\n  What has become a point of frustration for veterans now trapped in \nthe mortgage debacle is that the guaranteed home loan program is \nlimited in its ability to provide relief for veterans who have fallen \nvictim to unscrupulous lenders who prey on military families.\n  Given the sacrifices of our veterans and their families, and the \ndisruption\n\n[[Page S5211]]\n\nin their lives created when they patriotically answer their Nation's \ncall to service, we must do better by our veterans by providing a \nreadjustment benefit that reflects the realities of today's housing \nmarket. The legislation that I am introducing today would provide for \nthe following: (1) increase the maximum home loan guarantee amount to \n$729,750; (2) decrease the equity requirement to refinance a home loan; \n(3) require the VA Secretary to review and streamline the process of \nusing a guaranteed home loan to purchase a condominium; (4) eliminate \nthe home loan funding fees; (5) reduce the home loan refinance fees to \none percent; (6) extend the adjustable rate mortgage demonstration \nproject to 2018; (7) extend the hybrid adjustable rate mortgage \ndemonstration project to 2012; (8) raise the maximum loan guarantee for \nrefinancing a home to $729,750; and (9) authorize the VA to offer a 30 \npercent guaranty for loans made on homes determined by VA and HUD to be \naffordable housing.\n  Clearly, this is the right thing to do. I should note that this \nlegislation is supported by the veterans' services organizations, \nincluding the Veterans of Foreign Wars and the American Legion. I \nsincerely hope that my colleagues will join me and offer their support \nfor this important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WYDEN:\n  S. 3088. A bill to designate certain land in the State of Oregon as \nwilderness, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce two bills \nto protect two unique places in the high desert of Central and Eastern \nOregon as wilderness. These areas both reflect the wild, rugged beauty \nthat makes Oregon's terrain east of the Cascade Mountains so \nincomparable.\n  The first bill I am introducing, the Oregon Badlands Wilderness Act \nof 2008, S. 3088, would designate as wilderness almost 30,000 acres of \nthe area known as the Badlands. The Badlands consists of high desert \nthat is located just 15 miles east of Bend, Oregon, and straddles the \nDeschutes-Crook county border. The Badlands is made up of pockets of \nsoft sand, lichen-covered lava flows and 1,000-year-old ancient \njunipers. It is home to pronghorn, deer, and elk.\n  The effort to protect the Badlands was led by a Bend schoolteacher, \nAlice Elshoff, in the 1980s. According to an article about Ms. \nElshoff's efforts, ``Huge chunks of basalt rock jut out of the soft \ndesert sand like blisters that burst from within the earth. Twisted \njuniper trees, some hundreds of years old, seem to desperately cling to \nthe jagged rock formations. And beneath the trees and nearly hidden in \nnarrow hideaways among the rocks are faint red drawings, messages left \nby prehistoric Indians who called this rugged part of the world home. \nThis is the Badlands.''\n  In addition to its natural attributes, many Bend business leaders \nunderstand that an Oregon Badlands Wilderness adds to the area's \nnational reputation as a hub for diverse outdoor recreation. In the \nBend area, people can enjoy almost any outdoor activity--boating, \nbiking, skiing, horseback riding, hunting, riding off-road vehicles and \nhiking. Within roughly an hour's drive of Bend, there are more than \n400,000 acres of public lands available to motorized recreation--and I \nlook forward to continuing to work with the Central Oregon off road and \nsnowmobile communities. The region's diverse recreational options are a \ntrue example of multiple use. Into that mix we now add the peace and \nsolitude of a wilderness recreation experience. These kinds of diverse \nrecreational opportunities and scenic natural areas are part of what \nhas attracted companies and new residents to the Bend area and, with \nthem, booming economic development. According to the 2007 article in \nThe Economist entitled ``Booming Bend,'' ``Fabulous scenery attracts \npeople with fabulous amounts of money.'' To sum it up, people seek \nplaces to live and work with the kind of high quality of life the Bend \narea can offer. The natural beauty and recreational opportunities of an \narea like Bend propel this growth.\n  The Bend community has been talking about protecting the special \nplace known as the Badlands for many years. Volunteers have been \nworking with long-time Oregon ranchers, notably Bev and Ray Clarno, \nwhose family has worked the land for generations, along with \nconservationists, irrigators, and more than 200 local businesses to \ngain protection for the Badlands as wilderness.\n  This designation is also a tribute to a remarkable young woman, \nRachel Scdoris, who grew up driving and training her sled dog team \nthrough this area--and the bill provides that she may continue doing so \nfor as long as she chooses. Ms. Scdoris is legally blind, and she \nrecently completed in her third Iditarod sled dog race.\n  This wilderness designation has been a long time in coming; it has \nbeen over two decades since the BLM began reviewing which lands should \nbe considered candidates for wilderness. From that time forward, BLM \nhas repeatedly concluded that the Badlands should be protected as \nWilderness. It is time to make it happen. This unique part of the \nOregon high desert needs to be permanently protected for generations to \ncome.\n  The second bill I am introducing is the Spring Basin Wilderness Act \nof 2008, S. 3089. This region is further east and even more remote than \nthe Badlands. Spring Basin is one of Central Oregon's premier wild \nareas. Overlooking the John Day Wild and Scenic River, the rolling \nhills of Spring Basin burst with color during the spring wildflower \nbloom. It boasts canyons and diverse geology that offers recreational \nopportunities for hikers, horseback riders, hunters, botanists, and \nother outdoor enthusiasts. The area is important habitat for \npopulations of Mule Deer and Rocky Mountain Elk, as well as many bird \nspecies. To preserve this natural treasure, my bill would designate \napproximately 8,600 acres as the Spring Basin Wilderness.\n  During the past several years, many community leaders and adjacent \nlandowners have approached me advocating for Wilderness designation for \nthis spectacular land that borders the Wild and Scenic John Day River \nand the nearby John Day Fossil Beds. The area is known across Oregon \nfor its profusion of spring wildflowers. The Confederated Tribes of \nWarm Springs, local landowners, the County Commission and the Federal \nBureau of Land Management all support Wilderness designation for Spring \nBasin. In fact, Spring Basin was recommended to Congress as a \nwilderness area by the Bureau of Land Management in 1989. Protecting \nthis scenic jewel will add to Oregon's treasured wilderness and the \nunique recreational opportunities it provides.\n  I want to express my thanks to all the volunteers and supporters who \nhave worked tirelessly to protect this area and reached out to diverse \ncommunity groups to build support. I also want to thank the \nConfederated Tribes of the Warm Springs for their engagement and \nsupport. The Confederated Tribes of the Warm Springs own and manage \napproximately 30,000 acres of adjacent land that they manage to the \nnorth and east of Spring Basin.

A bill to extend and improve the effectiveness of the \nemployment eligibility confirmation program; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today, I am introducing legislation to \nreauthorize and expand the E-verify program, a web based tool run by \nthe Department of Homeland Security for employers across the country. \nKnown as the Basic Pilot Program since its inception in 1996, E-verify \nprovides employers with a process to verify the work eligibility of new \nhires. This program is set to expire in November of this year.\n  The Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 made it unlawful for \nemployers to knowingly hire or employ aliens not eligible to work in \nthe United States and required employers to examine the identity and \nwork eligibility documents of all new employees.\n  Employers are required to participate in a paper-based employment \neligibility verification system, commonly referred to as the I-9 \nsystem, in which they examine documents presented by new hires to \nverify identity and work eligibility, and complete and retain I-9 \nverification forms. Under current law, if the documents provided by an \nemployee reasonably appear on their face to be genuine, the employer \nhas met its document review obligation. However, the easy availability \nof counterfeit documents and fake identifications has made a mockery of \nthe law.\n  In 1996, Congress authorized the Basic Pilot Program to help \nemployers verify the eligibility of their workers. Participants in this \nprogram electronically verify new hires' employment authorization \nthrough the Social Security Administration and, if necessary, the \nDepartment of Homeland Security databases.\n  The Basic Pilot was authorized in 5 States until an expansion of the \nprogram was agreed to by Congress in 2003. Now, all States and all \nemployers can take advantage of this voluntary and free program.\n  The bill I am introducing today isn't broad expansion of the current \nprogram, which I would like to see done. I attempted to revamp E-verify \nin 2006 and 2007 when the Senate debated a comprehensive immigration \nbill. During those debates, I offered amendments to require all \nbusinesses to use E-verify rather than maintaining it as a voluntary \nsystem. Over time, I would like to see this tool as a staple in the \nworkforce. My legislation today doesn't go that far.\n  My amendment in 2006 and 2007 also would have changed the \nverification and appeal procedures, and would have improved the ability \nof the Federal Government to go after employers who knowingly hire \nillegal aliens.\n  While I hope that the Congress can one day address these issues, my \npriority this year is the reauthorization of the E-verify program. We \nmust not let it expire. Employers rely on it, and we must not pull the \nrug from under them in their attempt to abide by the law.\n  My legislation would extend the program indefinitely. There's no \nreason that we should allow this to expire in 1, 5 or 10 years. It \nshould only expire when Congress feels the need to terminate it. Right \nnow, over 61,000 employers use the program. That number is likely to \ngrow, and they need to be able to know that Congress isn't going to let \nthis program die.\n  Another provision in my bill would require all contractors of the \nU.S. Government to use E-verify, even though they have the authority to \ndo so today. Under the original statute in 1996, the Federal \nGovernment--including the Executive and Legislative Branches--must \ncomply with the terms and conditions of E-verify. I added this \nprovision because I don't like the progress I am seeing from the \nadministration to require contractors to use the program.\n  In August of this year, Secretary Chertoff announced a series of \nreforms to address border security and immigration challenges that our \ncountry faces. One of the 26 proposed reforms was to require Federal \ncontractors to use the basic pilot program.\n  Specifically, Secretary Chertoff said that ``the Administration will \ncommence a rulemaking process to require all federal contractors and \nvendors to use E-Verify, the federal electronic employment verification \nsystem, to ensure that their employees are authorized to work in the \nUnited States.'' I firmly believe that the Federal Government ought to \nlead by example, and they shouldn't wait for my bill to become law.\n  My bill would also allow employers to check the status of all \nemployees, not just new hires. Since the system is voluntary, \nbusinesses should be able to use E-verify to check the work eligibility \nof all their employees. They would alert the Department of Homeland \nSecurity of their desire to check all employees and be required to do \nthe checks not later than 10 days after. If an employer wants to make \nsure his or her labor force is lawful, or legally allowed to work in \nthe United States, he or she should be afforded that right. Also, the \nDepartment of Homeland Security should be able to require repeat \noffenders of immigration law to check the status of all employees, not \njust\n\n[[Page S5215]]\n\nnew hires. My legislation would require certain employers to use E-\nverify if the Security has reasonable cause to believe that the \nemployer has engaged in the hiring of undocumented workers. This \nprovision will help us hold employers accountable.\n  My bill would require more information sharing between the agencies \nat the Department of Homeland Security. Citizenship and Immigration \nService, the agency in charge of service and benefits for immigrants, \nruns the program. However, Immigration and Customs Enforcement has the \nduty to enforce immigration laws and conduct worksite enforcement. I \nfear that the two agencies don't communicate enough, especially when it \ncomes to this program. While CIS will provide ICE information about \nemployers who use E-verify upon request, this should be an automatic \nprocess. The enforcement agency is better equipped to go after those \nwho hire illegal aliens, and they should have access to such \ninformation, including those businesses that receive final non-\nconfirmations through the system. My bill would require CIS to report \nmonthly to ICE.\n  Finally, as a Senator from a State with many rural communities, I \nhave heard small businesses say they want a system that works and is \neasy to use. Many towns in Iowa and across the country want to be able \nto use E-verify but may not have access to computers or the Internet. \nThe Citizenship and Immigration Service has made strides to help \nbusinesses learn the system and accommodate their lack of access. As we \ncontinue to ramp up the program and potentially make it a requirement \nfor all employers, I would like to see the Federal Government reach out \nto rural areas and figure out a way to make this work. My bill would \nauthorize the Director of U.S. CIS to establish a demonstration program \nthat assists small businesses in verifying the employment eligibility \nof their newly hired employees.\n  In conclusion, I cannot stress enough the importance of making sure \nE-verify remains intact and operating for employers across the country. \nWe need to reauthorize the program this year so that businesses can \ncontinue to abide by our immigration laws. I urge my colleagues to join \nme in this effort.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BAUCUS:\n  S. 3095. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nexpand the Medicare Rural Hospital Flexibility Program to increase the \ndelivery of mental health services and other health services to \nveterans of Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom and \nto other residents of rural areas, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, an Iraq veteran named Travis Williams told \nhis story at a field hearing in Great Falls, Montana last summer. After \ngraduating from Capitol High School in Helena in 2002, Travis quickly \njoined the Marine Corps. Travis was deployed to Iraq in 2005. He served \nin Al Anbar province.\n  Like thousands of other American men and women in uniform, Travis \nserved nobly and with honor under the most difficult of circumstances. \nHe experienced the horrors of combat. He lost numerous friends. And he \nsaw unspeakable violence.\n  Travis testified that after months of combat, his emotions seemed to \ndull or shutdown. As he later learned, he was experiencing a normal \nreaction to a highly abnormal situation. His reaction was a defense \nmechanism that allowed him to continue to operate in a combat zone. His \nmind was finding a way to keep going. Thousands of marines, soldiers, \nairmen and seamen have experienced this phenomenon.\n  Travis testified that when he arrived home it seemed ``surreal.'' He \nfelt more out of place in his own home than he did in Iraq. Travis \nisolated himself from his friends. He was frequently drunk and angry. \nLooking back, he understands that he was on what he called the ``path \nto destruction.''\n  One day, Travis received a phone call from Deb McBee. Deb is a \nveteran's service officer from the Military Order of the Purple Heart. \nDeb had heard about Travis' experiences in combat. She recommended that \nhe visit the VA clinic to seek help. Travis took her advice. The VA \nreferred Travis to a veteran's liaison for the Western Montana Mental \nHealth Clinic.\n  Travis connected immediately with his mental health counselor. The \ncounselor was also a veteran who understood the nightmare of combat and \nthe loneliness of coming home. Over time, the counselor helped Travis \nto get back on track. Before long, Travis was enrolled in a pre-med \nprogram and had overcome many of the feelings of anger and loss he had \nfelt before.\n  I begin with Travis' story because it offers hope. But it offers hope \namid a very dark picture facing our veterans. A recent study by the \nRAND Corporation revealed that American veterans are facing a crisis of \nepic proportions. RAND estimates that around 300,000 service members \nsuffer from post-traumatic stress disorder--also known as PTSD--or \nmajor depression. And 320,000 individuals reported experiencing \nprobable traumatic brain injury during deployment.\n  The RAND study found that only 53 percent of service members with \npost-traumatic stress disorder or depression have seen a doctor or \nmental health provider in the past year. Of those who had a mental \ndisorder and sought care, about half received only ``minimally \nadequate'' treatment.\n  Tragically, on any single day, on average, 18 veterans commit \nsuicide. More than one out of five of those vets were patients \nundergoing treatment by the VA. Think of it: Today, 18 veterans are \nliable to commit suicide.\n  The VA has responded to this crisis with numerous initiatives that \noffer hope to thousands of veterans. This year, the VA will spend more \nthan $3.5 billion for mental health services. Some of these funds will \nbe invested in a new mental health inpatient ward in Helena, Montana. \nOver the last several years, the VA has opened up hundreds of new rural \nhealth clinics. Today, there are more than 700 of these clinics \nproviding health care to our Nation's veterans. Montana has recently \nreceived two new rural health clinics in Lewistown and Cut Bank. The VA \nis making great strides.\n  But we need to do more. Thousands of veterans still remain out of \nreach.\n  The VA has undertaken an aggressive campaign to make mental health \ncare services available to veterans living in rural areas. But \nthousands of Americans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan live \nhundreds of miles away from the health care that they need.\n  The Veteran's Affairs Office of Policy Analysis and Forecasting \ncounts 118,685 registered highly-rural veterans in America. Of these, \nonly 39,158 live within 2 hours of a VA medical center. Thousands of \nveterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan often have to choose \nbetween a day-long trip to the VA or no care at all. In my home state \nof Montana 32,404 rural veterans are enrolled in the VA healthcare \nsystem. Over 10,000 of those veterans must drive more than an hour and \na half to reach a VA hospital. And thousands of those veterans must \ndrive over two hours both ways. In times of crisis, two hours is much \ntoo far to drive.\n  Research conducted by the Department of Veterans Affairs shows that \nveterans residing in rural areas are in poorer health than their urban \ncounterparts. Nationwide, one out of every five veterans enrolled in VA \nhealth care lives in a rural area. Providing quality health care in a \nrural setting has proved to be a daunting challenge. Limited numbers of \ndoctors and long highways make inadequate access to care all too \ncommon.\n  But let me return to Travis Williams' story. The key lesson of \nTravis' story is that getting the right care to veterans is all about \nteamwork. It wasn't just the VA that saved Travis. It wasn't just \nprofessional mental health counselors alone. It wasn't just veterans' \nservice organizations. Travis' willpower alone was not sufficient to \nget him through the hard times. It was all of those things. All of \nthose factors working together helped Travis to get away from a life of \nanger and despair, and back to a life full of meaning and purpose.\n  Teamwork is what the Relief for Rural Veterans Act is all about. The \nbill would enable small rural hospitals, mental health service \nproviders, and other rural providers to work together to respond to the \nneeds of veterans in crisis. States could apply for funding to increase \ntheir capacity to deliver mental health services by using state-of-the-\nart technology such as tele-health and tele-psychiatry.\n\n[[Page S5216]]\n\n  More specifically, my bill will give the Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services authority to award grants under the Medicare Rural \nHospital Flexibility Program. The Medicare Flex Program has a \nsuccessful 10-year history of strengthening the rural healthcare \ninfrastructure. Under this new authority, States can apply for grants \nto increase the capacity of rural providers to provide mental health \nservices to veterans and other rural residents. The bill would \nauthorize an additional $100 million for this new authority for 2 \nyears.\n  The Medicare Flex Program is a good way to improve health care \nservices in rural America. It has provided grants to States to develop \nState rural health care plans. It supports conversion of eligible small \nrural hospital facilities to critical access status. It supports rural \nemergency medical services. And it fosters rural health care network \ndevelopment. It makes sense to expand this program to include mental \nhealth services needed by veterans in crisis.\n  Research conducted by the University of Maine found that small rural \nhospitals are playing a major role in providing emergency health care \nservices to veterans. They are filling a critical gap in caring for \nveterans in crisis.\n  But the Federal Government has not thus far provided funds to help \nrural hospitals to perform this task. The grants authorized in my bill \ncould support crisis intervention services and other health care \nservices needed by Iraq and Afghanistan veterans. My bill will focus \nupon those veterans who live far from VA facilities. It could provide \nrelief for veterans who have to drive hours to receive emergency mental \nhealth care.\n  An additional benefit of these grants is that all rural residents, \nregardless of whether they are veterans or not, would be able to take \nadvantage of the increased capacity of their small rural hospitals to \ndeliver improved healthcare services.\n  Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America and the National Alliance on \nMental Health Care have endorsed this bill.\n  The RAND study I mentioned earlier concluded that we need a major \nnational effort to improve the capacity of the mental health system to \ncare for veterans. The report stated that the effort must include the \nmilitary, veterans, and civilian healthcare systems.\n  This bill is one answer to that call. This bill is a way to approach \nthe problems facing our veterans from a new perspective. The philosophy \nbehind the bill is that all agencies that can lend a hand to our \nveterans should do so. The challenges facing our Nation's veterans are \ntoo large for the VA to handle on its own.\n  Researchers estimate that PTSD and depression among returning service \nmembers will cost the Nation as much as $6.2 billion in the 2 years \nfollowing deployment. That's an amount that includes both direct \nmedical care and costs for lost productivity and suicide. Investing in \nmore high-quality treatment could save close to $2 billion within 2 \nyears by substantially reducing those indirect costs.\n  Last month, Chairman Bob Filner said this about the crisis facing our \nveterans: This is not a crisis that only concerns numbers. This is a \nmatter of life and death for the veterans for whom we are responsible.\n  I urge the VA to continue its efforts to extend its reach into rural \nareas. I applaud the nation's thousands of volunteers who serve our \nNations' veterans. And I offer this legislation as one way to begin a \nnew approach to help those who have sacrificed so much in the name of \nduty, honor, and country.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3095\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce with \nSenator Levin a resolution recognizing the historical significance of \nJuneteenth Independence. Day.\n  Two years after President Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation and \nmonths after the end of the Civil War, many African-Americans were \nstill being denied the freedom that had been won. Juneteenth \ncommemorates June 19, 1865, the day Union soldiers arrived in \nGalveston, Texas, to announce that the Civil War had ended and ensure \nthat the slaves were free. African-Americans who had been enslaved \nbegan celebrating June 19 the following year as the anniversary of \ntheir emancipation, the day their dreams of freedom became reality.\n  As Americans, we can't afford to forget the lessons learned from \nslavery and that terrible stain on our nation's history. Juneteenth \nreminds us to stay vigilant in our efforts to secure equal opportunity \nfor all Americans to keep working for justice. Justice is true freedom \nand equality for all citizens, regardless of race, religion, or ethnic \nbackground.\n  I thank Senators Obama, Reid, Stabenow, and Brownback for joining \nSenator Levin and me in recognizing historic Juneteenth Independence \nDay. I encourage my colleagues to support this important resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/05/senate-section/article/S5217-2", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5217]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      SENATE RESOLUTION 585--SUPPORTING NATIONAL MEN'S HEALTH WEEK\n\n  Mr. CRAPO (for himself, Mr. Menendez, Mr. Shelby, Mrs. Dole, and Mr. \nHatch) submitted the following resolution, which was referred to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions:\n\n                              S. Res. 585\n\n       Whereas, despite advances in medical technology and \n     research, men continue to live an average of more than 5 \n     years less than women, and African-American men have the \n     lowest life expectancy;\n       Whereas 9 of the 10 leading causes of death, as defined by \n     the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, affect men at \n     a higher percentage than women;\n       Whereas, between ages 45 and 54, men are 3 times more \n     likely than women to die of heart attacks;\n       Whereas men die of heart disease at 1\\1/2\\ times the rate \n     of women;\n       Whereas men die of cancer at almost 1\\1/2\\ times the rate \n     of women;\n       Whereas testicular cancer is one of the most common cancers \n     in men aged 15 to 34, and, when detected early, has a 96 \n     percent survival rate;\n       Whereas the number of cases of colon cancer among men will \n     reach almost 54,000 in 2008, and almost \\1/2\\ will die from \n     the disease;\n       Whereas the likelihood that a man will develop prostate \n     cancer is 1 in 6;\n       Whereas the number of men developing prostate cancer will \n     reach over 186,320 in 2008, and an estimated 28,660 will die \n     from the disease;\n       Whereas African-American men in the United States have the \n     highest incidence in the world of prostate cancer;\n       Whereas significant numbers of health problems that affect \n     men, such as prostate cancer, testicular cancer, colon \n     cancer, and infertility, could be detected and treated if \n     men's awareness of these problems was more pervasive;\n       Whereas more than \\1/2\\ of the elderly widows now living in \n     poverty were not poor before the death of their husbands, and \n     by age 100 women outnumber men 8 to 1;\n       Whereas educating both the public and health care providers \n     about the importance of early detection of male health \n     problems will result in reducing rates of mortality for these \n     diseases;\n       Whereas appropriate use of tests such as prostate specific \n     antigen (PSA) exams, blood pressure screens, and cholesterol \n     screens, in conjunction with clinical examination and self-\n     testing for problems such as testicular cancer, can result in \n     the detection of many of these problems in their early stages \n     and increase the survival rates to nearly 100 percent;\n       Whereas women are 100 percent more likely to visit the \n     doctor for annual examinations and preventive services than \n     men;\n       Whereas men are less likely than women to visit their \n     health center or physician for regular screening examinations \n     of male-related problems for a variety of reasons, including \n     fear, lack of health insurance, lack of information, and cost \n     factors;\n       Whereas National Men's Health Week was established by \n     Congress in 1994 and urged men and their families to engage \n     in appropriate health behaviors, and the resulting increased \n     awareness has improved health-related education and helped \n     prevent illness;\n       Whereas the Governors of over 45 States issue proclamations \n     annually declaring Men's Health Week in their States;\n       Whereas, since 1994, National Men's Health Week has been \n     celebrated each June by dozens of States, cities, localities, \n     public health departments, health care entities, churches, \n     and community organizations throughout the Nation, that \n     promote health awareness events focused on men and family;\n       Whereas the National Men's Health Week Internet website has \n     been established at www.menshealthweek.org and features \n     Governors' proclamations and National Men's Health Week \n     events;\n       Whereas men who are educated about the value that \n     preventive health can play in prolonging their lifespan and \n     their role as productive family members will be more likely \n     to participate in health screenings;\n       Whereas men and their families are encouraged to increase \n     their awareness of the importance of a healthy lifestyle, \n     regular exercise, and medical checkups;

Res. 587\n\n       Whereas public prayer and national days of prayer are a \n     long-standing American tradition to bolster national resolve \n     and summon the national will for victory;\n       Whereas the Continental Congress asked the colonies to pray \n     for wisdom in forming a nation in 1775;\n       Whereas Benjamin Franklin proposed that the Constitutional \n     Convention begin each day with a prayer;\n       Whereas General George Washington, as he prepared his \n     troops for battle with the British in May 1776, ordered them \n     to pray for the campaign ahead, that it would please the \n     Almighty to ``prosper the arms of the united colonies'' and \n     ``establish the peace and freedom of America upon a solid and \n     lasting foundation'';\n       Whereas President Abraham Lincoln, in declaring in the \n     Gettysburg Address that ``this nation, under God, shall have \n     a new birth of freedom'', rededicated the Nation to ensuring \n     that ``government of the people, by the people, for the \n     people, shall not perish from the earth'';\n       Whereas, as 73,000 Americans stormed the beaches at \n     Normandy, France, on June 6, 1944 (D-Day), President Franklin \n     Delano Roosevelt went on the national radio to lead the \n     Nation in prayer for their success;\n       Whereas, in his D-Day radio prayer, President Roosevelt did \n     not declare a single day of special prayer, but instead \n     compelled all Americans to ``devote themselves in a \n     continuance of prayer'';\n       Whereas the words of President Roosevelt calling on all \n     Americans to ``devote themselves in a continuance of prayer'' \n     for American soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines in harm's \n     way are just as appropriate today as they were in June 1944;\n       Whereas, with our troops once again facing danger abroad \n     and the Nation looking for support here at home, the time is \n     ripe to once again heed the words and prayerful wisdom \n     contained in the D-Day radio address of the 20th century's \n     greatest Democrat president as he implored the Nation: ``as \n     we rise to each new day, and again when each day is spent, \n     let words of prayer be on our lips, invoking Thy help to our \n     efforts'';\n       Whereas more than 300,000 men and women of the United \n     States Armed Forces are deployed worldwide today;\n       Whereas about 200,000 of these troops are engaged in armed \n     combat in Iraq and Afghanistan against determined and \n     ruthless enemies;\n       Whereas more than 4,500 brave Americans have been killed, \n     and over 42,000 have been wounded, while fighting the War on \n     Terror;\n       Whereas, because the War on Terror will be long and hard, \n     because success is not likely to come with rushing speed, and \n     because the sacrifice will continue to be immeasurable in \n     human terms, it is appropriate to make the anniversary of D-\n     Day, June 6, a national day of prayer and rededication for \n     the men and women of the United States Armed Forces and their \n     mission; and\n       Whereas the D-Day radio address of President Roosevelt is \n     the inspiration and model for this annual national day of \n     prayer and rededication: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That--\n       (1) June 6, 2008, will be a national day of prayer and \n     rededication for the men and women of the United States Armed \n     Forces and their mission; and\n       (2) in encouraging our fellow Americans to join us in this \n     national day of prayer and rededication for our troops and \n     their mission, by reflecting on President Roosevelt's D-Day \n     radio prayer, as follows:\n     ``My Fellow Americans:\n\n       Last night, when I spoke with you about the fall of Rome, I \n     knew at that moment that troops of the United States and our \n     Allies were crossing the Channel in another and greater \n     operation. It has come to pass with success thus far.\n       And so, in this poignant hour, I ask you to join with me in \n     prayer:\n       Almighty God: Our sons, pride of our nation, this day have \n     set upon a mighty endeavor, a struggle to preserve our \n     Republic, our religion, and our civilization, and to set free \n     a suffering humanity.\n       Lead them straight and true; give strength to their arms, \n     stoutness to their hearts, steadfastness in their faith.\n       They will need Thy blessings. Their road will be long and \n     hard. For the enemy is strong. He may hurl back our forces. \n     Success may not come with rushing speed, but we shall return \n     again and again; and we know that by Thy grace, and by the \n     righteousness of our cause, our sons will triumph.\n       They will be sore tried, by night and by day, without rest \n     -- until the victory is won. The darkness will be rent by \n     noise and flame. Men's souls will be shaken with the \n     violences of war.\n       For these men are lately drawn from the ways of peace. They \n     fight not for the lust of conquest. They fight to end \n     conquest. They fight to liberate. They fight to let justice \n     arise, and tolerance and goodwill among all Thy people. They \n     yearn but for the end of battle, for their return to the \n     haven of home.\n       Some will never return. Embrace these, Father, and receive \n     them, Thy heroic servants, into Thy kingdom.\n       And for us at home--fathers, mothers, children, wives, \n     sisters, and brothers of brave men overseas, whose thoughts \n     and prayers are ever with them -- help us, Almighty God, to \n     rededicate ourselves in renewed faith in Thee in this hour of \n     great sacrifice.\n       Many people have urged that I call the nation into a single \n     day of special prayer. But because the road is long and the \n     desire is great, I ask that our people devote themselves in a \n     continuance of prayer. As we rise to each new day, and again \n     when each day is spent, let words of prayer be on our lips, \n     invoking Thy help to our efforts.\n       Give us strength, too--strength in our daily tasks, to \n     redouble the contributions we make in the physical and the \n     material support of our armed forces.\n       And let our hearts be stout, to wait out the long travail, \n     to bear sorrows that may come, to impart our courage unto our \n     sons wheresoever they may be.\n       And, O Lord, give us faith. Give us faith in Thee; faith in \n     our sons; faith in each other; faith in our united crusade. \n     Let not the keenness of our spirit ever be dulled. Let not \n     the impacts of temporary events, of temporal matters of but \n     fleeting moment--let not these deter us in our unconquerable \n     purpose.\n       With Thy blessing, we shall prevail over the unholy forces \n     of our enemy. Help us to conquer the apostles of greed and \n     racial arrogances. Lead us to the saving of our country, and \n     with our sister nations into a world unity that will spell a \n     sure peace--a peace invulnerable to the schemings of unworthy \n     men. And a peace that will let all of men live in freedom, \n     reaping the just rewards of their honest toil.\n       Thy will be done, Almighty God.\n       Amen.''.\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I rise to speak on a resolution I have \nsubmitted today that declares June 6 a national day of prayer and \nrededication for the men and women of the U. S. Armed Forces and their \nmission.\n  As my colleagues know, when 73,000 Americans stormed the beaches at \nNormandy, France, on June 6, 1944, President Franklin Roosevelt went on \nnational radio to lead the Nation in prayer for their success.\n  With over 300,000 men and women of the U.S. Armed Forces deployed \nworldwide today, and many of these troops directly engaged in armed \ncombat in Iraq and Afghanistan against determined and ruthless enemies, \nPresident Roosevelt's words calling on all Americans to ``devote \nthemselves to a continuance of prayer'' for American soldiers, sailors, \nairmen, and marines in harm's way are as appropriate today as they were \nin June of 1944.\n  It is appropriate to make every anniversary of D-day, June 6, a \nnational day of prayer for the men and women of the U.S. Armed Forces.\n  Now I will read President Roosevelt's D-day radio prayer:\n\n       My Fellow Americans:\n       Last night, when I spoke with you about the fall of Rome, I \n     knew at that moment that troops of the United States and our \n     Allies were crossing the Channel in another and greater \n     operation. It has come to pass with success thus far.\n       And so, in this poignant hour, I ask you to join with me in \n     prayer:\n       Almighty God: Our sons, pride of our nation, this day have \n     set upon a mighty endeavor, a struggle to preserve our \n     Republic, our religion, and our civilization, and to set free \n     a suffering humanity.\n       Lead them straight and true; give strength to their arms, \n     stoutness to their hearts, steadfastness in their faith.\n\n[[Page S5219]]\n\n       They will need Thy blessings. Their road will be long and \n     hard. For the enemy is strong. He may hurl back our forces. \n     Success may not come with rushing speed, but we shall return \n     again and again; and we know that by Thy grace, and by the \n     righteousness of our cause, our sons will triumph.\n       They will be sore tried, by night and by day, without \n     rest--until the victory is won. The darkness will be rent by \n     noise and flame. Men's souls will be shaken with the \n     violences of war.\n       For these men are lately drawn from the ways of peace. They \n     fight not for the lust of conquest. They fight to end \n     conquest. They fight to liberate. They fight to let justice \n     arise, and tolerance and goodwill among all Thy people. They \n     yearn but for the end of battle, for their return to the \n     haven of home.\n       Some will never return. Embrace these, Father, and receive \n     them, Thy heroic servants, into Thy kingdom.\n       And for us at home-- fathers, mothers, children, wives, \n     sisters, and brothers of brave men overseas, whose thoughts \n     and prayers are ever with them--help us, Almighty God, to \n     rededicate ourselves in renewed faith in Thee in this hour of \n     great sacrifice.\n       Many people have urged that I call the nation into a single \n     day of special prayer. But because the road is long and the \n     desire is great, I ask that our people devote themselves in a \n     continuance of prayer. As we rise to each new day, and again \n     when each day is spent, let words of prayer be on our lips, \n     invoking Thy help to our efforts.\n       Give us strength, too--strength in our daily tasks, to \n     redouble the contributions we make in the physical and the \n     material support of our armed forces.\n       And let our hearts be stout, to wait out the long travail, \n     to bear sorrows that may come, to impart our courage unto our \n     sons wheresoever they may be.\n       And, O Lord, give us faith. Give us faith in Thee; faith in \n     our sons; faith in each other; faith in our united crusade. \n     Let not the keenness of our spirit ever be dulled. Let not \n     the impacts of temporary events, of temporal matters of but \n     fleeting moment--let not these deter us in our unconquerable \n     purpose.\n       With Thy blessing, we shall prevail over the unholy forces \n     of our enemy. Help us to conquer the apostles of greed and \n     racial arrogances. Lead us to the saving of our country, and \n     with our sister nations into a world unity that will spell a \n     sure peace--a peace invulnerable to the schemings of unworthy \n     men. And a peace that will let all of men live in freedom, \n     reaping the just rewards of their honest toil.\n       Thy will be done, Almighty God.\n       Amen.\n\n  Mr. President, I hope the Senate will take up this resolution and \nmake June 6 a national day of prayer for our Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/05/senate-section/article/S5219-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5219-S5221]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 4863.

FINDINGS; SENSE OF SENATE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) more than 40 years of experience in the United States \n     relating to commercial nuclear power plants have demonstrated \n     that nuclear reactors can be operated safely;\n       (2) in 2007, nuclear power plants produced 19 percent of \n     the electricity generated in the United States;\n       (3) nuclear power plants are the only baseload source of \n     emission-free electric generation, emitting no greenhouse \n     gases or criteria pollutants associated with acid rain, smog, \n     or ozone;\n       (4) in 2007, nuclear power plants in the United States--\n       (A) avoided more than 692,000,000 metric tons of carbon \n     dioxide emissions; and\n       (B) accounted for more than 73 percent of emission-free \n     electric generation in the United States;\n       (5) a lifecycle emissions analysis by the International \n     Energy Agency determined that nuclear power plants emit fewer \n     greenhouse gases than wind energy, solar energy, and biomass \n     on a per kilowatt-hour basis;\n       (6) construction of a new nuclear power plant is estimated \n     to require between 1,400 and 1,800 jobs during a 4-year \n     period, with peak employment reaching as many as 2,400 \n     workers;\n       (7)(A) once operational, a new nuclear power plant is \n     estimated to provide 400 to 600 full-time jobs for up to 60 \n     years; and\n       (B) jobs at nuclear power plants pay, on average, 40 \n     percent more than other jobs in surrounding communities;\n       (8) revitalization of a domestic manufacturing industry to \n     provide nuclear components for new power plants that can be \n     deployed in the United States and exported for use in global \n     carbon reduction programs will provide thousands of new, \n     high-paying jobs and contribute to economic growth in the \n     United States;\n       (9) data of the Bureau of Labor Statistics demonstrate that \n     it is safer to work in a nuclear power plant than to work in \n     the real estate or financial sectors;\n       (10) while aggressive energy efficiency measures and an \n     increased deployment of renewable generation can and should \n     be taken,\n\n[[Page S5246]]\n\n     the United States will be unable to meet climate reduction \n     goals without the construction of new nuclear power plants;\n       (11) modeling conducted by the Environmental Protection \n     Agency and the Energy Information Administration demonstrate \n     that emission reductions are greater, and compliance costs \n     are lower, if nuclear power plants are used to provide a \n     greater percentage of electricity;\n       (12) the United States has been a world leader in nuclear \n     science; and\n       (13) institutions of higher education in the United States \n     will play a critical role in advancing knowledge about the \n     use and the safety of nuclear energy for the production of \n     electricity.\n       (b) Sense of Senate Regarding Use of Funds.--It is the \n     Sense of the Senate that Congress should stimulate private \n     sector investment in the manufacturing of nuclear project \n     components in the United States, including through the \n     financial incentives program established under this subtitle.\n\n     SEC. 902.

SHORT TITLE; AMENDMENT OF 1986 CODE.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This title may be cited as the ``Paul \n     Coverdell Homestead Open Space Preservation and Conservation \n     Act of 2008''.\n       (b) Amendment of 1986 Code.--Except as otherwise expressly \n     provided, whenever in this title an amendment or repeal is \n     expressed in terms of an amendment to, or repeal of, a \n     section or other provision, the reference shall be considered \n     to be made to a section or other provision of the Internal \n     Revenue Code of 1986.\n\n     SEC. __2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Tax and economic policies have for a sustained period \n     of time inadvertently created financial difficulties for our \n     Nation's farming and ranching families that, among other \n     negative impacts, has forced a significant number of them to \n     liquidate their land holdings.\n       (2) This has particularly been the case in areas \n     surrounding growing urban centers and resort destinations.\n       (3) This has fragmented many of our Nation's large \n     landscapes and disrupted many communities that historically \n     derived their cultural and economic identities from the land.\n       (4) The impact of this has been to deprive many areas of \n     open green space, which in turn has not only negatively \n     affected our human settlements through the resulting sprawl, \n     but has also dramatically reduced the amount of sustaining \n     habitat for our natural communities of plants and animals.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this title is to provide an \n     economic mechanism that will restore and conserve our \n     Nation's natural estate in the form of forests, farms, \n     ranches, and wetlands while protecting our waterways and our \n     forests and open space in a manner that keeps them subject to \n     private ownership and supportive of our surviving but \n     threatened natural communities of plants and animals.\n\n     SEC. __3.

``(A) In general.--The aggregate conservation credit dollar \n     amount which a conservation credit agency may allocate for \n     any calendar year is the portion of the State conservation \n

Bush, from $30.63 in January 2001 \n     to as high as $135 in May 2008;\n       (3) the average household with children will spend \n     approximately $5,030 on transportation fuel costs in 2008, an \n     increase of 164 percent or $3,127 more than 2001 \n     transportation fuel costs;\n       (4) while the price of gasoline has continued to skyrocket, \n     median household income, adjusted for inflation, has declined \n     by $982 from $50,566 in 2000 to $49,584 in 2006, making it \n     harder for families of the United States to afford the basic \n     necessities of life;\n       (5) while the price of gasoline has continued to skyrocket, \n     36,500,000 citizens of the United States lived in poverty \n     during 2006, an increase of 4,900,000 above the 2000 level, \n     the year before President Bush took office;\n       (6) 63 percent of respondents of a March 2008 Gallup Poll \n     stated that high gasoline prices have caused hardships for \n     the respondents;\n       (7) according to a Gallup Poll carried out on June 3, 2008, \n     55 percent of the citizens of the United States stated that \n     they are worse off financially than the prior year, marking \n     the first time in the 32-year history of the Gallop Poll that \n     more than 50 percent of the respondents of that question \n     provided a negative assessment;\n       (8) while the citizens of the United States continue to pay \n     record-breaking prices at the gas pump, the chief executive \n     officers of big oil companies have been rewarded with \n     excessive retirement and annual compensation packages;\n       (9) in 2005, Lee Raymond, the former chief executive \n     officer of Exxon-Mobil, received a total retirement package \n     of at least $398,000,000, among the richest compensation \n     packages in United States corporate history;\n       (10) in 2006, Ray Irani, the chief executive officer of \n     Occidental Petroleum (the largest oil producer in the State \n     of Texas), received over $400,000,000 in total compensation, \n     1 of the largest single-year payouts in United States \n     corporate history;\n       (11) in 2007, David J.

FINDINGS; PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) changes in land use patterns and forest sector \n     emissions account for approximately 20 percent of global \n     greenhouse gas emissions;\n       (2) land conversion and deforestation are 2 of the largest \n     sources of greenhouse gas emissions in the developing world, \n     comprising approximately 40 percent of the total greenhouse \n     gas emissions of the developing world;\n       (3) with sufficient data, deforestation and forest \n     degradation rates and forest carbon stocks can be measured \n     with an acceptable degree of uncertainty;\n       (4) encouraging reduced deforestation and reduced forest \n     degradation in foreign countries could--\n       (A) provide critical leverage to encourage voluntary \n     participation by developing countries in emission limitation \n     regimes;\n       (B) facilitate greater overall reductions in greenhouse gas \n     emissions than otherwise would be practicable; and\n       (C) substantially benefit biodiversity, conservation, and \n     indigenous and other forest-dependent people in developing \n     countries;\n       (5) in addition to forest carbon activities that can be \n     readily measured, monitored, and verified through national-\n     scale programs and projects, there is great value in reducing \n     emissions and sequestering carbon through forest carbon \n     projects in countries that lack the institutional \n     arrangements to support national-scale accounting of forest \n     carbon stocks; and\n       (6) providing emission allowances in support of activities \n     in countries that lack fully developed institutions for \n     national-scale accounting could help to build capacity in \n     those countries, sequester additional carbon, and increase \n     participation by developing countries in international \n     climate agreements.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this subtitle is to reduce \n     greenhouse gas emissions by reducing deforestation and forest \n     degradation in foreign countries in a manner that reduces the \n     costs imposed by this Act on covered entities in the United \n     States.\n\n     SEC. 1312. INTERNATIONAL FOREST CARBON ACTIVITIES PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Establishment.--Not later than 2 years after the date \n     of enactment of this Act, the Administrator, in consultation \n     with the Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of State, \n     and the Secretary of Agriculture, shall promulgate \n     regulations to establish programs or recognize existing \n     programs under which the Administrator shall provide emission \n     allowances allocated pursuant to subsections (b) and (c) to \n     assist developing countries in the efforts of the developing \n     countries to achieve emissions reductions or increased \n     sequestration of carbon dioxide from international forest \n     carbon activities.\n       (b) Allocation.--Not later than 330 days before January 1 \n     of each of calendar years 2012 through 2050, the \n     Administrator shall allocate for distribution under this \n     section 1 percent of the aggregate quantity of emission \n     allowances established for the applicable calendar year \n     pursuant to section 201(a).\n       (c) Early Action.--Not later than 2 years after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Administrator shall allocate for \n     early action distribution for each of calendar years 2010 and \n     2011 not more than 10 percent of the aggregate quantity of \n     emission allowances allocated under subsection (b) for each \n     of calendar years 2012 through 2022.\n       (d) Carryover.--If the sum of the emission allowances for a \n     calendar year is not allocated for distribution in the \n     calendar year, the Administrator shall carry over to the next \n     calendar year the residual emission allowances.\n       (e) Ensuring Market Readiness in Developing Countries.--\n       (1) In general.--The Administrator shall--\n       (A) set aside a portion of the allowances to be allocated \n     under subsections (b) and (c) for the purpose of ensuring \n     market readiness in forested developing countries; and\n       (B) auction those allowances with the proceeds deposited \n     into a market readiness account.\n       (2) Eligibility for proceeds.--The regulations promulgated \n     pursuant to subsection (a) shall delineate the requirements \n     for developing countries to be eligible to receive proceeds \n     from the auction of emission allowances under paragraph (1) \n     to be used for the preparation of a national reduced \n     deforestation and forest degradation strategy (referred to in \n     this section as a ``REDD strategy''), including--\n       (A) developing a reliable estimate of the national forest \n     carbon stocks and sources of forest emissions of the \n     developing country;\n       (B) defining the national emission reference baseline for \n     the developing country based on past emission rates;\n       (C) specifying options for reducing emissions; and\n       (D) implementing mechanisms that will support policies, \n     programs, and projects to reduce emissions.\n       (f) Incentive Payments for Low-Cost Emission Reductions.--\n       (1) In general.--Subject to paragraph (2), the regulations \n     promulgated pursuant to subsection (a) shall delineate the \n     requirements for forested developing countries or other \n     entities to be eligible to receive emission allowances under \n     subsections (b) and (c) to implement the national REDD \n     strategy of the countries or to implement low-cost emission \n     reduction projects in the forest sector.\n       (2) Requirements.--Under the regulations promulgated under \n     paragraph (1)--\n       (A) emission allowances under this section shall be awarded \n     in a manner that favors--\n       (i) achievement of the greatest quantity of carbon \n     sequestration or emission reductions for the lowest cost; and\n       (ii) broad geographical distribution of projects;\n       (B) no allowances for emission reduction under this section \n     shall be awarded to countries, or entities for projects in \n     countries, that meets the criteria established under section \n     1313(c)(1)(A), as determined by the Administrator, after the \n     2-year period beginning on the date the Administrator \n     determines that those criteria apply;\n       (C) no allowances shall be issued in a calendar year \n     beginning more than 5 years after the date of enactment of \n     this Act to a project or activity in a country that generates \n     greenhouse gas emissions accounting for more than 1 percent \n     of global greenhouse gas emissions;\n       (D) no allowances shall be issued in a calendar year \n     beginning more than 10 years after the date of enactment of \n     this Act to a project or activity in a country that generates \n     greenhouse gas emissions accounting for more than 0.5 percent \n     of global greenhouse gas emissions; and\n       (E) unless the Administrator determines that provision of \n     allowances to a project or activity in a country that would \n     otherwise be subject to the exclusions in subparagraph (C) or \n     (D) is in the interest of building needed capacity or \n     reducing international leakage, allowances may be issued to \n     the project or activity subject to other criteria in this \n     subsection.\n       (g) Eligibility Requirements.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than 2 years after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Administrator, in consultation \n     with the Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of State, \n     and the Secretary of Agriculture, shall promulgate \n     regulations establishing eligibility requirements for the \n     allocation of emission allowances under this subsection for \n     international forest carbon activities, including \n     requirements that those activities shall be designed, carried \n     out, and managed--\n       (A) in accordance with widely-accepted environmentally \n     sustainable forestry practices;\n       (B) to promote native species and restoration of native \n     forests, if practicable, and to avoid the introduction of \n     invasive nonnative species;\n       (C) in a manner that is supportive of the internationally-\n     recognized rights of indigenous and other forest-dependent \n     people living in the affected areas; and\n       (D) in a manner that enhances the capability, if consistent \n     with the applicable laws in the country involved, of local \n     communities to exercise the right of free, prior informed \n     consent regarding projects or other activities.\n       (2) Quality criteria for international forest carbon \n     allocations.--The regulations promulgated pursuant to \n     paragraph (1) shall include requirements intended to ensure \n     that the international forest carbon activity for which \n     emission allowances are provided under this section results \n     in real, permanent, additional, verifiable, and enforceable \n     emission reductions, with reliable measuring and monitoring \n     and appropriate accounting for leakage.\n       (h) Peatland and Other Natural Land That Sequester \n     Carbon.--The Administrator may provide emission allowances \n     under this section for a project for storage of carbon in \n     peatland or other natural land if the Administrator \n     determines that--\n       (1) the peatland or other natural land is capable of \n     storing carbon;

SENSE OF SENATE ON ASSISTING CONSUMERS WITH \n                   GASOLINE AND DIESEL PRICES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) consumers are paying more than $2.50 more for a gallon \n     of gasoline or diesel than they paid just 7 years ago, in \n     January 2001, when gas averaged $1.37 per gallon and diesel \n     averaged $1.52 per gallon;\n       (2) the 5 large integrated oil companies alone tripled \n     their profits during the period of 2001 through 2007, when \n     the profit of those companies increased from $39,000,000,000 \n     to $116,000,000,000;\n       (3) tax breaks for major integrated oil companies are worth \n     billions of dollars each year;\n       (4) high energy prices are harming households, the economy, \n     and the competitiveness of the United States;\n       (5) as of the date of enactment of this Act, millions of \n     onshore acres are under lease by the oil and natural gas \n     industry for exploration and drilling, but are not being used \n     for production;\n       (6) as of the date of enactment of this Act, millions of \n     acres on the outer Continental Shelf are under lease by the \n     oil and natural gas industry, but are not producing;\n       (7) the major integrated oil companies have failed to \n     invest an adequate amount of the $600,000,000,000 in net \n     profits the companies have collected during the past 7 years \n     on clean and affordable domestically produced renewable fuels \n     that can improve national security and reduce greenhouse gas \n     emissions;\n       (8) according to Energy Information Administration \n     analyses, the economy-wide carbon cap and trade system under \n     this Act will spur the development of clean alternatives, and \n     average household gasoline spending will decrease by 2020 \n     because of greater fuel efficiency and changes in the fuels \n     market;\n       (9) even while the Energy Information Administration \n     projects that per-household spending on gasoline will \n     decrease, an increase of less than 2 cents per year per \n     gallon of fuel through 2030 would be attributable to the \n     implementation of this Act--compared to an increase of more \n     than 73 cents per gallon since last year at this time; and\n       (10) the implementation of this Act will produce cost \n     savings through energy efficiency investments and provide \n     funds for tax relief for consumers.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) oil companies should be--\n       (A) investing a significant percentage of their enormous \n     net profits in developing clean, affordable, and domestically \n     produced low-carbon alternatives to petroleum and other \n     finite resources; and\n       (B) producing more oil and natural gas supplies from \n     existing available leases in environmentally appropriate \n     areas, using the best available and safest technologies;\n       (2) Congress should suspend royalty relief for major oil \n     companies during times of high prices and use those revenues \n     to assist energy consumers;\n       (3) Congress should eliminate tax breaks and loopholes for \n     major oil companies and use those revenues to assist energy \n     consumers;\n       (4) the President should support legislation to make price \n     gouging a Federal crime; and\n       (5) the Administration should take swift action to \n     implement existing statutory direction to limit energy market \n     manipulation, increase transparency, and protect consumers.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 4965.

Pitcher \nKatie Burkhart allowed only four hits during the game, struck out 13 \nbatters and was recognized as the Most Valuable Player. Mindy Cowles \nand Kaitlin Cochran both hit homeruns for the Sun Devils. Jackie \nVasquez, Jessica Mapes, Mandy Urfer, Rhiannon Baca, Krista Donnenwirth, \nLesley Rogers, and Caylyn Carlson all contributed to the final score. \nOther Sun Devils making important contributions include Katie Crabb, \nMegan Elliott, Dani Rae Lougheed, Brittney Matta, Kristen Miller, \nAshley Muenz, Amanda Nesbitt, Brooke Neuman, Michelle Nulliner, Sarah \nRice, Colleen Robbins, Jessie Ware, and Renee Welty.\n  Coach Clint Myers led the Sun Devils to a season record of 66 wins \nand 5 losses and a perfect 10 and 0 mark in the postseason. Coach Myers \njoined ASU three years ago and has turned the ASU women's softball \nprogram into a PAC-l0 Conference powerhouse.\n  I salute the Sun Devils and congratulate them on a hard-earned \nnational championship.
