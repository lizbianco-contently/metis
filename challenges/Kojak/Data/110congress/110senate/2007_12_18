Madam President, I have publicly stated my feelings about \nTrent Lott on a number of occasions since he indicated he was going to \nretire by the end of this year. We had a lovely reception for him in \nthe Mansfield Room. Other people have their own views as to the \nstrengths of Trent Lott, but having worked with him here on the Senate \nfloor for these many years, his greatest attribute can best be \nsummarized by the statesman Edmund Burke:\n\n       All government . . . every virtue and every prudent act--is \n     founded on compromise . . .\n\n  That is not negative. That is positive. Compromise is something we as \nlegislators must do. Legislation is the art of compromise. That is what \nwe have been taught, and that is the way it is. There is no better \nexample of that than what we have before us now or should have in a \nshort time from the House, the omnibus spending bill. That has been the \nepitome of compromise by legislators and by the White House as the \nexecutive. That is what Trent Lott did best, approaching a difficult \nissue, trying to figure a way out of it. No one who has ever legislated \nand gotten a bill passed with their name on it has had what they really \nstarted out to do. We all must compromise. That is a negative term in \nsome people's mind, but it really isn't if you are a legislator.\n  The special skill Trent Lott has, the special kind of understanding \nand pursuit of the common good, requires us to find common ground. \nTrent Lott embodies that skill. He is a true legislator. In all my \ndealings with Trent Lott, he is a gentleman. I have never, ever had \nSenator Lott say something to me that he was not able to carry through \non. His commitments are as good as gold.\n\n  We have had some jokes here about his dealings with John Breaux. They \nhave a lot of qualities, but their qualities were the ability to make \ndeals. When we needed something done during the Daschle years, the \nfirst person we went to was John Breaux. I am confident the first \nperson he went to was Trent Lott. They have been close personal friends \nfor all these years. As a result of their friendship, their trust of \none another, it kind of spilled off on the rest of us, and we were able \nto get a lot of work done.\n  It goes without saying that we disagree on policy often, Senator Lott \nand I, but with Trent, these disagreements never seemed to be that \nimportant because he was always able to approach these challenges with \na genuine desire to find a solution.\n  The history books will be written about this institution. I am \nconfident they will be written about the State of Mississippi. There \nwill be chapters that will have to be dedicated to Trent Lott because \nhe has been part of the history of the State of Mississippi and of this \ninstitution and the House of Representatives. No one has ever, in the \nhistory of our country, some 230 years, served as the House whip and \nthe Senate whip, but Trent Lott has. I believe he has made our country \nmore secure in many ways. When we talk about security, it doesn't mean \nnecessarily the military because our security depends on a lot more.\n  Senator Lott, I wish you and your wonderful wife and your family the \nvery best. I believe my dealings with you have made me a better person \nand a better Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/18/senate-section/article/S15794-3", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15794-S15818]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The minority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, after the news of Trent's retirement \nhad spread, a young farmer in Jackson had this to say about the man he \nhad called ``Senator'' most of his life:\n\n       He's a good person to represent the State, caring for \n     people like he does.\n\n  That farmer had it exactly right because whether Trent was making \nsure an old man in Pascagoula got his Social Security check or ducking \ninto a kitchen in Tunica to thank the cooks after a political event, no \nservice was too small, no task too insignificant when it came to \nserving the people of Mississippi.\n  One time, when Trent was a young Congressman, a constituent called \nhis office to have his trash removed. When Trent asked why he hadn't \ncalled the town supervisor first, the man replied that he didn't want \nto start that high.\n  Nobody ever saw Trent Lott as a Congressman or a Senator. To them, he \nwas just Trent. As he vowed last month, that commitment to the people \nof Mississippi does not end here. ``I will work hard for the State, the \nlast day I am in the Senate,'' he said, ``and I will work hard for this \nState until the last day I am alive.''\n  In a plaque on his office wall, visitors will find Trent's rules. The \nmost important one he always said was this: You can never have a \nnational view if you forget the view from Pascagoula.\n  He never forgot his roots. Trent dined with Presidents, yet he still \nremembers facing the winters of his childhood without indoor heat. He \nalso remembers his first hot shower. And he never forgot the source of \nthat luxury. ``It came from hard work,'' his mother said. He would \nspend a lifetime proving that he took her words to heart.\n  The love of politics came early, thanks in part to some lively \ndebates with his folks around the dinner table. They always treated him \nwith respect--``as an equal,'' he said--and they watched with pride as \nhe threw himself into his studies and everything else that was \navailable to a blue-collar kid growing up along the gulf coast in 1950s \nAmerica.\n  Trent was an early standout. His high school classmates voted him \nclass president, most likely to succeed, most popular, a model of \nChristian conduct, most polite, and, of course, neatest. One friend \nrecalls that Trent was the only guy he ever knew who tidied up his bed \nbefore going to sleep at night.\n  Of course, Trent's reputation for neatness outlasted high school. It \nhas been the source of a lot of jokes over the years. But some of those \njokes really are not fair. It is not true, for example, that Trent \narranges his sock drawer according to color every day. He is perfectly \ncontent to do it once a week--black on one side, blue on the other.\n  In college, the connection to Mississippi deepened. Surrounded by the \nwhite pillars and ancient oaks of Ole Miss, he formed lifelong \nfriendships and grew in respect for the traditions of honor, integrity, \nduty, and service that had marked his beloved Sigma Nu from its \nbeginnings.\n  There was always something to do, and Trent did it all: frat parties, \nswaps, campus politics, singing, leading the cheers at the football \ngames, and, occasionally, even studying. One of Trent's college friends \nrecalls that Mrs. Hutchinson's sophomore literature class was Trent's \nWaterloo.\n  But after a less than impressive showing on her midterm exam, he \nrefocused--and one of the things that came into view was a pretty young \ngirl he had first met in high school band practice. One day Trent told \na fraternity brother he had met a girl he wanted to date. When he \nshowed him Tricia's picture, the friend said: Yes, I think you should \ndo that.\n  Then it was on to law school and marriage and private practice. Then, \nin the winter of 1968, a surprise phone call\n\n[[Page S15795]]\n\ncame that changed absolutely everything. It was Trent's Congressman, \nBill Colmer. He wanted to know if Trent would be interested in a job as \nhis top staffer in Washington.\n  It was a tough decision. Trent had never thought of coming here, and \nthe money was not good. But it seemed like a good opportunity. And, as \nTrent says, he never made a choice in his life based on finances. So he \ntook it. And Tricia was behind him all the way. That spring, they \npacked everything they could pack into their Pontiac and headed north. \nIt was the first of many gambles that would pay off for Trent Lott.\n  The new city and its temptations did not change the boy from \nPascagoula. He put his energy and his people skills to work, learning \nthe rules and customs of the House and cementing new friendships over a \nglass of Old Granddad and a cigar--always a cheap cigar--by night.\n  The second big gamble came when Congressman Colmer decided to retire. \nTrent wanted to run for his boss's seat, but he would do it his way. \nAlthough more than 9 out of 10 Fifth District voters were Democrats, \nTrent decided he would run as a Republican.\n  It was the hardest race of his life, but Trent loved every greased-\npig contest, every county fair, every parking lot rally, and every \nconversation in every living room he burst into--often unannounced, and \nusually uninvited. And the voters loved him back.\n  Buoyed by the Nixon landslide and a last-minute endorsement by his \nboss, he won. And so at 32, Trent had achieved what so many others in \nthis country have experienced: the realization, through wits and hard \nwork, of an outrageous dream. The boy from Pascagoula would return to \nWashington as the gentleman from Mississippi full of energy and ready \nto put it to use.\n  A year later came Watergate, new wisdom, and soon the recognition by \nTrent's colleagues that he was a leader.\n  It was an exciting time to be in Washington. The Reagan revolution \nwas about to take hold. As Trent later recalled: ``You could feel the \npolitical ground shift.'' And he would play a leading role.\n  Rising up the leadership ladder, he revolutionized the House's whip \noperation and found his place in the push and pull of counting votes. \nThe only Member in history to serve as whip in both Chambers, Trent put \nhis skills on display every day on the floor and in some close \nleadership races over the years, three of which he won by a single \nvote. ``If you win by two,'' Trent always said, ``you've wasted a \nvote.''\n  But his special gift back then, as now, was his ability to bring \npeople around to his point of view. One of his college friends put it \nthis way:\n\n       Trent could carry on a conversation with a tree stump--and \n     make it feel good about itself.\n\n  His colleagues soon learned that Trent Lott's word was as solid as a \nMississippi oak. So armed with a reputation for honesty, charm, wits, \nand a group of trusted soldiers--including an Arizona lawyer named Jon \nKyl and a young former Maine State senator named Olympia Snowe--he \nturned minority Republicans into a potent legislative force, ensuring \nsome of the biggest victories of the Reagan revolution.\n  At the end of the Reagan years, Trent set his sights on the Senate, \nand his opponent in that first race came right at him. But Trent was \nready for the fight. When the opponent said Trent's hair was too neat, \nTrent politely offered him a comb. When he falsely accused Trent of \nbeing an elitist, the pipefitter's son responded the old-fashioned way: \nHe and Tricia met just about every voter in the State that summer. The \nvoters could judge for themselves what kind of guy he was.\n  And, of course, they liked him, and they made him their Senator. And \nhe did not disappoint. Again, he rose quickly, becoming conference \nsecretary and then whip. Then came another retirement, sending Trent to \nthe top of the class again as his party's leader in the Senate. On \npassing tough legislation, he did not understand the word ``no.'' On \nworking out deals, he was without equal.\n  We all saw it up close after Katrina, when Trent became a ferocious \nadvocate for the people of Mississippi and the wider gulf coast, many \nof whom would rather live in tents than move away. And in a fight that \nbrought together all his skills as a politician and home State \nadvocate, he won.\n  We all know how valuable good staff is. Trent has always had the \nbest. We honor all of them today--past and present--for their \ntremendous contributions. To those who stay behind, we are glad you \nwill be here. For those who do not, we wish you every success.\n  Trent has lived life fully, never afraid to reach higher and always \nready to accept whatever fate would bring. Who in this Chamber was not \nimpressed by the way he dusted himself off after stepping down as \nleader? He never quit. And there is something deeply admirable in that.\n  To me, Trent has always been the perfect colleague. We have been in a \nlot of tough spots together. He has always helped me in every possible \nway, and he has taught me a lot.\n  Looking back on his beginnings, it is astonishing to think of how far \nthe son of Chester and Iona Lott has come. He leaves this place with a \nremarkable 35-year record of accomplishment of which he can be justly \nproud and scores of admirers from across the ideological spectrum. He \nwill leave a mark on this institution that long outlasts the political \nfights of the day.\n  It is hard to believe Trent will not be around when we all come back \nin January and the gavel drops on another session. But when it does, we \nwill remember at some point in the days and weeks that follow that \nmischievous grin or a heavy slap on the back or some happy tune we \nheard him whistle once when he passed us quickly in the hall.\n  Then we will be glad to have served with a man like Trent Lott, and \nrenewed in the hope that this institution and this Nation that he \nloves--to borrow the words of another Mississippian--will not merely \nendure, they will prevail.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now proceed \nto the consideration of S. Res. 409, which is at the desk.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report the \nresolution by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 409) commending the service of the \n     Honorable Trent Lott, a Senator from the State of \n     Mississippi.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to \nreconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 409) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 409\n\n       Whereas Chester Trent Lott, a United States Senator from \n     Mississippi, was born to Chester and Iona Watson Lott on \n     October 9, 1941, in Grenada, Mississippi;\n       Whereas Trent Lott was raised in Pascagoula, Mississippi, \n     attended public schools, and excelled in baseball, band, \n     theater, and student government;\n       Whereas after graduating from Pascagoula High School, where \n     he met his future wife during band practice, Trent Lott \n     enrolled in the University of Mississippi in 1959;\n       Whereas Trent Lott pledged Sigma Nu, rising to become its \n     president; formed a singing quartet known as The Chancellors; \n     and was elected ``head cheerleader'' of the Ole Mississippi \n     football team;\n       Whereas upon graduating college, Trent Lott enrolled in the \n     University of Mississippi Law School in 1963, excelling in \n     moot court and as president of the Phi Alpha Delta legal \n     fraternity;\n       Whereas upon graduating from law school in 1967, Trent Lott \n     practiced law in Pascagoula, then served as administrative \n     assistant to United States Representative William Colmer \n     until 1972;\n       Whereas upon Congressman Colmer's retirement, Trent Lott \n     was elected to replace him in November 1972 as a Republican \n     representing Mississippi's Fifth District;\n       Whereas Trent Lott was reelected by the voters of the Fifth \n     District to seven succeeding terms, rising to the position of \n     minority whip and serving in that role with distinction from \n     1981 to 1989;\n       Whereas Trent Lott was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1988 \n     and reelected three times, serving as chairman of the Senate \n     Committee on Rules and Administration from 2003 to 2006;\n\n[[Page S15796]]\n\n       Whereas Trent Lott was chosen by his Senate Republican \n     colleagues to serve as Majority Whip for the 104th Congress, \n     then chosen to lead his party in the Senate as both Majority \n     Leader and Minority Leader from 1996 to 2003;\n       Whereas Trent Lott was chosen by his peers to serve as \n     Minority Whip for the 110th Congress;\n       Whereas Trent Lott's warmth, decency, and devotion to the \n     people of Mississippi and the country have contributed to his \n     legendary skill at working cooperatively with people from all \n     political parties and ideologies;\n       Whereas, in addition to his many legislative achievements \n     in a congressional career spanning more than three decades, \n     Trent Lott has earned the admiration, respect, and affection \n     of his colleagues and of the American People;\n       Whereas he has drawn strength and support in a life of high \n     achievement and high responsibility from his faith, his, \n     beloved wife Tricia, their children, Tyler and Chet; and \n     their grandchildren;\n       Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the Senate\n       Notes with deep appreciation the retirement of Chester \n     Trent Lott;\n       Extends its best wishes to Trent Lott and his family;\n       Honors the integrity and outstanding work Trent Lott has \n     done in service to his country; and\n       Directs the Secretary of the Senate to transmit a copy of \n     this resolution to the family of Senator Trent Lott.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, the decision made by my State colleague \nto retire from the Senate has left me with a deep sense of loss. I \nrespect his right to leave the Senate, and I know he will enjoy a well-\nearned respite from the demands and challenges that go with this job.\n  Trent Lott has served with distinction, and he has reflected great \ncredit on our State and Nation. I have enjoyed his personal friendship \nand the opportunity to come to know his family, his wonderful wife \nTricia and their two fine children, Chet and Tyler.\n  Trent and I were elected to serve in the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives in 1972. At that time, he was serving as the \nadministrative assistant to Congressman William Colmer, who was the \nchairman of the Rules Committee in the House. So I looked to him for \nadvice and counsel because of his experience on the Hill and his \ninsight into how the House really worked, as only an insider such as he \nwould know.\n  We became friends right away. We were the first Republicans elected \nfrom our districts in Mississippi since the Reconstruction period \nfollowing the Civil War.\n  In due course, we were elected to serve in this body, and we have \nworked together over the years on the many challenges that have \nconfronted our State.\n  I will truly miss serving with Trent in the Senate. I have come to \nrespect him and appreciate his legislative skills and his great \ncapacity for hard work. He is a tireless and resolute advocate for \ncauses and issues which he decides to support. In a word, he is a \nwinner. He gets things done.\n  I know Trent and his family will enjoy the new opportunities they \nwill have following his great career in the House and the Senate. They \nhave certainly earned the right to new, less burdensome, and more \nrewarding experiences in the years ahead.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. SMITH. Madam President, I have been privileged to serve as a U.S. \nSenator now going into the 12th year of a second term. In all 12 of \nthose years, it has been for me a great privilege and a high honor to \nserve as a colleague of Trent Lott.\n  Over the course of those 12 years, Trent Lott has told me many times \nthat he has visited every State in the Union except Oregon. \nNotwithstanding that, this Oregonian feels great pride today in \nspeaking for Trent Lott.\n  I hope Trent will come to Oregon someday, and when he comes to \nOregon, there is a place I would like to take him. We have in Oregon \nmany groves of very ancient trees. It is tall timber. These trees go \nback 2,000 and 3,000 years. But because they are old, occasionally one \nof these sequoias will fall. And when they fall, a hole in the huge \ncanopy in the sky is opened.\n  When you are in one of these groves, you feel something of the \npresence of the sacred, a sanctuary. That is a feeling that I often \nhave when I come to the floor of the U.S. Senate. Occasionally, some \ntall timber leaves our presence--through retirement or death or from \nother causes--and when that happens, a great hole is left in the \nSenate. That is the feeling I have as I contemplate the retirement of \nTrent Lott. In this sanctuary, a great hole in the canopy will be \nopened.\n  Madam President, when I think of the men I have known, the women I \nhave known in the Senate, they are people of extraordinary ability, but \none stands apart in my mind as how to get things done, and that is \nTrent Lott. I have never seen his equal in the cloakroom. We have all \nfelt his warm slap on our back, a steely look in his eye, and a strong \nurging to vote this way or that. But it was always done with \nunderstanding that we represent not just a party but our country and \nour States, and that is where our obligation lies.\n  It was because Trent was so good, in my mind, that he is still, and \nwill forever be, something of an ideal because he was my first leader. \nWhat I saw in him was someone who knew this institution deeply, who \nworked relentlessly, who could define differences and help us to reach \nhonorable compromises so that when we went home, we could look back on \nsomething of an accomplishment.\n  I am proud of the example my first leader set for me. It is a high \nstandard. I thank you, Trent, for that standard. It is the gold \nstandard, in my mind.\n  I was halfway around the world when an event befell Trent Lott that \nshook me deeply. I was celebrating my reelection and on vacation. I \nwatched over international news as his words were misconstrued--words \nwhich we had heard him utter many times in his big warm-heartedness, \ntrying to make one of our colleagues, Strom Thurmond, feel good at 100 \nyears old. We knew what he meant, but the wolf pack of the press \ncircled around him, sensed blood in the water, and the exigencies of \npolitics caused a great injustice to be done to him and to Tricia. It \nwas a wrong, but it was a wrong that was righted.\n  I was privileged to be asked by Trent Lott to speak for him when he \nran for whip. On that occasion, as I thought of Trent, I thought of \nmore than my leader, my first leader. I thought of him as something \nmuch more. I thought of him as a friend and as a father figure. I \nrecalled on that occasion words I spoke regarding my own father at his \nfuneral that seemed to define the man--the man I called dad and the man \nI called my leader. They are words that were put into the mouth of the \ncharacter Anthony by the great writer Shakespeare. Shakespeare said of \nCaesar, when Caesar had fallen, these words:\n\n       His life was gentle and the elements so mixed in him that \n     nature might stand up and say to all the world: this was a \n     man.\n\n  I am privileged to call this man my friend. May God bless Trent and \nTricia Lott and thank God for their service to Mississippi and even to \nOregon and to the United States of America.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority whip is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I join my fellow Senators in wishing my \ncolleague, Trent Lott, the best of luck as he begins the next chapter \nin his life. You are getting to hear your eulogies today, Trent, and \nthey are pretty good. Most of us never think we will have that \nopportunity.\n  Senator Lott and I sure have had our differences in the 11 years I \nhave served in the Senate, and I guess we always will when it comes to \nsome issues, but serving together this past year as whips for our \nrespective parties has given me a chance to work closely with Trent on \na number of issues and this I can say: Trent Lott is a committed \nRepublican. He can be a partisan, but he cares about the Senate. He \nunderstands that politics, in the Senate and in life, is the art of \ncompromise. He has been willing to reach across the aisle to try to \nfind a way to make the Senate work and make our Government work and I \nrespect him very much for that.\n  F. Scott Fitzgerald famously declared that: ``There are no second \nacts in American lives.'' Well, Mr. Fitzgerald obviously didn't meet \nTrent Lott.\n  In the first act, Trent Lott began his career on Capitol Hill working \nfor a Democratic Congressman from Mississippi. He then, of course, was \nelected as a Republican Congressman from the\n\n[[Page S15797]]\n\nsame State. He spent nearly four decades in Congress serving the people \nof Mississippi. As a leader in the Senate, he helped steer America \nthrough some of the most turbulent chapters in our recent history: Two \nshutdowns of the Federal Government, an impeachment trial, a 9/11 \nterrorist attack on our Nation, and anthrax attacks on the U.S. \ncapital. With my friend, Tom Daschle, he negotiated the delicate terms \nof our Nation's first-ever 50-50 Senate split.\n  Seven years ago this week, Trent Lott stepped aside as majority \nleader. Some wondered then whether Senator Lott might be through with \nthe Senate. But he stayed and he managed in a short time to write one \nof the most remarkable second acts in this Senate in recent memory.\n  I know Trent must be feeling mixed emotions as he leaves the Senate. \nI can assure my fellow whip he has left a mark and will be remembered \nfor a long time, not for seersucker Thursday, not for wearing kilts on \nthe floor of the Senate, Trent Lott will be remembered because he is \none of us.\n  I wish Senator Lott and his wife Tricia and his family the best of \nluck as they begin another new act.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Carolina is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. DOLE. Madam President, Harry Truman was wrong. Truman famously \ndefined a statesman as ``a politician who has been dead for 20 years.'' \nIt is a good line, but it wasn't true then, as Truman's own career \nattests, and it is not true today. That said, we can never have enough \nstatesmen and women to validate our democratic creed, which makes our \nsense of loss all the greater when an authentic statesman leaves this \nplace.\n  For 35 years, Trent Lott has served the people of Mississippi with \ndistinction, never forgetting their interests, even as he advanced our \nnational interests: Economic development for Mississippi, meeting \ntransportation infrastructure needs, persuading businesses to build \nplants and provide jobs. His effectiveness is legendary, whether \nchampioning a strong national defense, encouraging entrepreneurship in \na dynamic economy or expanding both educational opportunity and \naccountability. Through it all, Trent kept faith with the people who \nsent him here. Just as he long ago earned their trust and confidence, \nso he impressed Members on both sides of the aisle with his integrity \nand his decency.\n  The only person ever to serve as a party whip in both Houses, Trent \nsoon became much more than a party leader. To his lasting credit, he \nhelped convince us tax cuts were the road to economic revitalization. \nAt the same time, he argued for a bipartisan approach to education \nreform. In the bleak aftermath of 9/11, Trent appealed to what Abraham \nLincoln called the better angels of our nature. Similar to Ronald \nReagan, he wears an optimist's smile, for he never confused an \nadversary with an enemy. Trent Lott will be remembered as someone who \npreferred to narrow our differences rather than exploit them.\n\n  The junior Senator from Mississippi has scaled the heights in his \npolitical career and he has experienced life's valleys as well. With \ndogged determination, he made adversity, whenever it occurred, a \nstrengthening experience. As one who has shared Senate Bible studies \nwith both Trent and his beloved wife Tricia, I know that his has been a \nprofoundly spiritual journey and one that is far from over.\n  In a town where talk is cheap--indeed, it is the only thing that is \ncheap--Trent prefers solutions to sound bites, and he has never \nmistaken civility for weakness. One of his basic principles is to \nrespect others whose views might differ. More often than not, he found \na way to distill the best of each, which to me is the definition of a \nstatesman.\n  His ability to get things done--to work effectively and foster \nrelationships with colleagues from both parties--resulted in his \nnumerous triumphs as the Senate majority leader. In his first year as \nleader, he personally led his colleagues to pass two landmark \nlegislative items: Welfare reform and the budget compromise, which \nresulted in the first balanced budgets with surpluses in 30 years.\n  Of course, the Senate is also a family, and on this day, I must \nmention some of my most cherished memories in the Dole family album, of \nTrent and Tricia campaigning for me in Rocky Mountain, NC, in the \nautumn of 2002; of Bob Dole showing up for the Spouses Club, presided \nover by Tricia, though begging off on a tour of the Capitol since he \nsaid he had already seen the place. Nor will I ever forget sitting in \nTrent's cherished rocking chair on the front porch of his Pascagoula \nhome--a home that would vanish on a brutal morning a little more than 2 \nyears ago, when a tempest named Katrina scoured miles and miles of \nMississippi coastline.\n  Similar to so many who looked out on the gulf, the Lotts lost \neverything that day--everything but life and love and the faith that \ngives to them both a meaning that no storm can wash away. In the years \nsince, the victims of Katrina have had no more passionate advocates \nthan Trent and Tricia Lott. No one has worked harder, longer, to ensure \nthat we honor the promises made to our fellow men and women along the \ngulf coast. As the mayor of Gulfport said about Trent:\n\n       Although suffering catastrophic personal losses himself, he \n     has tirelessly fought our battles and won our wars for us \n     time and again. His legacy will be recognized in every corner \n     of our great State and the pages of history will reflect the \n     honor and service of the Senator from Pascagoula who restored \n     hope in the citizens of Mississippi.\n\n  I would add I have great respect for Tricia's enormous efforts to \nprovide needed supplies and hope to the Katrina victims.\n  Houses, we have learned, are vulnerable to the fury of nature. \nSupremacy in politicians is even more transitory. Majorities shift \nsimilar to the sands of Biloxi. But some things endure. Honor endures. \nTrue leadership generates its own legacy. True leaders stake their own \nclaim to posterity's gratitude. That is the stuff of statesmanship, and \nthat is the essence of Trent Lott.\n  The gentleman from Mississippi has had a lengthy and purpose-driven \ncareer in this institution, and he will be greatly missed. With deep \nadmiration and respect for a trusted colleague, I wish Trent and his \nfamily all the best.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Utah is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, when I came to the Senate after the \nelection of 1976, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee was a very \ndistinguished gentleman from Mississippi named James Eastland. I can \nremember the first time I met Senator Eastland as a citizen newly \nelected to the Senate, when nobody thought I was going to make it. I \nwas invited into his office and the first thing he did was offer me a \ncigar. I said: ``Well, I am sorry, sir. My faith does not permit me to \nsmoke.'' He said: ``Well, then, have a drink.'' I replied: ``Well, \nsorry, sir, but my faith doesn't permit me to drink.'' Senator Eastland \nthen exclaimed very loudly: ``What the expletive is the matter with you \nMormons?''\n  I want everybody to know Senator Lott has never offered me a cigar \nnor has he ever offered me a drink, although I think he has been \ntempted a few times.\n  Let me say this: I have such admiration for Senator Lott and his wife \nTricia and for the love and respect they have shown to all of us and \nthis institution, and for all of their hard work.\n  It is no secret that I bitterly resent the way Senator Lott was \ntreated after Senator Strom Thurmond's 100th birthday party. It was \nwrong, and it was hitting below the belt. It would have crushed any one \nof us to go through what he went through, facing such harsh attacks \nknowing that he certainly did not mean to say what others tried to put \nin his mouth. But Trent fought his way back, kept his head high, became \na friend to everybody in the Senate again the very next day, and, of \ncourse, won the respect of virtually everybody who has ever known him \nor what he stands for.\n\n  I have tremendous respect and love for Trent and Tricia for the \nsacrifices they have made for their State and for this country. He and \nSenator Cochran have been one of the best duos in the history of the \nSenate--two real gentlemen, two strong, tough people. But, they are \nalso two people who have shown respect for this body and all of its \nmembers in ways that not many others have.\n  All I can say is I wish Senator Lott and Tricia the best of luck in \nall of their future endeavors. While I am certain he will be an asset \nto any effort\n\n[[Page S15798]]\n\nwith which he becomes involved, I am equally certain the Senate is \ngoing to be a lesser place without him.\n  Supporting Senator Lott throughout his time in the Congress is one of \nthe most beautiful and noble women in the history of the Senate. Tricia \nLott has been the quintessential Senate wife, and I doubt Senator Lott \nwould have been as great as he has become had it not been for his \nrelationship with Tricia.\n  Elaine and I are going to greatly miss you, Trent. I know I am not \nsupposed to refer to you by your first name, but I am going to make an \nexception in this case. We will always be pulling for you, your \nsuccess, and your happiness in this life. This old Senator is going to \nmiss you greatly. We are going to miss the efforts you put forth. We \nare going to miss the talents you have. We are going to miss the energy \nyou bring to the Senate. And, we are most certainly going to miss your \nability to bring us together, making better Senators out of us all.\n  God bless the Lotts. We in the Senate will surely miss them.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, about exactly 21 years ago, after I had \nbeen elected to the House of Representatives from the State of Arizona, \nmy wife Caryll and I came to Washington and almost immediately met \nTrent and Tricia Lott. In fact, we have a photograph that is displayed \nin our home with Trent and Tricia on which Trent made a wonderful \ninscription.\n  I learned from the very beginning that Trent Lott was a leader--a \nleader in the House of Representatives and a leader among his \ncolleagues. I have been following Trent Lott ever since as House whip, \nas Senate whip, as Senate Republican leader, and as a colleague in \nbattles too numerous to mention.\n  Chaplain Black began this morning asking that we come here to serve. \nNo State has ever been served better than by their representative Trent \nLott. He always puts Mississippi first, yet always is able to balance \nhis devotion to his constituents with the national interest and with \nhis responsibilities in representing his colleagues.\n  That he came to serve, again to use the Chaplain's word, is best \nillustrated by his decision to run for reelection a year ago. Many of \nus knew Trent had come to believe that he had to prioritize his family \nresponsibilities and had concluded it was about time for him to leave \npublic service. But the catastrophe of Hurricane Katrina hit the coast \nof Mississippi, destroying not only the Lotts' home in Pascagoula but \nso many of the homes and businesses of his friends in Mississippi. It \ndid not take Trent too long in pondering what he faced to conclude that \nhe owed it to his constituents in Mississippi to continue to use his \nskills in Washington, DC, to represent them, to help them recover from \nthe devastation that had been visited upon them. It was this service, \nafter he had already concluded that his time had come to move out of \npublic service, that I think illustrates perhaps better than anything \nelse his devotion to the people of Mississippi, to his friends there. \nHe did not decide to leave the Senate until his work was done, and for \nthat the people of Mississippi, I know, will be forever grateful to \nTrent Lott.\n  Trent has always been known as being a person who has been able to \nfind the common ground among his colleagues. That is a very special \nskill. Some people call it dealmaking. Some people talk about it in \nterms of the art of compromise, frequently talking about Trent's \nability to move across the aisle and to work with friends on both the \nDemocratic and Republican side.\n  I think his ability to do this, which is unprecedented in my 21 years \nin Washington or unequaled, I should say, is due to a variety of \nqualities. First, Trent's intelligence; second, his boundless energy; \nthird, his knowledge of the institutions, of both the House and the \nSenate. Again, I know of no equal in terms of the knowledge of how \nthese bodies work and how we can achieve great things by working with \npeople in both bodies.\n  His knowledge of the nature of man--this is something my father \ntaught me and I have tried to learn from people such as Trent Lott--\nwhat makes people tick--you can find that common ground and achieve \ngreat things if you understand people. I think that is one of Trent's \ngreatest qualities and one which will be missed in this body. And, of \ncourse, his commitment to what he has always believed was right for \nMississippi and America. Also contributing to his success is his faith, \nand it sustained him more than we will ever know. And finally, of \ncourse, his family.\n  It is interesting that everybody who has commented about Trent's \nservice in the Senate has quickly moved to also comment about his \ncommitment to his family and in particular his wonderful wife Tricia. \nIt has to say something when that is one of the first things people \nthink of when they think of you. I know if that is the way Trent is \nremembered, he will be a very happy man.\n  Trent Lott has been serving almost his entire adult life. The people \nof Mississippi, the people of America, his colleagues in the House and \nSenate, and I have been honored to serve with Trent for 21 years. I \nhave learned a lot. Most importantly, I have enjoyed my time with \nTrent, especially quiet time.\n  Now it is time for Trent to serve his family more in accordance with \nhis priorities, and no one can argue that he has not earned that right.\n  So Trent Lott, a man for all seasons--Representative, Senator, \nservant, leader, husband, father, and grandfather, proud American and \nMississippian and friend--thank you. God bless you.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I noticed the Senator from California \nand I rose virtually simultaneously. I yield to her.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I thank the Senator from \nPennsylvania very much. It is very generous of him. My remarks are very \nbrief and they are very personal.\n  Trent, I want you to know how much I have enjoyed working with you. I \nhave enjoyed your friendship, I have enjoyed your sense of humor and, \nyes, I have even enjoyed your singing.\n  (Laughter.)\n  I have found you to be both forthright and truthful. I have found \nthat when you give your word, you keep it. I tend to judge people on \ntwo bases: how they go through the tough times and whether I would want \nto be in a bunker with them in a real debate.\n  I watched you go through the tough times. I remember you showing me a \npicture of a chair that had gone a mile from the home that blew down in \nthe hurricane. I remember your fight with the insurance company, and I \ncan only say to that insurance company: Give up, you are going to lose.\n  I want you to know how much I treasure the relationship we have had. \nYou have a great future. For you and your family, you are probably \ndoing the right thing. For us, it is going to be a real loss. I want \nyou to know how much I enjoyed the times we had socially, the \nseersucker caucus, seeing you turn up here in white bucks, all clean, \nspotless, a seersucker suit, a pink shirt, and a pink tie. No one in \nseersucker quite equals you, Trent Lott. For me, a westerner, to see a \nsoutherner at his peacock best was incredibly special.\n  I thank you for your contributions to the Senate. I thank you for \nyour friendship. I wish you well, and may the wind always be at your \nback.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I join my colleagues in expressing my \nheartiest congratulations to my good friend, Senator Trent Lott, on his \nhistoric career of 35 years as a member of the U.S. Congress. I also \nexpress deep regrets that following the new year, we will no longer \nhave Trent Lott as a member of this body. His announcement that he will \nbe retiring was a shock to some of us here in the Senate. Trent has \nbeen the embodiment of what's good in this body for so long, that it \nwill be difficult to think of the United States Senate without the \nSenator from Mississippi. I applaud Trent's outstanding service to the \npeople of Mississippi, and the nation which he has successfully \nundertaken in both wings of the U.S. Capitol.\n  Trent Lott was born on October 9, 1941, in Grenada, MS, the only \nchild to a shipyard worker, Chester Lott, and a school teacher mother \nIona. Trent attended a high school which in later\n\n[[Page S15799]]\n\nyears would bare his name, the Trent Lott Middle School. Lott went to \nthe University of Mississippi where he achieved an undergraduate degree \nin public administration in 1965 and a law degree in 1967. During his \ntime at college he met and married his wife Patricia Thompson in \nDecember 1964. Together the couple had a son and a daughter, Chester \nand Tyler.\n  After graduating from law school, Trent began a law practice in \nPascagoula, MS, but leaving after less than a year when he was offered \na job working in Washington as an administrative assistant for \nCongressman William Colmer, a Mississippi Democrat. When Congressman \nColmer announced his retirement from the House of Representatives, \nTrent Lott announced his candidacy as a Republican to seek the vacant \noffice. Lott, even as a Republican, won Colmer's endorsement, vowing to \nfight the increasing power of Government that was developing in \nWashington. Lott went on to win the seat with 55 percent of the vote. \nThe next 35 years would mark a series of extraordinary moments in \nhistory as Trent Lott begins his career as a Member of Congress.\n  I have had the privilege of serving with Trent in the Senate for the \npast 19 years. I have watched him throughout his Senate career develop \ninto a strong and effective leader, mastering the art of compromise, a \nfeat which is hard to accomplish in these times. These qualities served \nTrent well as he climbed the ranks in House and Senate leadership: he \nserved as House minority whip from 1981 to 1989; Senate majority whip \nfor 5 months in 1995; and in June of 1996, he succeeded my good friend, \nSenator Bob Dole, to become the 16th majority leader of the Senate. \nTrent served a brief stint as minority leader after the 2000 elections \nproduced a 50-50 split in the Senate, with Vice President Al Gore still \nbeing the tiebreaking vote. As the Bush administration came into \noffice, with Vice President Dick Cheney now being the tiebreaker, \ncontrol went back to the Republicans and Trent resumed his duties as \nmajority leader. Later in 2001, Trent would once again become Minority \nLeader as Senator Jim Jeffords, a Republican from Vermont, became an \nIndependent and caucused with the Democrats, allowing them to regain \nthe majority. Presumably, Trent will leave the Senate while serving in \nhis most recent leadership position; he was elected this Congress to \nserve as the Republican whip. Senator Trent Lott is the first person to \nhave served as whip in both Houses of Congress.\n  Drawing on his impressive experience as a legislator and a \nnegotiator, majority Leader, Lott was instrumental in promptly moving \nlegislation from Congress to the President's desk. Working harmoniously \nwith the executive and legislative branches of Government, the country \nwitnessed landmark bills being signed into law. Major policy \ninitiatives, such as the Welfare Reform Act of 1996 and bringing \nbalance to the Federal budget for the first time since 1968, were both \naccomplished under Trent's leadership. However, I was most impressed \nwith the role Trent played in the impeachment proceedings for President \nBill Clinton. Working with him during this difficult time in our \ncountry's history was an experience I will always remember.\n  Aside from a distinguished career as majority leader, Senator Lott \nhas been a champion for his own State of Mississippi. Recognizing that \nthe top priorities in Mississippi are an expanded transportation system \nand innovative education, Trent time and time again proved to the \npeople of his State his ability to deliver. He has secured Federal \nfunding to improve Mississippi's transportation expansion and has more \nthan doubled research funding for Mississippi's public universities. \nRecognizing Trent's leadership through public service, the University \nof Mississippi in Oxford, where he received both his undergraduate and \nlaw degrees, named its leadership institute after him.\n  On a personal note, I believe all my colleagues can agree with me, \nthat along with his remarkable accomplishments in Congress, what we \nwill miss most about Trent is his affability, commonsense persona, and \nhis enjoyable sense of humor. He brings a breath of fresh air to \nWashington, a town which desperately needs it at times. No one \nquestioned Trent's motive when he revived a long-forgotten Senate \ntradition known as Seersucker Thursday, a tradition which this Senator \nhas participated in, and will continue to participate in.\n  Senator Trent Lott's service and leadership were invaluable to this \ninstitution. Truly a great Senator, he will be missed in this body. I \nwish him, his wife Patricia, and all his family the very best in the \nyears to come.\n  I am pleased to join in this tribute to Senator Lott. My only regret \nis that it is occurring perhaps 18 years too soon.\n  I would characterize Trent's attributes, among many, as his talent, \nhis character, and his flair. He has brought to this body enormous \nintellectual capability and great street smarts. Ordinarily, the two do \nnot go together, but with Trent, they have been united to the great \nbenefit of the body.\n  We have watched Trent in his positions in the Senate before taking a \nleadership role after his election in 1988, being the majority leader, \nand the way he makes contacts on the Senate floor. We all move around, \nnone with the speed and alacrity of Trent Lott. There is always an \nintensity to his conversations. He doesn't buttonhole people or he \ndoesn't lean over as Lyndon Johnson was reputed to have done, but there \nis a real intensity. Usually at the end of the short conversation, the \nother person is nodding in the affirmative.\n  At our Tuesday luncheons, the way he moves around from table to \ntable, it was almost as if he were in Club 21. Here again, moving in \nand out with a great deal of speed and, again, the conversations and \nwhat I surmise at some distance to be success.\n  He has been characterized as a deal maker, a term which is not always \nused in the highest sense, but with Trent Lott it is. The great problem \nwith our body is there are not enough deal makers. Not enough Senators \nwilling to come to an accommodation. It is an understanding of the \nvaried points of view.\n  On the rare occasions when I have disagreed with a majority vote--may \nthe record show Trent is smiling--he has been understanding in his \nleadership position, never conceding, and frequently advocating, but \nalways understanding.\n  If there is one thing this body lacks, it is a sense of \naccommodation. That is evident by anybody who will take a photograph of \nthe Chamber today and note how many people on the other side of the \naisle have appeared here. I hope their numbers will be increased before \nthis proceeding is concluded.\n  The business about our political process being dominated by the \nextremes of both parties is very much to the detriment of the country. \nThose who are willing to cross the aisle, as the last speaker did on \nthe Democratic side, the Senator from California, the country owes a \ngreat debt of gratitude to. And to those such as Senator Lott who have \nbeen able to forge compromises, it is in the greatest tradition of the \nSenate and the greatest tradition of the United States.\n  Just a word or two about his character. I attended the 100th birthday \nparty of Senator Thurmond on December 4, 2002. I have seen many \ncomments blown vastly out of proportion during my tenure in the Senate \nand before, but never have I seen one blown as much out of proportion \nas that one was. And I said so at the time. My record on civil rights \nis one which no one yet has questioned. What Senator Lott said was in \nno means out of line. And then to continue in the Senate and really \nmove as a Member without leadership credentials was to his enormous \ncredit. Then to come back and to run for another leadership position \nand be successful was in the greatest tradition of the Phoenix rising \nfrom the ashes. I haven't seen any greater display of character in this \nbody in the time I have been here.\n\n  Then there is the matter of flair, which this body needs more of. \nAlways a smile, always a pat on the back, always the joviality, and the \ngreat tradition of seersucker Thursday. It is always an interesting \ntime when people come, not recognizing seersucker Thursday. One day, \nour leader, Bill Frist, went out and bought a suit--and I have a \npicture hanging proudly in my outer office--and Bill couldn't get the \ntrousers adjusted, and the highlight of the picture is the unadjusted \ntrousers of one of our Senate colleagues.\n\n[[Page S15800]]\n\n  Let me end on a note which I have debated whether I should comment \nabout, but it is relevant because of the response Trent made to a short \nstory I told recently at the celebrity comedy evening. I dusted off an \nold story from mayor Bill Daley at the 1968 convention and made Trent \nthe object of the story. It went to the effect that when Trent came \nback to the Senate after the losses in Mississippi, he was devastated \nand very glum.\n  I approached him on the Senate Floor one day and said: Trent, why are \nyou so unhappy? What is wrong?\n  I knew, in one sense, but he seemed especially morose.\n  He said: Well, Arlen, not only was my entire property destroyed in \nMississippi, but my entire library was destroyed--both books--and I \nwasn't finished coloring one of them, either.\n  Well, that little bit of joviality at Trent's expense was met with \nhis approaching me on the floor--and this part of the story is true and \nwhat makes it perhaps relevant to these comments--and with a scowl on \nhis face, he said: Arlen, I thought you and I were friends. We have \nbeen in this body a long time together. Now I hear you are making me \nthe butt of jokes at comedy hour, so I don't really understand. And \nbesides your unfairness and your incivility, you are wrong--I have more \nthan two coloring books.\n  In a sense, that characterizes Trent Lott's magnanimity, and we are \nall going to miss him very much. He has made a great contribution. When \nTrent decided there was another course for him and his family, I had \ngreat respect for that decision as I have great respect for him.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I had an opportunity to hear the first \nhalf hour of this tribute to Senator Lott, and then I had to go on to \nanother piece of business, and I have just returned. But in all of this \nconversation about Senator Lott, there has been some levity. I am not \ngoing to be able to add to that because my wife always tells me every \ntime I try to be funny, I kind of screw up. So I want to add to the \nbusiness aspect of Senator Lott and the Senate.\n  I think most of the tribute I heard praised Senator Lott for making \nthe Senate work, the process of the Senate, moving things through the \nSenate, making the Senate a great part of our institution of self-\ngovernment, and he does that. But I would like to talk about the \nsubstance of policy I have seen Trent Lott bring to the Senate and \nbring to the people, and whatever I talk about is part of the laws of \nthe United States to which I think he has contributed.\n  Like all of my colleagues, it is hard for me to imagine the Congress, \nand especially the Senate, without Trent Lott being a part of it.\n  I met my friend Trent Lott when I was elected to the House of \nRepresentatives in 1974. He had already been in the House of \nRepresentatives at that time for 2 years. As has been said so many \ntimes, he went on to become a very competent House Republican whip, \nfirst showing what a successful national leader he would prove to be \nagain and again, as he is now in that position in the Senate.\n  I also remember talking with Congressman Lott 8 years after I came to \nthe Senate, as he was imagining whether he should run for the Senate. \nBut it has really only been in the last 12 years that I have had the \nopportunity to work most closely with Senator Lott. He has been a very \nstrong ally, particularly for me as a leader on the Finance Committee, \nbut he has also, on occasion, been a worthy opponent.\n  Senator Lott has fought tirelessly for legislation that respects the \nprinciple of less government and more freedom, particularly economic \nfreedom. His support for tax relief, expanded market opportunities for \nU.S. manufacturers and for job creation, and for consumer-driven health \ncare has been essential to the many successful legislative initiatives \nthat have come from the Committee on Finance in recent years.\n  Back in 1997, as a new member of the Finance Committee, Senator Lott \nworked for passage of the Tax Relief Act of 1997. This legislation \nincluded a $500-per-child tax credit, a 20-percent capital gains tax \nrate, the Roth IRA, and estate tax relief for small businesses. In \nfact, Senator Lott was a leading proponent of capital gains tax relief, \nand he remains unfailing today in his commitment to this vitally \nimportant progrowth tax policy.\n  In 1998, Senator Lott was a key player on the Finance Committee in \nputting together a final agreement on the highway bill.\n  In 2001, when I became chairman of the Finance Committee and we had \nthe opportunity to pass the largest tax relief bill in a generation, \nSenator Lott was Republican leader at that time, but he continued as a \nmember of the Finance Committee and in turn an essential supporter and \ncontributor to what has become known as the Economic Growth and Tax \nRelief Reconciliation Act of 2001. This legislation lowered rates for \nall taxpayers, made the Tax Code more progressive, and created the \nfirst ever 10-percent marginal tax rate.\n\n  Two years later, after September 11, we were at work on the Finance \nCommittee to pass legislation to stimulate the economy. Again, Senator \nLott was in the forefront as an advocate for reducing the capital gains \ntax rate to 15 percent, where it is today. Senator Lott weighed in \nheavily to get it done. Also, with lowering taxes on income from \ndividends and capital gains, the Job Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation \nAct of 2003 accelerated some of the tax changes passed in 2001 and \nincreased the exemption amount for the alternative minimum tax. These \ninitiatives encouraged economic growth and were vital to mitigating the \neconomic shock of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. By \nspurring economic activity, those tax policies altogether resulted in \nrecordbreaking revenues collected by the Federal Treasury.\n  Senator Lott has brought tremendous energy to policy and tremendous \nenergy to getting the work of the Senate done. But I am going to \nremember his contribution to the policy this Senate has made--very good \npolicy--and he has been there working very hard as a member of the \nSenate Finance Committee to do that. The drive to get the work done has \nhelped me get my work done in the Senate.\n  Now, there is no doubt he served his constituents of Mississippi very \neffectively. After nearly three decades in the Senate, he showed his \nloyalty by staying in the Senate after a planned retirement just last \nelection. He decided to run for reelection in order to do what he has \ndone for an entire life as a public servant--to help the people of \nMississippi, and in this specific instance to help the people of \nMississippi recover from Hurricane Katrina. Mississippians didn't quit, \nand neither did Senator Lott quit. He used his influence and power in \nthe Senate to help his State recover.\n  As a Republican leader in the Senate, Trent Lott's experience and \nknowledge of the Senate and the Senate's procedures have proven to be \ninvaluable. It will be a long time, if ever, that we see anyone work \nthe whip process better than Senator Lott has.\n  Senator Lott leaves the Senate with a great legacy of \naccomplishments. Woven throughout everything, though, is Senator Lott's \nability to lead. He demonstrated repeatedly his talents and abilities \nfor building winning coalitions. He led with commitment to getting \nthings done. He understood that there are different points of view but \nthat they can be brought together for the right approach that brings \nresults and, as a result, good policy.\n  I salute Senator Lott's tremendous success as a leader in the Senate, \nand I am truly sorry to see Senator Lott leave the Senate. I will miss \nhim as a colleague and as a friend. Trent Lott has made the Senate, he \nhas made his home State, and, for sure, the Nation a better place.\n  Thank you for your service, Trent Lott.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Madam President, I wish to join all of my colleagues, \nsadly and regrettably, in a big farewell to my very good friend, a good \nfriend to this institution, a giant in this institution, as Trent \nprepares to leave the Senate and usher in a new chapter of his much-\naccomplished life. With his 35 years of distinguished service, his \nleaving the Senate represents an enormous loss to our Nation and to his \nbeloved State of Mississippi, to the Senate, and to many of us \npersonally.\n\n[[Page S15801]]\n\n  There is no question that it speaks volumes about his dedication and \ncommitment to his beloved State of Mississippi when he could not and \nwould not leave the Senate until his State found solid ground and \nfooting in the aftermath of the horrific devastation of Hurricane \nKatrina.\n  I must admit I feel as if I bear some responsibility in Trent's \nleaving the Senate. You see, a few weeks ago, prior to the recess, \nTrent said: Olympia, if you don't vote with me, I am leaving the \nSenate. Always the straightforward approach. Trent, I just didn't \nrealize you were serious. So I am a little relieved to know it wasn't \nabout me.\n  But, you know, I have known Trent for 28 years, since we first served \ntogether in the House of Representatives, and I have always known him \nto be an adept and thoughtful legislator in his various leadership \ncapacities in both the House and Senate. He forged the template for \nreaching out and solving problems and strengthening the respective \ninstitutions in which he served.\n  I saw firsthand his masterful skills as minority whip when he was \nelected in 1981. In 1982, he raised a few eyebrows when this \nconservative man from the South named a centrist woman from Maine as \nhis chief deputy whip. That was groundbreaking at the time because it \nwas the first Republican woman to serve in that capacity. But in 1981, \nwe only had 192 Republicans in the House, and Trent demonstrated his \nlegendary abilities to cross party lines, secure the votes, and was so \ninstrumental to instituting President Reagan's agenda. So it was no \nsurprise that President Reagan would frequently call Trent and his whip \norganization to the White House, because he knew Trent was central and \ncrucial to securing those early threshold victorious for his key \ninitiatives.\n  For those who served at that time in the House of Representatives, we \nhad epic budget and tax-cut battles. We were rebuilding our hollow \nforces after Vietnam and of course the Cold War was in full force. \nIndisputably, Trent rose to the occasion time and time again. He was a \nconsummate coalition builder. He created what he described as the buddy \nsystem, bridging the political divide, understanding that there would \nbe regional, political, and philosophical differences that would divide \nus, but he would find a way to unite us.\n  At that time we had, what was it, Gypsy Moths, which were the \nNortheast-Midwest Republicans, those of us who were there, Republicans, \nand then the Boll Weevils, who were southern Democrats. I will leave it \nup to you to decide whether it is appropriate to name Members of \nCongress after insects. Nevertheless, that was the regional divide and \nit was Trent's challenge to bridge that divide, and he did it time and \ntime again. Even after the 1982 election--we lost 26 Republican seats \nin the House of Representatives, now we were down to 166 Members of the \nHouse--he managed to secure votes that would have eluded others. In \nfact, we were able to obtain a 100-percent increase in defense spending \nin 5 years. That is what he was able to accomplish, because he \nsystematically and mathematically as well as philosophically worked \nwith people across the political lines to make it work. As he says \nhimself, he is a congenital doer, who wants to solve the problems of \nthis great Nation.\n  It is no surprise, then, that he would be the first person elected to \nwhip in both the House and Senate. He rose rapidly here within the \nranks of leadership, with the culmination as Senate majority leader in \n1996. He characteristically wasted no time once again applying the same \nformula for coalition building and achieving the passage of watershed \nlegislation, as has been mentioned--whether it was the minimum wage, \nKassebaum-Kennedy legislation on health care portability, the landmark \nwelfare reform, even after it had been vetoed twice by the President.\n  We all know during that period of time as well his tenure was \nbookended by unprecedented and historic events--the impeachment trial, \na 50-50 Senate for the first time in 120 years, and the worst attack on \nAmerican soil. He managed to achieve the first balanced budgets in \nprobably more than a half a century. He, as we all well know, guided \nthis institution with dignity and skill during those tumultuous times.\n  On a more personal note, one of the crowning achievements of his \npersuasive powers is when, as others have mentioned here today, he was \ndetermined to dedicate Thursday, one summer day, for Seersucker Day. He \napproached me with the idea. He said, Olympia, are you going to wear a \nseersucker suit? I said, Trent, be serious; I am from Maine. We don't \nwear seersucker suits and I will not wear it. Not over my dead body.\n  Of course, when Seersucker Day arrived, I showed up in a seersucker \nsuit, to his surprise, alive and well. But that is an indication of his \nability to persuade.\n  Finally, I think there can be no discussion of Trent's legacy without \npaying tribute to his extraordinary wife Tricia. Theirs is truly a \nspecial partnership. I know Trent would be the first to say he could \nnot have done any of it without Tricia. She in her own right has \ncontributed immeasurably, in both the House and the Senate, and their \nwonderful children as well.\n  To the Senator from Mississippi, Senator Lott, you have been a \npivotal and positive and powerful force for the good for our first \nbranch of Government, bearing a close resemblance to what our Founding \nFathers had in mind--Madison in particular--when he said he expected of \nthe Senate ``to prefer the long and true welfare of our country.''\n  It is with profound gratitude we say farewell and wish you well. God \nbless you and Tricia and your entire family.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Michigan is \nrecognized.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I rise today also to express my \nfriendship and gratitude to the great Senator from the State of \nMississippi. When I think about comments that have been said about his \neffectiveness, I have to say from this side of the aisle, we have \nlamented his effectiveness from time to time--and appreciated, as well, \nthe desire and the practical side of the Senator from Mississippi, to \nwant to get things done, to be able to make things work. I, for one, am \nvery grateful for that.\n  I am assuming some of that comes from having been on the staff side \nas well as having been in the House and the Senate and learning how \nthings work and valuing governing, valuing relationships, and wanting \nto get things done.\n  Back in my home State of Michigan, when I talk about the legislation \nSenator Lott and I have championed, folks raise their eyebrows. What \nare you two doing working together on something? I talk to them about \nthe fact that if it weren't for Senator Lott and his leadership, \njoining with me, we would not have achieved something important earlier \nthis year based on legislation we introduced to provide more \ncompetition in the area of prescription drugs, and to lower the price \nof prescription drugs through the ability of generic drugs to come into \nthe marketplace. We were successful in amending the FDA bill. It got \ntough in conference. A lot of folks didn't want to see those loopholes \nclosed. I thank Trent for hanging in there or we would not have \nachieved that. Businesses around the country will benefit from lower \nprices on prescription drugs for their employees as a result of your \nleadership. Seniors will benefit as a result. I thank you for stepping \nup at the time when it was not easy to do.\n  It has been a great pleasure to work with you in many different ways. \nI have to say also, always to me you have been a southern gentleman. I, \ntoo, never thought in my wildest dreams I would wear a seersucker suit. \nAlong with Senator Snowe, and with the help of Senator Feinstein--who \nchided and pushed and persuaded all of us, and helped all of us be able \nto find seersucker suits--we have all joined and had a great time every \nyear being able to come together for that great picture I have in my \noffice.\n  I know you will be missed on both sides of the aisle. We understand \nthat you understand the process. I know your book ``Herding Cats'' \nreflects what in fact it is oftentimes in the legislative process. But \nyou have been able to do the herding and been able to get people to \ncome together, and you will be known for being an extraordinary leader \nin the Senate.\n  I rise today to congratulate you, to thank you, to wish you and \nTricia and your children and grandchildren nothing but happiness as you \nmove to the\n\n[[Page S15802]]\n\nnext chapter of what I am sure will continue to be a very meaningful \nand exciting life.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Madam President, one of the words we often hear as \npeople talk about relationships is the word ``mentor.'' It is always \nassumed that the older person mentors the younger person. The record is \nclear that I am 8 years older than Trent Lott. But the record is also \nclear that he has acted as my mentor as I have come here to the Senate.\n  We have all heard about his legislative accomplishments. I wish to \npick out three items of my relationship with Trent where he has taught \nme things that have been valuable. When Trent ran for the whip \nposition, I worked for the election of Alan Simpson. I didn't know \nTrent all that well. Alan and I were friends from long ago. We first \nmet up in the family gallery when our respective fathers were being \nsworn in as Senators. He introduced me to his child bride and I \nintroduced him to mine. He made the Simpson-like comment. He said:\n\n       Having married younger women, this means in our older age \n     we will smell perfume instead of liniment.\n\n  After I got to know Trent and appreciate his abilities, I made the \ncomment, If I had known you to have been as good a leader as you are, I \nwould have voted for you in the beginning. He corrected me and said, \nNo, your relationship with Simpson was so strong and so personal that \nyou should have supported him, and I didn't even ask you because I \nrespected that relationship.\n  That was a very important thing he taught me there about \nrelationships and commitments that I have tried to remember ever since.\n  Second: As a freshman Senator who was sure I understood the \ninstitution, I moved out aggressively in a variety of circumstances and \nsuddenly found myself caught in a vice between two very senior, very \npowerful, very opinionated Senators, whose names I shall not disclose.\n  I didn't know what to do. Whatever I did, I would offend one or the \nother and both of them had reputations for very long memories and \ndetermination to take revenge. In my moment of great panic, I called \nTrent and laid this before him, more or less seeking some kind of balm \nor salve, and received instead a solution. He, with his expertise, knew \nhow to maneuver between these two giants, and what was in some ways my \nmost difficult day in the Senate became, with Trent's help, one of the \nbetter days I experienced in the Senate, as I watched these two clash \ntogether, with me on the sidelines, staying out of it because of his \nhelp. He taught me again: Don't get yourself into that kind of problem \nin the first place.\n  Finally, emotions run high around here. People get all wrapped up in \nthe issue of the time. We had one of those, where some members of the \nRepublican conference deserted leadership and there was a sense of \ngreat anger. Some people were talking about retaliation. Trent taught \nme this great truth. He said: The most important vote is the next one. \nDo not allow your concern over that vote to damage your relationship \nthat you may need on the next vote.\n  Those among us of the Republican conference who wanted to retaliate--\nTrent did his best to say to them: No, don't carry that grudge, don't \ncarry that forward. Understand, the most important vote is the next \nvote.\n  Those were the three things I wanted to highlight that I have learned \nfrom Trent. But I want to point out that he himself, when the blow \nfell--as Senator Specter has said, in a vastly overblown reaction to an \nappropriate comment--he himself demonstrated in his own life his \ncommitment to those principles. He did not allow anything that had \nhappened as a result of that to destroy his relationships, the \nfriendships he had built. Even if there were some who could have been \nattacked for having abandoned him, he did not attack those \nrelationships. He did not show any desire to retaliate. He may have \nfelt it. Indeed, he would not be human if he didn't. But he came back \nto the Senate with his optimism showing, his determination to stay \ncalm, his determination to stay engaged and not allow a sense of \nrevenge or retaliation to take him over. That, of course, served him in \ngood stead when he was returned to leadership by the same massive \nmajority that he had when he took the whip's job the first time--by 1 \nvote.\n  This is a man we shall miss. This is a man who has taught us a lot. \nThis is a man who served as a mentor to me, and because of him, I now \nown a pair of white bucks.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, once upon a time in the spring of \n1968, even before Ted Stevens was a Senator, a young man with carefully \ncombed hair came from Pascagoula, MS, to Washington, DC, and he moved \ninto a spare bedroom in the house at the corner of Klingle Street and \nFoxhall Road.\n  It was almost 40 years ago. I remember it very well, because I was \nalready in that house along with four other single young men in our \n20s. Our new resident from Mississippi was different in several ways \nthan the rest of us. No. 1, we were single, and he was married. Tricia \nand Chet, then a baby, were still back in Mississippi. No. 2, he was a \nDemocrat and we were Republicans. But at that age, that did not matter \nto us very much.\n  And No. 3 is--and this is hard for anyone in the Chamber to imagine, \nfor me even to say--I remember him as quiet.\n  Maybe it was because he did not stay long, because he remembers that \nwe were noisy--playing the piano, staying up late, as he said \nyesterday, having parties, and then getting up at 6 a.m. in the morning \nand going to work.\n  So for whatever reason, maybe because of those differences, our \nfriend from Mississippi moved out after a few months. Tricia and Chet \ncame to Washington, I believe, and he continued his job with Mr. \nColmer, the Congressman, from the area where he grew up.\n  My other roommate was Glover Robert, who was from Gulfport and who \nhad introduced us all to Trent, and who later was Trent's campaign \nmanager in his race for Congress. I can remember Glover saying at that \ntime that everybody in Mississippi knows Trent Lott is one of two young \nmen in Mississippi who is going to grow up to be Governor of \nMississippi. The other young man who Glover talked about was Thad \nCochran, who we also met that year in 1968. He was also a Democrat in \n1968. Neither of them grew up to be Governor of Mississippi, at least \nnot yet. But one became the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, \nand one became the leader of the Senate, and both are our friends.\n  Now Trent, after 35 years in Congress, is moving on to the next \nchapter of his life. I understand his decision. We talked about it. As \nfar as anyone can say from outside the Lott family, it looks like a \nwise decision on a personal basis. But on a personal basis too, I am \ntruly sorry to see him go, because over those 40 years, we have been in \ndifferent places most of the time--I mostly in Tennessee, he mostly \nhere--but we have stayed in touch in many different ways.\n  When our roommates got together at the Governor's mansion in \nTennessee in the 1980s, I remember reading to the group after dinner \nfrom a book on manners. When I came to the Senate, I received a book, \n``George Washington's Rules of Civility,'' that was inscribed, ``To my \nfriend, Senator Alexander, the history professor, Trent Lott.''\n  In 1986, I became a little bit exasperated with the House Republicans \nfrom a distance and I called up Trent and said: What is going on? Are \nwe Republican Governors and the House Republicans on the same page? He \nintroduced me to Newt Gingrich, and a group of the Governors and the \nRepublican leaders in the House met at Blackberry Farm in the Smoky \nMountains for a whole weekend and had a terrific weekend, in terms of \ncharting the future course for our party.\n  A few years later I came to Washington as Education Secretary and \nimmediately turned to Trent--who was always in some sort of leadership \nposition, usually some different one--for advice and support.\n  Those who follow the Senate know that Trent has, along the way, \ntaught all of us various lessons. He has especially taught me lessons, \nparticularly how to count. It is because of Trent\n\n[[Page S15803]]\n\nLott that a year ago, it was necessary for me to write 27 thank-you \nnotes for 24 votes in the race for whip. I have worked hard to learn my \nlesson from him over a period of time.\n  About 6 weeks ago, Trent and Tricia invited my wife Honey, me, and \nthe Greggs down to their home outside Jackson. We spent a weekend. It \nwas following up a nice weekend we had had in the mountains of \nTennessee sometime earlier. Most of the remarks today about Trent have \nbeen about Trent in Washington, DC and they are all very appropriate. \nAnd here in the Senate we often think of Trent as having the wiliness \nof Lyndon Johnson and the joyfulness of Hubert Humphrey--two other \ngreat figures in Senate history--but it is more fun to see him in \nMississippi. Going through the airport, every single woman in the \nairport in Mississippi wanted to talk to Trent Lott, and he talked to \nthem all of the way through the Jackson airport.\n  To see the number of buildings in Mississippi already named after \nhim--and he is not even dead yet--and to see the beautiful home they \nhave outside Jackson, MS is something to behold. Judd and I counted \nfive different tractors in his garage, and we rode in most of them. We \nshould have known, or I should have known, from seeing how happy he is \nthere and how much he loves to do this, that his mind was probably more \non becoming farmer of the year in Mississippi than it was on spending \nanother 5 or 10 years in the Senate.\n  Trent, transitions--I have had a number of them--are not always easy, \nbut they have been for me the most rewarding parts of my life. I \nbelieve for you and Tricia this next transition will be the same--\nliberating, not entirely easy, but perhaps the most rewarding period of \nyour life.\n  I tried to think of some words that would describe it, and I thought \nof words that better describe the Smoky Mountains where I am from than \nthe Mississippi area where you are from. But the thought still applies. \nThey are words from Emily Dickinson, which say:\n\n       Goodbye to the life I used to lead and the friends I used \n     to know. Now kiss these hills just once for me, for I am \n     ready to go.\n\n  It is a reassurance for us to know that you are not going far. I hope \nit will be reassuring to you to know that you are not going far, that \nyour old friends are still here and we are still your friends.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, let me note--it has probably been noted \nhere on the floor already--that it is so much nicer to hear your eulogy \nin person than afterward. In many ways you know it is more heartfelt \nbecause the Senator from Mississippi is here and has the ability to \ncorrect it, something he would not have 40 years or so from now when he \nmight rejoin his Maker.\n  I think, though, about Trent Lott. Trent is one of those Senators who \nhas great respect on both sides of the aisle. I think it is because he \nis from the old school. I do not want to damage his reputation in \nMississippi to have one of the more liberal members of the opposite \nparty praise him, but I do it easily. Because, as I told Trent within \nan hour after he made his announcement--we were on the phone, and I \ntold him that one of the things I liked about him is he followed that \nrule Mike Mansfield told me my first week here in the Senate: Senators \nshould always keep their word. Every time Senator Lott and I have \nworked together, to find our way, sometimes through a very tangled \nparliamentary or legislative morass, we got through because I could \nalways count on him once he made a commitment to keep his word and he \nwould keep his commitment. I think he knows I did the same with him. As \nSenator Mansfield tried to instruct all of us, those of us who were \nhere at that time, this is the mark of what a real Senator should do. \nBecause while you may disagree on one issue, you are going to be allies \nthe next day on a different issue. And that is what makes the Senate \nwork best.\n  Marcelle and I have had the opportunity to travel with Trent and \nTrish, and I must admit this is a great deal of fun. I think he even \nhas some of the photographs I have given him from some of those trips. \nAs they have told me in Vermont, on occasions when he came up, a number \nof Vermonters came up to me afterward and said, ``Boy, the Senator from \nMississippi is really good looking.'' I said: ``Well, yes, he is.'' \n``He has got all of that hair.'' I said, ``Yes, he does.'' And they \nsaid, ``He can really sing well.'' And I said, ``I do not need to talk \nwith you anymore.''\n  They would go on. Those trips--and I will close with this--one of the \nreasons why more of us should take such trips, bipartisan trips, is you \nfind that you have so many things in common. Trish and Marcelle would \ntalk about children and their hopes for them growing up. All four of us \nwould talk about the difficulties in maintaining homes in our home \nState and in Washington, and doing it if you are not wealthy. We would \ntalk about those things where we felt the Senate should come together. \nWe talked about our backgrounds, our faith, our hopes for this country. \nI think somebody listening in would have been hard pressed to know \nwhich one was the Democrat and which one was the Republican.\n  I have served all these years with Trent Lott. I will miss him as a \ncolleague, but I might say I will miss him especially as a friend.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, my State, like many States, has produced \nsome political giants: Lyndon Johnson, Phil Gramm, John Tower, many \ngreat political figures. But one I recall specifically: Bob Bullock, a \nDemocratic Lieutenant Governor in what was generally considered the \nmost powerful political position in State government. I remember one \ntime he said that there are two types of politicians: one who wants to \nbe somebody, and the other who wants to do something. Most decidedly, \nTrent Lott is of the latter category.\n  I have heard comments today about his great ability to compromise. I \nthink compromise is in and of itself overrated. Compromising with \nprinciple, looking for common ground while staying true to your \nconvictions and your principles, is an art and one that Trent Lott has \npracticed throughout his congressional career.\n  Since the foundation of our Nation, Congress has been the workplace \nfor many men and women who have come from modest beginnings and who \ntook it upon themselves to shoulder great responsibilities. They have \nundertaken the noble yet difficult work of governing in the best \ninterests of the American people. This has always been the defining \ncharacteristic of our country. In Lincoln's phrase: Government of the \npeople, by the people, and for the people. This year, after more than \nthree decades of public service in the Congress, we bid farewell to a \nman who has embodied this notion.\n  Trent Lott from Pascagoula, MS, always took to heart his \nresponsibility as a representative of the State and he has never lost \ntouch with his roots. We have heard reference to his memoir, ``Herding \nCats,'' which I told him, after reading it: It was surprisingly good. \nHe said: Why were you surprised? I said: I am not going to go there. It \nwas surprisingly good.\n  But he answered one particular critic in his memoirs by saying: I \nascended to the leadership of the Senate because I was from the \nMagnolia State. I found this to be a telling statement about a man who \nnot only represented his State's interests but sought to represent its \ncharacter and was literally impelled to public service.\n  As we know, he served Mississippi in both the House of \nRepresentatives and the Senate, in the majority and minority, through \nthe administrations of seven Presidents. He has experienced just about \neverything a life in politics has to offer--the good, the bad, and the \nugly. When his beloved home State was hit by a natural disaster named \nKatrina, he made it his top priority to see that the people of \nMississippi were shepherded through the most difficult of times. \nThroughout his life and service, Senator Lott has served his home of \nMississippi with unflinching resolve. His principled and dedicated \nservice has earned him a national reputation as a strong leader. His \nfervent desire to solve some of our Nation's biggest problems has put \nhim at the forefront of national politics.\n  Trent has always sought to find common ground on important \nlegislation, and there is no doubt in my mind his absence will be \nprofoundly felt. But as many have already observed, Senator Lott has \npaid his dues. He has\n\n[[Page S15804]]\n\ndone his time. He has served his State. He served his country. So while \nit is with sadness we say goodbye to a colleague and a statesman and, \nmost importantly, a friend, it is with great joy that I wish Senator \nLott the best of luck in the next stage of his life.\n  Trent, thank you for everything you have done for our country, for \nthe Senate, this great institution, and for everything I have learned \nfrom your example. I know you and Tricia have a bright future ahead, \nand I know you especially look forward to spending more time with your \nchildren and grandchildren. We wish you the very best.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise to say a few words about the \nretirement of my friend and colleague, Senator Trent Lott. Trent has \nvisited Colorado. However, he complained he was kept busy and couldn't \nappreciate Colorado's vistas. Now he will have time to appreciate the \ngreat State of Colorado, and I invite him to revisit us because he will \nhave time.\n  Trent was majority leader when I came to the Senate in 1997. A large \npercentage of the views I have of how this body should work and how we \ncan best come together, despite differences of opinions and goals, was \nformed watching Trent Lott shepherd through legislation organizing 100 \ncompeting agendas into a manageable schedule. I have always felt we \nwere sent here by the people of our States to solve problems and \nachieve results. I know ideas can and do vary as to what solutions are \nor even what the problems are. That makes the end goal of finding \nsolutions most of us can agree to that much harder and the skills \nrequired to do so much more rare. The Senate has been lucky to have \nTrent in our midst as we worked through the pressing issues of these \ntimes.\n  It should be noted Trent has done his work here, all the while \nremaining a genuinely decent man and a true gentleman. He is, everyone \nagrees, a fundamentally nice person who enjoys the human contact and \npersonal relationships that come with his position. He enjoys working \non behalf of the people of Mississippi. He has represented their \ninterests well, and they have made it clear they approve of his \nservice.\n  Trent attended Pascagoula Junior High, which is now called Trent Lott \nMiddle School. He is truly an example for future Americans to emulate. \nI join my colleagues in thanking Trent and his wife Tricia for their \nservice and thank God for providing him to public service in the \nSenate, where I personally know of his service.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I rise to pay great tribute to Trent Lott. \nSimilar to so many on the floor, I felt compelled, had a great desire \nto come to the floor because of my deep respect and affection for \nTrent. I mean that.\n  It is probably a great testament to Trent, given those very deep and \nsincere feelings of mine, to remember how we were introduced \npolitically. I was running for Congress and he endorsed my opponent. \nFor a lot of people, it would have meant that person would never have \nbuilt a strong working relationship with the other or it would have \ntaken a long time. For Trent, it took about 5 minutes. After I won, he \ncalled me and congratulated me and explained that my opponent was a \nformer colleague of his and a friend and he felt loyalty and affection \nfor the person. But the past was the past and the future was the future \nand he wanted to build that same friendship and sense of loyalty with \nme. So that was that.\n  It wasn't just words. He put that into action and made it perfectly \nclear from the beginning he was sincere. That is Trent. That is \nprobably the first and one of the most important lessons he imparted to \nme.\n  I will always feel privileged to have learned other lessons in two \nparticular settings. One, I was honored to be asked to join his whip \nteam over the last couple years, and I did so. I have learned an \nenormous amount as a member of that team. I will always remember his \nbeing very forthcoming in asking me for advice and ideas and what I \nthought about this or that, all the while paying compliments about my \ninsight into things. I will remember it not because any of those \ncompliments were true but because it showed his spirit and \neffectiveness at including people, getting the best out of them and \nbringing folks together.\n  As a member of his whip team, I will also always remember and \nappreciate his taking me under his wing and trying to help me develop \nrelationships and friendships with other Senators more and, as he would \nput it, be able to ``schmooze'' more effectively. I hope, Trent, you \ncontinue your work with me, as you join the private sector because \nobviously we still have a long way to go. But I appreciate the spirit \nof that work.\n  The second setting that is so important, in terms of my personal \nexperience with Trent is, of course, the experience of Katrina and \ndealing with that horrible hurricane. There couldn't have been allies \nin terms of our recovery work than Trent and Thad. I will always be \ndeeply indebted to them for all their work on behalf of the entire gulf \ncoast. In south Louisiana, occasionally in the press there would be \nsome story or comment resentful toward Mississippi in terms of the \nrecovery, saying they got this per capita and we got this; we didn't do \nwell enough. I would always explain that, boy, they got it exactly \nwrong. Because our best allies throughout all that horrible experience \nwere Trent and Thad. Were it not for them, we would not have fared \nnearly as well. I will be the first to admit that. I thank them on \nbehalf of my State for their tireless efforts on behalf of the entire \ngulf coast.\n  So, Trent, I join everyone in wishing you and Tricia and your family \nall the best. You deserve it. I know this is not the end of anything. \nIt is the beginning of new great things. I look forward to our \ncontinuing tutorials on schmoozing and maybe even getting me to wear a \nseersucker suit someday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, those of us who come from the South \ntake great pride in our heritage. Part of the heritage we are very \nproud of is the fact that whether it is the State of Mississippi that \nsent John Stennis and Senator Eastland to this body or whether it is my \nState that sent Richard Russell and Paul Coverdell and Sam Nunn, we are \nvery proud of the folks we have sent to the Senate. Come January, we \nare going to add the name of Trent Lott to those great men who have \nrepresented the South in this body.\n  When I think of Trent Lott, I think about something that a lot of \npeople probably can't relate to, but he and Thad will directly relate \nto. Trent is the epitome of the genteel southern gentleman, married to \na beautiful belle with whom he went to college.\n  In the fall in Oxford, MS, there is a special occasion that takes \nplace on football Saturday afternoons. They have a place down there \ncalled the Grove that is unlike any other area I have ever been to on \nany football afternoon. The Grove is what one might think. It is truly \na beautiful spot with trees and green grass. All the University of \nMississippi football fans gather in the Grove and, instead of backing \nup SUVs and pickup trucks with beer kegs on the back, as we do in \nAthens, they pull out silver goblets, white tablecloths, chandeliers on \nthe table, and they enjoy a great festive atmosphere. Trent Lott brings \nthat same gentility, that same mannerism of our part of the world to \nthe Senate.\n  A couple of quick personal anecdotes that somewhat relate to that. \nTrent has a way of being able to look at somebody and, whether it is \ntrying to figure out how they are going to vote, what they are feeling \nlike that day or whatever it may be, boy, he can get right to the heart \nof it. I am reminded of when I was thinking about running for the \nSenate back in 2002. Trent came to me in the summer of that year. I \nremember this conversation like it was yesterday.\n  He said: Look, I know they are working on you to run for the Senate. \nYou and I have been good friends for several years during your House \ndays. I don't think you have got the fire in the belly. Unless you do, \nyou better not run.\n  He was exactly right. About 6 months after that, he came to me again \nand said: I have heard you speak more and more about what you want to \ndo, and you have the fire in the belly. It is the time to run.\n  The other anecdote I will never forget about Trent is that during my\n\n[[Page S15805]]\n\ncampaign, we had a farm bill we had finished in conference. It was a \nlate farm bill that year. It was in the early spring of 2002. I needed \nto be all over my State campaigning. Unfortunately, I got stuck in \nWashington for a weekend with the farm bill conference. Trent was \ncoming to Georgia to campaign for me. I told him: Trent, I am not going \nto be able to go. I feel bad about this. He said: Don't worry about it. \nStay here and do what you have to do. Julianne and I will take care of \nthis.\n  So he went to Georgia, spent the whole day traveling around to five \ndifferent events in different parts of my State, drew big crowds \nbecause he was Trent Lott.\n  He called me up on Sunday morning when he got back and said: Saxby, I \ngot this thing figured out. I know how you are going to win this \ncampaign. What you need to do is stay in Washington and let Julianne \nand me take care of that campaign for you.\n  Trent is one of those people whom those of us junior Senators looked \nup to from day one. As I think back on my class, Lindsey and a couple \nof us served in the House together, where we got to know Trent. But \nwhether it was Elizabeth or Norm or Lamar or others in our class, from \nday one, Trent has been one of those individuals whom we admired so \ngreatly because of his knowledge of the institution, because of his \nability to come to you when you knew you were struggling with an issue. \nHe could talk to you for 2 minutes and all of a sudden you would feel \nbetter about whatever it was you were struggling with. That is the kind \nof person Trent Lott is and that is the part about Trent Lott I truly \nam going to miss.\n  His office happens to be right around the corner from mine. There is \nmany a day we will be on the elevator together going back after a vote. \nHe will start picking at me about something. He will say: I know you \nhave been worried about something. What is it? Invariably, again, he is \nright. He has had the ability to say a couple words that all of a \nsudden changed my perspective on whatever the issue was I was \nstruggling with.\n\n  So, Trent, we are mighty proud of you as a Southerner. We are mighty \nproud of you as an American. And we are certainly mighty proud of you \nas a Member of this body. You are truly going to be missed. But I \ntreasure the last 13 years of having the privilege of serving with you \nin my House days as well as my Senate days.\n  God bless you, and may God bless your family.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I appreciate so many of these remarks. I \nwould like to say a few things about Trent.\n  I think Trent's strength, first, is his roots. He knows where he came \nfrom. He knows how he was raised. He is loyal to his constituents and \nhis people. He loves the people of Mississippi, and they love him. If \nhe chose to move to Alabama and run for the Senate, he would be a \nwinner there. He is well known in our State. He used to have a \ntelevision program with the three Congressmen from that region, the \n``Gulf Coast Report.'' It went for 35 years. It ended last year. He \nstarted that with former Congressman Jack Edward of Mobile and it had \nsuch a tremendous following. In fact, it was front-page news in Alabama \nwhen Trent Lott announced his retirement.\n  Secondly, Trent was at the forefront of what clearly has been a \nhistorical movement of mainstream Republican thought in the South. It \nhas been a trend that has been steady and strong and has shaped the \nNation. It ended up helping provide a Republican majority in the House \nand the Senate to accomplish things that would not have been \naccomplished otherwise.\n  I am not that much younger than Trent, but I remember when he made \nthat fateful decision to run for Congress as a Republican in \nMississippi. Those of us who were following politics at that time knew \nhis decision was an important one. We young Republicans, throughout the \nSouth in particular, all watched with tremendous interest to see \nwhether he would be successful. He and Thad both were successful that \nyear. It was a movement of significant historical importance because \nmany have followed his path.\n  Trent has had an incredibly wise way of dealing with people. I \nremember sitting right over here, having not been here long, and a very \nimportant bill was on the floor. A very critical amendment was being \ndecided, an amendment, if it had gone the wrong way, could have \nderailed the entire legislation. I had reasons to vote against it, but \nI had not made up my mind. There were a lot of reasons I could have \nvoted against it. Some good friends were on the other side. He sidled \nup to me, and all he said was: Look at old Phil. This is his first big \nbill on the floor. It would be a shame to see him lose that bill.\n  (Laughter.)\n  He did not say any more. Those simple words touched my concerns, and \nI thought about them for a day and a half before I decided to vote with \nPhil and Trent. He had a gift to sense your concerns, to know where \nmembers were.\n  I will mention two other things I think were of historical \nimportance.\n  We could not agree on how to handle the impeachment. Trent was the \nleader of the Senate. The Senate was supposed to try the House charge \nof impeachment. The Chief Justice who sat back here off the floor was \nasked: What procedures shall we use, Mr. Chief Justice? He leaned back \nin his chair and said: Well, it is the Senate's job to figure out how \nto conduct the impeachment trial. That is what the Constitution says. \nIt is your problem, not mine. And still we could not agree.\n  Trent thought and worried and did everything he could possibly do to \nreach an agreement on procedure. That agreement could not be reached, \nso he took an unprecedented step of calling the Senate together in the \nOld Senate Chamber. Do you remember that? That is when we had, what \nTrent called, the great epiphany when Ted Kennedy and Phil Gramm spoke \nup and an agreement was reached. We did not embarrass the Senate. We \ndid our duty. We followed through successfully. We met the \nconstitutional responsibility we had. He was creative in trying to \nimpress on us the importance of reaching that decision.\n  I can think of another one from the Republican side. In our movement \nin 2001 to reduce taxes the vote was close, with every single vote \ncritical. Senator Domenici was the Budget chairman at that time, and I \nbelieve the critical vote was over the budget reconciliation. Trent \ncalled a meeting of the Republicans in the Senate Chaplain's office.\n  (Laughter.)\n  The room has a high arched ceiling--so I guess we had a prayer \nmeeting up there. You could look down the Mall and see the Washington \nMonument. Such a location had never been used before or since. There \nwere a couple of votes Trent had to have. He knew; he could count \nvotes. Maybe there was just one vote he had to have. So that meeting \nwas orchestrated carefully, and it worked. Our tax cuts passed, with \nevery vote crucial and ultimately on the floor the vote was a 50-50 \ntie, with the Vice President breaking the tie. For 10 years, however, \nwe will have had tremendous tax relief for Americans. It has surged our \neconomy.\n  Without a truly skilled leader in both those instances, this Senate \ncould have gone the other way and the history of our country quite \ndifferently.\n  I have enjoyed my friendship with Trent Lott and Tricia. I think he \nis a fabulous leader who has done remarkable things for our country. It \nhas been an honor to serve with him.\n  If you come to Alabama, you can have my Senate seat, Trent.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Trent, this is the time, on an occasion like this, where \nsomebody always rises and says: Whatever could be said about this \nsubject has been said, it is just that everybody has not said it yet. \nBut in this case, it is not true. We have only been talking for 2 hours \n7 minutes. It would take a lot longer than 2 hours 7 minutes to say all \nthe things that could be said about your distinguished career.\n  But there are two things I wish to say, the two most powerful words \nin the English language: Thank you--first, on behalf of the late Paul \nCoverdell and his lovely wife Nancy.\n  I will never forget in March of 1993 meeting Paul--as I had for 20 \nyears, as I led the Georgia House and he led the\n\n[[Page S15806]]\n\nGeorgia Senate--at the International House of Pancakes in Buckhead at 7 \na.m., his first time back in Georgia after being sworn in. I had him \ntell me about the place known as the Senate. All he could talk about \nwas Trent Lott. He said: Johnny, Trent Lott has the two Ls. He can \nlegislate and he can lead.\n  So on behalf of Paul, whose legislation--the Coverdell Education Act, \nand many other things--was done here, thank you for what you did for \nhim. I know you always have shared with me how much you appreciate what \n``Mikey'' did for you.\n  But, secondly, Trent, thank you on my behalf. If every one of us in \nthis room stood up and thought about it, we could take a specific \nincident that in our career has been accomplished that would not have \nhappened were it not for your insight, your leadership, and your \ncommitment.\n  For me, it was the pension bill last year and the pension of 91,000 \nDelta employees in Georgia. We got down to the lick log, as they say in \nGeorgia, on the last day, in the last hour before the August recess. \nBankruptcy was pending, and it was almost over. Thanks to your tenacity \non Finance and your care and your willingness to be able to do what you \ndid, that legislation passed. I got the credit, but the benefit belongs \nto you.\n  Thank you for what you have done for all of us.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to my friend, my \nencourager, my mentor. Mae West once said: Marriage is a fine \ninstitution, but I am not ready yet for an institution.\n  Reflecting on the comments of my colleague from Georgia, I think when \nwe get here, I don't know how many of us are ready for the institution. \nWhat I had--and what I know my other colleagues had--in Trent Lott was \nsomebody who put his arm around you. He shared with you the importance \nof your word is your bond, the importance of family--more than things \nyou can read in a rules manual or a procedural manual but the history \nof the heart and the soul of the institution, embodied by my friend and \nmy encourager, Trent Lott.\n  This Chamber has been home to some of the great statesmen in American \nhistory. I say this not with hyperbole or superlatives, but I say it as \na matter of established fact: that among the great statesmen in the \nhistory of this country, one is sitting in this Chamber today, who will \nmove on to do other great things, I am sure.\n  Similar to me, he governs from the bank of the Mississippi. It is a \nlittle colder where I come from, the State I represent. But he is an \noutstanding representative of the heartland, the heart and soul of \nAmerica.\n  On my way to the Senate complex, as I walk through, I sometimes stop \nand take a look at the words that are written in one of the office \nbuildings by Everett McKinley Dirksen. I wish to read these words \nbecause this is inscribed on the wall: ``His unerring sense of the \npossible that enabled him to know when to compromise; by such men are \nour freedoms retained.'' Such a tribute belongs to Trent Lott.\n  Freedom requires that we all express our views strongly and to do \nthat on the floor. But in the end, you need those who can knit \ntogether, who can craft legislation. We all have stories of being in \nTrent's presence and watching him do that. He truly is today's current \nmaster of the Senate. He understands the art of what it takes to get \nthings done.\n  Some of us have said the worst sin in politics is not knowing how to \ncount. If that is the case, then Trent is pure as the driven snow \nbecause he knows how to count. And not only knowing how to count, what \nhe does is use that in a way to kind of guide us to ultimately get \nthings done. That is what it is about.\n  I believe what we are suffering from in this country today is a deep \npartisan divide. So the American public looks at and wonders about our \nability to do what we have been elected to do. If there is somebody \ntoday who has the antidote to that infection, it is Trent Lott. Because \nin the end, that is what he strives to do.\n  We all have our stories. I served on the conference committee on \nhomeland security to reshape the way in which we do intelligence, to \nlook at somehow getting rid of the silos that were problematic on 9/11 \nthat the 9/11 Commission talked about, and to figure out a way to put \ntogether a system of gathering intelligence which works together, is \nseamless.\n  I watched time and again, when it seemed like we were not going to \nget it done--and it was not, by the way, partisan; it was not just \nDemocrat versus Republican; sometimes it was House versus Senate--and I \ncan tell you, almost every time, on every occasion--and Chairman \nCollins could tell you the same thing, and Ranking Member Lieberman \ncould tell you the same thing--at the moment you needed that, where it \nseemed like it was not going to get done, the voice that arose was the \ngentleman from Pascagoula, the Senator from Mississippi, who would \noffer a little something that would kind of pull us back together and \nmove us forward. In the end, we passed the bill. The Nation is better \nfor it.\n  I had the opportunity earlier this year to be honored with Senator \nLott by the Ripon Society, with the Theodore Roosevelt Rough Rider \nAward. That is, by the way, the progressive wing of the Republican \nParty. Trent got up there, when he received his honor, and said: Before \nI got here, I used to be called a conservative.\n  He is still a conservative, a principled conservative. But the reason \nhe was recognized by the Ripon Society--and I think by folks regardless \nof what side of the aisle they are on, what side of the political \nspectrum they are on--is because of his incredible ability to find \ncommon ground, to pull people together.\n  In Minnesota, we all know of the Scandinavian who loved his wife so \nmuch he almost told her. There are many in this institution who care so \nmuch they almost get something done. But Trent Lott is one of those who \nboth cares so much and he gets things done.\n  I thank the Lott family for sharing him with our Nation. I know the \nfoundation of Trent's service is commitment to freedom, to faith, and \nto family. That is about as solid a foundation as one could have. That \nis something this first-term Senator has seen, has appreciated, and \ncarries in his heart.\n  I thank him for his lifetime of service to all Americans. I ask that \nGod continue to bless Trent, Tricia, and the Lott family.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, there are others seeking to be recognized \nand I shall be brief. But I think of my good friend in many ways, not \nthe least of which, we are two Senators who stood in the well in kilts \nwith our knobby knees showing and voted--to the astonishment of all our \ncolleagues.\n  You have helped me through the years in many ways, particularly on \nthe Defense bill. You have served on the committee. When that bill was \ndogged, disparaged, cast aside, you always were there to bring it back, \nsometimes six or seven times in the course of the spring, until we were \nable to pass it, always, always being guided by your heart and your \nconcern for the men and women who wear the uniforms and their families.\n\n  But I wish to speak of you in a very personal way. We had our \ndifferences in elections. Like Bob Bennett, I was on the Alan Simpson \nteam. I remember sitting in your office discussing that and voting for \nSimpson. You won, but you never held it against me or Bob or others. \nThat is the way you managed this institution.\n  But I think back on my own career, insignificant as it is, and I \nreflect on the fact that I have been privileged to serve with 271 \nSenators in the 29 years that I have been privileged to serve. My dear \nfriend Thad Cochran and I have that record together as we came to the \nSenate in the fall of 1968.\n  What I didn't know about the Senate--and surprisingly, I had the \nopportunity as Secretary of the Navy to come here for 5 years and \ntestify many times and to come and respond to the calls of Members who, \nfor whatever reason, wanted to talk to the Secretary about their \nparticular problems--I never realized how all-consuming this body would \nbe in terms of it becomes your family, they are your friends, and those \nbonds continuously grow year after year. When one Member is celebrating \nexhilaration, accomplishments,\n\n[[Page S15807]]\n\nbe they on the floor of the Senate or be they in private life or \nwhatever the case may be--winning an election, as Thad and I have done \nfive consecutive times--you share those moments. But you also share the \nmoments when a Member is faced with despair.\n  They often say the fall may be painful, but the road back is doubly \nchallenging. I have watched you in those situations, and the strength \nthat you and your lovely wife exhibited has been instilled in me. I \npray to God that I never face some of the challenges that faced you: \nthe devastation brought to your State, your graceful stepdown from the \nleadership, and your comeback, your magnificent and courageous \nrestoration of your career in full--I say to you, Senator--in full. You \nmade a tough decision, as I have done, not to return to this body and \nto our dear friends, but you did it on solid ground, and all of us join \nin our hopes that in your next challenge in life, you will make a \ncontribution to this country you love, to the State you love, and to \nthe Senate you love. Thank you for your friendship.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, this statement comes from the back row \nbut no less love from us back-benchers. Let me tell you the Senate \ncareer that, for me, now completes 3 years has known no better friend \nthan Trent Lott. I have certainly appreciated your willingness to \nmentor me. I was astonished to hear that Bob Bennett considered you a \nmentor. I thought you did that for those of us who have just gotten \nhere but, frankly, it looks as though you mentored about everybody in \nthe Senate. So I consider myself very fortunate.\n  I think back to when we first met. I was first here in Washington as \nSecretary of Housing and Urban Development, and Trent was the leader, \nthe Republican leader of the Senate. We had occasion to meet, and \nshortly thereafter we were building a habitat for humanity house on a \ncold day, much like today, and I got the opportunity to know him on a \nmore personal level and get to know Tricia as well. That has only \nendured and continued. I also very much appreciated you shepherding my \nnomination as HUD Secretary through the Senate, which I know was no \neasy lift, but you have my gratitude, in fact, then and now.\n  But, to me, as I look at my short career in the Senate, there was no \nissue that punctuates my time more than the very divisive issue of \nimmigration. You didn't need to get involved in that--you really \ndidn't. I know a lot of people in Mississippi probably wish you hadn't. \nThe fact is, you saw a problem that needed solving. I remember you \nsaying: Is there a problem? In fact, there was. And does this bill \nimprove the situation from what it is today? And you said that it did, \nwhich I agreed with. Then you went on about trying to solve the \nproblem, which is a quality that I greatly admire. You were moving the \nball forward. You were trying to do what in your heart you felt was \nbest for the Nation and something that would, in fact, move the ball \nforward and get it done. So you courageously worked, I know, sometimes \nagainst the grain. But I, for one, would rather have no one in a \nfoxhole than Trent Lott during difficult times when they are lobbing \nthem in at you.\n  So I very much appreciated the fact that you taught me a great deal \nin that difficult time, but also throughout my time in the Senate. I \nvery much thank you for taking an interest in me and in my career, and \nI very much thank you for what you have done for our Nation and for \nyour State.\n  As I look forward, my Senate career will be diminished by not having \nthe opportunity to continue to work and learn from you, but I am \ngrateful for the time I have had and what I have learned by your side. \nThank you very much for your service and all the best to you and \nTricia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, let me first say of Senator Lott I must \nmake a slight confession. You know I am leaving next year, and one of \nthe reasons I am leaving is because I have an ailment that has an \nimpact on my brain. I say that in all honesty. I already told the whole \nworld that. The point of that is I have difficulty remembering some \nthings. I still am a pretty good Senator, so nobody is fighting about \nthat. I just know that you and I have gone through some incredible \nlegal situations, legislative situations, and I am trying to pull them \nup now in the next few minutes just to share them with you and to share \nthem with everybody here.\n  I have been here 36 years, which is a little bit longer than Trent, \nand that is six elections. You must know that I was in the middle of a \nlot of things or I couldn't have been here 36 years. I am not a back-\nbencher or an under-the-tabler. I am where the action is, and I lucked \nout on the committee that did a lot of exciting things.\n  One of the things Trent Lott has taught me about leadership is that \nit is quiet. It takes place without you knowing it is happening. That \nis what you did. When we had to put together the votes for the balanced \nbudget and for the reconciliation tax bill, which was one of the most \nmonumental acts, and we had to use that Budget Act drafted by the \ndistinguished Senator Byrd and he didn't quite think we would be able \nto use it the way we did, and we had that battle and we won that on a \nvote, then we were using it to reconcile tax cuts for America. It is \nhard to explain, when you would get everybody around and then you would \nsay: We are almost there, but we are not there. And here I am, I have \nbeen working on it forever, and we have this very unique process, and \nwe just have to get the votes. We can't come back a second time on this \nkind of thing. We will get killed. It has to go right now. He would say \nwe are one vote short or two, and you just knew that it was going to \nhappen. He knew what was there, and when he would tell us to go, we \nwould go, and sure enough, that is how it happened.\n\n  So I have had all kinds of situations, from the huge balanced budget, \nto--I remember when we reformed welfare. Many of these things came from \nthe budget process, the way I used it on behalf of the Senate. We put \nin the numbers so that you couldn't avoid--if you did the welfare \nreform, you would get the protection of the budget. And I can remember \nthat was an exciting day because it all of a sudden became bipartisan.\n  Do you recall, Trent, that it didn't end up with just us; it was \nthem. They came to the party, and so ultimately did the President. It \nwas one great big party. But it was also, in the end, absolutely \nimperative that we had the reconciliation instruction that came with it \nthat Senator Lott--he wouldn't fuss with me. He wouldn't ask me to \nprove it. He would just say: Is that the way it is? I would tell him \nyes. And he said: Well, that is what we will do.\n  It was just terrific to be a chairman of important matters and have a \nleader like Trent who would say: If that is what it takes, that is what \nwe are going to do. We didn't redo it or rethink it because it got \ntough. Many times the path I chose was probably the harder one. He \nwould say: If that is the way we are going to do it, we are going to do \nit. It was rather terrific to be part of a team like that.\n  Now, I want to tell you, it works both ways because Trent Lott was on \nthe opposite side of something very important when he was over in the \nHouse. We did a Social Security change here to permanently fix Social \nSecurity--we thought--and Trent--we heard from over in the House that \nthe rocks and the stones weren't coming from the Democrats.\n  We said: Where are they coming from?\n  They said: They are coming from Trent Lott.\n  I said: Well, maybe I have to go over there and talk with him.\n  Then I said: Well, maybe I won't. Maybe I will just let him stew.\n  It was something Reagan was for and we were for, but his little team \nwasn't for. I think they were right. I think we made a mistake. But we \ndidn't do that. We didn't get it done. Do you remember, Trent? It died. \nYou were over there and, clearly, you knew what you were doing, and I \ndon't think you liked it very much because it was Republicans against \nRepublicans.\n  But we did get back together, and for the one angst we had many \nmemorable pluses that are just terrific when it comes to thinking back \non the life of the Senator over a complicated, tough period of time, \nwhen we learned how to use a Budget Act for innumerable\n\n[[Page S15808]]\n\nthings. In fact, the Budget Act was used, over a period of 16 years, by \nme, as chairman, with my staff, as an instrument beyond which anybody \never thought it would be used. It changed how we functioned as a Senate \nbecause it permitted us to do things through the reconciliation process \nthat were absolutely impossible without that act.\n  Then we got around to the balanced budget. That was the big monster \nevent of our time. We had to get that done, and we got it done, sure \nenough, by reconciliation instruction that was really gigantic, and \nthen sitting down in a little room that I use over here that I call my \nhideaway. I hope somebody puts a sign on it after I leave because that \nlittle room was the room wherein we negotiated, four people negotiated \nthe balanced budget.\n  Trent was the guy who would come in every now and then to see if we \nwere making headway and see if we needed help. It was Speaker Gingrich, \nmyself, and somebody from the White House. Sure enough, when we were \nthrough, he was right there by our side, having participated as if he \nreally knew what the budget was all about. He could put on a terrific \nface. He didn't have any knowledge of what I was doing in there, but he \njust asked: Is it going all right?\n  Yes, all right. Is it going all right? Fine. Then he would walk out \nand have a terrific press conference. They would all think he really \nknew what this budget was about. I mean, I have to admit, you don't \nhave to tell him very much. We were still a long ways from getting \nthere, and he would walk out and say: They are making great headway. \nThis is really moving ahead.\n  I would go home after having not slept for 2 weeks, and I would be \nworried that he shouldn't be saying that because we were so far apart, \nand all he would say is: Don't worry. Just give them a little bit of \noptimism; we have to keep them alive a little bit.\n  I close by saying, Trent, I know what it is to sacrifice to be a \nSenator. I did that. I came here, believe it or not, with my eight \nchildren--and I am going to just mention it once because you had it a \nlittle bit better, not much--but the pay was about $38,000 with eight \nchildren, and we couldn't find a way to change the pay because we were \nscared to. That is the kind of suffering we went through. Trent did the \nsame in his early days. When he and his wife came here, the Senate had \ndecided for a number of years that we did not want to pay ourselves a \nsalary, which is one of the worst things we did. A democracy should not \ndo that. We must pay people for these important jobs.\n  That wasn't what kept him going. He loved the place, and his family \nloved it, it is obvious. His son was ambitious and rambunctious, \nwanting to get ahead, and he did get ahead. He was able to do that \nwhile his dad served here, and that is truly to their betterment and a \ncompliment.\n  I say thanks for the sacrifice for serving us, for serving in the \nSenate, and for serving our Nation. It is important you are leaving at \na time when you are strong and have a lot of energy left. That means \nyou will have a second life and you will say to me what James Baker has \nsaid at least 10 times. He said: Domenici, there is life after the \nSenate. And I say that to you: May that life be as good as the Senate \nor better, and may your family enjoy it as much as they have enjoyed \nthe Senate, and may it be successful for all of them.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I know that under the previous order, \nit is time for the policy luncheons. There are others here who may want \nto speak. I see Senator Gregg may well want to speak. Senator Lott \nwould like to respond. Senator Byrd also wants a few minutes.\n  I suggest the following: that Senator Byrd be recognized for 3 \nminutes, after which Senator Lott be recognized for 5 minutes, after \nwhich we recess for the policy lunches. I know there may be others who \nwish to speak. Hopefully we can accomplish that sometime after the \npolicy lunches. This is the last day we are here for our respective \npolicy lunches. These are important lunches. We are going to have to \nbegin them shortly. Therefore, I ask that consent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Reserving the right to object, I make an inquiry of the \nminority leader: Wouldn't it work out well if later on during quorum \ncalls we have an opportunity to speak and then have all those speeches \nappear in the Record in continuity?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. It would be my hope and expectation, I say to my \nfriend from Oklahoma, that there will be floor time after lunch and \nthat any Member who wanted to comment on Senator Lott's career can do \nthat. Of course, we ask consent that all be consolidated at this place \nin the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I rise today to honor my friend from \nMississippi, Senator Trent Lott. Trent and I have been friends since my \nfirst year in the House in 1987.\n  He was the minority whip in the House during my first year in \nWashington, DC. Now that we are in the Senate together 20 years later \nhe is my minority whip again.\n  Trent and I have enjoyed our time together on Wednesday afternoons in \nChowder and Marching. My wife Mary and I have enjoyed spending time \nwith Trent and his lovely wife Trish. Trent and Trish are college \nsweethearts and two of the great warming personalities in our Senate \nfamily.\n  We are proud that members of the Lott family call Kentucky home. \nTrent and Trish often come to the Bluegrass State to see their son Chet \nand his family.\n  He has served the people of Mississippi well for over 30 years. After \nthe devastation of Katrina, the gulf coast region had no stronger \nadvocate than Senator Lott.\n  Trent has risen from humble roots in his beloved Pascagoula to one of \nthe top leaders in Congress. I know his family and the people of \nMississippi are proud to call him one of their own.\n  Mr. President, I would like to thank Trent for his contributions to \nthe Senate and wish him and his family well as they open a new chapter \nin their lives.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a dear friend and \ncolleague here in the Senate whom I have served with in this body as \nlong as I have been in the Senate. Over the course of his 35 years in \nCongress, Senator Trent Lott has developed a reputation for strong \nleadership, a bipartisan approach to legislating, and an unwavering \ncommitment to Republican ideals and values. As you know, he is the only \nSenator to have served as whip in both the House of Representatives and \nthe Senate, and it was under his watch as a younger legislator that our \nNation saw significant economic recovery and increased national \nsecurity in the 1980s that had the support of those on both sides of \nthe aisle. Over the years, from my time in the House of Representatives \nto my time here in the Senate, I have looked to Trent for collaborative \nexamples of how to accomplish important, conservative goals such as tax \nreform, support for our military, and health care transformation, to \nname just a few. He has gained a remarkable, lasting reputation for \nbeing able to bring competing interests to the table, to work out \nsuccessful answers to policy challenges--a quality that is in \nincreasing deficit here in Congress these days. Trent has committed his \ncongressional service to Mississippians to furthering policies that \nstand for America: a strong national defense, responsible and fair tax \npolicies that encourage economic growth, and health care that puts \npatient needs above Government mandates. I am especially heartened that \nTrent remains unequivocal in his belief in second amendment rights.\n  Trent and I have worked together over the past few years on the \nFinance Committee, and I have been pleased to have his support on \nlegislation that we have moved through the committee, legislation that \nadvocates tax policies that do not penalize Americans for saving or \ninvesting. Trent understands that tax structures that favor small \nbusiness investments, individual saving and investing, and a financial \nservices system unburdened by onerous regulations are critical keys to \na healthy economy for the United States, one that translates into a \nmore stable global economy.\n  I have been pleased to host Trent when he has come to Idaho, and I \nhave had the pleasure of visiting the great\n\n[[Page S15809]]\n\nState of Mississippi. Trent's retirement from the Senate, while in his \nbest interest and in the interest of his family, will be a loss for the \nSenate and the promotion of conservative values here in Congress.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a man who is my close \nfriend but who, more importantly, is an American patriot and statesman.\n  Today, we pay tribute to Trent Lott, whom many, including myself, \nconsider an institution within this great institution.\n  I have known Trent for a number of years. He has served as an able \nand well-accomplished leader, a great Republican whip, and a \ndistinguished Congressman and Senator from the State of Mississippi. A \nman of impeccable character, Trent always shows the utmost respect for \nhis colleagues and for Congress itself, always putting the interests of \nthe country before his own. Trent Lott has a leadership style that I \npersonally admire and I believe often went underappreciated. He loves \nthis institution, and we respect him for that.\n  During his tenure in Congress, Trent has been a legislative warrior \nfighting for commonsense solutions to our country's most difficult \nchallenges. He does not seek credit for his achievements--they are too \nnumerous to list--even though he has been instrumental in shaping our \ngreat democracy.\n  Trent Lott is a modest and honest man who has made the United States \na better place from where it was when he first took the oath to serve \nin Congress decades ago. He is a true gentleman, and I have no doubt \nthat his impressive legacy will live on for generations to come.\n  God bless Trent Lott and his beautiful family. Your service to this \ngreat Nation will certainly be missed but will never be forgotten.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President. I rise today to celebrate the career of \nSenator Trent Lott--an accomplished leader, a great American, and a \ntrue friend. Trent has spent more than three decades in Congress \ntirelessly fighting for a State and a people he dearly loves.\n  Trent's path in life has followed closely that of the great American \nstory. His humble beginnings, as the son of a hard-working teacher and \npipefitter, established the foundation to value an honest day's work. \nThese principles have remained ingrained in Trent's heart throughout \nhis historic rise to the Senate.\n  In his more than 30 years in Congress, Trent has earned an immense \namount of respect among his peers. Easily said, he knows all the ins \nand outs. While there are many things we can all learn from his legacy, \nthe most notable of all is the power of compromise. Senator Lott has \nproved to every one of us the impact reaching across the aisle can have \non this country. It seems simpler these days to say ``I am a \nRepublican'' or ``I am a Democrat'' and to leave it at that, but for \nTrent Lott reaching across the aisle and working with others has led to \nresults.\n  Trent has shown all of us that we share the commonality of serving \nthe American people in the Congress. We are here to make the best \ndecisions we can for our country and its people, and bipartisan \nsolutions are a vital component to the legislative process.\n  When looking back at Senator Lott's accomplishments, the list is long \nand distinguished. In the areas of foreign policy and national defense, \nSenator Lott has been a strong supporter of our armed services, \nstationed both domestically and abroad. He has fought hard for the \nsecurity of our Nation and the protection of our service men and women. \nLikewise, he has not forgotten the commitment our veterans have made to \nthis country and has upheld what he knows is our responsibility to \nsupport our veterans at every opportunity.\n  As a public servant, my colleague has fought strongly to keep \nGovernment off the backs of the American worker and set the stage for \nthe Republican revolution through the progrowth gang the ``Five \nAmigos.'' Alongside Congressman Jack Kemp, House Speaker Newt Gingrich, \nSenator Connie Mack, and Congressman Vin Weber, Trent advocated \nPresident Reagan's approach to politics, tax cuts to promote economic \ngrowth for everyone in America.\n  Never far from his mind is his beloved home State of Mississippi, the \nsparkle in his eye. He has stood by the people of his State with \nunwavering devotion. When the people of his State were devastated by \nHurricane Katrina, Senator Lott shared their pain with his own family's \nloss and jumped into action. He dedicated his efforts to secure \ndisaster relief and restoration construction.\n  Senator Lott has recognized the importance education plays in \ndeveloping tomorrow's leaders and has been a staunch advocate of \nimproving the education system in Mississippi. Over the past few years, \nSenator Lott has sent several excess Senate computers to public schools \nin Mississippi in and effort to increase their students' access to the \nvast amount of information in the 21st century. His commitment to \neducation in his State will be enjoyed for years to come.\n  I have had the great privilege of working with Senator Lott on a \nvariety of issues. During my years in the House of Representatives, I \nremember when, as the Senate majority leader, Trent worked tirelessly \nto help pass the landmark welfare reform bill of 1996, such a \nmonumental piece of legislation that it is already receiving history's \npraise.\n  It has been a pleasure to work with him in Senate republican \nleadership and to serve alongside him on both the Commerce and Finance \nCommittees. Last year, on the Commerce Committee, Trent and I worked \ntogether to establish broad video franchising reform. This year, as a \nmember of the Finance Committee, Senator Lott has been a very strong \nadvocate for enacting permanent tax relief without increasing other \ntaxes.\n  There can be no question that Senator Lott is a man of results; his \nremarkable list of achievements illustrates this very point. But it is \nimportant to highlight that Trent does not overpromise. He will tell \nyou just as straight as he can, ``I'll be with you until I can't be \nwith you anymore.''\n  Senator Lott stands among few men in this world; a promise isn't \nsimply a word to him, it is a commitment to make good on a pledge. \nTrent carries around a small notebook in which he records every promise \nmade to him or by him. Senator Lott is a man of his word who will hold \nyou to yours.\n  For the 7 years I have been in the Senate, I have been in a small \ngroup with Trent who have met to pray together and to share each \nother's burdens. I have seen him on the highest mountain and the lowest \nvalley. Through it all he sought his Lord for wisdom, comfort, and \nstrength.\n  On a personal level I will miss serving alongside my friend. But I \nknow wherever this life leads you, I am certain the Lord will bless \nboth you and your incredible wife Trish. I also know you will bless \nthose whose paths you will cross.\n  As his role as a Senator nears an end, I ask that we remember Senator \nLott's legacy to this country, his State, and its people. Senator Lott, \nI wish you and your family the best of luck. It has been a privilege to \nserve alongside you in the Senate.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, as we come together for this last week of \nlegislative activity before we adjourn for 2007, I appreciate having \nthis opportunity to join my colleagues in expressing our appreciation \nfor the many contributions to the Congress that have been made by one \nof our colleagues who will soon be retiring. We have heard many great \nspeeches, seen a lot of passion and emotion--all well-deserved and \nheartfelt.\n  Trent Lott, who has a well-earned reputation as a hard worker and \ngreat fighter for the people of Mississippi, has announced that he will \nbe leaving the Senate so he can spend more time with his family. \nAlthough I understand the reasons for his departure, I know I will miss \nhim and his presence and active participation in our work and the day \nto day life of the Senate.\n  Trent's story begins in a town called Pascagoula in Mississippi. It \nis where he was raised and it is the place he still calls home. His dad \nworked in the shipyards and his mother was a teacher. Together they \ntaught him the great lessons of life, and when he left for college he \nwas already showing the presence of the leadership qualities that would \nsomeday help to lead him to a career in politics.\n  Trent enjoyed his school years and after a year of law practice, \nTrent got\n\n[[Page S15810]]\n\na job with Congressman William Colmer, who was from his hometown. When \nCongressman Colmer retired after 40 years in the House, he encouraged \nand endorsed Trent as Trent ran for and won his seat.\n  I have often heard it said that the great formula for success is \npreparedness plus opportunity. I know that Trent believes it too, which \nis why when the opportunity came for Trent to run for the House, he was \nfully prepared and that ultimately led to his success. He then served \nin the House from 1972 until his election to the Senate in 1988.\n  Here in the Senate, Trent has compiled a remarkable record of \nachievements because he understands the importance of working together \nto reach common goals. I have a similar rule I have often put into \npractice during my service in the State legislature and here in the \nSenate. I call it my 80/20 rule. Simply put, it means we can agree on \n80 percent of every issue. It is the other 20 percent that can sometime \nthrow us off track and prevent a solution to the issue at hand. If we \nare going to make any progress, the key to success is to focus on that \n80 percent and not allow ourselves to get sidetracked.\n  Trent fully understands that principle and he has put it into effect \nthroughout his political career. Whenever he was working on an issue he \nknew that it was better to walk away with half a loaf than wind up with \nnothing. He knew that, with half a loaf in hand, he could always work \non negotiating for the other half sometime later on down the road.\n  That spirit of cooperation and compromise has been Trent's hallmark \nand his guiding philosophy during his service in the House and Senate. \nThat is why he was able to get so much done for his State.\n  There is no doubt that the people of Mississippi love Trent and they \ngreatly appreciate how hard he has been working for their best \ninterests. That is why they kept sending him back to Washington after \nevery election.\n  I will never forget when I was running for reelection in 2002 and \nTrent came to Wyoming with his wife Tricia to help. He was a big hit \nand he received an enthusiastic response everywhere we went. It made a \nbig difference to me to know that our leader in the Senate was willing \nto take the time to help a fellow Republican who was up for election.\n  I wasn't the only one, of course. Whenever Trent saw an opportunity \nto help one of our nominees, he was always there to lend his support \nand provide whatever was needed to increase our chance for success.\n  Trent has been very fortunate in his life, but nowhere has he done \nbetter than in his choice of a spouse. The old adage is true. He and I \nboth ``over-married'' and our lives have been blessed with the presence \nof a spouse who makes it possible for us to do everything we need to do \nas Senators. Without them, our lives and our jobs would be impossible.\n  Now Trent has decided to leave the Senate and pursue another \nadventure in his life. He will be greatly missed and, after more than \n30 years of fighting for the people of Mississippi, he will be very \ndifficult to replace.\n  Trent will always be remembered as someone who had a talent for \nputting together agreements so that everyone came out a winner. He has \nbeen in more battles than I can count on the floor and in committee and \nthrough it all he has always stood up and fought for the things he \nbelieves in, like keeping our taxes low and providing a strong defense \nto keep us safe and free from harm.\n  In his statement about his retirement, Trent reminded us of the Bible \npassage that tells us that everything has its own time, everything has \nits own season. For Trent, this will be a time of great change and the \nbeginning of another new season in his life. One thing that won't \nchange, however, will be Trent's continued service to God and the \ncountry he loves.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I join my Senate colleagues in wishing \nSenator Trent Lott well as he leaves the Senate. I have known Senator \nLott since I arrived here in 1993, and he has always been a model of \ncivility, and someone whose word you can rely on. While we don't have a \ngreat deal in common politically, we still have worked together on \nimportant issues like media concentration and 527 reform. One of the \nbest things about working in the Senate is finding ways to reach across \nthe aisle and work together, and I am pleased that Senator Lott and I \ncould find that common ground. I think that is what the American people \nwant us to do, and it is something that Trent Lott has always done very \nwell. It was a pleasure from time to time to be on the same side as \nSenator Lott. He is an effective and tenacious legislator, and I think \nwe both enjoyed the strange bedfellows aspect of our work together. I \nparticularly enjoyed appearing before the Rules Committee when Senator \nLott was its chairman.\n  Senator Lott has given so much of his life to public service, serving \n34 years in Congress, in a number of different leadership posts. I have \nappreciated his willingness to work together on a number of issues, and \nI have appreciated what a fair and courteous colleague he has been. I \nknow that the people of Mississippi will miss his leadership, as will \nso many in this body. I wish him all the best as he leaves the Senate \nand returns to private life.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate my \nfriend, Senator Trent Lott, on his 35 years of service to the people of \nMississippi in both Houses of Congress, and also to wish him well as he \nleaves the Senate, and begins the next chapter of his incredible life.\n  Senator Lott was born in Grenada, MS, in 1941. His father was a \nshipyard worker, and his mother was a schoolteacher. He went to the \nUniversity of Mississippi in Oxford, where he earned an undergraduate \ndegree in public administration, and a law degree.\n  After finishing his education, he went to work for his local \nCongressman, William Colmer, for 4 years. When Congressman Colmer \nannounced his retirement in 1972, he endorsed Trent Lott as his \nsuccessor--even though Colmer was a Democrat, and Lott ran as a \nRepublican. Trent Lott won that election. And he was reelected to \nCongress seven times.\n  As a congressman, Trent Lott had a major, positive impact on his \ncolleagues, and also on the economic vitality of America. After the \n1980 election, he was elected to serve as House minority whip, and he \nbecame the first southern Republican to ever hold that position.\n  Counting votes, building coalitions, and moving legislation were \nthings he seemed born to do, and he genuinely enjoyed the process. In \n1981, he helped forge the bipartisan alliance that enacted President \nRonald Reagan's historic, across-the-board tax cuts.\n  Those tax cuts have been extremely successful. Since they went into \nfull effect, the U.S. economy has almost quintupled in size, the Dow \nJones has surged from less than 1,000 to over 13,000, and a wave of \nrevolutionary technologies, including cell phones and the Internet, \nhave strengthened America's position in the global marketplace.\n  In 1988, Trent Lott ran for, and won, a seat in the U.S. Senate. \nSince he arrived, Trent has earned strong marks from the people of \nMississippi, and they have reelected him to the Senate three times.\n  Senator Lott has never forgotten the needs and concerns of his \nconstituents. I know about his compassion, dedication, and hard work \nbecause I have seen it firsthand.\n  In 2005, as we all know, Senator Lott's house was destroyed by \nHurricane Katrina--a storm that created so much destruction throughout \nthe gulf coast.\n  Since then, Senator Lott--along with his partner from Mississippi, \nSenator Cochran--have helped lead the fight to make sure that \nWashington meets its obligations to the people of the Gulf Coast \nstates, who are rebuilding still today. His commitment during this time \nis a good part of why he decided to run for reelection.\n  Throughout his tenure in the U.S Senate, Trent Lott has demonstrated \ntremendous leadership ability.\n  After the 1994 election, he was elected Senate Republican whip, and \nin 1996, he succeeded another Senate legend, Bob Dole, as Republican \nleader.\n  During the next 6 years, Senator Lott was a strong leader for several \npieces of legislation that improved life in America in a wide variety \nof ways.\n\n[[Page S15811]]\n\n  First and foremost was the landmark welfare reform bill of 1996.\n  The next year, Senator Lott worked to produce a bipartisan agreement \nthat cut taxes, cut spending, and most importantly, balanced the \nFederal budget for the first time in almost 30 years.\n  Then, in 2001, Senator Lott led the fight for President Bush's tax \ncut package. Combined with the tax cuts that followed in 2003, lower \ntaxes have once again recharged America's economy, even as the global \neconomy grows more competitive\n\n  Since 2003, we have created 8.3 million jobs, which is more jobs than \nall the other major industrialized countries in the world combined. The \neconomic growth caused by those tax cuts has also led to record tax \nrevenue. Federal tax receipts are up more than 37 percent over the past \n3 years. This has enabled us to cut the budget deficit in half, and if \ntrends continue, we will be able to eliminate the deficit as soon as \n2012.\n  During recent years, Senator Lott has also taken a leadership role on \nother issues, including improving education and strengthening homeland \nsecurity. In fact, he brokered the compromise that created the \nDepartment of Homeland Security. He was also instrumental in passing \nthe Rail Security Act.\n  Senator Lott's ability to round up votes and get results is clear for \nanyone to see. That is why his Republican colleagues elected him \nassistant Republican leader again last year.\n  I have had the privilege to serve with Senator Lott as a member of \nthe Republican leadership and have watched him affect the outcome of \nevery major piece of legislation that has gone before Congress.\n  Last month, when Senator Lott announced his intent to resign from the \nSenate, I was saddened--like all of my colleagues--to hear of his \nplans. However, like all of my colleagues, I also understand his desire \nto have time for himself and his family. After 35 years of public \nservice, he deserves that and more.\n  America is a better place--and has a brighter future--because of \nTrent Lott.\n  I wish Trent and Tricia, and their family all the best in the future.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, as this session of the Senate draws to a \nclose, I want to say thanks and farewell to one of our most dedicated \nMembers, Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, and to wish him all the \nbest in the next phase of his life.\n  In his 36 years of service as a Member of both the House and the \nSenate, Trent Lott has consistently demonstrated his deep commitment to \nour nation and to his state. His amazing understanding of intricate \nSenate rules and procedures has guided us through many challenges. His \noutstanding work as our Republican whip has strengthened our caucus and \nour two-party system.\n  I have had the privilege of working with Senator Lott on two issues \nof paramount importance to the safety and security of our Nation. Like \nme, he comes from a shipbuilding State and he fully understands how \nessential seapower is to preserving our freedom. We have worked \ntogether to strengthen our Navy and to pursue a dual-shipyard strategy \nbecause it is in the best interests of America.\n  As a leader of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs \nCommittee, I had the opportunity to work closely with Senator Lott \nduring our investigation of the response to Hurricane Katrina. His \nknowledge of the gulf region was invaluable, and his compassion for the \nvictims of that disaster was inspiring. Although his own home was \ndestroyed by the storm, Senator Lott was on the front lines from the \nstart, directing resources where they were most needed and helping cut \nthrough the redtape. Before Katrina hit, he had planned to step down \nfrom the Senate last year, but with the needs so great and with a \ncontribution yet to make, he instead ran again so that he could \ncontinue to serve at a time when his experience and dedication were \nmost needed.\n  Although Maine and Mississippi are separated by great distance, both \nare rural States facing similar challenges, and I have always found \nSenator Lott a strong ally in meeting them. I was especially pleased to \ncosponsor his Amtrak reauthorization bill, which recognized that the \nbenefits of modern rail service must be made available to all States \nand to all of the American people.\n  Last April, I had the honor, at Senator Lott's invitation, of \naddressing students at his beloved University of Mississippi. \nSpecifically, I addressed students at Ole Miss's Trent Lott Leadership \nInstitute, a designation made in honor of his commitment to public \nservice. It is a commitment that has greatly benefitted our Nation, and \nit is the legacy for which Senator Trent Lott will always be \nremembered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, it is with sadness and affection that I \nnote the imminent departure from the Senate of my dear friend and \ndistinguished colleague Trent Lott of Mississippi. Trent and I came to \nthe Senate together almost 20 years ago. Over that time, I have come to \nrespect Trent's leadership abilities, but most of all I have treasured \nhis friendship and counsel.\n  Trent and I come from different places but we share a deep love for \nour country and a deep respect and appreciation for this institution in \nwhich we have been privileged to serve. Trent not only represented his \nbeloved home State, but he became a national leader because his \ncolleagues recognized that he had extraordinary abilities to make this \ninstitution work.\n  Like all successful and effective Senators, Trent understood that for \nthis institution to work for the American people, the 100 Members of \nthis body must find a way to cooperate; despite the differences in \nregion, ideology, party, and even personality. Trent had a seventh \nsense of what motivated his colleagues and how they might approach an \nissue that was before the Senate. Sometimes, it was uncanny how \nprescient Trent could be about the outcome of a particular vote on the \nSenate floor. He understood that one could compromise in order to \nachieve results without compromising core principles.\n  Yes, Trent was a conservative Republican partisan when he needed to \nbe. But Trent also knew there were times when it was critical to put \npartisanship aside for the national interest. Particularly in the area \nof national security, Trent comprehended that Republicans and Democrats \nmust find a way to unite to promote America's interests.\n  In addition to being an effective legislator, Trent is a man of \nconsiderable charm and warmth. Hadassah and I have great memories of \nthe times we spent with Trent and his wonderful wife Tricia. When we \nwould travel abroad, Trent was a terrific companion and always carried \nhimself with honor, style, and grace. I even remember a moment when we \nwere staying in a hotel in Scotland when we were forced to hurriedly \nexit in the middle of the night because of a fire alarm. Yet, there was \nTrent, perfectly coiffed and unruffled. Our leader!\n  Although Trent was always devoted to the institution of the Senate, \nhe was also devoted to another critical American institution--the \nfamily. Trent did not merely talk about family values--he lived them. \nTrent saw no contradiction in being a good Senator and being a good \nhusband and father. That is to his tremendous credit, and, for all of \nus, a tremendous lesson.\n  Above all, Trent appreciated the miracle of America. He rose from \nmodest means in Grenada, MI, to ascend to the legislative heights in \nWashington, DC. However, Trent never abandoned the values of faith, \nfamily, and hard work that were his inheritance from his beloved \nparents, Chester and Iona Lott.\n  Trent, as you begin this new chapter in your life, I wish you well. \nYour example of doing what is necessary to make this institution work \nis something we have all benefitted from. The people of Mississippi and \nthe people of America are grateful for your service. And Hadassah and I \nlook forward to continuing our friendship with Trish and you for years \nto come. May God bless you and yours, dear friend.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise to speak about Senator Lott. The \nSenate is a place--and we have heard it today for 2 hours with \nwonderful eloquence and thoughts and humorous stories and anecdotes \nabout Senator Lott--it is a place of words and language. It is also a \nplace, obviously, of legislation, and\n\n[[Page S15812]]\n\nlegislation leading to laws. But, most significantly, the Senate is a \nplace of people, of individuals--individuals who come here from all \nover our Nation, representing their people but always representing \nAmerica, and who meld into the institutions and traditions of this \nextraordinary place in various ways. Certain individuals leave an \nindelible mark. There are not too many, but there are some who have.\n  I would expect that Trent Lott will be one of those individuals.\n  I have had the great pleasure and honor of working with Trent Lott \noff and on for a long time. I was elected in the class of 1988 to the \nHouse of Representatives. He was elected Republican whip of the House \nat that time.\n  Somebody mentioned in their statement--and I served in the House with \nhim and have served in the Senate with him for many years--that he won \nthree major leadership elections by one vote. I know I, at least, voted \nfor him in those three elections, so maybe I was that one vote.\n  Our wives and our families have integrated over the years and have \nbeen close and done a lot of interesting and fun things together. Kathy \nand Tricia are very close friends. Trent and Kathy are close friends. \nAnd I am a close friend of Tricia. We really enjoy that friendship, and \nit goes back to a lot of different instances.\n  There are a lot of stories told about Trent Lott. One of my favorites \nis that Trent tends to like to sing and dance. I guess that comes from \nhis cheerleading days at Mississippi. But he has so much energy he has \nto let it out through song and dance. On occasion, he can be drawn into \nthis. In fact, it does not take too much to get him to sing.\n  We were at a gathering once, where Tricia and I and Kathy were \nsitting around a table near a stage, and Trent was up on the stage \nsinging with his good friend, Guy Hovis, and then there was dance music \nthat started. Tricia, knowing Trent as she does so well, turned to \nKathy and said under her breath: If you don't look at him, he won't ask \nyou to dance.\n  Little did Tricia know that Kathy actually likes to dance too. So the \ntwo of them went off and danced away and had a great time. Tricia and I \nsat at the table dancing inside. But as a practical matter, he has an \nenergy and a personality that is effusive and effervescent, and it \ndraws everybody in.\n  He is truly the American story. He is not a southern story, he is an \nAmerican story. He came from a family of moderate means. His father was \na pipefitter. His mother was totally committed to him. He raised \nhimself up and went to his beloved University of Mississippi, which I \nthink he still thinks he is going there some days he talks so much \nabout it.\n  His whole life has revolved around Mississippi and the people of \nMississippi and the people he has helped in Mississippi. This is what \nhas made him go: his ability to reach out and make people's lives \nbetter, to change their lives and improve their lives.\n  He has brought all those Mississippi values here. I think there is \nsome sort of almost genetic quality to Members of the Senate from the \nSouth. They just have this ability to move through this body with ease \nand with comfort and make everybody feel relaxed and enjoy them. They \ndo not have that stoic nature that we might have, those of us from the \nNortheast. Rather, it is just the opposite. They have an energy and an \neffervescence and a personality that brings people in and causes people \nto want to work with them.\n  Of course, numerous statements have been made about what a great \nindividual he is, about going across the aisle and understanding how \nyou go across the aisle and make things work here. That is absolutely \ntrue. He is a tremendous doer of legislation because he has the \ncapacity to bring together coalitions. He knows how to reach out to \npeople in a comfortable way. He also knows how to fight a fight and win \nit.\n  But it goes well beyond this issue of working to reach compromise to \nmake legislation pass because he has had a passion for getting things \ndone. He also has a philosophy of how we should govern. He is truly a \nconservative, a fiscal conservative, an individual who understands the \nimportance of giving the individual opportunity, giving the individual \nthe capacity to succeed in our Nation because he had undertaken that \nand accomplished it.\n  But it always goes back to his Mississippi roots, I believe. He now \nhas--I think it is something Senator Alexander described because \nSenator Alexander and his wife, Honey, and Kathy and I had the good \nfortune to be invited down to visit him at Tricia's new home--we call \nit Tricia's home--in Jackson, MS, where they bought this very nice \nhouse they are restoring. It is an antebellum house. It is a beautiful \nhouse. He just loves the land. He loves the people who come to the \nhouse. The people he sees, he loves, throughout his day and when he is \ntraveling in Mississippi.\n\n  Of course, he loves his tractors. He has this whole shed full of \ntractors. I am sure there must be maybe 7 tractors there, farm \nequipment. Of course, only 1 or 2 of them actually work. But as a \npractical matter, he loves them. He loves them. He loves to just drive \naround his property and make sure his fields are cut. He cuts them, and \nhe makes sure they are properly taken care of. He is working his \nMississippi land. He and Tricia built this beautiful home down there, \nwhere I suspect their purpose is to gather their family which is so \nimportant to them: Chet, Tyler, their grandchildren coming over on a \nregular basis. Kathy and I just looked at them and said: These are \nspecial people. These people represent the values we really have as \nAmericans--not as southerners but as Americans--the value of family, \nvalue of honesty, value of integrity, the willingness to get things \ndone and to work hard. Succeed, and then take advantage of your \nopportunities to make life better for others, and that was his whole \npurpose in the Senate--to make life better for America but especially \nfor his constituents in Mississippi.\n  Of course, then came Katrina. What a devastating effect it had on him \nand Tricia. They had this beautiful home in Pascagoula which, again, \nKathy and I had a chance to visit, an extraordinary house in a line of \nVictorian houses right on the waterfront. Out behind the house there \nwas this magnificent oak tree, just huge. I have never seen such a \nspectacular and large tree. The storm came, of course, and it wiped out \nhis house, it wiped out his brother-in-law's house, his sister-in-law's \nhouse, and every other house anywhere near there was devastated. He \nfound his class ring, I believe, three blocks away, or somebody found \nit and gave it to him. All of their memorabilia, the things that meant \nso much to them, the photos of their families, their notes and comments \nthey received from people, from Presidents and others, all the \nmemorabilia that had represented his lifetime and Tricia's lifetime, of \nfamily and Mississippi activity was also spread and destroyed by the \nstorm, and the house, of course, was eliminated by the storm.\n  But I asked him, because I was so startled, if the tree was still \nthere. He said to me: Yes, the tree is still there. The tree is still \nthere, this huge oak tree that is so beautiful, so magnificent and so \nelegant. As Trent leaves this Senate, I think of this oak. He may be \nleaving the Senate, but he is still here, and he will be here. His \nmemory will be here, and the way he did things, the way he taught those \nof us who learned from him will be here. He will leave a legacy which, \nlike an oak, will stand for a long time in this body. It was an amazing \nand an extraordinary privilege to have the ability, the right, and the \nprivilege to serve with him, and for Kathy and I to get to know him and \nTricia over these many years. So we thank him for his service, and we \nlook forward to continuing our friendship as the years proceed.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, there is something that is being concluded \ntonight or upon the time we go sine die, and that is the career of \nSenator Trent Lott of Mississippi. While many have come to the floor \nover the course of the day to speak about Trent, I have not had that \nopportunity because of several other meetings and a committee that was \nin session. So I wish to take a few moments to visit with all of my \ncolleagues about my friend and my associate Trent Lott.\n  There is not a lot I can say to add to what has already been said \nabout his quality as a person, his ability as a leader.\n  I first got to know Trent in 1981 when I came to the House. He had \nalready been there for 10 years and was\n\n[[Page S15813]]\n\nrapidly growing in stature amongst Republicans as a leader who would \nultimately be chosen to work as a Republican whip in the House.\n  He and I grew to know each other and our wives got to know each other \nduring that period of time and a clear friendship developed. But it was \nnot until both of us left the House and came to the Senate that we \ndeveloped a different kind of relationship and friendship that, \nfrankly, most Senators don't have the opportunity to do.\n  Trent Lott and I and John Ashcroft, the Senator from Missouri, who \nbecame U.S. Attorney General under this administration, and a former \nRepublican, and then to become a Democratic Senator and then to retire, \nSenator Jim Jeffords of Vermont, all four of us developed a very unique \nrelationship that no other Senators shared. We found out that we could \nsing together and that in doing so, we could not only have fun \nourselves, but that other people, sometimes with a smile, would suggest \nthey enjoyed listening to us.\n  We formed a group called the Singing Senators, and over a period of \nabout 4 years, we traveled from Los Angeles to Springfield, MO, to \nBranson to Houston to Nashville. We were on the ``Today Show.'' We sang \nat the Kennedy Center. What was most interesting was, we shocked folks. \nNot only after a lot of practice did we begin to sound pretty good, but \ncan you imagine stuffy, blue pinstripe suit Senators all of a sudden \nsinging ``Elvira''? That we did, and we had a lot of fun doing it, and \nwe entertained people all over the United States.\n  But what came out of that was a friendship and a bond that probably \nfew others have because the four of us traveled together with our \nspouses in all of these locations that I mentioned and a good many \nmore, not only to entertain the public and to show we were human by our \ncharacter, while we could still be Senators, but also to raise money \nfor our party or to raise money for a Senate candidate.\n  I will never forget the time when we were in Los Angeles and there \nwere about a thousand people out there waiting to hear us. We were \nsinging off of a CD with our background accompaniment music, and the \nsystem broke down. And what do you do when the music stops? Well, most \npeople quit singing. But we found out that we could sing a cappella, or \nwithout accompaniment. So we sang ``God Bless America,'' we sang a \ncouple other songs, and then they got the music fixed. And I think the \naudience enjoyed us without music more than they enjoyed us with music. \nAnyway, we had a lot of fun.\n  But in the end we did something else. We went to Nashville and put \nall our songs together on a CD, produced several thousand CDs, just to \ngive away, and found out that they were in demand. So we sold them all, \nand all of the money went to the Ronald and Nancy Reagan Alzheimer's \nfund. And, frankly, we found out to our great surprise that it raised a \nlot of money.\n  I know Trent and John and Jim and I still today, every so often, will \nget a phone call from somebody who says: I just listened to your CD \nagain, and you know, you guys were amazingly good for United States \nSenators.\n  Now, that is probably a side of Trent Lott that was not spoken to \ntoday, but it is a side of Trent Lott that you all ought to know--the \nsmile, the joy, the fun we had of singing the kind of songs we sang in \na way that Senators are just not supposed to do. For in the end, \nSenators are like an awful lot of other folks out there--we are human. \nWe have a very human side to us, with our friends and our families, and \nthat is what we learned about Trent and Tricia Lott and John Ashcroft \nand his wife and Jim Jeffords and his wife, as we traveled around the \ncountry singing on behalf of Republicans, but really singing on behalf \nof America because we enjoyed it and we hoped others would enjoy it.\n  That is something I will miss when Trent Lott leaves because we have \nhad an opportunity since that time to get together on occasion and sing \na few songs and enjoy ourselves. Trent Lott, a great United States \nSenator from Mississippi, and a guy with a pretty good bass voice.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to our friend \nand colleague, Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi. When Senator Lott \nsteps down at the end of this year after 35 years of service to our \ncountry in the Congress, he will leave behind a legacy of leadership \nand service to Mississippi.\n  I have known Senator Lott for many years. Our friendship dates back \nto when he was first elected to the House of Representatives in 1972.\n  In 1981, when serving as House Republican whip he played a central \nrole in the formation of a bipartisan coalition which produced national \nsecurity initiatives and promoted economic recovery under President \nRonald Reagan.\n  In 1994, Senator Lott became the first Republican to ever have been \nelected whip in both houses, and then went on to become Senate majority \nleader. He and his friend and fellow Senator from Mississippi, Thad \nCochran, who were both elected to the House in 1972, were the first two \nRepublicans to win statewide elections in the Magnolia State since \nReconstruction.\n  In 2005, when Hurricane Katrina left nothing but an oak tree on the \nfront lawn of where his home had been in Pascagoula, MS, Senator Lott \nworked tirelessly for recovery funding and tax breaks for gulf coast \nhomeowners and businesses who had lost everything.\n  My wife, Lilibet, who is also from Mississippi and I wish Trent, \nTricia, and their family every happiness in their new life. They have \nearned it. But we will miss them.\n  Mr. President, I know all our colleagues join me in congratulating \nSenator Trent Lott on a long, successful, and distinguished \ncongressional career.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, born in Grenada, raised in Pascagoula, and \neducated at the University of Mississippi--there is no denying where \nTrent Lott is from. He is a true son of Mississippi.\n  Trent is one of my few colleagues who knows how to say ``Missouri'' \nright.\n  In all seriousness, it has been an honor to work with Trent Lott, and \na real pleasure for Linda and me to get to know his wonderful wife, \nTrish.\n  Senator Lott has had a remarkable career in Congress that has spanned \nseven Presidents, two impeachments, and most importantly, decades of \nprogress that has made Mississippi and America stronger and more \nprosperous.\n  He saw Watergate up close and personal, oversaw the end of the Cold \nWar, spearheaded enactment of historic welfare reforms, shepherded \npassage of tax relief in both the Reagan and Bush administrations that \nmade America's working families more prosperous, and helped pass \nnumerous historic trade agreements to create more U.S. jobs.\n  While his career in Washington began in the House, he quickly became \na creature of the Senate and built a reputation as a parliamentary \nmaster.\n  Getting work done in the Senate is no easy task. I like to say it is \na lot like getting frogs in a wheelbarrow. Some may call it herding \ncats. However you would like to say it, Senator Lott knew how to get \nthe job done.\n  Senator Lott always knew how to count votes and get the best deal \nbased on Republican priorities and principles. In the Senate, there is \nno higher compliment. And in that respect, Trent is a Senator's \nSenator, reflected both in his work on behalf of Mississippi and on \nbehalf of America.\n  On behalf of the country, his belief in fiscal responsibility led to \na historic tax cut agreement that produced the first balanced budget \nsince 1968.\n  His belief in investing in a strong national defense has made our \ncountry safer.\n  On behalf of his home State of Mississippi he has been tireless in \nhis efforts to promote economic development and expand job creation. \nFrom investing in schools to improving infrastructure, his contribution \nhas been extensive and lasting.\n  Thanks to Senator Lott, Toyota, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, \nand many other companies have a home in Mississippi.\n  It has been a tremendous honor and privilege to serve with Trent \nLott.\n  I join my colleagues in congratulating the Senator and thanking him \nfor his many years of service and our friendship.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I rise today to join in recognizing \nSenator Trent Lott.\n  Less than 6 months ago, I joined the Senate. I was selected to serve \nout the term of our dear friend, Craig Thomas, and given the \nresponsibility to represent the people of Wyoming.\n\n[[Page S15814]]\n\n  My experience has only been enhanced by the quality of the \nindividuals with whom I serve. The welcome has been warm, the advice \ngratifying, and the diversity of my colleagues remarkable.\n  This morning's session is about the incredible service of one \nexceptional Member of the Senate, Trent Lott. President Reagan once \nsaid, ``I know Trent Lott as one of the most important leaders in the \ncountry on issues vital to all Americans.''\n  Shortly after I joined the Senate, Senator Lott was kind enough to \nvisit with me and share some advice. In addition to his advice on how \nto deal with the Senate as an institution, it was his advice of a more \npersonal nature that is most inspiring. Senator Lott stressed that to \nsurvive the chaos and challenge of serving in the Senate, it was \nimportant to never be far from the people you love the most. It was \nevident from his words that the depth of love for his wife Tricia, his \nfamily, friends, and the people of Mississippi was the key to his \nsuccess in Washington. His inner strength comes from the people who \nsupported him when times were tough and challenged him when he thought \nall was well. It is a lesson I will remember for as long as I am \nfortunate enough to represent the people of Wyoming in the Senate.\n  If he were with us today, Senator Thomas would want to extend his \nheartfelt best wishes to Trent and Tricia. I know Susan Thomas wishes \nthe entire Lott family many years of happiness and success. I join all \nof my colleagues in wishing all the best to this remarkable man.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, the first call I received from Trent Lott \nwas in 1986 when I first ran for Congress. Though the polls hadn't yet \nclosed and I still didn't know that I won, Trent called me up to \ncongratulate me. In 1994 when I ran for my Senate seat, Trent Lott \nagain called me on election night to tell me congratulations. Trent and \nI have worked together for 21 years and he has always been the best \npolitical mechanic in Washington. I take great pride in having helped \nlaunch the successful political career of Trent Lott by being one of \nhis first supporters in his bid for the Republican Whip position.\n  People quite often take shots at Trent without justification. Don \nImus used to say on his morning radio program that it looked like Trent \n``combed his hair with a sponge.'' Well, I have to admit it did look \nthat way sometimes, but if that is the worst you can say about Trent, I \nthink he is doing just fine.\n  One lesson I've learned from Trent is that you shouldn't take things \ntoo seriously. I've seen him laugh in the face of adversity on more \nthan one occasion, most recently when Trent's home in Mississippi was \nwiped out by Hurricane Katrina. Romans 5:3 tells us to rejoice in our \nsufferings because ``suffering produces perseverance; perseverance, \ncharacter; and character, hope,'' and certainly I've seen that in the \nlife of Trent Lott.\n  When he talked this morning about his four pillars of family, faith, \nfriends, and freedom, the one that people didn't talk much about was \nhis faith. I have prayed with him at a weekly meeting for many years, \nan I have to say this about him: he is a faithful and obedient person \nto his Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. So many of my colleagues say they \nhave lost a friend, a colleague, and a statesman, but I have lost a \nbrother. I rejoice in the contributions that Trent Lott has made \nthroughout his life.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I wanted to take a few moments this \nmorning to pay tribute to my departing colleague, Senator Trent Lott of \nMississippi.\n  Senator Lott has been a trusted friend, a hardworking legislator, and \na skilled party leader on issue after issue in his 35 years of \ndistinguished service in the House and Senate. He has been a tireless \nchampion of conservative values over the year, but it is a testament to \nhis unfailing courtesy and affability that he has been so popular and \neffective with his colleagues over the years, without ever surrendering \nthose core values. This Senate will miss his presence and example, and \nhis state and his Nation will miss his principled leadership.\n  I often think about what an incredible country this is where the son \nof a Kansas farmer and the son of a Mississippi shipyard worker can \nwork together on the great issues of our day in the world's greatest \ndeliberative body. I know that this country is better for the fact that \nTrent Lott, with all of his talents and abilities, was given that \nopportunity.\n  Senator Lott was instrumental in the great political realignment that \ntook place in the South throughout the 70s and 80s; in fact he was only \nthe second Republican elected to Congress from Mississippi since \nReconstruction. He went on to become one of the most effective \npolitical leaders of his day, perhaps one of the most effective leaders \nthis body has every seen. Trent has been amazingly effective, in \nbuilding coalitions, in working across the aisle, and in leading his \nparty.\n  Those of us on both sides of the aisle who have worked with him over \nthe years know that Trent Lott is a man of his word. In large part, \nthat has accounted for his political effectiveness, both with the \nvoters and with his colleagues. With Senator Lott, there is never any \nquestion about where he stands and who he is, and that kind of \nintegrity gains people's respect and admiration.\n  His integrity was never more apparent than when he stayed in the \nSenate out of a sense of duty to his state to see his people through \nthe terrible natural disaster that was Hurricane Katrina.\n  After three decades serving the people of his State and serving his \ncountry in the U.S. Congress, we now say farewell to our valued \ncolleague. He has served his country with resolve, honor, and energy. \nAs he leaves us in order to spend more time with his beloved family, I \njoin my colleagues in thanking Trent and his wife Patricia for their \nservice to their country, and I wish him all the best in his future \nendeavors.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I have not had the privilege to serve \nin the Senate with our colleague, Senator Lott, for as long of a period \nof time as many of those who have spoken today.\n  But it doesn't take that long to realize just how important the \nSenator from Mississippi's contribution to this institution has been.\n  We all know of his tremendous dedication to the institution that is \nCongress. Thirty-four years of public service between the House and \nSenate. His creation of the whip organization in the House that \nemphasized Member-to-Member contacts and outreach to the other party. \nElection to the Senate in 1988, as the Senate majority leader in 1996, \nand then as the Republican whip earlier this year.\n  But rather than lament the loss of a tremendous asset, I would like \nto celebrate his accomplishments.\n  When there is a problem to be resolved, Trent can resolve it. When \nthere is a compromise that needs to be brokered, Trent will broker it. \nAnd when there is a shortage of tomatoes at the Lott household, well, \nTrent always knew he could find a few extra in the garden a few doors \ndown.\n  My husband and I have been fortunate these past 5 years to be \nneighbors with Trent and Tricia. We share many things as neighbors--I \nblow the leaves down the sidewalk to his yard, and he blows them back \nto mine.\n  Jokes aside, whether it was the quick conversations between Members \nduring votes, or a closed door sit down discussion on the issues, Trent \nknew the pulse of the Senate. He works like a butterfly--going from \nMember to Member on the floor, lighting for a moment to discuss an idea \nor resolve an issue and then going on to another. Always friendly, \nalways working to find the path forward.\n  His ability to develop those relationships and work out a deal to \neveryone's satisfaction is a skill that I certainly look to as a model \nfor how the Senate should operate.\n  So it is with great fondness that I wish my friend and colleague well \nin his future endeavors. I wish him and Tricia well as they embark on \nthe next stage of their adventures.\n  Trent, thank you for your friendship, and for your service to this \nNation and this institution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, as a sort of starting point, I noticed that \nthroughout today we have had a lot of legislative business, and I \nthought it was interesting this morning, when\n\n[[Page S15815]]\n\nmany of my colleagues came down here to pay tribute to Senator Lott, \nthat while that was going on, and I was coming down here as well to \nlisten to some of those and to offer my remarks at that time, I was \nhanded a whip card to go start to do some whip work, because that is \nthe task that Senator Lott--and I have had the honor to serve on his \nwhip team--is entrusted with here in the Senate.\n  So it was always focused on the task and always on the work at hand. \nEven as we were in his last day here in the Senate paying tribute to \nhim, he continued to work hard at the responsibility that had been \nentrusted to him by his fellow Senators on this side of the aisle.\n  It was a great privilege, as I said, to be able to serve in that \ncapacity and to learn from Senator Lott. I think he has the distinction \nas perhaps the only person who served as the whip in the House of \nRepresentatives and now in the Senate. As he leaves, he leaves a great \nlegacy. Many of us who have had the opportunity to learn under his \ntutelage about the way this institution operates have been blessed to \nhave someone like him to be a teacher.\n  Senator Lott always understood that although we deal with very \nserious, very weighty, sometimes complex and oftentimes consequential \nissues, it is also important that we not take ourselves too seriously. \nTrent never did. Even those of us sort of plain Midwesterners who \nresisted the seersucker suit day and its attendant fashion statement \nrecognized the value of many of the trends that Senator Lott was \nresponsible for instigating.\n  Trent never lost sight of the fact that in the end--while we are \nelected officials, we are Senators, we have responsibilities to our \nconstituencies, responsibilities under the Constitution, \nresponsibilities to our country--that we are all human beings. In the \nend, despite our differences, the relationships are what will endure. \nHe worked actively at building those types of relationships.\n  I first had the opportunity to meet Trent when I was a Member of the \nHouse of Representatives. Like many of my colleagues who at the time \nserved in the House, he was the leader in the Senate. But we had some \nopportunities to interact, and we always respected the work he did and \nthe way he understood the Senate and its rules and its procedures and \nwas able to effectively make it work to produce results. Ultimately, \nthat was always his objective. He knew we were going to disagree, he \nknew there would be differences, but in the end his objective was \nalways to get us across the finish line so the Senate could complete \nits work, and the work of the American people could be done.\n  I will certainly miss, as will many Senators, that personal touch, \nthat sense of humor, that warmth, that smile--all those things that are \npart of his character and his personality that are so closely \nassociated with the Senate.\n  My office is next to his on the fourth floor of the Russell Building. \nIt was not uncommon for Senator Lott to do the pop-in visit. He would \npop into my office, always to have a discussion about perhaps what the \nissue of the day was. But there was not one of those pop-in visits \nwhere I didn't learn something, where just, again, having been exposed \nto him presented the opportunity to learn from someone who had mastered \nthis institution after serving here for those many years; someone who \nalso understood the House very well, 34 or 35 years, I think, in total \nin the House and Senate, as well as having served here as a staffer \nprior to that.\n  When Senator Lott came to the Senate the very first time as a \nstaffer--I don't know exactly the date, but I know it was sometime in \nthe late 1960s--I was probably in first or second grade, somewhere in \nthat vicinity.\n  Over the years, his service has helped accomplish a great many things \nfor the American people. He has been a great leader for the Republican \nParty. As majority leader, as minority leader, as minority whip, \nmajority whip--in all those positions he has held he has had one goal \nand objective in mind, and that is to help his team help this great \ncountry continue to prosper, continue to be safe and secure for future \ngenerations.\n  If I think there are any lessons that can be learned, things that I, \nperhaps, learned from Trent during his service in the short time I have \nhad the opportunity to serve with him, one would be to serve causes \nthat are greater than yourself. I think he had a great sense of purpose \nabout what was important in life. Clearly, that was the case or he \nwould have gone off and done other things a long time ago.\n  Second, to be serious about your work. He was very much, as I said, a \ntask master. I know from experience, serving on his whip team, that \nwhen there was a task at hand he was very focused and intently \nconscious of the importance of getting the job done and getting it done \nin a timely way. He was serious about his work. But the other thing he \nunderstood was he never took himself too seriously. He, as I said, \ninvested in relationships in this body, knowing full well it is those \nrelationships that will have the enduring value.\n  The final lesson that I got from Trent is never forget where you came \nfrom. That was one thing he also modeled. He was a Mississippi original \nthrough and through. That was something you always sensed. His \npriority, his heart, was always with his home State. What came through \nloud and clear to all of us when his State was struck with the \nadversity that came from Hurricane Katrina and the aftermath of that \nwas the enormous work he did to help his State to recover. He always \nhad a sense of where he was from. He never lost sight of that, and who \nhe represented.\n  There is a verse in the Bible that says:\n\n       Where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.\n\n  I think you could always tell what things Trent treasured. You could \nalways tell where his heart was because of the things that he \ntreasured. His faith was very important to him in a personal way. His \nfamily, his beloved wife Tricia, and his children, were always a top, \nfirst priority for him. Finally, his friends. That was something I \nthink you heard abundantly today as people from both sides of the aisle \ngot up and talked about their experiences and the relationships that he \nhad built with them over the years. If you can judge someone, where \ntheir heart is, by where their treasure is, you always knew where Trent \nLott's heart was. It was with his faith, it was with his family, and it \nwas with his friends.\n  I am very proud and privileged to count myself among those friends.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 3 minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may speak for \nas long as I wish to consume. That will not be very long. I cannot talk \nabout Senator Lott in 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank my colleagues, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, in his political memoir, ``Herding Cats: A Life in \nPolitics,'' our distinguished colleague, the former majority leader, \nSenator Trent Lott, noted that he viewed his ``years in Washington as a \nmagnificent experience, with many more mountaintops than valleys.'' How \nis that? Let me say that again: He viewed his ``years in Washington as \na magnificent experience, with many more mountaintops than valleys.''\n  What a wonderful way to look at one's experience in the U.S. \nCongress. Everyone in public life knows there are valleys. Life may be \nunfair, but in public life, that unfairness, I daresay, is magnified \ntenfold. But as Senator Lott explains, he prefers to look at the \nmountaintops, and his political life has been one of many mountaintop \nexperiences.\n  This son of a shipyard worker and public school teacher was elected \nto the U.S. House of Representatives in 1972. He was in the House for \n16 years, where he distinguished himself by serving with great aplomb \non the House Rules Committee as his party whip. I know something about \nthat party whip. That ain't easy.\n  In 1988, he left his safe and secure seat in the House to run for the \nSenate. Reach for the stars. In the Senate, Senator Lott has served as \nRepublican conference secretary, Republican Senate whip, Senate \nminority leader, and Senate majority leader. As the Senate\n\n[[Page S15816]]\n\nwhip, Senator Lott became the first Republican ever elected to the whip \npositions in both Houses of Congress.\n  As the Republican Senate leader, Senator Lott served with dignity and \nwith diplomacy. Diplomacy was his tool. He was a facilitator who sought \nto bring differing political factions together on key legislative \nissues.\n  Trent Lott established solid, productive relationships with the \nSenate Democratic leaders in order to keep legislation moving, moving, \nmoving to the floor. Make no mistake, as a conservative Republican, \nSenator Trent Lott has always been combatively--combatively; underline \nthat word, combatively--partisan in his thinking and his approach to \npublic policy, but--a big conjunction here--but he never allowed his \npartisanship to become stubborn or nihilistic or destructive. No, \nnever.\n  Senate Majority Leader Reid--that is Harry Reid, Senator Harry Reid, \nmajority leader--recently commented on how closely he has worked with \nSenator Lott. They negotiated. They negotiated. Together they worked \nout compromises, which, as they say, is the art of politics and the \nlegislative process. Majority Leader Reid then explained:\n\n       Even though Trent Lott is certainly a true conservative, we \n     were able, in his pragmatic fashion, to work things out.\n\n  It is not easy. Allow me to state this in another way. Senator Lott \nalways put the good of this institution--right here, this institution--\nand the good of our country first; that is, above partisan political \ninterests or political party. For that, I have always respected him, \nTrent Lott, and I have always admired him.\n  Senator Lott takes great pride in his roots and his southern \nheritage. I, too, am a southerner and am proud of that. My great uncle \nwas killed fighting for the Confederacy. As a champion of his beautiful \nand beloved home State of Mississippi, he was always on call for the \npeople of the Magnolia State. This was best seen a few years ago when \nhe was considering retiring from the Senate at the close of the 109th \nCongress, but feeling an obligation to help his State to recover from \nthe deadly and devastating impact of Hurricane Katrina, Trent Lott \ndecided to stay with us, and I, for one, am glad he did. Thank you, \nTrent.\n  In his political memoir, ``Herding Cats,'' which I mentioned a few \nminutes ago, Senator Lott included a special chapter entitled ``The \nDifferences Between Friends and Colleagues.'' ``Differences Between \nFriends and Colleagues''--what a powerful and insightful look this is \ninto the political realities of life and work on Capitol Hill. Senator \nTrent Lott pulled no punches--none--as he discussed the differences \nbetween the two. He bluntly recalled telling one person: You didn't \nhelp me when you could have. Senators, think of that. Think of that \nstatement if it was said to you: You didn't help me when you could \nhave. That is piercing, leaves nothing unsaid. I guess that about sums \nit up: You didn't help me when you could have.\n  I will miss Senator Trent Lott. I wish him and his very lovely wife \nTricia--tell her I said hello on behalf of Erma and myself--I wish him \nand his lovely wife Tricia health, happiness, and success as they now \nembark upon the next phase of their lives. I pray they will enjoy \nnothing but the best. They have earned it.\n  Mr. President:\n\n     It isn't enough that we say in our hearts\n     That we like a man for his ways;\n     And it isn't enough that we fill our minds\n     With psalms of silent praise;\n     Nor is it enough that we honor a man\n     As our confidence upward mounts;\n     It's going right up to the man himself\n     And telling him so that counts.\n\n     Then when a man does a deed that you really admire,\n     Don't leave a kind word unsaid,\n     For fear that it might make him vein\n     Or cause him to lose his head;\n     But reach out your hand and tell him, ``Well done'',\n     And see how his gratitude swells;\n     It isn't the flowers we strew on the grave,\n     It's the word to the living that tells.\n\n  Thank you, Trent.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, while I was deeply saddened when Senator \nTrent Lott told me he would retire at the end of the year, I understood \ncompletely why he made this decision.\n  Trent and Tricia have been trying to restore their lives in \nMississippi following the devastation of their home as a result of the \nterrible devastation which struck our East Coast during the Katrina and \nRita hurricanes. They lost their home--and most of their possessions, \nand, they need time to recover.\n  There is no Senator with whom I have served who has had a deeper \ncommitment to our Nation. Trent was the whip of our party in the House \nof Representatives when I was whip here in the Senate. We initiated \nweekly conferences to try to share the progress and intentions of our \nleaders at that time. From those days until now I have considered Trent \none of the best friends I have had in my lifetime.\n  Trent and I have served together on several committees of the Senate. \nOur primary work together has been on the Commerce Committee where \nTrent has been our leader on the aviation and maritime commerce \nsubcommittees. His work on our Commerce Committee will be sorely \nmissed.\n  Trent's own words on ``herding cats'' is well known here. He has had \nmore success in achieving bipartisan results than most people outside \nthe Senate know. Trent has not sought the credit for what he has \naccomplished--it has been enough for him that he knew the job was done.\n  His role as a member of the ``Singing Senators'' is well known. What \npeople should know is that he had the good sense to ask this Senator \nnot to join--they didn't need a monotone!\n  As I told the The Politic, it is doubtful the Oak Ridge Boys will \ncome back to the Capitol. Trent brought them to the LBJ Room--where he \nasked them to sing ``The Late Night Benediction at the Y'all Come Back \nSaloon.''\n  It is hard for me to visualize the Senate without Trent Lott. I \nbelieve every Senator here now knows what he has done. He stepped down \nfrom the leadership--kept a smile on his face and went back to work. He \nregained the leadership as he was selected to be our whip--and the \nRepublican leader's comments show that Trent Lott became the whip any \nleader would dream to have: loyal, supportive, full of energy to get \nthe job done, and all with that smile that we all know so well.\n  So, as I said in the beginning, it is with sadness that I join in \nwishing Trent and Tricia the best that life has to offer as they leave \nthis Senate family. Catherine and I wish them the best and will pray \nfor their success in the future.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi, the Republican \nwhip.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I can't help but feel honored and humbled by \nall that has been said here. My mother would have loved it and would \nhave believed it all.\n  I feel totally inadequate to properly respond to much of what has \nbeen said. I thank my colleagues one and all, and, of course, the \nvenerable symbol of this institution, Senator Byrd, and his comments, \nending as he always does with magnificent quotes, from memory. So maybe \nit is appropriate that I would begin briefly by telling some of my \nexperiences with Senator Byrd.\n  When you enter my son's home in Kentucky, on the wall, framed, is a \ntribute he gave to my first grandchild--a grandson--the week he was \nborn. I was majority leader and came on the floor that Friday, and he \nasked me if I would be around for a few minutes; he had something he \nwould like to say. It was truly one of the most beautiful things I had \never heard in my life. Maybe it was because I thought my grandson was \nthe most beautiful I had ever seen, but it was so magnificent, and he \nended with a quote of how a grandfather wants his grandson to remember \nhim. So it hangs there in a place of great pride. ``Chester Trent Lott, \nIII'' is the title.\n  Senator Byrd and I have worked together, and of course we have \ndisagreed. There have been magic moments. I remember when I was \ninvolved in our little singing group, he came on the floor one day and \nasked me if I had a little time; he had something he would like to show \nme. So he went down to his office and he showed me a video of himself \nat the Grand Ole Opry playing great fiddle. So we were bonded by music, \nby heritage, by faith, and in so many ways.\n  I could tell a story about certainly each one of these colleagues \nhere and a lot on the other side and how I have enjoyed being here and \nhave enjoyed my\n\n[[Page S15817]]\n\nwork, and a lot of it has been on a personal, one-to-one basis. \nSometimes, when I really, really cared about something, on a personal \nbasis, for my State or for the Senate or our country, I would go to \nthat Senator's office. I remember one time it took me quite some time \nto track down Pat Roberts, because he was hiding from me, but I found \nhim.\n  I remember one time I needed a vote, and I needed some votes on the \nDemocratic side. So the simple thing I have always thought is, you \nknow, go where the ducks are. If you are looking for votes, you have to \ngo talk to them, you have to pursue those votes. So I went to Senator \nByrd's office. As always, he graciously welcomed me into the inner \nsanctum. I think I smelled a cigar, which delighted me, and I sat down, \nand he listened to me as I made my pitch. I talked about the attributes \nof this nominee for a very important position and why it was so \nimportant, I thought, to the institution and why it was important to me \nand my State. He listened, he asked a couple of questions, and asked me \nto repeat the name.\n  At the end, he said: Well, I think everything will be okay. He didn't \nsay: I will vote for him. He just said: I think everything will be \nokay. I figured it was good enough and time for me to take my leave, \nand I did. I talked to my senior colleague, Senator Cochran, and said: \nWhat does that mean? He said: I think it will be okay.\n  So the vote came, and it was okay. He was one of a number of \nDemocrats who did vote for that confirmation. It was just sort of the \nepitome of Senator Byrd. I respect him as a great Senator, I respect \nhim because of the way he loves this institution, and I respect him as \na friend.\n  I take occasion, when I am in the Senate, sometimes when I am \nleaving, to go over and say: How are you doing, Senator Byrd? Because I \nknow how he felt about Erma, I know how he loved Billie, and he has so \nmany things that appeal to me and that make him a great man. I single \nhim out now because of the beautiful remarks he just made and because \nreally he is emblematic of the relationships I have had with so many of \nmy colleagues here.\n  I guess, to tell you the truth, I really was kind of hesitant about \nthis moment and about being here today and what you would say, but it \nall sounded so good, now I am thinking of changing my mind and maybe \nannouncing for President or something.\n  But to our leaders, Senator Harry Reid, the majority leader--he and I \ndid work together on many occasions and without a lot of fanfare. I \nremember we would bring up a bill, and 100 amendments would always \nappear. I got to thinking it was the same 100, but then he and I would \ngo to work, with me in the leadership of my party and he as the whip on \nhis side, working with Senator Daschle, and we managed to get it done \nover and over again. We established a relationship of trust and honesty \nwith each other that is so critical.\n  I think he has the toughest job in the whole city, being the majority \nleader in the Senate, and not just because I had it but because I got \nto see what it was all about. The President has the whole \nadministration, the Speaker has the Rules Committee, but the leaders of \nthe Senate, on both sides of the aisle, they lead because of who they \nare and the power of persuasion they have and the respect for the \nposition they hold. Nothing in the Constitution gives them special \npowers.\n  So I appreciate what Harry Reid has said. He has been a friend, he \nhas been a supporter, he has offered me encouragement when I was down \nand when I was up. He has been very generous and magnanimous in what he \nhas had to say, and I admire him. I wish him only the best because when \nhe succeeds in working and making this institution work and produce a \nresult, most of the time the country succeeds.\n  To our Republican leader, Mitch McConnell, you knew just a little bit \ntoo much about my background, all these personal references, but I \nappreciate it. It means so much to me. You have been a great friend. We \nhave been in the leadership together, we have kept our word to each \nother, we have been supportive of each other in tough times and good, \nand I really enjoyed having you work with me in the leadership when I \nwas leader, and I have been so honored and thrilled to be a part of \nyour leadership team.\n  I told you that I knew what your job was and I knew what the whip job \nwas, and I would be your whip and I would support you. And I want the \nrecord to show here, and for one and all, I think you have been a \nmagnificent leader for our party this year. It has not been easy. It \nhas been tough. Both of you are going to get criticized, but I have \nbeen riding shotgun for you, and it has been a great pleasure, my \nfriend. You have done a magnificent job for our party.\n  I have to recognize our most senior Republican, too, Senator Stevens. \nHe told me yesterday he didn't like my nickname for him, so I am \nworking on a more appropriate one for him, but he has been a good and \nloyal friend too. When I was a whip in the House and he was a whip here \nin the Senate, he took me under his wing, even took me on some flights \nwith him. But I admire you so much, Senator Stevens.\n\n  And I have to say to my colleague from Mississippi, it has been quite \na ride--35 years--but we have enjoyed each other's company. No matter \nhow tough things get, we could always sit down and talk about Ole Miss. \nI really thought I would be the head coach this year, but that didn't \nwork out. But the thing I will always say about Senator Cochran, and \ntypically of him, after Katrina, which was a seminal event in my life, \nobviously in the lives of my families and neighbors and friends, and my \nState, we had so many needs, and Senator Cochran immediately went to \nwork and produced appropriations--more than one--and he got everything \nwe needed. He didn't jump up and down and brag about it.\n  He helped not only my State but, as Senator Vitter said, Louisiana \nand the entire gulf region, and here is what really impressed me about \nit. We all took credit for what he did--I did, our Governor did, our \nmayors did--and he sat there quietly in the second row in Biloxi, MI, \non the 1-year anniversary of Hurricane Katrina, and public official \nafter public official got up and took deep bows for what they had done. \nFinally, I had all I could stand, and I got up and said: I am glad we \nall got to take credit. Now it is time we recognize the man on the \nsecond row who actually did it. I will forever be grateful for what you \ndid after Hurricane Katrina, which was obviously a very tough event.\n  To my staff, who are lined up back here--I have a great team. \nTypically, Senate staffers do so much of the work and we take the \ncredit, but I have been blessed with super staff this year, and there \nare some former staff members in the balcony. I have a rule in my \noffice that once you work for Trent Lott, you always work for Trent \nLott no matter who pays your salary, and, you know, it seems to work. I \nnever let them go. They are always on call and they are always there, \nand I thank you all for that.\n  I want to do something, too, that I have done before. We don't do \nenough to thank our entire Senate family, everybody from the elevator \noperators to our policemen and the people here. I think the staff of \nthe Senate here on the floor appreciates it. I have always tried to \nthink about you too. One of my speeches about the sun is setting, isn't \nit time to go home--as most of you know, I was serious when I said I \nwanted to go home and have supper with my wife Trish, and on occasion, \nI did it and didn't come back either.\n  But to all of the staff: Thank you. You have helped in so many ways. \nOur leaders on the staff--I think of Elizabeth Letchworth, Dave \nChiappa, and Marty. They just do great jobs, and so I want to express \nmy appreciation to them.\n  To my State of Mississippi, they have shown me a lot of leniency. \nThey have honored me, and they have put up with me sometimes, and it \nhas been quite a pleasure to represent that State. I love it, always \nwill, and will always be working for the State.\n  But especially to my wife Tricia and our two children, Chet and \nTyler, and now our four grandchildren, they have been very supportive, \nand they have always stood by me. My wife has been a lot more than a \nwife and mother, she has been a real helpmate. I thank them for all \nthey have done.\n  I do want to say again to the Senate itself, I have learned to love \nthe institution. Senator Byrd occasionally accused me of trying to make \nthe Senate\n\n[[Page S15818]]\n\ninto a mini-House, and I have denied it, but maybe I was, in my desire \nfor order and neatness. The messiness of the Senate sometimes was hard \nfor me to take.\n  But I love this place, and I was thinking about it today--the \nfriendships. They are real here, but they don't go away. Some of our \ncolleagues have gone before us whom I have dearly loved as friends and \nnot just colleagues, people such as Connie Mack, Dan Coats, Phil Gramm, \nand Paul Coverdell was mentioned. These are friendships which will last \nforever.\n  Dianne Feinstein. One of my regrets in deciding to retire is that now \nwe have sort of formed a team, and I think maybe she is a little peeved \nat me that she took a stand with me after I took a stand with her, and \nnow I am going to the house. But this is a great Senator, and she is a \nsymbol of what I hope the Senate will remember to do, and that is to \nreally go the extra mile to be a friend and to have a personal \nrelationship.\n  She took on the seersucker Thursday. When we lost everything, she was \nthe one who made sure my wife had some glasses for us to drink out \nof. She didn't do it for publicity, and I never talked about it \npublicly, but it was a very special gesture.\n\n  I thank my colleagues for letting me be in the leadership. Thanks to \nmy colleagues and the American people for allowing me to have some fun \nwhile being in the Senate. I commend it to you, for the future. I \ndidn't form the Singing Senators, the quartet, just because I like to \nsing base or because I enjoyed music, but because I wanted to show that \nside of the Senate. Could the Senate really have soul? Could the Senate \nreally have music in its heart? As bad as we sounded, there was method \nin my madness. I also thought it would lead me to find ways to get one \nof our Senators to vote with us more. I think it got one more vote than \nwe would have otherwise.\n  But the kilts--you know, just being a little looser I think is a good \nidea every now and then. I believe whatever you do in your life you \nshould find a way to enjoy it and have fun. I have to say I have had \nfun in the Senate because I really enjoyed it. That is all there is to \nit. But I tried to find a way to do some things that made us closer as \nfriends.\n  I am glad we recorded some history with the Leaders Lecture Series. I \nurge my colleagues to restart that, bring in experts to talk to us, men \nand women who led the Senate, who led the country, who know the history \nof our country and the history of this institution, and give us some \nopportunity to have an intellectual discussion about what the Senate \nis, what it has been, and what it can be.\n  I do hope we will always find a way to be just a little bit family \nfriendly. Remember, we all have families at home, back in our States. \nOur leaders sometimes could give us a little reward; if we would behave \nand allow them to get to a vote quicker, maybe we could get home to our \nfamilies a little quicker.\n  Senator Byrd mentioned the fact that I have been on mountain tops and \ndown in the valleys. I thought many times about my high school class \nmotto. As class president--we had a class flower, we had a class color, \nwe had a class song, we had a class everything. We had a class motto \nthat has lived with me since those years at Pascagoula High School in \n1959. Our class motto was:\n\n       The glory is not in never failing, but in rising every time \n     you fail.\n\n  I have had opportunities to fail, and I have had opportunities to \npersevere, as the people I represent. It has been a great motto, one I \nhave learned to live by.\n  I am not going to give a long speech today. I quoted a great \nphilosopher about how you should speak on occasions such as this. He \nsaid: You should speak low, you should speak slow, and you should be \nbrief--John Wayne. I am going to try to honor that. I am not going to \ngive you a list of achievements because I have been so pleased with \nwhat my colleagues have had to say. But among the things I really am \nproud that we have done in my years in the Senate: We have built our \nmilitary, we have made it stronger, we gave them better pay, we gave \nthem better retirement benefits. I will always be proud of that. We had \ntax cuts, tax reform, and strengthened the economy, even things such as \nsafe drinking water. I had communities in my State that literally \ncouldn't drink water out of the faucets. We have improved on that. We \nhad insurance affordability, welfare reform, transportation.\n  When I announced my retirement a couple of weeks ago, one reporter \nasked about what was I most proud of. I said: To tell you the truth, I \nam not the kind of guy who sits around meditating on what I am going to \nput on a marker somewhere. I am proud of all of it. But I think I am \nthe most proud of the effort we had with colleagues on both sides of \nthe aisle, working very closely with Senator Domenici and Senator \nGrassley and others. So in my 6\\1/2\\ years as majority leader we have \nhad balanced budgets, four, and surpluses two of those four. It hasn't \nhappened since 1968, and we are kind of struggling again. That is \nsomething we need to do. Fiscal responsibility is a very important part \nof what we can do for our children and our grandchildren. I hope we \nwill find a way to do that again in the future.\n  I have one regret. I guess I was part of the problem along the way. \nThe one thing I always hoped we could get done for our children and our \ngrandchildren we have not been able to do, and that is to find a way to \npreserve, protect, and ensure that Social Security will be there for \nour children and grandchildren in the way that it is here for us now. I \nhope we will find a way before it is too late to get that done.\n  With regard to recommendations, I have no anger, complaints, I have \nnothing but hope and joy in my heart for the future. I am so \nappreciative of the way the Senate and the Congress and the American \npeople stepped up and helped us after Hurricane Katrina. But if there \nwere just two things I would like to urge the Senate to do--I have \ntouched on them, but I repeat them now--No. 1, find a way to make sure \nSenators have a life and have some time with their families. When you \nlose that, you have lost an important part of those pillars that make \nus who we are--family and friends, faith and freedom. You have to make \nsure you pay close attention to that and learn to know each other and \nknow each other's families. It will make us better people.\n  Then, last, find a way to keep the human side. It has been hard for \nme, with my Scottish roots, to tell people when I really do appreciate \nthem and love them; to call people when they are celebrating and call \nthem when they are hurting. But when I hurt, myself, I know how much it \nhas meant to me to have some of you call and offer your support and \nyour encouragement. Find a way to do that. It is more important than \nanything else that happens in the Senate. Keep that personal, human \ntouch.\n  Always find a way to disagree if you have to, but don't be \ndisagreeable. There has come sort of a meanness, sometimes, that I do \nnot think is befitting of the institution. I hope we will find a way to \nstay away from that.\n  Again, I repeat something I said a moment ago. This morning when I \nwas doing my morning Bible devotional, the message that came through to \nme was one of hope and joy for the future. I look forward to my \nopportunities after the Senate. I am not going to say a fond farewell \nbecause I am not leaving. I will not be here, but my heart will be with \nyou and I will be watching and I will stay in touch for the rest of my \nlife.\n  Thank you so much for being able to serve with you. I thank you all \nfor what you have had to say today. I do have a quick card in my topic. \nI do want to talk to you about some folks who will be coming up later \nthis week.\n\n  Thank you very much. God bless this institution.\n  (Applause, Senators rising.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I hope we all heed Trent Lott's words that \nhe spoke so beautifully right now. He spoke from the heart, and he \nspoke from experience. As I listened to him, I thought: We do sometimes \nforget about what is important in life. I think he brought that back to \nus.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/18/senate-section/article/S15818-1", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15818-S15819]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, I strongly oppose the blanket grant of retroactive \nimmunity in the Senate Intelligence Committee's bill to amend the \nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Act. This administration violated \nFISA by conducting warrantless surveillance of Americans for more than \n5 years. They got caught. If they had not gotten caught, they probably \nwould still be doing it.\n  When the public found out about the President's illegal surveillance \nof Americans, this administration, and the telephone companies who may \nhave assisted them, were sued by citizens who believed their privacy \nrights were violated. Now, this administration is trying to convince \nCongress to terminate those lawsuits, in order to avoid accountability. \nWe should not allow that to happen.\n  The administration knows that these lawsuits may be the only way that \nit will ever be called to account for its illegal program of \nwarrantless surveillance and its flagrant disrespect for the rule of \nlaw. In running its program of warrantless surveillance this \nadministration relied on legal opinions, prepared in secret by a very \nsmall group of like-minded officials, who crafted those opinions to fit \nthe administration's agenda. Jack Goldsmith, who came in briefly to \nhead the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel, described the \nprogram as a ``legal mess.'' The administration does not want a court \nto get a chance to look at that mess, and retroactive immunity would \nensure that there is no court scrutiny of their actions.\n  Senator Rockefeller and I have been consulting since this summer to \nfind ways to obtain access to the information our members need to \nevaluate the administration's arguments for immunity. The \nadministration has consistently refused to provide this information to \nthe Judiciary Committee. In fact, in light of the administration's \nstonewalling, Chairman Specter was prepared to subpoena this \ninformation from the telephone companies during the last Congress. \nFinally, we obtained access, not only for the chairman and ranking \nmember, but for members of the Judiciary Committee. However, I believe \nall Senators should have access to this information, as well as those \nstaff with the appropriate clearance.\n  Instead of conducting warrantless surveillance in violation of FISA, \ntrying to cover it up, and then trying to justify the coverup, this \nadministration should have come to Congress immediately and asked for \nthe authority it is now claiming it needs.\n  I have drawn a different conclusion than Senator Rockefeller about \nretroactive immunity. I oppose granting blanket retroactive immunity. I \nagree with Senator Specter and many others that blanket retroactive \nimmunity, which would end ongoing lawsuits by legislative fiat, \nundermines accountability.\n  Immunity against future litigation is not the issue; the issue is \nretroactive immunity. If they followed the law, and FISA was not \nviolated, the telephone companies would automatically have immunity and \nthere would be no need for Congress to now duplicate that immunity.\n  I also would note that title I of the FISA law was changed during \nmarkup in the Senate Judiciary Committee. When we come back to this \nbill next year, it will be my intent to bring much of what we did in \nthe Judiciary Committee before the Senate for a vote.\n  Again, I want our intelligence agencies to be able to intercept the \ncommunications of those people overseas who are trying to do harm to \nthe United States. We all agree with that. But I want to make sure that \nAmericans' communications cannot be acquired by the executive for just \nany reason. If the Government is going to listen to the communications \nof Americans it must abide by the legal system that has served us so \nwell throughout the history of this country: court determination of the \nlegality of surveillance before it begins, and court oversight \nthroughout the process.\n  We hear from the administration and some of our colleagues that we \nmust grant immunity or the telephone companies will no longer cooperate \nwith the Government.\n  Senators should understand that if we do not grant retroactive \nimmunity, telecommunications carriers will still have immunity for \nactions they take in the future. If they follow the law, they have \nimmunity.\n  Instead, I will continue to work with Senator Specter, as well as \nwith Senators Feinstein and Whitehouse to try to craft a more effective \nalternative to retroactive immunity. We are working with the legal \nconcept of substitution to place the Government in the shoes of the \nprivate defendants that acted at its behest, and to let it assume full \nresponsibility for any illegal conduct.\n  I believe that requires reaching agreement that the lawsuits should \nbe able to reach the merits rather than be short-circuited by Congress, \nand that the program be subject to judicial review so that its legality \ncan be determined.\n  Again, this administration violated FISA by conducting warrantless \nsurveillance for more than 5-years. They got caught and they got sued. \nThe administration's insistence that those lawsuits be terminated by \ncongressional action is designed to insulate itself from \naccountability.\n  Retroactive immunity would do more than let the carriers off the \nhook. It would shield this administration from any accountability for \nconducting surveillance outside the law. It would leave the lawsuits \nthat are now working their way through the courts dead in their tracks \nand leave Americans whose privacy has been violated no chance to be \nmade whole.\n  These lawsuits are perhaps the only avenue that exists for an outside \nreview of the Government's actions. That kind of assessment is critical \nif our Government is to be held accountable. That is why I do not \nsupport legislation to terminate these legal challenges and I will vote \nto strike it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri has yielded earlier \nto the Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. GREGG. Would the Senator yield so I may propound a unanimous \nconsent request that I be recognized at the completion of her remarks?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I first want to comment on what a \npleasure it was listening to several hours of tribute to Senator Lott. \nI have not served with Senator Lott for very long, but at the point in \ntime that I, hopefully, would be allowed to decide to retire from the \nSenate, I could only hope I have such kind things said about me in so \nmany different ways.\n  I was glad I got an opportunity to listen to 3 hours of Senators \ntalking nicely about each other. It is an important thing to do this \ntime of year, and I think, frankly, it is an important thing to do more \noften, and we do not do enough of it around here, particularly across \nthe line.\n  I rise today to speak as in morning business for a few minutes about \nsomething that is on everybody's mind this time of year; that is, \ncredit cards. Now, I know why it is on my mind, because my fingers are \nhaving to do the shopping because I cannot get home to Missouri, and so \nI am having to click, click, click on the Internet. I now know my \ncredit card number by heart\n\n[[Page S15820]]\n\nbecause I have entered it so many times in the computer trying to get \ngifts for my family and my children. So I am very aware of my credit \ncard this time of year.\n  I have spent some time this year in the Senate looking at the issue \nof credit cards, and as we all are wringing our hands and gnashing our \nteeth over the subprime mortgage mess, I think we all need to begin to \nwring our hands and gnash our teeth about some of the credit card \npractices in this country. We have allowed the credit card industry to \nplay a little fast and loose with fairness.\n  I certainly fundamentally understand that people's obligations in \nterms of their credit, their unsecured credit on a credit card, are \nprimarily their responsibility and it is important that people be \nresponsible when they enter into debt, and it does not matter what kind \nof debt it is, whether it is credit card debt or any other kind of \ndebt. On the other hand, I have spent some time trying to read through \nthe fine print on some of these credit card agreements. Frankly, I have \nbeen trained as a lawyer, I have worked as a lawyer for most of my \nadult life, I have been a State legislator, I have now worked at the \nFederal level legislating, and I can't understand a lot of the fine \nprint on some of these credit card statements. If I can't understand \nthe fine print on a lot of these credit card statements, what shot does \nsomeone who has not spent as much time around the law as I have?\n  If you look at what is going on with the unsecured credit card \nindustry in terms of some of the fast-and-loose play with the rules, \nthe kinds of tricks that are being played--I will give you a great \nexample. We now know your interest rate can go up if you get near your \ncredit limit. We now know you can call and get an authorization to \ncharge money on your credit card, and they will let you do it even if \nyou go over your credit limit, and then they are going to charge you \nevery month an extra fee because you went over your credit limit, which \nthey said was okay for you to do. You never know this.\n  Imagine my interest when I learned in a hearing this year that they \ncan raise your interest rate on your credit card just by getting more \ncredit cards. So if you are going into a department store and they say: \nHey, you can get 15 percent off today if you open a credit card, you \ncan get 10 percent off today if you open a credit card, the act of \nopening those credit card accounts can increase your interest on \nanother credit card. Now, who would have thunk that? No one ever \nexplains that to the American consumer. No one ever explains that \ngetting at or near your credit limit on a number of credit cards could \nrequire your interest rates to go up even if you are paying your bills \non time, even if you have always paid exactly what you are supposed to \npay on time every month.\n  It is very important that we get a handle on this. This is a great \nexample. A member of my staff who knows I have been very interested in \nthis brought this in to me this week. We just had a hearing where we \nlearned that if you get to your credit limit, it is possible they will \nraise your interest rate even if you paid everything on time. Well, \nwhat is this? This staff member of mine had several thousand dollars \nleft in available credit on one of his credit cards. So what happens? \nHe gets checks in the mail from his credit card company, and the first \none is made out. Guess how much it is made out for. It is made out for \nan amount that will get him very close to his credit limit. So the idea \nhere is if you fill them all out, guess what. Bingo. You are over your \ncredit limit, and then all the fees and the extra interest rates start.\n  Well, I have to tell you--by the way, there is nothing on this that \nsays: If you go over your credit limit, not only will we charge you \nfees, but we are probably going to raise your interest rate. That is \nnever explained to the American consumer. That is not fair play.\n  Make it very clear to your credit card customer exactly what they are \ngoing to pay for and when. Fifty percent of the people who have credit \ncards in this country right now are paying minimum balances only, and \nthey don't understand they are in a hole they can't dig out of.\n  The credit card companies say: We have not had that much increase in \ndefaults. Well, I will tell you, here is what is different: A lot of \nthe credit card debt in this country--hundreds of billions of dollars \nof the credit card debt in this country--has been rolled into home \nequity lines of credit because of this housing boom we were on, and \neveryone was combining their credit cards, and a lot of that debt has \nbeen transferred to mortgage debt.\n  This is stuff that needs to get fixed, it needs to be fair, and the \nrules need to be clear to anyone because I will tell you, if we don't \nget it fixed, we are going to be wringing our hands and worrying about \nthe next big problem in our economy, and that is all this unsecured \ncredit that goes unpaid.\n  I think the credit card is a wonderful tool for Americans. It has \nallowed our country to consume at great levels, has kept our economy \npumping. But at the end of the day, if we don't require the credit card \ncompanies to make full disclosure in a way that everyone can understand \nexactly what they are charging for this very expensive form of credit, \nwe are going to regret it.\n  There are two pieces of legislation. First, Senator Levin and I have \nintroduced a Stop Unfair Credit Card Practices Act which prohibits some \nof the most egregious examples I have talked about that unfairly deepen \nor prolong credit card debt held by consumers.\n  The other piece of legislation is one I am cosponsoring with Senator \nKohl that deals with college students. Nothing strikes more fear in the \nheart of a parent who has two children in college than the idea that \nsomeone wants to send them credit cards right now.\n  I love my two children in college very much. I think they are smart \nand wonderful people. But, believe me, neither one of them has the \nresources to handle a credit card right now. The only resources they \nhave to handle a credit card right now are mine. If they want to send \nme the credit card, that is fine, and if I want to help my kids, that \nis fine, but the idea that we are now selling lists of college students \nto credit card companies so they can send them--by the way, one of \nthese credit card officials actually had the nerve to say in a hearing \nthat he found college students to be a very good risk. Well, yes, \nbecause their parents pay it off because they do want not want them to \nhave bad credit when they get out of college. But college students do \nnot have the wherewithal to take on unsecured debt. They are having a \nhard enough time just getting to class and getting everything done, \nmuch less taking on unsecured debt.\n  We need to stop some of these practices that are victimizing the \nAmerican consumer. We can do it. We can do it in the Senate. I look \nforward to working with my colleagues in the new year to see if we \ncan't make it a better year for middle-class America that is buried \nunder credit card debt without the playbook to show them how to get \nout.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to note with some sadness that we \nare reaching a point at the end of this session where it appears we \nwill adjourn without acting on any of the nominees for the Federal \nElection Commission. The effect of this will be to leave the Federal \nElection Commission with only two functioning commissioners, when the \nlaw calls for six. It is worse than that. The law insists that no \naction can be taken by the commission without the votes of at least \nfour. So by having only two left, we will leave\n\n[[Page S15821]]\n\nthe Federal Election Commission with no capacity to function.\n  I have a history with the Federal Election Commission which makes me \nsensitive to the importance of this group. When I was elected, there \nwas an allegation made against me which I considered highly partisan. \nIt went before the FEC and before the entire commission a vote was \ntaken, with the three Republicans upholding the position I took and the \nthree Democrats holding the position on the other side. Because they \ncould not muster four votes, nothing was done. In my view, this was \njustice. But the thing I found difficult was the fact that the \npartisanship on the FEC was so heavy, there was an almost automatic 3-3 \nvote on everything. It makes far more sense for the commissioners to \nwork together to recognize the merits of the case, rather than simply \nresponding in a knee-jerk partisan fashion to the individual or group \nthat is bringing the charge. In my case, that is what was happening. A \nDemocratic group brought the charge that I had violated the law. The \nthree Democrats on the FEC automatically agreed with that, and the \nthree Republicans automatically disagreed. I don't think, frankly, any \nof them spent any time examining the merits. If they had, I am sure I \nwould have been unanimously exonerated, but that is not the way it \nworked in those days.\n  It got to the point here on the floor where a piece of legislation \nwas introduced saying, whenever there is a tie in the FEC, the general \ncounsel will break the tie. Along with Senator McConnell, I and others \ndid our best to defeat that bill because it would have de facto made \nthe general counsel of the FEC the sole decisionmaker for that body.\n  I am happy to report that those days seem to have passed. We now have \nan FEC where the vast majority of the votes are unanimous, where \npartisanship seems to have taken a back seat to an attempt to get \nthings right and act on the merits rather than the partisan challenge.\n  Four of the members of the FEC are recess appointees who must be \nconfirmed. The President has sent forward four names--two Republicans \nand two Democrats. In the standard tradition, practice, procedure, and \nprecedent of the FEC, the Democratic leadership in the Congress got to \npick the two Democrats. The Republican leadership got to pick the two \nRepublicans. Always before we have moved these nominations forward en \nbloc, maintaining the balance between Republicans and Democrats, with \nRepublicans approving the Democratic nominations, and Democrats \napproving the Republican nominations.\n  In our committee, the Rules Committee on which I have the honor to \nsit, we sent all four of the names en bloc to the Senate. There was \ngreat controversy about one of them, which I will address, but in the \nspirit of the past history of the committee, instead of singling out \nthis one individual to come to the Senate without recommendation, we \nsaid we will treat all four of them alike, and all four names came to \nthe Senate without recommendation so that the Senate could work its \nwill.\n  Now because of the controversy surrounding one of the Republican \nnominees, it becomes clear we will not have a vote on any of the four, \nproducing the deadlock I described at the opening of my remarks. We \nwill have only two functioning FEC commissioners beginning next year, \nand the FEC will not be able to rule on any of the controversies that \nmay arise in the 2008 election. Furthermore, the FEC will not be able \nto distribute any Presidential matching funds in the 2008 election. \nThis comes as bad news to some of our colleagues in the Senate, because \nmany of them were dependent upon and expecting the matching funds to \ncome out of the Presidential campaign fund. They will not get them, \nbecause these nominees will not be approved. Who is the one who is \ncausing all of this problem? His name is Hans von Spakovsky. He has \nbeen attacked by outside groups on the grounds that he is somehow \ninsensitive to minority voters.\n\n  I wish to spend a moment examining that particular attack. It all \ncomes back to a position Mr. von Spakovsky took when he was at the \nCivil Rights Division of the Justice Department and recommended the \npre-clearance of a voter ID law. There were those who were career \nattorneys in the Civil Rights Division who said a voter ID law is \nterrible and should not go forward. But Mr. von Spakovsky disagreed \nwith them. Then, acting on Mr. von Spakovsky's recommendation, the \nmanagement of the Justice Department said: No, we are going to go \nforward.\n  According to those who have attacked Mr. von Spakovsky, he was \noverruled by a court. The court did issue an injunction, saying that \nthe voter ID law could not be enforced, thus leaving the impression \nthat von Spakovsky is an ideologue, while the career attorneys were \nsimply doing their job and the court stepped in to protect the country \nfrom this ideologue. In fact, the injunction had to do simply with the \ntiming of the implementation of the law and was not a determination on \nthe merits of the case, with the court saying it didn't want the law \nenforced right now but wanted to wait until the matter could be fully \nconsidered.\n  After the case was heard, a Federal judge, one appointed by President \nCarter, although that probably shouldn't make any difference, and the \none who had initially issued the injunction, upheld the \nconstitutionality of the Georgia voter ID law and, in that fashion, \nratified the position Mr. von Spakovsky had taken all along. Mr. von \nSpakovsky's position was consistent with the ruling of the Federal \ncourt that said the career attorneys who argued with him were wrong. He \nwas on the right side of the law; they were on the wrong side of the \nlaw. Yet he is being attacked as somehow being the ideologue who must \nbe kept off the FEC lest the FEC be turned into some kind of partisan \nhotbed of difficulty and dissension.\n  The fact is, Mr. von Spakovsky has served on the FEC as a recess \nappointee for 2 years. We need not project what he would do if he were \nconfirmed. We can look at what he has done in that 2-year period. To \nthat point, I repeat that the vast majority of the cases that have been \ndealt with since he has been on the FEC have been unanimous. He has not \nbeen a lone voice seeking to destroy the FEC or turn it into some kind \nof partisan hotbed. He has acted completely in the mainstream, in the \nopinion of the other members of the FEC.\n  Let me quote from one of the Democratic members of the FEC, repeating \nagain these people are appointed for their partisan positions. This is \nnot a circuit court where you want to find someone who is above \npartisanship. This is where the law specifically says there will be \nthree Republicans and three Democrats.\n  This is what Mr. Walther, a Democratic member of the FEC, had to say \nat the December 14 FEC meeting. This is from a very recent article. He \nsaid Mr. von Spakovsky was ``a terrific person to work with'' as a \ncolleague, a ``fine commissioner.'' The article continues: ``He \n(Walther) spoke after Mr. von Spakovsky made a traditional nominating \nspeech, praising Mr. Walther's qualifications to be vice chairman. Mr. \nWalther's comments echoed a speech during the FEC meeting by Mr. \nLenhard to close his year-long chairmanship by praising bipartisan \ncooperation on the commission and recounting the FEC's accomplishments \nin resolving enforcement cases.''\n  One of the things we hear around here during confirmation battles is, \nthe President ought to make more mainstream nominations. Not for this \none; this one, by law, is supposed to be partisan. But here is a man \nwho has had 2 years of experience, 2 years of service, being praised \nfor his activities, clearly in the mainstream, being attacked for a \nposition he held before he came to the FEC where polls have been done \nand found that 81 percent of Americans, with only 7 percent dissenting, \nagree with Mr. von Spakovsky's position that we ought to have voter ID.\n  We have photo ID requirements in order to keep cigarettes out of the \nhands of teenagers. We have photo ID requirements in order to keep \nterrorists off airplanes. I have had the experience in my home State of \nUtah, where I like to think I am fairly well known, of being asked for \na photo ID when I have presented a credit card, in an effort to avoid \nidentity theft.\n  Isn't preventing voter fraud as important as keeping tobacco out of \nthe\n\n[[Page S15822]]\n\nhands of teenagers or preventing identity theft? Eighty-one percent of \nAmericans agree with von Spakovsky's position on this matter. Yet he is \nbeing attacked as being outside the mainstream for what his critics \ncall a partisan position.\n  Because of the holds that have been placed on Commissioner von \nSpakovsky's nomination, we now come to this impasse where the FEC will \nbe left with only two Commissioners, unable to rule on any potential \nviolation that may occur in the 2008 election--a Presidential year, \nalong with all of the Senate races that are up, and every Member of the \nHouse of Representatives. The FEC will not be able to rule on any \nviolations because they will have only two Commissioners--all because \nof an ideological bent pushed by groups outside of the Congress saying \nthat this one man, because he agrees with 81 percent of the American \npeople, is somehow disqualified for being too partisan.\n  The principle has always been that the Republicans pick the \nRepublican nominees for the FEC and the Democrats pick the Democratic \nnominees for the FEC--a principle that makes sense. I do not know very \nmuch about the Democratic nominees for these positions who will not be \nconfirmed, and, frankly, I do not care because they are not mine to \nselect. They have been picked by the Democratic leadership to represent \nthe Democratic position, and I am willing to vote for them on that \nbasis.\n  Mr. von Spakovsky has a 2-year history of acting intelligently, with \ngreat integrity, and great collegiality in this position, and it is a \ntragedy that the whole Commission will be denied the opportunity to \nfunction in a Presidential year; that those Presidential candidates who \nare depending on Presidential matching funds will not get them because \noutside groups have demonized this one public servant. It is a sad day \nthat this kind of thing is happening with respect to our governmental \nappointments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I see the distinguished Senator from West \nVirginia. I certainly do not want to preempt him if he wants to go \nnext. Does the Senator have a preference? If not, I will go ahead, if \nthat is OK.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/18/senate-section/article/S15822-1", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15822]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     IN MEMORY OF THOMAS B. MURPHY\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I rise on a sad occasion for me \npersonally and for my State, but also in some sense a proud time for me \nto be able to acknowledge the life and times of Thomas B. Murphy.\n  Last night, at 10 o'clock, in Bremen, GA, in Haralson County, Thomas \nB. Murphy died from the complications of a stroke that for the last 4 \nyears kept him, at best, semiconscious and in a very difficult state.\n  But in those previous 79 years of life, he is probably the most \nremarkable political figure in the history of the State of Georgia. \nElected speaker of the house in 1974, he maintained that position until \n2002--for 28 years--longer than any speaker of any legislature in the \nhistory of the United States of America.\n  He was the son of a primitive Baptist preacher by weekend and a \nrailroad telegraph man by day. He was a product of the Depression. And \nhe was Irish. He was tough as nails but had a heart of gold. He was a \nDemocrat through and through, and proudly stated his absolute distaste \nfor any Republican.\n  For 8 years of my 17 years in the Georgia Legislature, I was the \nRepublican leader of the Georgia House. To give you an idea of what a \nminority is really like, I was 1 of 19 Republicans, and there were 161 \nDemocrats. I understood what being a minority leader was all about.\n  Tom Murphy was a powerful, forceful leader. But from the day I met \nhim, when I was first elected in 1976, to the last day I held his hand, \nthis past April, by his bed in Bremen, GA, he was always fair, he was \nalways good, and he did what was best for the State.\n  Tom Murphy did not play golf. He did not play tennis. He raised \ntomatoes in his garden. His house is a modest brick ranch in Bremen, \nGA. His trade as a country lawyer was exceeded only by his skill as a \npolitician. He never cared for money. He never cared for fame. He never \ncared for attention. His favorite day of the year was March 17, St. \nPatrick's Day, for which he would summarily adjourn the Georgia \nLegislature so he and his entourage could go to Savannah, GA, and be a \npart of the second largest St. Patrick's Day parade in America, in \nSavannah, on St. Patrick's Day.\n  His second favorite thing was to hold his grandchildren in his lap as \nhe sat on the throne of the speaker of the house of representatives, \nand let them watch over his presiding of the Georgia House.\n  But this common, tough, fine man did so much for our State it is \nalmost difficult to describe. We would not have a Metropolitan Atlanta \nRapid Transit Authority were it not for Tom Murphy. He delivered the \nrural vote for the urban city of Atlanta in 1974 to get mass transit \nand to raise the taxes to do it. If you ever watched the Super Bowl in \nthe Georgia Dome, the Georgia Dome would have never been built were it \nnot for Tom Murphy.\n  As to the Georgia World Congress Center, there is not a Member of \nthis Senate who has not been there because almost every convention in \nAmerica goes through there once every couple years. It would never have \nbeen built were it not for Tom Murphy. Our rural roads and highways, \nthe Governor's Road Improvement Program, would never have happened were \nit not for Tom Murphy.\n  But of all the great legacies and edifices that will be named after \nhim, and have been named after him, his legacy will live on not through \nbuildings and institutions but through people because Tom Murphy cared \nthe most about people. And he cared the most about people who were poor \nand people who were disadvantaged.\n\n  Tom Murphy's legacy is the children who were born in poverty who came \nout of poverty and became successful because of the programs he put in \nplace as speaker of the house. Tom Murphy's legacy will live on because \nof those who know, as a foster child or as a child in trouble, it was \nTom Murphy who was there to give a hand up, not a handout.\n  Tom Murphy will be honored this Friday in the State capitol, where he \nwill lie in state, and where his funeral will take place--a State \ncapitol where for 28 years, through five Governors, he ruled the State \nof Georgia--not in the sense of a ruler or a tyrant but in the sense of \na proud man whose time and destiny came together in the great State of \nGeorgia. I will mourn his loss for all I learned from him.\n  I end my remarks by telling you about that day I sat by his bed this \npast April and held his hand. He could not communicate, but I knew he \nwas awake. I said: Mr. Speaker, I am now in the U.S. Senate. And I just \nwanted to tell you I am a better man, and I probably got there because \nof the painful and wise lessons I learned from you.\n  A tear came in his eye, and he squeezed my hand. I knew, as we \ncommunicated first in 1976, we communicated once again. And from the \nday I knew him in 1976, to the last day I knew him this year, I \nrespected him, I honored him, and I loved him.\n  Georgia appreciates the service Tom Murphy gave to all her people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/18/senate-section/article/S15822-2", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15822-S15823]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 LIHEAP\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, let me begin by thanking my good friend, \nthe distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee, for \nyielding.\n  The reason I rise is to deal with a very important issue that impacts \nmillions of our fellow Americans, and that is all over this country, \nwith the price of home heating oil soaring, people are wondering about \nhow they are going to stay warm this winter. My very fervent hope is \nthat the Congress, both the Senate and the House, will address this \nissue before we adjourn for the Christmas holidays.\n  I commend Majority Leader Reid, Minority Leader McConnell, the \nchairman of the Appropriations Committee, Senator Byrd, Chairman \nHarkin, and others for, in fact, adding a significant sum of money--\nover $400\n\n[[Page S15823]]\n\nmillion--to the Omnibus appropriations bill. This is important, and I \nappreciate that. I think people all over this country appreciate that.\n  Unfortunately, however, this total of $2.6 billion in funding for \nLIHEAP, the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, that so many \npeople, so many elderly people depend upon in order to stay warm in the \nwintertime, while it is an 18-percent increase from last year, it is \nstill 23 percent below what was provided for LIHEAP just 2 years ago in \nnominal dollars. Meanwhile, as everybody knows, the cost of home \nheating fuels has soared. Compared to 2 years ago, heating oil prices \nare projected to be 50 percent higher this winter. The price of propane \nwill be 38 percent higher, and electricity prices will be 14 percent \nhigher. These high prices, coupled with the reduction in LIHEAP \nassistance compared to 2 years ago, mean States will be forced to \neither reduce the number of people who will be receiving LIHEAP or else \nto significantly cut back on the amount of money that people will be \nreceiving. There is no question about what will happen if that occurs: \nPeople in the United States of America will be cold. It is possible \nthat some may actually be freezing.\n  Two years ago, thanks to the leadership of Senator Snowe and many \nother Senators, LIHEAP funding was increased by $1 billion above the \nappropriated level because it was then the belief that we faced a home \nheating emergency. Well, if we faced a home heating emergency at that \npoint, let me tell my colleagues we face one today that is even more \nsevere. In the State of Vermont and all over this country, we are \nhaving elderly people living on fixed incomes who are looking at the \nsoaring prices of home heating fuels. They are scared to death. It \nseems to me that we have the moral responsibility as the Senate of the \nUnited States of America to do something for those people before we \nadjourn.\n  I thank my colleague, Senator Leahy from Vermont, as well as Senators \nColeman, Klobuchar, Snowe, Obama, Dole, Baucus, Sununu, Cantwell, \nCollins, Casey, Lieberman, Landrieu, Kerry, Kennedy, and Clinton for \nsupporting an amendment that will essentially increase LIHEAP funding \nby $800 million, half of which will go into the normal LIHEAP formula, \nhalf will go into emergency funding to be used at the discretion of the \nPresident.\n  While those Senators are already onboard, I know there are many other \nSenators--Republicans, Democrats, and Independents--who are also \nwanting a vote to show the people back home that we have not forgotten \nthem and that we do not want any Americans to go cold this winter.\n  Let me simply conclude by suggesting to you that the people of our \ncountry all over America are losing faith in the U.S. Government. That \nis no secret. Polling for the President, polling for Congress is at an \nalmost all-time low. They think we are concerned about a whole lot of \nissues, but we are not concerned about them. It seems to me that before \nwe go home to our well-heated homes, before we go home to our vacation \ntime, that we not turn our backs on some of those who are most in need. \nI think we have to act boldly to restore faith in the U.S. Government, \nand I hope that before we leave, we can get a vote on this floor with \nbipartisan support, and that we can move this process forward.\n  Mr. President, with that, I thank my good friend, Senator Byrd, the \noutstanding leader of our Appropriations Committee, for yielding, and I \nyield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the very distinguished Senator for \nhis remarks.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Senator from West Virginia has the \nfloor, but would he yield me at least a couple minutes in reference to \nwhat my colleague from Vermont just spoke about?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes, Mr. President. I am glad to do so.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman. I agree \nwith what the Senator from Vermont has just said. In our State, cold \nweather is not a rarity, it is a fact of life, especially this time of \nthe year. The thermometer on my front steps goes down to 20 below zero. \nMany times there is no mercury showing because it has gone below that.\n  Now, that is not theoretical cold, that is cold you die from. I know \nwhat it has cost us in filling the tank for my own furnace this year, \nand I wonder how many people who are not privileged to have the kind of \nsalaries all of us do, how they possibly do it. It is not a matter of \njust help; this is a matter of life or death. It is not a matter of \njust comfort. We are not talking about the weather being in the fifties \nand perhaps you can just put on more sweaters or more coats; we are \ntalking about it being 5 or 10 and 15 and 20 degrees below zero, or \neven today in Burlington, VT, it began at zero. The temperature was at \nzero, and then it warmed up from last night. In those situations you \ndie if you don't have heat. It is not a question of being comfortable; \nyou die. It is as simple as that. You die. There are a lot of people \nwho cannot afford this.\n  I will work with the distinguished Senator from Vermont, as I have \nwith my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, in trying to get more \nmoney after this bill is passed for LIHEAP. I know the distinguished \nSenator from West Virginia has supported us every single time on \nLIHEAP. He also knows what it is like in those rural areas of West \nVirginia where people barely eke out a living and what happens to them \nwhen the snow is falling and it is cold outside and the children are \ncrying because they are cold and the parents are doing everything \npossible to keep them warm. We will work on this.\n  I thank the Senator from West Virginia for yielding me the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/18/senate-section/article/S15823-1", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15823-S15826]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 CONSOLIDATED APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the Constitution grants to Congress an \nextensive array of powers, each of which in one way or another touches \nthe lives of every 1 of the 300 million people who live in America \ntoday. But of all of those powers so carefully inscribed in article I, \nnone is so powerful or so necessary for the welfare of our country as \nthe power to appropriate monies--monies from the Federal Treasury. But \nit is not simply within the power of the Congress to appropriate funds \nfor the operation of the Government. It is a duty that must be \nexercised each year without fail and without excuses. The operation of \nthe Government to enforce our laws, to serve our people, to protect our \nliberties depends upon Congress providing the funds that are necessary \nto do so.\n\n  The bill that will soon be before the Senate, the Consolidated \nAppropriations Act of 2008, is essential legislation for the country. \nIt includes 11 of the 12 annual appropriations bills. In all, it \nappropriates $473.5 billion--spelled with a B, Mr. President, a capital \nB. That is $473.50 for every minute since Jesus Christ was born.\n  It appropriates $473.5 billion for the operations of nearly every \nagency in the Federal Government, save for those funded by the already-\napproved Defense Appropriations Act.\n  The bill contains an additional $42.2 billion in emergency spending, \nincluding $31 billion for the war in Afghanistan and for force \nprotection for our troops--American troops, our troops--in Iraq. I \nwasn't for going there; I was against our going into Iraq. But we are \nthere. We are talking about our troops who are there in Iraq.\n  The President's budget, as submitted, simply did not include \nsufficient funds for the health of our veterans. This bill provides \n$3.7 billion more than requested to make sure the Veterans' \nAdministration can provide better care for our veterans.\n  The bill also includes $3 billion of emergency spending for border \nsecurity, $622 million for drought relief, $300 million for \nfirefighting in the West, and $250 million for low-income home energy \nassistance. Emergency funds totaling $2.4 billion are also included for \npeacekeeping operations in Darfur, refugee assistance, and other \nforeign assistance programs. We also approved $194 million for the \nreplacement of the bridge which recently fell into the Mississippi \nRiver.\n  The consolidated appropriations bill contains an unprecedented level \nof transparency and accountability for Member-requested projects and \nearmarks. Each and every earmark contained in the bill or described in \nthe explanatory statement is accounted for\n\n[[Page S15824]]\n\nin the tables that are part of the joint explanatory statement. These \ntables describe the project, they describe the level of funding \napproved, and they provide a list of the Members of either the House or \nthe Senate who requested the item. It is there, as clear as the \nnoonday's Sun in a cloudless sky. How is that, Bernie? We are not \nsupposed to address other Members directly, but in this instance, I \nknow I will be forgiven.\n  These tables, as I say, describe the level of funding approved and a \nlist of the Members of either the House or the Senate who requested the \nitem. All information required by Senate rule XLIV is included in the \nexplanatory statement accompanying the amendment. Read it, Senate rule \nXLIV.\n  The total dollars that are earmarked is reduced--hear me now--by 43 \npercent. That ``ain't'' chickenfeed. The total dollars that are \nearmarked is reduced by 43 percent compared to the appropriations bills \nsigned into law by the President 2 years ago.\n  It is imperative this bill be approved not the week after next, not \nnext week but this week. Last May, Congress passed a budget resolution \nthat balanced the budget by 2012 and permitted Congress to approve \nappropriations bills at a level of $21.2 billion above the President's \nrequest.\n  The Senate was able to work constructively on a bipartisan basis to \naddress the needs of the American people. After the deadly bridge \ncollapse in Minnesota, the Senate voted 88 to 7 to provide additional \nfunds to repair crumbling bridges. At a time when crime rates are on \nthe rise, the Senate voted for a bill that puts more cops--yes, they \nprotect you, they protect me--more cops on the street by a vote of 75 \nto 19. While oil prices are soaring, the Senate voted 75 to 19 to pass \na bill providing more help to low-income families so they can pay their \nheating bills this winter.\n  After the shocking state of the Walter Reed Army Medical Hospital \nmade the news, the Senate voted 92 to 1 to approve a bill increasing VA \nspending to allow better care for our returning warriors.\n  Because our borders are in need of additional enforcement to stem the \ntide of illegal immigration, the Senate voted 89 to 1 to approve an \namendment with billions more for border security.\n  This bipartisan cooperation on moving the appropriations process \nforward, while addressing the crucial needs of this country, would not \nhave been possible without the diligent work of the committee's ranking \nmember. Who is that ranking member? The distinguished and able and \nvenerable Senator Thad Cochran--may his tribe increase. That is from \nAbou Ben Adhem, in case you have forgotten.\n  It is refreshing to know that in this era in which each political \nparty is urged to view the other as a mortal enemy, there is hope for \nat least one oasis of comity in which the duty to govern is still taken \nseriously. I thank my friend, Senator Thad Cochran, and all the other \nMembers of the Appropriations Committee for their hard work, their \ndiligent work to produce each--now listen to this--each of the 12 \nappropriations bills and for all their cooperation in the assembly of \nthis Consolidated Appropriations Act.\n\n  Sadly, the President does not share our view that we must invest in \nAmerica, apparently. The President--your President, my President, our \nPresident--proposed to increase the Defense budget by 10 percent. The \nPresident proposed to increase foreign aid by 12 percent. The \nPresident--your President, my President, our President--proposed $195 \nbillion of emergency spending for the wars, and yet the President \nbelieves this 7-percent increase we sought for domestic programs was \nfiscally irresponsible. As a result, he, the President--your President, \nmy President, our President--threatened to veto 9 of the 12 \nappropriations bills.\n  Under our Constitution, the President has the power to veto. He does. \nNobody disputes that. And the President made it clear, crystal clear, \nas clear as the noonday's Sun in a cloudless sky, that he intended to \nveto our bills.\n  We are already 10 weeks into the new fiscal year. It is time to \ngovern. There is a time in the affairs of men when we say it is time to \ngovern. There must be compromise from time to time, and so working \ntogether across the aisle, such as Senator Thad Cochran and I--we shake \nhands, we argue, we debate, and we contend with one another. At the end \nof the day, we put our arms around each other and walk out of this \nSenate together. So working together across the aisle, we have cut \n$17.5 billion from the original levels approved by the Appropriations \nCommittee. As a result, domestic programs receive only a 3-percent \nincrease. I am not pleased with this outcome, but I urge all Senators \nto support the consolidated bill.\n  Within the limits set by the President, we have funded as best we \ncould, the essential priorities of this Nation--your country, my \ncountry. For our veterans, this package includes a record $43.1 billion \nin funding for the VA. That is a lot of money, $43.1 billion in funding \nfor the VA, an increase of $3.7 billion over the President's request.\n  The bill provides $37.2 billion for veterans health care, and an \nadditional $124 million is included to hire more VA personnel to reduce \na 6-month backlog of benefit claims.\n  Funding for the National Institutes of Health is $613 million above \nthe President's request.\n  Energy prices are going through the roof, and we provide $788 million \nmore than the President requested for the Low-Income Home Energy \nAssistance Program, which gives 2 million more families additional help \nfor winter heating bills at a time of these record oil prices.\n  Despite the fact that violent crime is on the rise--hear this, \nviolent crime is on the rise--for the first time in 15 years, the \nPresident wanted to cut State and local law enforcement, but--there is \nthat conjunction ``but''--we have restored $1.2 billion to that unwise \ncut.\n  Under the President's request, 600,000 women, infants, and children \nwould lose important nutrition assistance. We fully fund--yes, we fully \nfund--the WIC program.\n  This package also makes education a priority--education a priority--\nby increasing Head Start by $114 million, stopping the proposed cut of \n30,000 slots for early childhood education. This additional $118 \nmillion for No Child Left Behind means that tens of thousands of \ndisadvantaged students will get the help they need to succeed in \nschool. For college students, the amount for Pell grants is increased \nto $4,731 per year.\n  The President proposed to eliminate or slash numerous programs for \nour rural communities, such as rural health, rural housing, and clean \nwater programs, but we have restored money for all of those programs.\n  The President wanted to slash funding for vital infrastructure \nprograms, but we--the Congress--have increased funding: For highways? \nYes. For repairing bridges? Yes. For airport improvements? Yes. And for \nAmtrak. Amtrak. All aboard for Amtrak.\n  At my direction, the bill includes a $20 million increase above the \nPresident's request for mine safety. Now I know something about that. I \nknow something about the need for mine safety. I am the son of a coal \nminer.\n  This money will save lives.\n  Despite the failure of FEMA to adequately respond to Hurricane \nKatrina, the President wanted to slash funding by over $1.5 billion for \nfirst responders. We restore those cuts--how about that--and actually \nincrease funding by $544 million.\n  I am pleased also that the bill includes $31 billion for the wars in \nIraq--I was against that war. I said we ought not go in there; we have \nno business being in there, but we are in there--and Afghanistan--I was \nfor that war--including $16 billion for the war in Afghanistan, over \n$10 billion for force protection in Iraq, such as body armor and \nsystems to defeat IEDs, $1.1 billion for the Wounded Warrior program, \nand $4 billion for other programs. It is a balanced package--a balanced \npackage--and I support it.\n  The bill invests in the security of our homeland and supports the men \nand the women who are on the front lines of protecting our communities. \nThe Border Patrol will hire 3,000 more Border Patrol agents to protect \nour borders. We nearly double funding for port security, chemical \nsecurity--we know what that is about down in the Canaan Valley of West \nVirginia--and transit and rail security. The Justice Department will \nhire 100 new U.S. Marshals, 200 DEA agents, and 160 FBI agents, and we \nprovide funding for hundreds of\n\n[[Page S15825]]\n\nnew cops at the State and local level. Finally, we more than double \nfunding, to a total of $108 million, for screening and treating \nillnesses suffered by those who bravely responded to the 9/11 attacks \nat the World Trade Center.\n  Because so many Americans are worried about their mortgages and the \nspecter of foreclosure, this bill adds $180 million to provide credit \ncounseling and foreclosure mitigation to subprime borrowers.\n  These are not just meaningless numbers on an obscure government \nledger. There are consequences for our failure to invest in America. \nDid everybody hear that? There are consequences for our failure to \ninvest in America. Bridges fall, fires destroy, hurricanes devastate. \nPeople get sick from food that is not inspected and drugs that are not \nadequately tested. Our schools, our roads, our transportation systems \nare all in need of serious attention.\n  This bill is a genuine effort to compromise so that we can move \nforward. It is a balanced bill. It is the result of over a month of \nbipartisan negotiations. For the sake of the welfare of our Nation, it \nis time--time, time--to govern. The ``gotcha'' politics that prevail in \nWashington must end. To continue it damages our country from within and \ndamages our country from without and discredits both political \nparties--your party, my party--both political parties.\n  With respect to the explanatory statement for the bill, the House-\napproved amendment to H.R. 2764, was filed with the House Committee on \nRules by Representative Obey at approximately midnight Sunday night, \nDecember 16, 2007. Accompanying the amendment is an explanatory \nstatement contained in the Congressional Record of December 17, 2007. \nThat statement, like the amendment, is the product of bipartisan, \nbicameral negotiations. The joint explanatory statement is the final \nvehicle for conveying congressional intent with respect to purposes for \nwhich appropriations are made.\n  In order to assure that there is no ambiguity as to congressional \nintent, the House amendment includes a provision that provides that the \nexplanatory statement submitted by Mr. Obey and printed in the Record \nwill serve the purpose of a conference report for determining \ncongressional intent. I fully endorse this provision, for in its \nabsence, this Administration, which strives to overturn statutory \nlanguage in its bill signing statements, would completely ignore \ncongressional intent.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be able to join my \ndistinguished friend from West Virginia in advising the Senate that we \nhave before us the Omnibus appropriations bill. It has been a long and \ndifficult road getting to this point.\n  The President, in February, delivered a budget request to the \nCongress that included a robust increase for our Armed Forces, very few \nincreases for nondefense discretionary programs, along with many \nproposed program cuts. Then, in the spring, the new majority in \nCongress laid out a very different vision for discretionary programs, \none that called for some $23 billion in additional spending. We have \nbefore us an Omnibus appropriations bill that reflects many of the \nspending priorities of the Congress, both from the majority and \nminority perspectives, but the bill also reflects the very real concern \nabout overall spending levels held by the President and most Members, \ncertainly on the Republican side of the aisle.\n  The bill is, without question, an imperfect product of an imperfect \nprocess, but I think every Member of this body would rather have the \nopportunity to vote on appropriations bills individually rather than \nlumped together in one giant omnibus bill. I regret that the Senate did \nnot take up and consider all 12 of the appropriations bills \nindividually. When we fail to take up all of the bills, we invite the \ncreation of an omnibus bill, lumping all the other bills together, such \nas this one, and we weaken the opportunity for the Senate to influence \nthe content of these bills and shape the final legislation. I hope next \nyear the leader will redouble his efforts to make time for \nconsideration of all the appropriations bills, even though it is quite \npossible that we will again disagree with the President over \nappropriate amounts of discretionary spending.\n  Having said that, this omnibus bill is, in my view, superior to many \nof its predecessors in one sense: It contains virtually none of the \nlegislative matter that is so often added to omnibus bills. And I give \ngreat credit to the chairman, my friend from West Virginia, and our two \nleaders, Mr. Reid and Mr. McConnell, for this fact. The business of the \nAppropriations Committee is complicated enough without importing \nlegislative baggage from other committees in a way that often undercuts \nthe delicate bipartisan and bicameral negotiations in other arenas.\n  I also note that the bill includes none of the riders or funding \nprohibitions that the President previously identified as likely to \nprompt a veto. While I am sure this is a disappointment to some \nSenators, it is an important factor in our being able to support the \nomnibus portion of this bill.\n  I also wish to touch briefly on the subject of earmarks. Much has \nbeen made about earmarking throughout the year. Clearly, there have \nbeen past cases of abuse, just as historically there have been abuses \nof legislative powers in other areas. I hope the heightened scrutiny \nand transparency of the appropriations process will eliminate any such \nabuses going forward. The Appropriations Committee and its staff have \nmade extraordinary efforts to add transparency to the process going \nback to well before the enactment of the ethics reform bill.\n  I think all Senators are comfortable in openly defending the funding \npriorities they advocate and suggest be included in appropriations \nbills, and they should be. This is another reason why it is so \nimportant that the Senate make time to consider all of the \nappropriations bills in an orderly process.\n  The total amount of congressional earmarks funded in this bill is \nwell below the level included in the fiscal year 2006 appropriations \nbills. I know the amount is reduced because we hear the protests from \nour colleagues and from our constituents as well. Whether the amount of \nearmarking in this bill is ideal, I don't know. I suppose it depends on \nthe interests of the beholder. What I do know is Congress should never \nyield its right or its power to make annual spending decisions and \ninclude those decisions in the appropriations bills. Congress should \nnot leave it up to the executive branch, and it should not be persuaded \nthat last year's decisions are the right ones for the next year. That \nis why we have an annual process. Enacting a long-term, continuing \nresolution might appear to be an easy way to avoid controversy and \ndisagreements. It is an abdication of our responsibilities.\n\n  If Congress has to undergo vetoes of appropriations bills and make \nmodifications to bills as a result, so be it. But ultimately we need to \nfinish our work in a timely fashion and provide Federal agencies and \ndepartments with a set of directives and spending priorities that \nreflect the collective will of the legislative branch in consultation \nwith the executive branch. That is why we have hearings at the \nbeginning of the annual appropriations process, to get the views of the \nadministrators of the programs, to invite executives from the various \ndepartments to tell us what their challenges are, tell us what the \nPresident's priorities are, what the Cabinet Secretaries have to say \nabout their needs and their suggestions for appropriate funding levels. \nWe take those into account. These are serious issues that have to be \nconsidered by the Congress. That is what the Appropriations Committee \ntries to do every year, in reviewing the President's budget requests \nand the information we receive at our annual hearings.\n  Finally, I wish to say something about a part of this bill that is \nwithout question one that has to be fixed. The amendment adopted by the \nHouse of Representatives includes $31 billion to fund the deployment of \nAmerican men and women overseas in the global war on terror. But the \nHouse amendment restricts operating funds to those fighting in \nAfghanistan and does very little to support our troops deployed in \nIraq. While I understand the political needle the House was attempting \nto thread when it wrote this amendment, I think the message it sends to \nour men and women who are deployed in these countries is unfortunate.\n\n[[Page S15826]]\n\n  The Senate dedicated a serious amount of floor time to the debate of \nIraq policy this year. The debate was, of course, earnest and sometimes \ninformative. Amendments have been offered and votes were taken on \nissues related to the war. Yet while the debates demonstrated a strong \nand sincere desire among Members to successfully conclude operations in \nIraq as quickly as possible, there remains no broad consensus on any \nparticular alternative to the policy currently advocated by the \nPresident or Ambassador Crocker or General Petraeus.\n  Let's be honest, that policy has produced undeniable successes in \nrecent months. I am sure deeply felt disagreements remain on the \nsubject of Iraq policy. But we have tens of thousands of American men \nand women who are deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan, performing missions \nassigned to them by our Government and with the blessing of Congress at \nthe outset. Those men and women need the resources to succeed. To try \nto change American policy in Iraq by slowly starving our troops of \nresources they need is unfair to them and very dangerous to our \nNation's interests. We should reject the House language and provide \nadequate funding to support our troops until well into next year.\n  I wish to end my remarks by thanking and commending our chairman, Mr. \nByrd, my dear friend. We have worked together in writing and \nnegotiating these appropriations bills and this package that is coming \nbefore the Senate. I know we haven't been able to agree on everything, \nbut we have reached an accommodation so that we present this now at \nthis point and urge its adoption. I thank all Senators who served with \nus on the committee for their diligent efforts.\n  Last year, we had a large appropriations train wreck. We do not want \nthat again. It produced a large supplemental funding bill. But we \nbrought together a bill this year, despite new rules and hard \nnegotiations--renegotiations. I thank all our members for their hard \nwork on both sides of the appropriations committee, and I am happy we \nwill be able to present this bill to the Senate.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank my able friend for his generous \nremarks, for his good work on the committee, and for his kind \nleadership. I wish for him and all his loved ones a very merry \nChristmas, in the old-time way.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for about 4 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/18/senate-section/article/S15826-1", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15826]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   THE RETIREMENT OF DR. BILL HOGARTH\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, at the end of the year my good friend Dr. \nBill Hogarth will be leaving his position as the leader of the National \nMarine Fisheries Service. Bill is the Assistant Administrator for \nFisheries for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and \nhis departure will mark the end of a 6-year tenure in this post.\n  Throughout Bill's career with the National Marine Fisheries Service, \nI have had many opportunities to work with him on Fisheries issues \ncritical to the State of Alaska, to the Nation, and to international \nfisheries management organizations. Bill's knowledge of our fisheries \nand commitment to science-based management have helped to conserve and \nrebuild many of our most important fish stocks, both domestically and \ninternationally.\n  Last January, the President signed our reauthorization bill for the \nMagnuson-Stevens Fisheries Conservation and Management Act, which \nmandates an end to overfishing by requiring fisheries management \ncouncils to adhere to science-based catch limits. As we wrote that \nlegislation, my colleagues and I worked with Bill to ensure this goal \nwould be met. His expert advice and insight into our Nation's fisheries \nregulations proved to be indispensable.\n  In Alaska, which has half the coastline of the United States and \nproduces half of our Nation's fisheries products, Bill has also \ndemonstrated a firm commitment to both conserving and supporting our \nState's fisheries. Under his tenure, the fisheries service has invested \nin the scientific research and facilities that will enable sound \nconservation of Alaska's fish stocks. Bill has also ensured effective \nimplementation of all fisheries legislation important to our State.\n  Alaska native communities have also benefited under Bill's \nleadership. He knows that the survival of our Alaskan villages relies \non maintaining access to fisheries and marine mammals, and therefore \nBill worked hard to ensure that this access is upheld. At this year's \nmeeting of the International Whaling Commission in Anchorage, during \nwhich Bill served as Commission Chairman, he secured the subsistence \nbowhead whale quota for Alaska Native communities. This was a \nsignificant victory at a contentious meeting, and our communities owe \nBill a debt of gratitude for his achievements.\n  I am pleased that Bill will be remaining on as Chairman of the \nInternational Whaling Commission. I look forward to continuing to work \nwith him in this capacity. This will build on his other achievements in \nthe international arena--such as the International Commission for the \nConservation of Atlantic Tunas, where, as Chairman, he was at the \nforefront of the fight against illegal, unreported, and unregulated \nfishing--a serious threat to all global fish stocks.\n  I thank Bill for his many years of service to our fisheries and \nfishing communities. I also thank him for his cooperation and \nfriendship as we worked to achieve our common goals of fisheries \nsustainability. I think he has done a grand job for the Nation. I wish \nBill and his wife, Mary, all the best in the future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL.

Mr. President, we are in a little bit of a lull here before \nwe reach the final conclusion of this session of this Congress. But \nmuch of the debate is revolving around two pieces of legislation, one \nof which has been at least temporarily removed from the floor, the \nreauthorization of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, and the \nother one which is critical for us to act upon before we can leave \nWashington, DC, and return to our home States, and that is the ability \nto fund the troops whom we have sent on missions abroad in places such \nas Afghanistan and Iraq.\n  That funding has basically come to an end. The Defense Department has \nhad to rob Peter to pay Paul, moving money from different accounts in \nthe Defense Department in order to pay the ongoing effort of our \ntroops. That is not the right way, the most efficient way, to ensure \nthat our troops have what they need when they are fighting abroad. It \nis critical that we get the funding to the troops. The President has \nhad a request out now for more than 10 months to try to get the funding \non an emergency basis to them. Our minority leader will have an \namendment later on this afternoon that will seek to add money to fund \nthe troops, at least through sometime next spring. It is critical that \nwe achieve that objective. That is the critical piece of business we \nhave to attend to before we can leave.\n\n  I thought, in connection with both of those national security issues, \nthat some comments that our friend, the former Speaker of the House of \nRepresentatives, Newt Gingrich, made back in September to the American \nEnterprise Institute were of special relevance and we might well \nconsider\n\n[[Page S15827]]\n\nsome of the things he said in thinking about how to move forward with \nthis funding. Representative Gingrich said that to some extent the \ndebate we are having right now is the wrong debate about what is \nnecessary to defeat our enemy and win the war against the terrorists. \nThe bottom line is, it cannot be done on the cheap. War is kill or be \nkilled. You risk everything in war. As a result, what we have to do is \nthink anew about the kind of bold effort and difficult undertaking this \nreally entails. It does entail real risks, and we have to recognize \nthat there are significant requirements for change in the way we \noperate.\n  Congress can't continue to provide money, just dole it out a few \nweeks at a time, hoping that will be sufficient for the troops. They \nhave to be able to count on Congress to back them when we send them on \na mission.\n  To some extent, as Representative Gingrich said, it is important to \nadopt a spirit that in some cases it is better to make a mistake of \ncommission and then fix the problem than it is to avoid achievement by \navoiding failure. In this regard, we have to have a national dialog \nabout the true threat we are facing from this irreconcilable wing of \nIslam and what is necessary for us to defeat it, both in the ongoing \nconflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq as well as other places around the \nworld where intelligence becomes our key tool in helping to defeat the \nenemy.\n  One of the things Speaker Gingrich did was to refer to some remarks \nDaniel Pipes, an expert on the Middle East, made about Islamists. He \nmade it clear that they have significant assets at their disposal. They \nhave potential access to weapons of mass destruction, a religious \nappeal that provides deeper resonance and greater staying power than \nthe artificial ideologies of fascism and communism. They have an \nimpressively conceptualized and funded and organized institutional \nmachinery. They have an ideology capable of appealing to Muslims of \nevery size and shape anywhere in the world. This is problematic. \nFinally, these militant Islamists have a huge number of committed \ncadres, some estimate as many as 10 percent of the Muslim population of \nthe world, which, of course, is a far greater total than all of the \nfascists and communists combined who ever lived. As Daniel Pipes would \nsay, this is a significant and impressive array of assets and potential \nagainst the Western world against which these Islamists have declared \nwar.\n  Specifically, with reference to the intelligence I mentioned we have \nto focus on, the CIA Director, GEN Michael Hayden, testified a couple \nof months ago about his own judgment of these strategic threats facing \nthe United States. Among the things he said was that our analysis with \nrespect to al-Qaida is that its central leadership is planning high-\nimpact plots against the U.S. homeland. They assess this with high \nconfidence. So this is not just a guess about what might happen. With \nhigh confidence, they believe al-Qaida is planning high-impact plots \nagainst our homeland, focusing on targets that would produce mass \ncasualties, dramatic destruction, and significant economic aftershocks. \nSo our very survival as a free people is challenged by this large \nthreat, and defeating it on a worldwide basis is inherently going to \ninvolve a very large effort, a degree of change we have yet to face.\n  We need a debate about the genuine risk to America of losing cities \nto nuclear attack or losing millions of Americans to engineered \nbiological attacks. We also need a very calm dialog about the genuine \npossibility of a second Holocaust if the Iranians were to get nuclear \nweapons and use them against Tel Aviv or Haifa or Jerusalem.\n  All of these larger issues are sometimes lost in the debate about \narcane provisions of something like the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Act that we are seeking to reauthorize. We have to keep in \nmind what the object is. We have to defeat a very capable enemy which \nnot only has the means but the will to defeat us in a war literally to \nthe end.\n  We also need some realistic examination of the progress--or lack \nthereof--we are making in the larger war. I think we have to \nrealistically assess where we are with respect to that. In the last \nyear or so, Hamas has won an enormous victory in Gaza; Hezbollah has \nwon a substantial victory in south Lebanon; Iran, Syria, Lebanon, \nAfghanistan, the Taliban sanctuary in the Waziristan, substantial \ninstability in Pakistan, even in the Philippines and, to some extent, \neven in Great Britain. The estimates of terrorist sympathizers and \npotential sympathizers are far greater than the resources being applied \nto monitor them.\n  Again, to summarize this point with respect to intelligence \nsurveillance, we have, even here in the United States, the spread of a \nmilitant extremist radical vision. It is funded by money from the \nMiddle East, including Saudi Arabia. It is on the Internet, on \ntelevision, it is in extremist mosques and schools. This advocacy of \nmartyrdom, of jihad, suicide bombing, and violence against a modern \ncivilization is not restricted to places abroad; it exists even in the \nUnited States.\n  At the end of our conflict in Iraq and of the debate about our \nintelligence collection activities, there is a simple test, and that is \nwhether a free people are celebrating because the American people have \nsustained freedom against evil or, God forbid, violent evil enemies of \nfreedom are celebrating because Americans have been defeated. Life \nwould be easier if there was a more modulated answer, but there is not.\n  In war, there is a winner and a loser. If the American people will \nsustain this effort, we will win. But if American politicians decide to \nlegislate defeat, then, of course, America could be defeated.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nnow proceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 2771, the \nlegislative branch appropriations bill; that the only amendment in \norder be a substitute amendment at the desk which is cosponsored by \nSenators Leahy, Coleman, Klobuchar, Snowe, Obama, Dole, Baucus, Sununu, \nCantwell, Collins, Casey, Lieberman, Landrieu, Kerry, Kennedy, and \nClinton--this amendment provides for $800 million in additional LIHEAP \nfunding--that there be a time limitation of 30 minutes for debate \nequally divided in the usual form on the amendment; that upon the use \nof that time, the amendment be agreed to, the bill be read a third \ntime, and the Senate, without any intervening action or debate, vote on \npassage of the bill, as amended.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, I say to my friend from \nVermont, I support this issue. All you have to do is look in the \nWashington Post today at their editorial. It says, among other things:\n\n       This could be the start of an epic winter. If the past few \n     winters here in the northeast have taught us anything, it is \n     to be prepared to do whatever winter allows at the moment it \n     allows.\n\n  We have to be prepared for a cold winter. We have some money in this \nbill that we hope to pass sometime in the next several hours to take \ncare of some of the needs of the problems relating to the issue of \nLIHEAP; that is, money for people who are desperately poor and need \nhelp to keep their homes warm. That is what this is all about. I have \ntold the Senator from Vermont that I am going to do everything within \nmy power to get this issue before the Senate as soon as possible. \nWinter is not going to end at Christmastime. Winter is going to be \nhere. We can move to enlarge the funding for this bill. That is a \ncommitment I have. I think with the list of cosponsors he has on this \nproposed unanimous-consent request, it is something we should be able \nto get done.\n  The problem the distinguished Senator finds himself in is, it is late \nin the year. This is the first year of this session of Congress. There \nare always a lot of reasons for not doing things this late in the year.\n  I have admired this fine Member of Congress for many years, being \nwith the people he best represents, people who don't have any \nrepresentation. I admire what the Senator has done. I hope we can move \nforward on this now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, on behalf of several Republican Senators, I \nobject.\n\n[[Page S15828]]\n\n  I would also note that I believe there may be one other unanimous-\nconsent request, and I would be happy to suspend while that is made and \nthen conclude my remarks in 3 minutes. I think the Senator from Rhode \nIsland would like to speak, or I can go ahead and conclude, and then \nthe Senator from Ohio could make his request--whatever the pleasure of \nthe leader is.\n  Mr. REID.

I will conclude in about 3 minutes.\n  Mr. President, the point I was making is this: It is easy to lose \nsight of the larger objective when we get down into the details of \nspecific legislation, as we must do. It is important to understand it \nand to get it right, but we also have to keep our eye on the ball. To \nmix metaphors, you have to look at the forest and not get drawn down \ninto the trees too much. The forest here is a very dangerous enemy \nwhich means to do us harm. They have the means to do it. They have the \nwill to do it. We are fighting them in two different kinds of \nconflicts. We are fighting them in hot war in Afghanistan and Iraq. It \nis a serious proposition. Young men and women have been sent to these \nplaces to do battle, to lay their lives on the line to carry out the \nmission on behalf of the American people to secure those places for \nliberty. Not all of them will come home. Not all of them will come home \nwithout casualty. This is serious business. It requires our full \nattention, with a knowledge of the nature of the threat.\n  We cannot send them to do this job without being willing to provide \nthem the funding they need to sustain their effort. Part of the debate \ntoday is ensuring that at least for the next 4 months, they will have \nenough money to get the job done.\n  By the same token, we have an enemy all over the world, including in \nthe United States, which is plotting, our intelligence community \nassesses with high confidence, to carry out a devastating attack if \nthey have the opportunity to do so. It is critical that we use the \nassets we have available to collect intelligence against these \norganizations and people wherever they are. The best way to defeat the \nradical Islamists who mean to do us harm is to prevent it in the first \nplace. That is what good intelligence allows us. That is why it is \nimportant for us to reauthorize the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance \nAct.\n  My point is, on two of the great issues that are before us today, we \nhave a violent enemy that needs to be defeated. The best way to do that \nis to support our troops and our intelligence agencies and the men and \nwomen who are carrying out the missions we have asked of them in \ndefeating this enemy.\n  We have to understand the threat and understand that in America, in \nthis great democratic Republic of ours, the American people are the \ncenter of gravity in any war. It is their support that is needed in \norder to achieve victory.\n  Our young men and women on the battlefield and our people serving us \nin the intelligence community are counting on us, the representatives \nof the American people, to see to it that they have what they need to \ncarry out their missions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

First, let me thank the majority \nleader for arranging this time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/18/senate-section/article/S15829-1", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15829]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO DENNIS P. RILEY\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to an outstanding \nRhode Islander and a superb employee of the Senate who is retiring \nafter 34 years of Federal service--my friend, my colleague, someone I \nadmire immensely, Dennis P. Riley.\n  Dennis Riley has worked in my Providence office since I was elected \nto the Senate. But before that, he was a longtime employee of Senator \nClaiborne Pell, my predecessor. Dennis was born in Pawtucket, RI, on \nMarch 3, 1948, and attended St. Raphael's Academy. He went on to earn a \nbachelor of science in history and political science at the University \nof Wisconsin in 1971.\n  He taught history for a brief time in the Pawtucket School System and \nwas a graduate student in the Masters in Teaching Program at Rhode \nIsland College. In 1972, he became the field coordinator for U.S. \nSenator Claiborne Pell's reelection campaign and formed a bond with \nSenator Pell and public service that lasts to this day.\n  Dennis came to serve on the personal staff of Senator Pell, first as \na staff assistant in Washington, DC, from 1973 to 1978. But in \nrecognition of those skills and the commitment he brought to bear as a \nstaff member for Senator Pell, Senator Pell chose Dennis to serve as \nhis campaign manager for his next successful reelection effort. So \nDennis returned to Rhode Island and successfully planned and executed \nthe Senator's reelection campaign.\n  From 1979 to Senator Pell's final day in office, Dennis worked as \nassistant director of the Senator's Rhode Island office. He was a \ntrusted employee of Senator Pell, and, more importantly, Dennis remains \nclose to the Pell family today.\n\n  As Senator from 1961 to 1997, Senator Claiborne Pell's legacy \nincludes establishing Pell grants as well as creating the National \nEndowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities. \nSenator Pell was also noted as a diplomat, and he served with \ndistinction as chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. Senator \nPell's legacy is a model for all of us, particularly for myself. Dennis \nRiley is a testament and a part of that tradition of talented and \nconscientious public servants who labor, perhaps in the shadows, but it \nis their work that is decisive in our success on the floor.\n  After Senator Pell retired, and the people of Rhode Island gave me \nthe chance to continue his good works, Senator Pell spoke so highly of \nDennis that I asked him to join my staff. It is one of the best \ndecisions I have ever made. He brought with him a keen knowledge of the \nworkings of the Senate, a history and knowledge of Rhode Island \npolitics, good judgment, great wisdom, and great character. In the \nensuing years, we have become dear friends, and he is a trusted \nadviser.\n  During his tenure with my office, Dennis has worked on special \nprojects and has assisted hundreds of agencies and organizations as \nthey sought Federal assistance and thousands of Rhode Islanders who \nneeded help, who needed someone to listen to their stories, and to let \nthem know there is a government that cares about them, because Dennis \nRiley is a person who cares deeply, not just about Government but about \nthe people we serve.\n  In Rhode Island, he has been involved in crafting many public policy \ninitiatives, and he has been particularly active as my point person on \nFederal grants and the applications process for the Appropriations \nCommittee.\n  He has shepherded projects through. He has brought people together \nfor the common good. He has made a significant impact on the economic \nvitality of my State. Although Dennis's name will never be lauded in \nthe news reports or press releases, his hand is seen in so many efforts \nto make our State an even better place to live, work, and raise our \nfamilies.\n  Everyone who knows Dennis sees him as a kind and decent man, with a \ngreat heart, a great mind--someone we are proud to call a dear friend.\n  His compassion and quick Irish wit are legendary. For years, \ntransplanted Rhode Islanders in Washington, DC, and politicos in our \nState eagerly awaited, every day, the ``Riley Report''--a carefully \ncrafted summary of the day's topical stories, political news, and a \nretelling of the events of the day in Rhode Island. This complete and \nunbiased commentary of the author provided the ``real story,'' very \noften, of what was going on in Rhode Island.\n  Well, after his distinguished service to the Senate for 34 years, \nDennis now will be retiring to his beloved home in Little Compton, RI, \nwith his wife--the love of his life--Kathy McLaughlin Riley. Kathy is a \nwarm and lovely person, who has devoted her life to educating children. \nShe is an elementary teacher at the Elizabeth Baldwin School in \nPawtucket, and she will soon join Dennis in retirement.\n  In their well-deserved retirement, Dennis and Kathy plan to travel \nextensively. They are avid baseball enthusiasts, and they plan to visit \nall the ballparks they have not yet seen. It will be an inspiring and \ninteresting trip for both of them.\n  He will also be spending time caring for his family, including \ncreating more memories with his many nieces and nephews who so treasure \nhis company. I wish both Kathy and Dennis much happiness and \nfulfillment in the years ahead.\n  Now, on behalf of myself--and also I will take the liberty to speak \non behalf of my esteemed predecessor, Senator Claiborne Pell--I would \nask all my colleagues in the Senate, who treasure, as I do, the loyalty \nand the devotion of their staffs, to join me in paying tribute to a \nstellar Senate employee, Dennis Riley.\n  Rhode Island has been honored by his service, and the Reed staff will \nfondly remember his time with them. We formed a lasting bond that will \nnever be severed, and we treasure that bond.\n  As Dennis files the final ``Riley Report,'' I wish him every good \nwish.\n  Now, Dennis is Irish, and that means he has a rather somber view of \nthe world. He has a saying on his office door that reads: ``There is \nnothing so bad that it can't get worse.'' That is a typically Irish \nsentiment. As we send him off, however, let me offer another sentiment. \nDennis:\n\n       May the saddest day of your future be no worse\n       Than the happiest day of your past.\n\n  Thank you for your friendship, and thank you for your service.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/18/senate-section/article/S15829-2", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15829-S15830]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             FOOD PANTRIES\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, on Monday, in Hocking County--a small-town, \nrural county in southeast Ohio--residents began forming a line at the \nSmith Chapel United Methodist Church Pantry before dawn. By 8:30, when \nvolunteers began distributing food, the line of cars stretched for more \nthan a mile and a half. By early afternoon, more than 2,000 residents \nhad received food. That is over 7 percent of the local population. Mr. \nPresident, 1 out of 14 people in this county had received food from \nthis food pantry. Eight years ago, the same pantry was serving 17 \nfamilies a month. Two thousand people in one day; 17 families for the \nwhole month 8 years ago.\n  The Freestore Foodbank in Cincinnati, OH, has seen a 52-percent \nincrease in demand this year. Many of these new patrons are working \npeople. They are working minimum-wage jobs. Some hold two jobs. They \nare not just the homeless. They are not just the dispossessed. They are \nall kinds of people who have had a series of bad luck in the last \nseveral months.\n  With food prices going up, fuel prices going up, wages stagnating, \nand subprime foreclosures continuing to hit home, working middle-class \nAmericans are finding it difficult to find room in their budgets for \nfood.\n  More Americans in need; less food available--the result is far too \nmuch human suffering. Think of this. In the wealthiest Nation in the \nworld, people are waiting in line for a subsistence level of food, and \nsome of them are not even receiving that. The men and women and \nchildren waiting in line for food are men and women and children you \nhave passed on the street--mothers and fathers trying to feed their \nkids, children too proud to admit there is no lunch money in their \npocket, no food in the refrigerator, no holiday meals ahead; no food.\n\n[[Page S15830]]\n\n  Grandmothers raising their grandchildren, living on fixed incomes, \nrelying--because they have no choice but to rely--on food pantries, on \nfood donations, on food banks.\n  The unemployed, the sick, the aged, the homeless, the mentally ill. \nAnd in Hocking County, 1 out of 14 people went to one food bank on 1 \nday. There are people who live in the communities that all of us serve. \nFood banks in Ohio, in Montana, Michigan, Illinois, Arizona, New York, \nNew Mexico, North Dakota, and Rhode Island and in every State of the \nUnion are underfunded and overextended. Food banks too often are \nrationing rations, trying to prevent children and families from going \nhungry over the holidays. In Lorain, OH, my hometown, the Salvation \nArmy Food Pantry ran out of food completely and was forced to close \ntemporarily. The society of St. Vincent de Paul Food Pantry in \nCincinnati has been forced to give families 3 or 4 days of food instead \nof the customary 6 or 7 days of food when people come to see them. In \nAthens County, OH, earlier this month, the director of the Family and \nFriends Choice Pantry was actually ``praising God we are in a snowstorm \nand not many people showed up'' because if they had, her pantry would \nhave run out of food. In Ohio as a whole, 70 percent of food pantries \ndon't have enough food to serve everyone in need.\n\n  That is why earlier last week I offered legislation to act to \nalleviate the current food shortage. That is why I want to see us \ninclude $40 million in emergency food aid for food pantries across my \nState and across the country. I appreciate the leadership of Senator \nDurbin and Majority Leader Reid in wanting to include this at the next \nopportunity come January to get this $40 million out to the States, out \nto churches and food banks and food pantries so that the 1 out of 14 \npeople in Hocking County and people in need all over this country can \nget the assistance we can afford to give them.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, will the Senator from Ohio yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. BROWN. I yield to the senior Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I would like to ask through the Chair--I \nwant to first thank the Senator from Ohio for his leadership on this \nissue. He is new to the Senate but not new to this issue.\n  Times have changed in America, and not for the better when it comes \nto food pantries. People need help. I just this Sunday visited the \nGreater Chicago Food Depository and learned that there is an 11-percent \nincrease over last year in the number of people coming into food \npantries served in the greater Chicagoland area, and most of them have \njobs. These are people who, when they fill up the gas tank and need \nanother $20 to fill the tank, realize they are not going to have enough \nmoney to buy food for their children that they planned on buying, and \nthey make a stop at the food pantry.\n  I would like to ask the Senator from Ohio whether he is familiar with \nSecond Harvest, which is a major national organization that involves \nitself in the processing of contributions from private industry and \nfrom the Federal Government into food pantries, and whether he has any \nexperience in dealing with the Second Harvest food pantries in his area \nor other food pantries.\n  The last point I would like to make is that we were told on Sunday \nthat people who care, particularly during this holiday season, should \ngo to secondharvest.org, but find their local pantry, find where they \ncan drop off food, volunteer for an hour, make a donation, do something \nthat will make you feel good about yourself this holiday season.\n  But I would like to ask the Senator from Ohio whether he has been \ncontacted by these agencies dealing with Second Harvest.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I thank the senior Senator from Illinois \nfor his work on food issues and on other issues, including everything \nfrom subprime to minimum wage and all issues where we can play a role \nin improving the lives of people who, as the Senator from Illinois \nsaid, are working, in most cases, full-time jobs.\n  Second Harvest is one of the great organizations in this country--in \nIllinois, in Ohio, in Nevada, and in Vermont, all over this country. I \nurge people, understanding that Second Harvest is not getting the \ndonations they used to get, they are not getting enough help from the \nGovernment, they are not getting as much from supermarkets and from \nbusinesses as they got before, and they, frankly, are not getting as \nmany charitable donations because people who gave before sometimes are \nin need themselves because it is often people who don't make a lot of \nmoney who are the most generous with their money and with their \nassistance, to plea to people in our States, businesses, individuals \nwho are as lucky as we are in this Chamber, to help Second Harvest, to \ngo on Web sites and look in the yellow pages and look around their \ncommunities where they can help people so that this will actually make \na difference. So I thank the Senator from Illinois for his interest.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I mentioned to my friend from Ohio a fact \nthat I just heard. I hope it is wrong, but if it is wrong, it is not \nmuch wrong. The average income of people who vote in America today is \n$70,000 a year. I am very happy we have people who have a little--\npeople of means who are voting, but the reason I mention that is the \nlast two issues that have been brought before the Senate, one dealing \nwith LIHEAP--that is, how people stay warm in the wintertime; that was \nby the Senator from Vermont, Mr. Sanders--and now the Senator from Ohio \nis talking about food banks. In Nevada, 25 percent of the homeless are \nveterans, and we have a very difficult problem, especially in Las \nVegas. The weather is warm most of the time. We have people who are \nhomeless there who are destitute. Food banks is the difference between \nbeing very hungry and having something to eat.\n  I, at one time, in disguise, spent 2 days with the homeless. It was a \nnumber of years ago that I did that, but it is something I will never \nforget. People are not there because they want to be. They are not \nthere because they are lazy. There are some who are alcoholics, and \nthere are some who have drug problems, there is no question about that. \nBut there are so many of these people who have emotional problems who \nhave no community health centers where they can go, so they are just \ndown and out.\n  All the Senator from Ohio is saying is that food banks, the places \nwhere the poorest of the poor go to get a meal, don't have food. I want \nthe attention to be directed to the last two things we have tried to \nwork on: keeping people warm in the wintertime and helping people so \nthey are not starving. So I appreciate this.\n  The people who are cold in the wintertime don't have people to come \nand lobby for them. People who are homeless don't have people here \nlobbying for them, coming in their limousines and parking over on \nConstitution Avenue, and sometimes they are in their Gucci shoes and \nthey have to walk all the way across half a block to come and lobby for \nsome of the tax breaks they want. For people who are hungry and people \nwho are cold, that isn't the case. So I appreciate very much the \nSenator from Ohio bringing to the attention of the Senate something \nthat needs to be done.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/18/senate-section/article/S15830-1", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15830-S15834]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 CONSOLIDATED APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Chair lay \nbefore the Senate the message from the House on H.R. 2764.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Chair lays \nbefore the Senate a message from the House.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Resolved, That the House agree to the amendment of the \n     Senate to the bill (H.R. 2764) entitled ``An Act making \n     appropriations for the Department of State, foreign \n     operations, and related programs for the fiscal year ending \n     September 30, 2008, and for other purposes,'' with \n     amendments.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I move to concur in the amendments of the \nHouse. I have a cloture motion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The cloture motion, having been presented \nunder rule XXII, the Chair directs the clerk to read the motion.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the motion to \n     concur in the House amendments to\n\n[[Page S15831]]\n\n     H.R. 2764, State, Foreign Operations Appropriations, 2008.\n         Harry Reid, Jeff Bingaman, Barbara A.

Mr. President, the manager of this bill is going to be the \nchair of the Foreign Operations Subcommittee. Senator Byrd has \ndesignated Senator Leahy to manage this bill. During the hour that is \nprior to this cloture vote, we have a few people who want to speak; \nmaybe not all the time will be used. I hope during the evening people \nwill be considerate of talking when they have to. These issues are \nfairly well pronounced now. We know what they are. We have a domestic \nspending bill that has been worked out through the House and the \nSenate, Democrats and Republicans. We have the White House which has \nbeen involved in that. That part should be fairly easy. It may not be \neverything we want, it may be more than what some want, but it should \nnot take a lot of time.\n  We have three amendments relating to the debate on the war funding. \nOne is the McConnell amendment which will try to increase war funding \nup to $70 billion out of the $196 billion the President has asked for. \nWe also are going to have an amendment offered by Senator Feingold that \nwill deal with a matter we brought before the Senate on other occasions \nwhich calls for our troops to be back by the middle of May of this next \nyear, leaving troops to take care of counterterrorism, force \nprotection, and training the Iraqis to a limited extent. Then we have \nan amendment which will be offered by Senators Levin and Reed that will \ncall for additional funding for Iraq, but in addition to that, it will \nhave some accountability that is now not in existence.\n  Mr. President, as the majority leader, I designate Senator Leahy as \nthe controller of our time during the debate on this matter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 1 hour \nfor debate equally divided between the two leaders or their designees \nprior to the vote on the motion to invoke cloture.\n  The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I will hopefully not even need the full \nhour, and we will be able to go ahead and have the cloture vote. I \nbelieve Senator Gregg is going to be managing on the Republican side \nonce he gets here. Hopefully, it will be possible to just yield back \nall of our time before the end of the hour and go to a vote. I will \nyield in just about 3 minutes to Senator Murray from Washington State \nfor 10 minutes.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, will the Senator consider yielding to me \nfor no more than 5 minutes on a separate issue before we get heavily \ninto the debate?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the time has been equally divided, and I \nask unanimous consent that the Senator from Idaho, when recognized, be \nable to take 5 minutes from the time set aside on the Republican side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Congress will send \nthe Openness Promotes Effectiveness in our National Government Act--the \n``OPEN Government Act--S. 2488, to the President for signature before \nthe end of this year. With House passage of this bill today, and the \nSenate's passage of it last Friday, this historic, bipartisan, \nbicameral legislation becomes the first major reform to the Freedom of \nInformation Act, FOIA, in more than a decade. The American people will \nhave a new law honoring the public's right to know under the tree this \nholiday season.\n  I commend House Government Reform and Oversight Committee Chairman \nHenry Waxman for moving quickly to enact this bill, and for his \nleadership of the successful effort to pass FOIA reform legislation in \nthe House of Representatives. I thank him and his staff, including Anna \nLatin, Michelle Ash and Phil Schiliro, for all of their hard work on \nthis legislation. I also commend Representative William ``Lacy'' Clay, \nJr., for sponsoring this legislation in the House.\n  I also thank the members of my staff who worked on this bill--Lydia \nGriggsby, Lauren Brackett, Erica Chabot, Bruce Cohen and Leila George-\nWheeler--for all of their hard work on this bill.\n  I also commend the bill's chief Republican cosponsor in the Senate, \nSenator John Cornyn, for his commitment and dedication to passing FOIA \nreform legislation this year.\n  I am also appreciative of the efforts of Senator Jon Kyl for \ncosponsoring this bill and helping us to reach a compromise on this \nlegislation this year. I also thank the more than 115 business, news \nmedia and public interest organizations that have endorsed this \nlegislation.\n  As the first major reform to FOIA in more than a decade, the OPEN \nGovernment Act will help to reverse the troubling trends of excessive \ndelays and lax FOIA compliance in our government and help to restore \nthe public's trust in their government.\n  This legislation will also improve transparency in the Federal \nGovernment's FOIA process by: restoring meaningful deadlines for agency \naction under FOIA; imposing real consequences on Federal agencies for \nmissing FOIA's 20-day statutory deadline; clarifying that FOIA applies \nto government records held by outside private contractors; establishing \na FOIA hotline service for all Federal agencies; and creating a FOIA \nOmbudsman to provide FOIA requestors and Federal agencies with a \nmeaningful alternative to costly litigation.\n  The OPEN Government Act will protect the public's right to know, by \nensuring that anyone who gathers information to inform the public, \nincluding freelance journalists and bloggers, may seek a fee waiver \nwhen they request information under FOIA.\n  The bill ensures that Federal agencies will not automatically exclude \nInternet blogs and other Web-based forms of media when deciding whether \nto waive FOIA fees. In addition, the bill also clarifies that the \ndefinition of news media, for purposes of FOIA fee waivers, includes \nfree newspapers and individuals performing a media function who do not \nnecessarily have a prior history of publication.\n  The bill also restores meaningful deadlines for agency action, by \nensuring that the 20-day statutory clock under FOIA starts when a \nrequest is received by the appropriate component of the agency and \nrequiring that agency FOIA offices get FOIA requests to the appropriate \nagency component within 10 days of the receipt of such requests.\n  The bill also clarifies that the Supreme Court's decision in \nBuckhannon Board and Care Home, Inc. v. West Virginia Dep't of Health \nand Human Resources, which eliminated the ``catalyst theory'' for \nattorneys' fees recovery under certain Federal civil rights laws, does \nnot apply to FOIA cases.\n  Furthermore, to address concerns about the growing costs of FOIA \nlitigation, the bill also creates an Office of Government Information \nServices in the National Archives and creates an ombudsman to mediate \nagency-level FOIA disputes.\n  In addition, the bill ensures that each Federal agency appoints a \nChief FOIA Officer to monitor the agency's compliance with FOIA \nrequests, and a FOIA Public Liaison who will be available to resolve \nFOIA related disputes. And, the bill creates a better tracking system \nfor FOIA requests to assist members of the public and clarifies that \nFOIA applies to agency records that are held by outside private \ncontractors, no matter where these records are located.\n  Finally, this bill contains a number of key improvements championed \nby Chairman Waxman. The bill includes ``pay/go'' language that will \nensure that attorneys' fees that are awarded in FOIA litigation are \npaid for with annually appropriated agency funds.\n  The bill also eliminates a provision on citations to FOIA (b)(3) \nexemptions contained in the earlier Senate bill. In addition, the bill \nincludes a new provision that requires Federal agencies to disclose the \nFOIA exemptions that they rely upon when redacting information from \ndocuments released under FOIA.\n  And the bill adds FOIA duplication fees for non-commercial \nrequestors, including the media, to the fee waiver penalty that will be \nimposed when an\n\n[[Page S15832]]\n\nagency fails to meet the 20-day statutory clock under FOIA.\n  The enactment of FOIA reform legislation this year is an important \nmilestone in the effort to restore openness and transparency to our \ngovernment. By sending this meaningful FOIA reform bill to the \nPresident this year, the Congress also sends a powerful message to the \nAmerican people that the era of excessive government secrecy has come \nto an end.\n  While I am pleased that the reforms contained in the OPEN Government \nAct will ensure that FOIA is reinvigorated for future generations, my \nwork to strengthen FOIA will not end with the enactment of this \nlegislation.\n  There is much more work to be done to ensure that we have a \ngovernment that is open and accountable to all Americans. And I will \ncontinue to work with Senator Cornyn, Chairman Waxman and others to \nfurther strengthen this vital open government law.\n  I urge the President to promptly sign this open government \nlegislation into law at the earliest opportunity.\n  So again, I am pleased today that the Congress is going to send the \nOpenness Promotes Effectiveness in our National Government Act--also \nknown as the OPEN Government Act--and for those who follow this issue, \nFOIA. They are going to send it to the President before the end of this \nyear. With passage of this bill today in the House and the Senate's \npassage of it last Friday, this historic, bipartisan, bicameral \nlegislation becomes the first major reform of the Freedom of \nInformation Act in more than a decade. The American people are going to \nhave a new law honoring the public's right to know, and they will have \nit during this holiday season.\n  I commend the House Government Reform and Oversight Committee \nchairman, Henry Waxman, for moving quickly to enact this bill and for \nhis leadership. I wish to thank him and his staff, including Anna \nLatin, Michelle Ash, and Phil Schiliro, for all of their hard work on \nthe legislation.\n  I commend also the chief Republican cosponsors in the Senate, Senator \nJohn Cornyn and Senator Jon Kyl, for joining me in this effort.\n  The reason this legislation is so important is that throughout my \nwhole career in the Senate, I have always supported the idea of the \nFreedom of Information Act. We all know no matter who is in the \nadministration, whether it is a Democratic or a Republican \nadministration, that when they do things they want us to know about, \nthe press releases flow. When they make a mistake--and all \nadministrations do--they would just as soon we not know about it, \nwhether money has been wasted or whether a policy has not been \nfollowed. The Freedom of Information Act allows the American public--\nand after all, the Government serves them--to find out, through \nindividual private citizens, and through the press, what is happening \nin their government. It has saved billions of dollars over the years \nbecause of what they found out, but more importantly, it has kept our \nGovernment honest. I wrote the Electronic Freedom of Information Act \nwhich allowed us to use the Internet and electronic files for that \npurpose.\n  But this month, the Open Government Act--the first major reform in \nmore than a decade--is going to help reverse the troubling trends of \nexcessive delays, the lax compliance with FOIA and will help restore \npublic trust in our Government. It will improve transparency and \nrestore meaningful deadlines for agency action under FOIA. It will also \nimpose real consequences on Federal agencies who miss the 20-day \nstatutory deadline. It will clarify that FOIA applies to Government \nrecords that are held by outside private contractors. The Open \nGovernment Act will establish a FOIA hotline service for all Federal \nagencies, and create a FOIA Ombudsman, which will provide a meaningful \nalternative to costly litigation.\n  Chairman Waxman wanted pay-go language to ensure that attorney's fees \nthat are awarded in FOIA litigation are paid for with annually \nappropriated agency funds, and that has been included in this bill.\n  This is an important milestone. The Open Government Act contains \nreforms that ensure FOIA is reinvigorated for future generations. I \ndon't intend to give up after this effort, of course. We will continue \nto work with our oversight. We will continue to pursue efforts on FOIA. \nBut what we have said is that no matter who is the next President, they \nwill have to run a Government that is more open than it has been in the \npast, and all 300 million Americans will have a better chance to know \nwhat happens in their Government.\n  This is a great step forward for the access of a free press, and for \nan honest and open Government in this country.\n  Mr. President, I yield such time as the Senator from Washington State \nmay need of the time I have. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nWashington State.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, as chairman of the Transportation, \nHousing, and Urban Development Subcommittee, I have mixed feelings as I \nrise to talk about the transportation and housing division of this \nOmnibus appropriations bill.\n  This bill is the result of a lot of hard work, and there is a lot to \nbe proud of. At the same time, I regret that over the last month, we \nhave had to strip some $2.1 billion in resources from it. As all of us \nknow, the Omnibus bill before us has a total cost that is slightly \nhigher than the levels requested by President Bush, and much of the \npress coverage surrounding this bill has highlighted the fact that we \nhave shrunk this bill down to the levels that were requested by the \nPresident. But when it comes to the transportation and housing division \nof this bill, I wish to make it clear to my colleagues that the budget \nreflected in this bill is not the President's budget. Instead, this \nbill makes great strides in rejecting President Bush's hardest and \nharshest cuts in transportation and housing, and it includes critical \ninitiatives that are new that will make important improvements to \ntransportation safety.\n  I am proud of what this bill accomplishes. It provides funding to \nhire and train new air traffic controllers, and it rejects the \nPresident's efforts to cut funding to modernize the air traffic control \nsystem. It responds to our need to address crumbling infrastructure, \nespecially our Nation's highway bridges, and it responds to the \nworsening congestion our families experience on our highways and our \nrunways.\n  This bill rejects the efforts by the administration to slash funding \nthat would ease congestion at our airports. It rejects his efforts to \npush Amtrak into bankruptcy and leave millions of Americans stranded on \nthe platform. And it rejects his attempt to walk away from the needs of \nmillions of Americans who depend on the Federal Government to keep a \nroof over their heads, including our elderly and our disabled.\n  Finally, this bill reaches a helping hand to the millions of families \nwho are worried at this holiday season about whether they will be able \nto keep their homes in the coming year. Millions of people are facing \nforeclosure on their homes in the coming months as mortgage payments \nare rising out of control. There are communities in this country where \nevery third home or even every other home is being abandoned by \nhomeowners who cannot make their payments.\n  This bill addresses that crisis by targeting almost a quarter of a \nbillion dollars to ensure that our families get the counseling they \nneed. This kind of housing counseling can make all the difference for \nhomeowners who are struggling to make payments and to keep their homes. \nThe amount this bill provides for housing counseling is more than 4\\1/\n2\\ times the level that was asked for by President Bush.\n  Earlier this year, my very able partner Senator Bond and I held \nnumerous hearings on the most important transportation and housing \nchallenges that face this Nation. Together we negotiated every line of \na very complicated spending bill with each other and then with our \ncolleagues in the House. We were able to put together an appropriations \nbill that was reported, in fact, unanimously by our committee and \npassed the Senate with 88 votes. We then negotiated a conference \nagreement that earned the signature of every single conferee on both \nsides of the aisle on both sides of the Capitol. So we produced a truly \nbicameral, bipartisan bill.\n  Unfortunately, even though House Democrats, House Republicans, Senate\n\n[[Page S15833]]\n\nDemocrats, and Senate Republicans were agreed on a balanced package \nthat did address our transportation and housing needs, the one person \nwho did not agree with us was President Bush. Because of that, we are \nblocked from sending our Transportation bipartisan bill to his desk for \na veto.\n  Since that time, we have had a couple of very difficult negotiations \nand, as a result, we have had to strip almost $2.1 billion of funding \nout of our part of the bill. There are real consequences to those \nadditional cuts on which the President insisted. Transit riders across \nthe country are going to ride in outdated buses because there is not \nenough money to replace them. Construction of new light rail systems in \nsome of our most congested cities is going to be slow. Discretionary \nhighway programs have been stripped of the dollars that would have been \navailable for national competitions.\n  Because of the President's demands, we were required to cut matching \nfunds that we were sending to the States to support expanded passenger \nrail service. We reduced the initial commitment made by our conferees \nto expand the number of family unification vouchers. That is a \nprogram that provides the necessary housing assistance so foster \nchildren and their struggling parents can be reunited in a stable \nhousehold.\n\n  We were required to slow the release of a satellite navigation \nthroughout our national aerospace.\n  As I said, I have mixed feelings about this bill. We were dealt a \nvery difficult hand by the President's budget demands, and in order to \nlive within those constraints and move forward, we had to make some \ndifficult cuts, and those cuts mean we have had to put off important \ninvestments in transit, in highways, and in community development, \namong many other areas.\n  Still, I appreciate the work of my colleagues to ensure that this \nbill rejects the President's worst transportation and housing cuts. \nInstead, this bill responds to the most critical needs in \ntransportation and housing and makes sure our broken bridges and \nhighways get repaired, that our crowded airports are safe, Amtrak is \nprotected from bankruptcy, and we are protecting our most vulnerable \ncitizens from homelessness.\n  Finally, I do want to spend a couple minutes on a related subject. In \nthe last few days, the Appropriations and Finance Committees were able \nto reach an agreement on the way FAA funding will be made available in \nthe future. I am letting my colleagues know, this past fiscal year was \nsupposed to be the year Congress finished important legislation to \nreauthorize our Federal aviation programs. That included the core \nauthorizations for the operations of the FAA, as well as the agency's \nprocurement budget, research budget, and Federal grant program that are \nused to improve and expand our Nation's airports.\n  I regret Congress was not able to make more progress on the \nlegislation this year, but thankfully this appropriations bill now \nincludes a number of important authorities and funding that will keep \nthe FAA functioning and keep the airport and airway trust fund solvent.\n  This conference agreement extends the current aviation excise taxes \nuntil the end of February, and it includes provisions to extend the \nexisting war insurance risk program, as well as third-party liability \nprotections.\n  The bill also includes funding that rejects the President's proposed \ncuts to essential air service which guarantees air service to a lot of \nour rural communities, something about which many of us care. And it \nrejects the President's proposed cuts to our effort to modernize the \nair traffic control system and invest in airport infrastructure.\n  Congress has not been able to finish the FAA reauthorization process \nin part because of the disagreements among the Senate committees about \nwhat their role is in overseeing and funding FAA programs. There are \nalso disagreements about what type and mix of taxes and fees are \nsupposed to be used to fund the FAA. But I am pleased to report that we \nhave now successfully worked through one of those disagreements. Over \nthe last 2 days, the two committees have come to an understanding about \nhow funding for FAA programs will be moving forward.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the exchange of \nletters between the leadership of the two committees.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                  Committee on Appropriations,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 20, 2007.\n     Hon. Max Baucus,\n     Chairman, Committee on Finance,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington DC.\n     Hon. Charles Grassley,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Finance,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington DC.\n       Dear Chairman Baucus and Ranking Member Grassley: We \n     understand that your Committee will convene this afternoon to \n     mark-up the ``American Infrastructure Investment And \n     Improvement Act.'' We write to express our great concern \n     regarding provisions of your draft legislation that would \n     create a new mandatory funding mechanism for the \n     modernization of the FAA's air traffic control system. \n     According to documents distributed by your Committee, your \n     proposal would exempt certain modernization funds from the \n     annual appropriations process and the oversight of our \n     Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation, Housing and \n     Urban Development, and Related Agencies. In our view, such an \n     action would be inappropriate and detrimental to the \n     Congress's ability to review and control FAA spending.\n       The Committee on Appropriations shares your goal for the \n     modernization of our air traffic control infrastructure with \n     a next-generation system. Indeed, this year, as in past \n     years, our Committee has directed resources to the \n     development of this next generation system beyond the levels \n     sought in the FAA's own budget request. At the same time, \n     however, our Committee has gone to great lengths to highlight \n     and control wasteful programs where the FAA has encountered \n     dramatic cost overruns for systems that are delivering fewer \n     improvements than were originally promised to our Committee \n     and the taxpayer. Unfortunately, such instances are not a \n     rare occurrence at the FAA.\n       As is discussed in our Committee report accompanying the \n     Transportation Appropriations Act for 2008, fully 25 percent \n     of the FAA's 37 major procurement projects have encountered \n     schedule delays or substantial cost overruns since their \n     initial contracts were signed. Since 2001, the accumulated \n     schedule delays for these programs now exceed 296 months \n     and the associated costs to the taxpayers have grown by \n     almost $1.7 billion. When you compare the performance of \n     these programs to the FAA's estimates at each program's \n     inception, accumulated delays now approach 400 months and \n     cost growth exceeds $5 billion. Innumerable audits by the \n     DOT Inspector General and Government Accountability Office \n     make clear that, while improvements are being made in the \n     FAA's procurement processes, the agency still has a very \n     long way to go before the Congress and the taxpayer can be \n     assured that funding for a next generation system will be \n     spent wisely.\n       Our Committee is committed to providing that funding but is \n     equally committed to overseeing the agency's efforts to \n     ensure that such funding isn't wasted. Given the FAA's \n     record, we do not see any merit in putting any part of the \n     FAA modernization budget on ``automatic pilot'' and \n     substituting our Committee's oversight role with that of an \n     un-elected ``Modernization Board'' that is not answerable to \n     the taxpayers that are bearing the agency's costs. We believe \n     that efforts to exempt any part of the FAA's funding from \n     annual Appropriations Committee oversight is particularly \n     unwise and potentially wasteful. We strongly oppose such \n     efforts and ask that you revise these provisions before the \n     bill is brought before the Full Senate for debate.\n       We look forward to working with you this year and in the \n     years ahead to launch a modernized air traffic control system \n     in a manner that is both accountable and affordable.\n           Sincerely,\n     Robert C. Byrd,\n       Chairman.\n     Patty Murray,\n       Chairman, Subcommittee on Transportation, Housing and Urban \n     Development, and Related Agencies.\n     Thad Cochran,\n       Ranking Member.\n     Christopher S. Bond,\n       Ranking Member, Subcommittee on Transportation, Housing and \n     Urban Development, and Related Agencies.\n                                  ____\n\n                                             United States Senate,\n\n\n                                         Committee on Finance,\n\n                                Washington, DC, December 11, 2007.\n     Senator Patty Murray,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Senator Kit Bond,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Senator Thad Cochran,\n     Dirksen Senate Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Senator Robert C. Byrd,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Byrd, Cochran, Murray, and Bond: We are in \n     receipt of your letter dated September 20th, 2007, in which \n     you cite\n\n[[Page S15834]]\n\n     your collective concern regarding provisions in the American \n     Infrastructure Investment and Improvement Act that relate to \n     the manner in which tax revenues authorized in the Act are \n     provided to the Federal Aviation Administration for its \n     procurement needs. We all share the same interest in \n     modernizing our air traffic control system as quickly and \n     efficiently as possible.\n       We appreciate your concerns regarding the role of un-\n     elected entities in developing Federal policy, and we believe \n     strongly that Congress should retain its constitutional \n     authority to raise revenue and appropriate funding.\n       In your letter, you voice your concern that our bill, as \n     drafted, might result in the FAA receiving annual mandatory \n     funding outside of your Committee's control. You also voice \n     concern that provisions of our bill could result in an \n     external un-elected board, rather than Congress, having the \n     authority to make Federal funding allocations to specific FAA \n     procurements.\n       In order to eliminate any ambiguity regarding these \n     matters, it will be our intention to immediately modify the \n     text of our bill when it either reaches the Senate Floor or \n     is incorporated into any other vehicle so as to ensure that \n     these concerns are addressed. Specifically, the bill will be \n     modified to ensure that no new mandatory funding will be \n     provided to the FAA and that the Committee on Appropriations \n     will continue to retain its current role of determining the \n     final funding level for all programs, projects, and \n     activities within the Federal Aviation Administration through \n     annual and supplemental appropriations acts.\n       Our national aviation enterprise faces a great many \n     challenges in the years ahead as air traffic continues to \n     grow faster than available capacity. Our Committee is \n     committed to working as a partner with your Committee to \n     ensure that we establish and maintain the safe and efficient \n     state-of-the-art air traffic control system that the American \n     taxpayers want and deserve.\n     Max Baucus.\n     Chuck Grassley.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, the final paragraph of the letter our \nAppropriations Committee received from Chairman Baucus and Ranking \nMember Grassley of the Finance Committee states that they look forward \nto working with our Appropriations Committee as partners in advancing \nthe needs of our aviation system.\n  As one member of the subcommittee that oversees aviation funding, I \nexpress my strong interest in working as a partner with both committees \nto come up with a bill that fully addresses the future needs of our \nnational aviation system. I hope that important effort will be one of \nthe Senate's first priorities when we reconvene next year.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/18/senate-section/article/S15834-1", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15834-S15843]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          MEDICARE, MEDICAID, AND SCHIP EXTENSION ACT OF 2007\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to immediate consideration S. 2499, introduced earlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2499) to amend titles XVIII, XIX, and XXI of the \n     Social Security Act to extend provisions under the Medicare, \n     Medicaid, and SCHIP programs, and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, as we approach the end of 2007, one \ncannot help but look ahead and see that there are many challenges that \nawait us in the second session of the 110th Congress, specially in \naddressing issues relating to health care. In 2008, we will need to \ntake a serious look at many issues in the Medicare Program. Among them \nwill be continuing to work on developing a solution for Medicare's \nflawed physician reimbursement system. As usual, I look forward to \nworking with my partner on the Senate Finance Committee, chairman, \nSenator Max Baucus, in our usual bipartisan way to address this and \nmany other issues.\n  However, before we could adjourn this first session and go home to \nenjoy the holidays with our families, there was still urgent work to \nfinish. That was the purpose of this exercise. In the legislation we \nconsidered today, there were several provisions that rise to the level \nof ``must do's.'' These included ensuring that physicians do not \nreceive a drastic cut in their Medicare reimbursement and extending a \nnumber of expiring provisions including the State Children's Health \nInsurance Program.\n  Ensuring health care access to my constituents is a top priority of \nmine and the possibility of a negative update for physicians was of \ngreat concern to me as well as to doctors and patients in Iowa and \nelsewhere. When discussions began to solve this problem I was in favor \nof a 2-year update. I know that several of my colleagues were as well. \nBut in continuing negotiations with the House and Senate colleagues it \nbecame apparent that a 2-year fix was not possible.\n  I wanted to do more. I know Senator Baucus wanted to do more. We were \nunable to reach consensus even on the Republican side either and, \ntherefore, the Finance Committee was unable to move ahead with the \nlegislation that Senator Baucus and I had been developing. \nUnfortunately, for a variety of complex reasons, we are now here with a \nmuch more limited package. This is a disappointment for many of us. So \nthe purpose of moving forward with a 6-month package now is to provide \nthe opportunity for the Finance Committee to address these priorities \nnext year.\n  One of my first priorities has been to ensure access to rural \nhospital services. Since hospitals are often not only the sole provider \nof health care in rural areas, but also significant employers and \npurchasers in the community, it is especially important that they are \nable to keep their doors open. One group of hospitals that I am \nespecially concerned about are ``tweener'' hospitals, which are too \nlarge to be critical access hospitals, but too small to be financially \nviable under the Medicare hospital prospective payment systems. The \nstruggles these facilities face in Iowa are real and serious. I am very \ndisappointed we were not able to help these hospitals in this package. \nI look forward to working with Senator Baucus and other Members to \ninclude ``tweener'' hospital improvements in next year's package.\n  Second, we must address the problem of specialty hospitals. I have \nbeen an outspoken advocate against these facilities for several years \nnow. My primary concern with these facilities is the inherent conflict \nof interest that exists when physicians have an ownership interest in \nthe facilities to which they refer patients. The best interest of the \npatient should always be the deciding factor when a referral for \ntreatment is made, not the financial self-interest of the doctor who is \ntreating the patient. I strongly support a competitive marketplace and \nfree market forces, but not at the expense of decreasing access to \nhealth care for the poor and uninsured or decreasing the quality of \ncare for and safety of patients. I have been and remain concerned about \nthe ability of community hospitals to provide care to all patients. I \nalso look forward to working with Senator Baucus on addressing this \nissue in our package next year.\n  There are a number of other important issues that need to be \naddressed as well. We need to take on the reforms of the Medicare \nQuality Improvement Organization Program, we need to inject some \nsunshine into the payments that drug companies make to doctors, and we \nalso need to make sure that Medicare is part of the solution when it \ncomes to greater use of electronic prescribing and electronic health \nrecords.\n  In the meantime, we have this package with the following provisions \nthat extend a number of Medicare, Medicaid and SCHIP provisions.\n  This legislation prevents the 10.1 percent cut to physician payment \nthat would have occurred as of January 1, 2008, and instead gives a 6-\nmonth 0.5 percent update for physicians through June 30, 2008. In \neffect, this provides a 10.5 percent increase in physician fees from \nwhat they would otherwise have received beginning in January under \ncurrent law. While this is not what many of us had in mind when we \nbegan this process, providing an update through next June will allow \nmore time and the opportunity for a bill to fully go through the \nlegislative process beginning with a committee markup next year.\n  This legislation also continues to provide additional payment \nincentives for physicians and other health care practitioners who \nreport quality measures in the Physician Quality Reporting System. We \nmust ensure that health care providers can afford to continue to \npractice medicine. We must also ensure that beneficiaries have access \nto physicians and other health care providers. And we must provide \nincentives for quality improvement.\n\n[[Page S15835]]\n\n  We also accommodate physicians ordered to active duty in the Armed \nServices by extending for 6-months a provision that permits them to \nengage in substitute billing arrangements for longer than the 60 days \nallowed under current law when they are ordered to active duty.\n  Our legislation also revises the Physician Assistance and Quality \nInitiative Fund, which is intended to help stabilize physician payments \nand promote physician quality initiatives.\n  This new fund will be available in 2008 to help minimize fluctuations \nin physician payments and promote physician quality initiatives.\n  The physician payment changes will be offset, in part, by an \nadjustment to the Medicare Advantage stabilization fund. Our \nlegislation does not repeal the stabilization fund but rather preserves \nthe fund for future years. We use the $1.5 billion available in 2012, \nwhile preserving the fund in 2013. Given the continued strong \nparticipation by plans in the program right now, the legislation \npreserves the fund so that Congress can add more funds in future years \nif they are needed.\n  The legislation extends Medicare private plan cost contracts through \n2009, which, without this legislation, are due to expire at the end of \n2008. These are longstanding plans that provide health care to Medicare \nbeneficiaries in many communities but have been unable to convert to \nMedicare Advantage plans. In addition, the legislation includes a 1-\nyear extension to Medicare Advantage special needs plans through 2009. \nAt the same time, the legislation puts a moratorium on new special \nneeds plans. When Congress enacted the Medicare Modernization Act in \n2003, it created a category of plans intended to provide specialized \ncare models for certain populations, including Medicare beneficiaries \nwho are also eligible for Medicaid, those who are chronically and \nseverely ill or disabled, and those who are institutionalized (for \nexample, in nursing homes). While these plans have proliferated, it is \nunclear how well they are meeting their mission of specialized care. \nThe legislation freezes the program at the plans currently approved so \nthat Congress and CMS can monitor the plans' performance and determine \nif any changes are needed.\n  In addition to reforming the manner in which Medicare pays for \nphysician services, this legislation will extend several expiring \nprovisions enacted in the Medicare Modernization Act to help ensure \nthat beneficiaries will continue to have access to needed medical \nservices. This includes provisions applicable to rural payments to \nphysicians, extending the 1.0 floor on the work geographic adjustment, \ncontinuing direct payments to independent laboratories for physician \npathology services, and continuing Medicare reasonable cost payments \nfor lab tests in small rural hospitals.\n  Our legislation also provides a 6-month extension of the therapy cap \nexceptions process that was included in the Tax Relief and Health Care \nAct last year to ensure that beneficiaries receive the physical, \noccupational, and speech language therapy services they need. It also \nextends the existing payment methodology for brachytherapy services and \nextends it to therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals through June 30, 2008.\n  As in previous legislation that Congress has passed, this legislation \nwill continue to improve accountability in the Medicare Program. There \nare situations when Medicare is not the primary payer for a \nbeneficiary's health care, but it is currently difficult to identify \nthese situations. This legislation will improve the Secretary's ability \nto identify beneficiaries for whom Medicare is the secondary payer by \nrequiring group health plans and liability insurers to submit data to \nthe Secretary.\n  The legislation will ensure beneficiary access to long-term care \nhospitals. These facilities will receive regulatory relief for 3-years. \nIn order to ensure patients are receiving appropriate levels of care at \nlong-term care hospitals, facility and medical review requirements will \nbe established, and the Secretary will be required to conduct a study \non long-term care hospital facility and patient criteria. Also, there \nwill be a limited moratorium on the development of new long-term care \nfacilities and a freeze to the annual long-term care hospital payment \nupdate for one quarter in rate year 2008.\n  The legislation will also ensure beneficiary access to inpatient \nrehabilitation facility services by addressing the 75-percent rule. \nThis rule has been criticized as too blunt an instrument for ensuring \nthat appropriate patients receive care at these facilities. Under \ncurrent law, a percentage of Medicare patients must have at least 1 of \n13 listed medical conditions in order to be classified as an inpatient \nrehabilitation facility. This percentage or compliance threshold is \ncurrently at 65 percent. This legislation would permanently freeze the \ncompliance threshold at 60 percent and allow comorbid conditions to \ncount permanently toward this threshold. The Secretary will be required \nto study beneficiary access to inpatient rehabilitation services and \ncare at inpatient rehabilitation facilities and to make recommendations \nfor alternatives to the 75-percent rule. In addition, there will be a \nfreeze to the annual inpatient rehabilitation facility payment update \nfrom April 1, 2008 through fiscal year 2009.\n  This legislation will also continue to promote more accurate hospital \npayments. One aspect of Medicare hospital payments that has been \nsubject to much criticism is the area wage index. Many say that the \ncurrent method of calculating the wage index does not reflect a \nhospital's actual labor costs and is instead arbitrary in nature so \nthat similarly situated hospitals can receive significantly different \nwage index values. Since the enactment of the Medicare Prescription \nDrug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, hospitals have been \nable to obtain relief from this unfair situation temporarily.\n  The legislation also provides more accurate payment for Part B drugs. \nIt implements recommendations of HHS Office of Inspector General and \nrequires CMS to adjust its average sales price, ASP, calculation to use \nvolume-weighted ASPs based on actual sales volume. It also establishes \nappropriate reimbursement rates for generic albuterol and for glycated \nhemoglobin diabetes laboratory tests.\n  In the Medicaid arena, the legislation extends the provision of \ndisproportionate share hospital payments to Tennessee and Hawaii for \nthe first three-quarters of the current fiscal year. These payments \nwere authorized for these States for the first time in last year's Tax \nRelief and Health Care Act and this is an extension of that policy.\n  The legislation also delays implementation of recently released \nregulations on school-based services and rehabilitation services in \nMedicaid so that the Finance Committee can appropriately review those \nregulations.\n  And finally, the legislation also includes an extension of the State \nChildren's Health Insurance Program, SCHIP, through March 31, 2009. \nThis provision makes additional funding available so that States do not \nhave to scale back SCHIP. This SCHIP extension will ensure that no \nState has to cut back their program due to insufficient Federal \nfunding.\n  I remain hopeful that when the 110th Congress reconvenes next year, \nthere will be a renewed effort to reauthorize and improve SCHIP.\n  The bill we considered today addressed the things Congress needed to \ndo before going home for the holidays. I am pleased we were able to act \nquickly and unanimously to pass the bill. I know many of my colleagues \nwanted to do more. I know some of my colleagues are disappointed \nbecause their individual priorities could not be included. It is \nunfortunate. I do hope we can do more when we come back next year.\n  Next year is an election year. The caucuses in my home state of Iowa \nare but days away. We have important business to conclude in Medicare \nand Medicaid and SCHIP. We have a Democratic Congress that has to work \nwith a slim majority in the Senate and a Republican President. At times \nthis year, I am not sure my colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nfully grasped the consequences of that reality. It certainly shows when \nyou consider what we could have done this year and what was ultimately \naccomplished. I sincerely hope we do a better job of being bipartisan \nalbeit in a political year.\n  Let me be clear that I stand ready to roll up my sleeves and get back \nto work come January. I am committed to moving ahead with the broader \nMedicare package when we return here next year. To make law, that \npackage\n\n[[Page S15836]]\n\nwill have to be one that the President will sign. It will require \nbipartisan cooperation and hard work. I am ready to get the job done. \nThere are many problems that need to be addressed, and we can address \nthe myriad issues that we left on the table. We can review and act on \nthe proposed Medicaid regulations that have so many people vexed. We \ncan pass a SCHIP reauthorization that can become law. We have learned \nthe pathway to failure this year. I stand ready to join any of my \ncolleagues who want to join me on the path not taken in 2007 to a more \nproductive 2008.\n  As we move to the end of the first session of the 110th Congress, I \nwant to extend my grateful appreciation to my health staff and others \nfor the work they have done in 2007. My staff director on the Finance \nCommittee, Kolan Davis, has been with me for many, many years and \nprovides me invaluable counsel. My chief health policy counsel, Mark \nHayes, accomplishes more every day than any other hundred people on the \nHill combined and for his tireless work ethic, I am truly thankful. My \nMedicare Part A counsel, Mike Park, labored through the last several \nweeks though he was sick as a dog because it is that important. My \nMedicare Part B counsel, Sue Walden, ably deciphered the multiple \nvariations we considered for providing an update to the physicians. The \nnewest member of my team, Kristin Bass, who handles Medicare Parts C \nand D, helped us reach thoughtful compromises on numerous challenging \nissues. My Medicaid staffer, Rodney Whitlock, deftly handles the most \ncontroversial of issues day in and day out. I particularly want to pay \ntribute to my SCHIP staffer, Becky Shipp. We may have not accomplished \nwhat we hoped to do with SCHIP this year, but we wouldn't have been \nremotely close without Becky's expertise and effort. My team benefits \nfrom the able assistance of Sean McGuire and Shaun Freiman going above \nand beyond the call of duty to make sure the little things get done. I \nalso want to thank Senator McConnell's point person on health care, Meg \nHauck, for working with us throughout the year. The Finance Committee \nbenefits from that strong working relationship.\n  We work as hard as we possibly can to achieve bipartisan consensus in \nthe Finance Committee and so I also want to pay tribute to Senator \nBaucus' staff: staff director Russ Sullivan, Michelle Easton, Neleen \nEisinger, Billy Wynne, Shawn Bishop, David Schwartz, and Catherine \nDratz.\n  We benefit greatly from the Congressional support staff as well. Tom \nBradley, Tim Gronniger, Shinobu Suzuki, Jeanne De Sa, Eric Rollins and \nall of the hard-working scoring gurus at CBO. Jim Fransen, John \nGoetcheus, Kelly Malone, and Ruth Ernst at Senate Legislative Counsel. \nJennifer O'Sullivan, Rich Rimkunas, Chris Peterson, April Grady, Elicia \nHerz, Sybil Tyson, Mark Hamelburg, Erin Taylor and all the folks at \nCRS. Mark Miller and all of his staff at MedPAC. They make us look a \nlot more intelligent and effective than we actually are some days.\n  Finally, I want to thank some folks at CMS. Liz Hall, Erin Clapton, \nIra Burney, Richard Strauss are people who help make sure we get things \nright even when we aren't in complete agreement.\n  In closing, I want to thank all those folks for their hard work in \n2007 in service to the people of Iowa, Montana, and all of America. \nThank you.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise in support of this package and want \nto commend my colleagues on a job well done.\n  To be fair, it would have been my preference to do a broader bill and \nresolve the myriad of Medicare-, Medicaid- and CHIP-related issues we \nhave been discussing for many months now. Given that this has proven \nimpossible, my overriding concern is that we move ahead with flawed \ncorrection to the physician reimbursement formula, as this bill does.\n  Indeed, while most of us would have preferred to have a longer term \nphysician fix, this bill is a reasonable compromise. Physicians will be \nable to practice medicine without having their Medicare reimbursement \nrates significantly reduced. And that means that Medicare beneficiaries \nwill continue to have access to quality health care.\n  I also am pleased about other provisions in this legislation, \nparticularly those related to policy on long-term care hospitals and \ninpatient rehabilitation facilities, IRFs. With regard to long-term \ncare hospitals, Senator Conrad and I introduced legislation, S. 1958, \nMedicare Long-Term Care Hospital Patient Safety and Improvement Act of \n2007. I am proud that the long-term care hospital provisions in today's \nMedicare legislation are based on the legislative language from the \nConrad-Hatch bill. The legislation before us provides regulatory relief \nto allow continued access to current long-term care hospital services; \nrequires new facility and medical reviews to ensure that patients are \nreceiving appropriate care; and authorizes a study by the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services, HHS, on long-term care hospitals and patient \ncriteria. This legislative language reflects compromises that were made \nbetween the various trade groups for long-term care hospitals and \nfinding policy solutions which generate savings for Medicare.\n  As a proud cosponsor of S. 543, Preserving Patient Access to \nInpatient Rehabilitation Hospitals Act of 2007, I am also pleased that \nthe Medicare bill eliminates the 75 percent rule implemented by the \nCenters for Medicare and Medicaid Services, CMS, for rehabilitation \nhospitals. Instead, this legislation permanently freezes the inpatient \nrehabilitation services compliance threshold at 60 percent and allows \ncomorbid conditions to count toward this threshold. Finally, it \nrequires the Secretary of HHS to study beneficiary access to inpatient \nrehabilitation services and care at IRFs and make recommendations on \nhow to classify inpatient rehabilitation facility hospitals and units.\n  Additionally, the legislation before the Senate extends the State \nChildren's Health Insurance Program, CHIP, through March 31, 2009. Let \nme make one point perfectly clear on this provision I--am not going to \ngive up on reauthorizing the CHIP program for an additional 5 years. I \nam still committed to that goal and intend to work with my colleagues \nearly next year. I will not rest until this program is reauthorized and \nall eligible, low-income children are covered by the CHIP program.\n  On balance, while this bill is not what any of us would have liked, \nit does address many of the immediate concerns of Medicare patients, \ntheir physician and other health care providers. I strongly support \nthis bipartisan legislation and urge my colleagues to support this \nbill.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I support the Medicare, Medicaid, SCHIP \nExtension Act of 2007. I appreciate the hard work and leadership of \nSenators Baucus and Grassley in putting together this important \nlegislation that will improve Medicare reimbursements, extend the State \nChildren's Health Insurance Program, and extend other important \nMedicare and Medicaid policies.\n  In addition, this legislation includes a provision that extends \nMedicaid disproportionate share hospital, DSH, allotments for Hawaii \nand Tennessee for another 6 months. Medicaid DSH resources help support \nhospitals that care for significant numbers of Medicaid and uninsured \npatients.\n  Hawaii and Tennessee are the only two States that do not have \npermanent DSH allotments. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 created \nspecific DSH allotments for each State based on their actual DSH \nexpenditures for fiscal year 1995. In 1994, Hawaii implemented the \nQUEST demonstration program that was designed to reduce the number of \nuninsured and improve access to health care. The prior Medicaid DSH \nprogram was incorporated into QUEST. As a result of the demonstration \nprogram, Hawaii did not have DSH expenditures in 1995 and was not \nprovided a DSH allotment.\n  The Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Benefits Improvement and Protection \nAct of 2000 made further changes to the DSH program, which included the \nestablishment of a floor for DSH allotments. However, States without \nallotments were again left out.\n  The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of \n2003 made additional changes in the DSH program. This included an \nincrease in DSH allotments for low DSH States. Again, States without \nallotments were left out.\n\n[[Page S15837]]\n\n  In the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006, DSH allotments were \nfinally provided for Hawaii and Tennessee for 2007. The act included a \n$10 million Medicaid DSH allotment for Hawaii for 2007. The Medicare, \nMedicaid, and SCHIP Extension Act of 2007 will extend the DSH \nallotments for Hawaii and Tennessee for an additional 6 months.\n  This extension authorizes the submission by the State of Hawaii of a \nState plan amendment covering a DSH payment methodology to hospitals \nwhich is consistent with the requirements of existing law relating to \nDSH payments. The purpose of providing a DSH allotment for Hawaii is to \nprovide additional funding to the State of Hawaii to permit a greater \ncontribution toward the uncompensated costs of hospitals that are \nproviding indigent care. It is not meant to alter existing arrangements \nbetween the State of Hawaii and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid \nServices, CMS, or to reduce in any way the level of Federal funding for \nHawaii's QUEST program.\n  I look forward to continuing to work with Senators Alexander, Corker, \nand Inouye to permanently restore allotments for Hawaii and Tennessee. \nI thank the chairman and ranking member of the Finance Committee for \nall of their efforts on this legislation and for their support on this \nissue of great importance.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nread a third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, and that any statements relating to the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, the Senator from Washington and all of us \nrecognize that this may be the conclusion this evening of this session \nof Congress, and there may be a lot of issues out there that will be \nbrought to a final vote. I think for all of us, as any session \nconcludes, we have to look at the work product and say that is a job \nwell done or a job not so well done. Frankly, for those of us on the \nRepublican side who stayed together and fought the fight and exchanged \nour differences with those on the Democratic side, to bring a budget \nback into constraints that are at or near the President's proposal is \nwithout question a victory. Some of us will recognize that and honor \nthat tonight as we conclude this first session of this Congress.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \npermitted to proceed until the vote occurs, which is 2 minutes from \nnow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the funding for the Low \nIncome Home Energy Assistance Program. This program is absolutely vital \nto the people of my State. This winter we have seen record-high prices \nfor home heating oil.\n  I want to thank the appropriators for including additional funding \nfor the LIHEAP program as part of the omnibus spending bill, but, Mr. \nPresident, I was hoping we would proceed to consideration of the \namendment offered by the Senator from Vermont, of which I am proud to \nbe a cosponsor, which would have provided 800 million additional \ndollars for the LIHEAP program.\n  Mr. President, this is a real crisis. I consider the amount of money \nin this bill to be a significant step forward, but it is not adequate \nto meet the overwhelming needs for the constituents that live in cold \nweather States and are struggling and literally choosing between paying \ntheir bills, buying food, purchasing prescription drugs, and staying \nwarm. That is a choice that no family in this country should have to \nmake.\n  I am pleased with this downpayment on the LIHEAP program. It is a \nmajor step forward that is going to make a significant difference, but, \nfrankly, it is simply not adequate to meet the overwhelming need.\n  Nationwide, over the last 4 years, the number of households receiving \nLIHEAP assistance increased by 26 percent from 4.6 million to about 5.8 \nmillion, but during this same period, Federal funding increased by only \n10 percent. The result is that the average grant declined from $349 to \n$305. In addition, since August, crude oil prices quickly rose from \naround $60 barrel to nearly $100 per barrel, so a grant buys less fuel \ntoday than it would have just 4 months ago. According to the Maine \nOffice of Energy Independence and Security, the average price of \nheating oil\n\n[[Page S15844]]\n\nin our State is $3.26 a gallon. That is a record in our State.\n  This large, rapid increase, combined with less LIHEAP funding \navailable per family, imposes hardship on people who use home heating \noil to heat their homes. Low-income families and senior citizen living \non limited incomes in Maine and many other States face a crisis in \nstaying warm this winter.\n  The Sanders amendment would have provided an additional $800 million \nas emergency funding for LIHEAP. The term ``emergency,'' could not be \nmore accurate. Our Nation is in a heating emergency this winter. \nFamilies are being forced to choose among paying for food, housing, \nprescription drugs and heat. No family should be forced to suffer \nthrough a severe winter without adequate heat.\n  I understand we may consider this proposal again after the holidays. \nWhen we reconsider it, I urge all my colleagues to support the Sanders \nproposal to provide vital home energy assistance for the most \nvulnerable of our citizens.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order and pursuant to rule \nXXII, the Chair lays before the Senate the following cloture motion \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the motion to \n     concur in the House amendments to H.R. 2764, State, Foreign \n     Operations Appropriations, 2008.\n         Harry Reid, Jeff Bingaman, Barbara A.

Mr. President, under the consent agreement, how much \ntime do we have? I will use my leader time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The agreement contemplates a second-degree \namendment, the Feingold amendment, where there will be 1 hour of debate \nequally divided on that amendment.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I will use leader time now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, a lot has changed since last December. \nAt this time last year, America and its allies were desperate for good \nnews out of Iraq. The security situation was dire, and getting worse. \nAn all-out civil war threatened to undermine the heroic work of U.S. \nforces and frustrate the hopes of millions of Iraqis.\n  Then General Petraeus stepped forward with a bold new plan. We \nconfirmed General Petraeus unanimously for what seemed like one last \neffort at salvaging the mission. And we sent him the troops and the \nfunds he needed to carry out the job.\n  Since the implementation of the Petraeus plan, the security situation \nin and around Baghdad has changed dramatically. Attacks on troops are \ndown. Civilian casualties in Baghdad are down 75 percent. Iraqi \nrefugees are streaming back over the borders. Outside the city, the \nlocal leaders are forging agreements among themselves and with U.S. \nforces to ensure even greater security.\n  There is simply no question that on the military and tactical levels \nthe Petraeus plan has been a tremendous success. So as we stand here \ntoday, we have new hope that U.S. service men and women are beginning \nto return home with a sense of achievement. A lot has changed in Iraq, \nand here in Washington, we should take notice.\n  Before us is an amendment sent to us by the House of Representatives \nthat underfunds our troops and only provides for those fighting in \nAfghanistan. It leaves the troops in Iraq to fend for themselves. That \nis unacceptable.\n  What is the difference between funding the troops in Afghanistan and \nfunding the troops in Iraq? They are both our troops. Even those of us \nwho have disagreed on the war have always agreed on at least one thing, \nand that is the troops in the field will not be left without the \nresources they need.\n  So the amendment I sent to the desk provides for our men and women in \nuniform in Iraq and Afghanistan because I believe it is our duty to \nprotect all of those who are putting their lives on the line. It is \nalso important to understand--I hope everybody in the Chamber and \nanybody listening gets this fundamental point: If this amendment does \nnot pass, the McConnell-Lieberman amendment does not pass in its \ncurrent form, the underlying bill will not become law. The passage of \nthe McConnell-Lieberman proposal is essential to getting a Presidential \nsignature on the Omnibus appropriations and Iraq funding.\n  The Petraeus plan provides for a gradual reduction of our forces and \na\n\n[[Page S15845]]\n\ntransition of the mission. Iraqi security forces will eventually shift \nfrom partnering with coalition forces to leading forces on their own. \nWe must not impose an arbitrary timeline for withdrawal or accelerate \nthis timeline at an unrealistic pace.\n  This is a moment of real hope for our Nation and for the people of \nIraq. It is a moment of real urgency in the Senate. We need to pass the \nspending bill with troop funds without any strings and without further \ndelay.\n       At the risk of being redundant, the President has made it \n     absolutely clear that to get a Presidential signature, to \n     wrap up this session, having succeeded in passing all of our \n     appropriations bills, will require the passage of the \n     McConnell-Lieberman amendment.\n  So when we get to that amendment--we will have a couple of votes \nbefore then, but when we get to that amendment, it is essential. We \nwant to complete our work in a way that implements the appropriations \nprocess as all of us feel it should be implemented on a yearly basis. \nThe success of the McConnell-Lieberman amendment is essential.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, not counting leader time, what is the \nprovision of time once Senator Feingold has introduced his second-\ndegree amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will be 1 hour of debate equally \ndivided.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I see the Senator from Wisconsin. I ask, of \nthe half hour on this side, that 15 minutes be given to the \ndistinguished Senator from Wisconsin, 10 minutes to the senior Senator \nfrom West Virginia, 5 minutes to the distinguished senior Senator from \nMassachusetts, and that the Senator from Vermont who is a cosponsor be \nallowed to submit a statement as though read for the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3875 to Amendment No. 3874\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. Feingold], for himself, Mr. \n     Reid, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Dodd, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. \n     Kerry, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Whitehouse, Mr. Wyden, Mr. Durbin, Mr. \n     Schumer, Mr. Obama, Mr. Sanders, Mr. Menendez, Mr. \n     Lautenberg, and Mr. Brown, proposes an amendment numbered \n     3875 to amendment No. 3874.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To provide for the safe redeployment of United States troops \n                               from Iraq)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. SAFE REDEPLOYMENT OF UNITED STATES TROOPS FROM IRAQ.\n\n       (a) Transition of Mission.--The President shall promptly \n     transition the mission of the United States Armed Forces in \n     Iraq to the limited and temporary purposes set forth in \n     subsection (d).\n       (b) Commencement of Safe, Phased Redeployment From Iraq.--\n     The President shall commence the safe, phased redeployment of \n     members of the United States Armed Forces from Iraq who are \n     not essential to the limited and temporary purposes set forth \n     in subsection (d). Such redeployment shall begin not later \n     than 90 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, and \n     shall be carried out in a manner that protects the safety and \n     security of United States troops.\n       (c) Use of Funds.--No funds appropriated or otherwise made \n     available under any provision of law may be obligated or \n     expended to continue the deployment in Iraq of members of the \n     United States Armed Forces after the date that is nine months \n     after the date of the enactment of this Act.\n       (d) Except for Limited and Temporary Purposes.--The \n     prohibition under subsection (c) shall not apply to the \n     obligation or expenditure of funds for the following limited \n     and temporary purposes:\n       (1) To conduct targeted operations, limited in duration and \n     scope, against members of al Qaeda and affiliated \n     international terrorist organizations.\n       (2) To provide security for United States Government \n     personnel and infrastructure.\n       (3) To provide training to members of the Iraqi Security \n     Forces who have not been involved in sectarian violence or in \n     attacks upon the United States Armed Forces, provided that \n     such training does not involve members of the United States \n     Armed Forces taking part in combat operations or being \n     embedded with Iraqi forces.\n       (4) To provide training, equipment, or other materiel to \n     members of the United States Armed Forces to ensure, \n     maintain, or improve their safety and security.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise to offer an amendment with the \nmajority leader, Senator Reid, and Senators Leahy, Dodd, Boxer, \nKennedy, Kerry, Harkin, Whitehouse, Wyden, Durbin, Schumer, Obama, \nSanders, Menendez, Lautenberg, and Brown to H.R. 2764, the fiscal year \n2008 Omnibus appropriations bill.\n  The amendment is one I have offered before. I will not hesitate, if I \nmust, to offer it again and again and again.\n  The 17 cosponsors is the greatest number we have ever had for this \namendment.\n  It requires the President to begin safely redeploying U.S. troops \nfrom Iraq within 90 days of enactment, and requires redeployment be \ncompleted within 9 months. At that point, with the bulk of our troops \nsafely out of Iraq, funding for the war would be ended, with four \nnarrow exceptions: providing security for U.S. Government personnel and \ninfrastructure, training the Iraqi security forces, providing training \nand equipment to U.S. service men and women to ensure their safety and \nsecurity, and conducting targeted operations limited in duration and \nscope against members of al-Qaida and others affiliated with \ninternational terrorist organizations.\n  Some of my colleagues complain that we spent too much time debating \nIraq this year. They would rather talk about other issues. Well, we \nhave a lot of important priorities, but nothing is more important to me \nor my constituents than ending this disastrous war.\n  As I do every year, I held a town hall meeting in every county in \nWisconsin this year. That is 72 meetings for those of you who are not \nfrom the Badger State. I heard a lot from my constituents at the \nmeetings about health care and education. But the No. 1 issue I heard \nabout was foreign affairs, particularly the war in Iraq.\n  But the No. 1 issue I heard about was foreign affairs, particularly \nthe war in Iraq. Let me tell you--they weren't asking why Congress is \nspending so much time on this issue. They weren't asking us to give the \nPresident more time for his so-called surge. Like Americans all across \nthe country, they want an end to this war, and they want to know what \nis stopping us.\n  The Senate needs to address the concerns and demands of our \nconstituents, who more than a year ago voted for a change in \ncongressional leadership in large measure because of the debacle in \nIraq. But we have yet to follow through and end this misguided war, \nbefore more Americans are injured and killed. And we are about to \nadjourn for the year and let the war drag on even longer.\n  We hear a lot from supporters of the President that violence in Iraq \nis down right now, and therefore we are on the path to victory. That \nargument would be a lot more convincing if the administration had a \nviable strategy for success. The surge may buy time, but as long as \nthere is no political solution to Iraq's problems, we are just \npostponing the inevitable resurgence in violence, and our brave troops \nwill continue bearing the brunt of it.\n  That is not a strategy for success. It is not even a strategy. It is \na way of pushing this problem off to the next President and the next \nCongress, while our troops put their lives on the line, and our \nconstituents foot the bill. Or, I should say, our constituents' \nchildren and grandchildren foot the bill, because we can't even be \nbothered to figure out a way to pay for the war. We are just handing \nthe tab to future generations, sticking them with hundreds of billions \nof dollars of more deficit spending.\n  I am certainly pleased that violence in Iraq has declined in the last \nfew months. Once again, our troops have showed they excel in any \nchallenge with which they are tasked. This doesn't change the fact, \nhowever, that this year was the bloodiest year for Americans since the \nwar began, and there are still a few weeks to go in 2007.\n\n  Indeed, let us remember that nearly 4,000 Americans have died, and \nalmost 30,000 have been wounded in a war that has no clear strategy and \nno end in sight. While the President is bringing home a token number of \ntroops, over 160,000 remain as the war drags on into its fifth year. \nWhat are we supposed to tell them, and their families, to wait another \nyear until a new administration and new Congress finally listen to the \nAmerican people and bring this tragedy to a close?\n\n[[Page S15846]]\n\n  Mr. President, Iraq appears to be no closer to legitimate political \nreconciliation at the national level than it was before the surge \nbegan. Equally worrisome is that, as part of the President's plan, we \nappear to be deepening our dependence upon former insurgents and \nmilitia-infiltrated security forces with questionable loyalties. \nSupporting the sheiks in al Anbar--and elsewhere--may help to reduce \nviolence in the near term, but by supporting both sides of a civil war, \nwe are risking greater violence down the road. Such tactics are likely \nto undermine the prospects for long-term stability, as they could lead \nto greater political fragmentation and ultimately jeopardize Iraq's \nterritorial integrity. Again, without legitimate national \nreconciliation, violence may ebb and flow, but it won't end, and we \nwill be no closer to a settlement, no matter how long we keep a \nsignificant military presence in Iraq. That is not the fault of our \nheroic men and women in uniform. It is the fault of the \nadministration's disastrous policies.\n  There is another dirty secret behind the temporary drop in violence, \nand it relates to the segregation of Baghdad and the neighborhoods on \nits outskirts. With so many Iraqis fleeing their homes in search of \ngreater safety and security, large-scale displacement has resulted in \nvery different demographics. Previously mixed neighborhoods have ceased \nto exist, thereby curtailing one of the chief sources of sectarian \nviolence. This ethnic cleansing is hardly evidence of a successful \nsurge. And it sure isn't a hopeful sign for future peace and stability.\n  When it announced the surge, the administration said its goal was to \nkeep a lid on violence to give time and space for reconciliation in \nIraq. Now that we are no closer to reconciliation, the administration \nis trying, once again, to shift the goalposts. We don't hear as much \nabout reconciliation now, and when we do, it sounds very different from \nthe national reconciliation that was supposedly our goal--instead we \nhear about ``bottom-up'' reconciliation, whatever that means. All the \nadministration can do is stall for time, just as it did in 2004, just \nas it did in 2005, and just as it did in 2006. The slogan may be \ndifferent--``Mission Accomplished,'' ``Stay the Course,'' ``The New Way \nForward'' and even ``Return on Success,'' but each time we are told we \nare on the right road, if we just keep walking a little longer. Until, \nthat is, we reach another dead end, and a new slogan is invented to \njustify heading in a new, but equally futile direction.\n  As the administration blunders from one mistake to another, brave \nAmerican troops are being injured and killed in Iraq; our military is \nbeing overstretched; countless billions of dollars are being spent; the \nAmerican people are growing more and more frustrated and outraged; and \nour national security is being undermined.\n  Instead of focusing on Iraq, we should be focusing on our top \nnational security priority--going after al-Qaida and its affiliates \naround the globe. This administration has sadly proven that we cannot \ndo both.\n  Al-Qaida is waging a global campaign, from North Africa--where the \nAlgerian Government has blamed an al-Qaida affiliate for two major \nbombings last week--to the border region between Afghanistan and \nPakistan were, while we have been distracted by Iraq, al-Qaida has \nreconstituted and strengthened itself. There is a price to pay for our \nneglect, and this administration has failed to acknowledge it.\n  Because of its narrow focus on Iraq, the administration has been so \ndistracted it has not adequately addressed the deteriorating security \nconditions in Afghanistan, where the resurgent Taliban--the same \nmovement that harbored and supported the terrorist elements that \nattacked our country on 9/11--are gaining ground. Violence may be down \nin Iraq, but it is up significantly in Afghanistan. There were 77 \nsuicide attacks in Afghanistan in just the first 6 months of 2007, \nwhich is about twice the number for the same period in 2006 and 26 \ntimes higher than from January to June 2005.\n  This worrisome escalation of suicide bombings is one of many signs \nthat Afghanistan's already tenuous stability is even shakier. And while \nearlier this week the Pentagon confirmed that the U.S. military and its \nNATO partners are reviewing plans for Afghanistan, it is awfully late \nin the game to try to put that country on a solid path to stabilization \nand development. Nonetheless, we have to try because we still have an \nopportunity to finish the job we started 6 years ago in Afghanistan--\neliminating the Taliban and destroying a safe haven for terrorist \nnetworks that seek to harm us. This opportunity is critical because \nuntil bin Laden and his reconstituted al-Qaida leadership are killed or \ncaptured, Afghanistan's future cannot be separated from our own \nnational security.\n\n  Instead of seeing the big picture--instead of approaching Iraq in the \ncontext of a comprehensive and global campaign against a ruthless \nenemy--this administration persists with its tragic policy and its \ntragic mistakes. As the President digs in his heels, he is \nsimultaneously deepening instability throughout the Middle East, \nundermining the international support and cooperation we need to defeat \nal-Qaida, providing al-Qaida and its allies with a rallying cry and \nrecruiting tool, and increasing our vulnerability.\n\n  The President's promise to redeploy a few battalions, while leaving \n160,000 troops in Iraq, is not nearly enough. That is why, once again, \nI am offering this amendment with Majority Leader Reid. It is up to us \nhere in Congress to reverse what continues to be an intractable policy. \nIt is our job to listen to the American people, to save American lives, \nand to protect our Nation's security by redeploying our troops from \nIraq, because the President will not.\n\n  I am not suggesting that we abandon the people of Iraq or that we \nignore the political impasse there. We cannot ignore the ongoing \nhumanitarian crisis that has unfolded within Iraq or the one that \nfollowed millions of Iraqis as they fled to Jordan and Syria. These \nissues require the attention and constructive engagement of U.S. \npolicymakers, key regional players, and the international community. \nThey require high-level, consistent, and multilateral engagement and \ncooperation. But Iraqi reconciliation cannot--and will not--be brought \nabout by a massive American military engagement.\n\n  By enacting Feingold-Reid, we can finally bring our troops out of \nIraq and focus on what should be our top national security priority--\nwaging a global campaign against al-Qaida and its affiliates.\n  Some of my colleagues will oppose this amendment. That is their \nright. But I hope none of them will suggest that Feingold-Reid would \nhurt the troops by denying them equipment or support. There is no truth \nto that argument--none. Passing this legislation would result in our \ntroops being safely redeployed within 9 months. At that point, with the \ntroops safely out of Iraq, funding for the war would end, with the \nnarrow exceptions I mentioned earlier. That is what Congress did in \n1993, when it voted overwhelmingly to bring our military mission in \nSomalia to an end. That is what Congress must do again to terminate the \nPresident's unending mission in Iraq.\n  This amendment is almost identical to the version I offered with \nSenator Reid and others to the Defense Department authorization bill. \nAnd once again, we have specified that nothing in this amendment will \nprevent U.S. troops from receiving the training or equipment they need \n``to ensure, maintain, or improve their safety and security.'' I hope \nwe won't be hearing any more spurious arguments about troops on the \nbattlefield not getting the supplies they need.\n  This war is exhausting our country, overstretching our military, and \ntarnishing our credibility. Even with the recent decline in violence, \nthe American people know the war is wrong, and they continue to call \nfor its end. I urge my colleagues to vote yes on Feingold-Reid so we \ncan finally heed their call to action.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Menendez). The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I intend to support the amendment being \noffered by the Senator from Wisconsin. While I fully support the \naddition of the $31 billion in funding for the war in Afghanistan and \nfor troop protection, I cannot support the President's demands that \nfunding be given to him with no strings attached so that he may keep \nsome 130,000 or more troops in Iraq for a sixth year. Risking the lives \nof more soldiers to try to win a\n\n[[Page S15847]]\n\nbad bet on Iraq represents a terrible injustice to our brave fighting \nmen and women. Just a little more time, the President says, just a \nlittle more money, and the quagmire that is Iraq will be transformed.\n  The President has made clear that if he has his way, U.S. troops \nwould still be in Iraq decades hence. What a statement by a U.S. \nPresident. What a deadly bankrupt legacy to leave. 2007 has already \nbeen the most deadly year in Iraq in terms of U.S. deaths since the \ninvasion began, and the year is not yet over. The number of U.S. deaths \nhas reached 3,890, and the number of wounded has surpassed 28,000. The \nIraqi Government has not passed any of the legislative benchmarks that \nwould indicate progress toward national reconciliation.\n  The economic rebuilding of Iraq continues to lag, financed by U.S. \ntaxpayer dollars and marked by waste, fraud, and abuse. Oil production \nis sputtering and shortages of basics such as electricity and water \ncontinue unabated, despite the boondoggle that this war has been for \nprivate contractors. Evidence of ethnic cleansing is growing, as Sunnis \nare forced out of Shia areas and vice versa. The Iraqi Army and police \nforces remain riddled with sectarianism. U.S. forces continue to carry \nthe bulk of the security burden, and while U.S. forces remain in Iraq, \nthere is little incentive for the Iraqis to assume that duty.\n  Some have pointed to recent tactical successes and the reduction of \nviolence in certain areas of Iraq as justification for continuing the \noccupation of Iraq. But the prowess of our troops was never in \nquestion. They have been given a job to do, and they do it with bravery \nand skill. The important question--the only true measure of our efforts \nin Iraq--is whether those tactical successes somehow add up to progress \ntoward a lasting political solution. That progress has failed to \nmaterialize.\n  It is time for a change in Iraq. It is time to limit the U.S. \nmilitary mission in Iraq and bring the bulk of our troops home. It is \ntime to seriously engage our allies and the nations of the Middle East \non Iraqi security issues. It is time to restore the reputation of the \ngreat United States of America by returning to the policies that made \nthe United States an example to inspire the world, a beacon of economic \nprosperity, a showcase of humanitarian ideals, and benevolent \nassistance to people in their hour of need. It is time to shed our \nimage as invaders and occupiers of other nations, using mercenary \nforces to expand our reach. It is time to unequivocally reject the \nnotion that America condones torture. For most of my lifetime--and it \nhas been a long one already--the world looked to the United States \nfirst when help was needed. Now, the world wonders which nation America \nwill invade next. How far we have fallen.\n  The administration has used emergency proclamations and stop-loss \norders to effect a back-door draft that keeps soldiers in the military, \neven though their terms of service have been completed. Meanwhile, the \nneeds of our own Nation go wanting, as important equipment that could \nbe used for domestic disasters is shipped off to Iraq, and our National \nGuardsmen, the first responders in emergencies, sit in the sands--the \nhot sands--of the Middle East.\n  I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote in favor of \nthis amendment and, thus, reaffirm our resolve to alter our disastrous \ncourse in Iraq. To vote for this amendment is to vote for our troops \nand to begin a reasonable new policy for Iraq. To vote for this \namendment is to begin to reassert the constitutional role of the \nCongress as the people's check on the Executive, using the most \npowerful tool there ever was and ever will be in the congressional \narsenal--the power of the purse. To vote for this amendment is to show \nthe American people we are listening to them.\n  Keeping our troops in harm's way in support of a misbegotten war and \na failed strategy is not patriotism. We must not roll the dice again, \nrecklessly risking American lives and American treasure. It is time--\ntime--time--for a change.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise to oppose the pending amendment by \nthe Senator from Wisconsin, my friend. I strongly support the amendment \nthat will be offered by the Republican leader that would deliver vital \nfunding for our troops in Iraq.\n  The underlying House-passed bill is not only irresponsive to the \nfacts on the ground in Iraq, it is simply irresponsible. It fails to \nprovide any funding for our troops fighting in Iraq and actually \ncontains an explicit prohibition against the use of funds for Operation \nIraqi Freedom. The authors have compiled a bill of some 1,400 pages and \nan even larger joint explanatory statement chock-full of unnecessary \nspending, but they include not a dime for our troops in Iraq. They \ninclude not a dime for our troops in Iraq.\n  I would like our friends and colleagues and others to consider that \nthe bill on the floor today contains $1.6 million for animal vaccines \nin Greenport, NY, but not a penny for our soldiers in Iraq; $477,000 \nfor Barley Health Food Benefits but nothing for the troops in Iraq; \n$846,000 for the Father's Day Rally Committee of Philadelphia but not a \ndime for our sons and daughters who are fighting.\n  We are willing to spend $244,000 for bee research in Weslaco, TX, but \nnot a dollar for our fighting men and women in Baghdad, Kirkuk, and \nAnbar. It is a sad day--it is a sad day, indeed--when in the middle of \na war this country must win, the Congress provides more funds for bee \nresearch than for the brave Americans risking their lives on our \nbehalf.\n  For Congress to fail to provide the funds needed by our soldiers in \nthe field is inexcusable under any circumstances, but it is especially \ndisappointing right now at the very moment when General David Petraeus \nand his troops are achieving the kind of progress in Iraq that many \ndismissed as impossible a few months ago, including suspending \ndisbelief in order to believe the surge was working. One has to suspend \ndisbelief to believe it is not.\n  The bill's proponents seek, I suppose, a precipitous withdrawal of \nU.S. combat forces from Iraq regardless of conditions on the ground or \nthe views of our commanders in the field. If that sounds familiar, it \nshould. It should sound familiar, my friends. The majority has thus far \nengaged in no less than 40 legislative attempts to achieve this \nmisguided outcome.\n  The choice today is simple: Do we build upon the clear successes of \nour current strategy and give General Petraeus and the troops under his \ncommand the support they require to complete their mission or do we \nignore the realities and legislate a premature end to our efforts in \nIraq, accepting thereby all the terrible consequences that will ensue?\n  In case my colleagues missed it, a couple nights ago, there was a \npiece on the evening news of one of the major networks that pointed out \nthat for the first time in a long time there was 24 hours in Baghdad \nwithout a single incident of violence. How you can ignore these facts \non the ground is something I do not--will not--comprehend.\n  I had the privilege, along with my colleagues, Senator Lieberman of \nConnecticut and Senator Graham of South Carolina, of spending \nThanksgiving with our troops in Iraq. On that trip, I saw and heard \nfirsthand about the remarkable transformation these brave men and women \nin uniform have brought about this year. After nearly 4 years of \nmismanaged war, our military, in cooperation with the Iraqi security \nforces, has made significant gains under the new American \ncounterinsurgency strategy, the so-called surge. Overall violence in \nIraq has fallen to its lowest level since the first year of the \ninvasion. LTG Ray Odierno, the second in command in Iraq, said this \nweek this improvement is due to the increase in American troops and \nbetter trained Iraqi forces--due to the increase in American troops and \nbetter trained Iraqi forces.\n\n  Now, you can believe LTG Ray Odierno or you can believe those on the \nother side of the aisle who want to bring to a halt the success we have \nachieved.\n  Improvised explosive device blasts, the foremost source of U.S. \ncombat deaths, now occur at a rate lower than at any point since \nSeptember 2004. This week, MG Joseph Fil, the commander for Baghdad, \nstated that attacks in Baghdad have fallen nearly 80 percent since \nNovember 2006, murders in Baghdad Province are down by some 90 percent \nover the same period, and vehicle-\n\n[[Page S15848]]\n\nborne bombs have dropped by 70 percent.\n  So as Ronald Reagan used to say: Facts are stubborn things. Facts are \nstubborn things. These are the facts--not rhetoric but facts.\n  Major General Fil added that, today, there is no longer any part of \nBaghdad under al-Qaida control, though the terrorist group is ``still \nlurking in the shadows.'' I agree. They are on the run, but they are \nnot defeated. They are on the run, but they are not defeated.\n  Last week, the violence in Anbar Province was the lowest ever \nrecorded. The British handed control of southern Basra to the Iraqi \nGovernment. And in Diyala, one of most dangerous regions in Iraq, al-\nQaida militants tried to retake several villages around the town of \nKhalis, only to see U.S.-backed local volunteers drive the terrorists \naway. That is the success of a classic counterinsurgency strategy. Tens \nof thousands of volunteers have joined ``awakening councils'' that aim \nto combat al-Qaida, and al-Qaida's No. 2, Ayman al-Zawahiri, has begun \nwarning of ``traitors'' among the insurgents in Iraq.\n  As a result of the hard-won gains our troops have secured, General \nPetraeus has been able to initiate a drawdown of U.S. forces, a \ndrawdown tied not to an artificial timetable but based on security \ngains in-country. This drawdown, beginning with the removal without \nreplacement of some 5,000 American troops, has commenced following a \ndramatic drop in American casualty rates and enhanced security \nthroughout the country.\n  Al-Qaida's leadership knows which side is winning in Iraq. It may not \nbe known in some parts of America and in this body, but al-Qaida knows. \nAl-Qaida knows who is winning in Iraq. Our soldiers know they have \nseized the momentum in this fight. Does the majority party understand \nwe are succeeding under the new strategy? The proponents of this bill \ncannot continue forever to deny or disparage the reality of progress in \nIraq or reject its connection to our new counterinsurgency strategy.\n  As General Odierno explained, with the new counterinsurgency \noperations, ``we have been able to eliminate key safe havens, liberate \nportions of the population and hamper the enemy's ability to conduct \ncoordinated attacks.'' General Odierno went on to add: ``We have \nexperienced a consistent and steady trend of increased security. . . . \nand I believe continued aggressive operations by both Iraqi and \ncoalition forces are the most effective way to extend our gains and \ncontinue to protect the citizens of Iraq.'' Given these realities, some \nproponents of precipitous withdrawal from Iraq have shifted their \nfocus. While conceding, finally, that there have been dramatic security \ngains, they have begun seizing on the lackluster performance of the \nIraqi Government to insist that we should abandon the successful \nstrategy and withdraw U.S. forces. This would be a terrible mistake. Of \ncourse, there is no question that Iraq's national leaders must do more \nto promote reconciliation and improve governance and that the reduction \nin violence has created a window for political and economic progress \nthat Iraqi leaders must seize, but let's not close that window. The \nlikelihood that they make this progress would be vastly decreased--not \nincreased--by a precipitous U.S. withdrawal. Whatever the failings of \nthe imperfect democracy in Baghdad, they do not justify--either in \nterms of national interests or simple morality--abandoning it to the \nal-Qaida terrorists and Iranian-backed militias trying to destroy it.\n\n  None of this is to argue that Iraq has become completely safe or that \nviolence has come down to an acceptable level or that victory lies just \naround the corner. On the contrary, the road ahead remains as it always \nhas been: long and hard. Violence is still at an unacceptable level in \nsome parts of the country. Unemployment remains high in many areas. The \nMaliki government remains unwilling to function as it must. No one can \nguarantee success or be certain about its progress or its prospects. We \ncan, however, be certain about the prospects for defeat if we fail to \nfund our troops.\n  Make no mistake; despite the progress I have outlined, there is no \ncause for complacency. Just as we have managed to turn failure into \nsuccess in 2007, we can likewise turn success back into failure in \n2008, if we are not careful. As Major General Fil recently put it, \nprogress toward securing the city remains fragile and there is \n``absolutely a risk of going too quickly'' in drawing down troops. ``An \nimmediate pullout too quickly would be a real serious threat to the \nstability here in Baghdad,'' he said. Al-Qaida is off balance, but they \nwill come back swinging at us if we give them the chance.\n  Imagine for a moment if 1 of those 40 attempts to force a withdrawal \nfrom Iraq had been successful earlier this year. Rather than hearing \nfrom our commanders and troops in the field about the enormous \nprogress, the decline in violence, the Iraqis seeking to return home, \nthe decrease in al-Qaida influence, we would hear instead a very \ndifferent story--a darker one--with terrible implications for the \npeople of Iraq, the wider Middle East, and the security of the United \nStates of America.\n  Some of my colleagues would like to believe that should the bill we \nare currently considering become law, without funding our troops in \nIraq, it would mark the end of this long effort. They are wrong. Should \nthe Congress force a precipitous withdrawal from Iraq, it would mark a \nnew beginning, the start of a new, more dangerous effort to contain the \nforces unleashed by our disengagement. If we leave, we will be back. If \nwe leave, we will be back in Iraq and elsewhere in many more desperate \nfights to protect our security and at an even greater cost in American \nlives and treasure. Now is not the time for us to lose our resolve.\n  That is why the Senate must adopt the McConnell amendment. The \nfunding contained in this amendment is not as some have characterized \nit: ``The President's money.'' It is money for the troops. It is money \nfor the brave Americans who are in harm's way as we speak. This funding \nis to provide them with the equipment and proper training they require \nto fulfill their mission; funding to protect our men and women from \nroadside bombs and other attacks; funding to enable them to bring this \nwar to a successful and honorable end. If the funding is not included, \nthe President will very rightly veto this omnibus measure.\n  I say to my friends on the other side of the aisle that I understand \nthe frustration many feel after nearly 4 years of mismanaged war. I \nshare their frustration and sorrow. But we must remember to whom we owe \nour allegiance--not to short-term political gain but to the security of \nAmerica, to those brave men and women who risk all to ensure it, and to \nthe ideals upon which our Nation was founded. That responsibility is \nour dearest privilege, and to be judged by history to have discharged \nit honorably will in the end matter so much more to all of us than any \nfleeting glory of popular acclaim, electoral advantage, or office. Let \nus not sacrifice the remarkable gains our service men and women have \nmade by engaging in a game of political brinkmanship. There is far, far \ntoo much at stake.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the McConnell amendment and to reject \nthis amendment. I urge my colleagues to fund our troops and to support \nthem so that when they do return to us, they return with the honor and \nsuccess their valiant efforts have earned. They and the American people \nwhom they are entrusted to protect deserve nothing less.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I yield myself 7 minutes under the \nRepublican time. I am going to share my concerns about a provision \nincluded in the Interior division of the Omnibus appropriations bill. \nThis provision was added on the House Floor and was unfortunately \nretained by the conference committee. The language of this provision \nwill prohibit BLM from preparing or publishing final regulations for \noil shale commercial leasing on public lands. This provision is opposed \nby the Department of the Interior. I have a letter stating their \nconcerns from Secretary Dirk Kempthorne which I ask unanimous consent \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S15849]]\n\n\n\n\n                                The Secretary of the Interior,\n\n                                Washington, DC, December 12, 2007.\n     Hon. Wayne Allard,\n     Ranking Member, Subcommittee on Interior, Environment and \n         Related Agencies, Committee on Appropriations, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Allard: As the House and Senate consider the \n     Fiscal Year 2008 Interior, Environment and Related Agencies \n     Appropriations bill, I would like to voice my concern \n     regarding efforts to prohibit our Department from issuing \n     regulations related to oil shale leasing.\n       Section 606 of the House-passed Interior appropriations \n     bill would prohibit the use of funds to prepare or publish \n     final regulations regarding a commercial leasing program for \n     oil shale resources on public lands. The Energy Policy Act of \n     2005 (EPAct) was enacted with broad bipartisan support. The \n     EPAct included substantive and significant authorities for \n     the development of alternative and emerging energy sources.\n       Oil shale is one important potential energy source. The \n     United States holds significant oil shale resources, the \n     largest known concentration of oil shale in the world, and \n     the energy equivalent of 2.6 trillion barrels of oil. Even if \n     only a portion were recoverable, that source could be \n     important in the future as energy demands increase worldwide \n     and the competition for energy resources increases.\n       The Energy Policy Act sets the timeframe for program \n     development, including the completion of final regulations. \n     The Department must be able to prepare final regulations in \n     FY 2008 in order to meet the statutorily-imposed schedule.\n       The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) issued a draft \n     Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) in August 2007. The \n     final EIS is scheduled for release in May 2008 and the \n     effective date of the final rule is anticipated in November \n     2008. The final regulations will consider all pertinent \n     components of the final EIS. Throughout this process BLM will \n     seek public input and work closely with the States and other \n     stakeholders to ensure that concerns are adequately \n     addressed. The Department is willing to consider an extended \n     comment period after the publication of the draft regulations \n     in order to assure that all of the stakeholders have adequate \n     time and opportunity to review and comment before publication \n     of the final regulations.\n       The successful development of economically viable and \n     environmentally responsible oil shale extraction technology \n     requires significant capital investments and substantial \n     commitments of time and expertise by those undertaking this \n     important research. Our Nation relies on private investment \n     to develop new energy technologies such as this one. Even \n     though commercial leasing is not anticipated until after \n     2010, it is vitally important that private investors know \n     what will be expected of them regarding the development of \n     this resource. The regulations that Section 606 would \n     disallow represent the critical ``rules of the road'' upon \n     which private investors will rely in determining whether to \n     make future financial commitments. Accordingly, any delay or \n     failure to publish these regulations in a timely manner is \n     likely to discourage continued private investment in these \n     vital research and development efforts.\n       The Administration opposes the House provision that would \n     prohibit the Department from completing its oil shale \n     regulations. I would urge the Congress to let the \n     administrative process work. It is premature to impose \n     restrictions on the development of oil shale regulations \n     before the public has had an opportunity to provide input.\n       Identical letters are being sent to Congressman Norm Dicks, \n     Chairman, Subcommittee on Interior, Environment, and Related \n     Agencies, Committee on Appropriations, House of \n     Representatives; Congressman Todd Tiahrt, Subcommittee on \n     Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies, Committee on \n     Appropriations, House of Representatives; and Senator Dianne \n     Feinstein, Chairman, Subcommittee on Interior, Environment, \n     and Related Agencies, Committee on Appropriations, United \n     States Senate.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Dirk Kempthorne.\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. In 2005, I worked closely with my colleagues in the House \nand in the Senate on provisions which were included in section 369 of \nthe Energy Policy Act of 2005. These will help lead to \ncommercialization after the research and demonstration projects \ncurrently underway have proven themselves. As those of us who have to \nrun a business know, it is a bad practice to pour millions of dollars \ninto research and development projects with no hint of assurance that \nthese projects will lead to commercialization. Understanding the \nregulatory framework within which development must take place is \nimportant to companies making investment decisions. I believe, as I did \nin 2005, that it is critical to give companies investing tens of \nmillions of dollars into these research projects a proverbial ``light \nat the end of the tunnel.''\n  The timeline included in this section of the Energy Policy Act for \nsetting up a regulatory framework for oil shale development required \nthe Department of the Interior to develop a programmatic environmental \nimpact statement for oil shale by February of 2007 and to finalize oil \nshale regulations by August of 2007. Although these dates have slipped, \nmany who are concerned with decreasing our country's dependence on \nforeign sources of oil remain interested in seeing this process move \nforward. A regulatory framework is needed in order to clarify the range \nof development options.\n  During the last several years, a handful of companies have worked to \ndevelop technologies that will allow for economically and \nenvironmentally feasible development of this resource. While it may \ntake many years of research to establish whether commercial leasing is \nviable, it is essential in guiding the scope of study and further \nanalysis, including additional site-specific environmental impact \nstatements that are likely to be needed prior to any commercial-scale \ndevelopment.\n  Some have complained that it is too soon to begin drafting \ncommercialization regulations or that the pace at which the development \nis moving is too quick. I am not advocating that we move forward \ninappropriately or in a way that is not sustainable.\n  It should be noted that section 369 of the Energy Policy Act also \nrequires the Department of Interior to host a commercial lease sale in \nFebruary of 2008, but all who are involved in this process are aware \nthat it is premature to take that step too soon. I have been supportive \nof moving back the date of the first commercial lease sale. However, \nthis fact does not mean that we should not bring the rest of the \nprocess to a grinding halt.\n  We are in the midst of a deliberate and thoughtful process for \napproaching the research and eventual commercial development of oil \nshale. The potential of this abundant domestic resource is too \nimportant to take lightly.\n  It is estimated that there are potentially over 3 trillion barrels of \nrecoverable oil available from shale. Let me repeat that. There is a \npotential of over 3 trillion barrels of recoverable oil available from \noil shale, at a time when this country is struggling to produce enough \noil for this country's consumption. This could be the single largest \ncontributor to weaning us off of imports from other countries, many of \nwhich are in political turmoil. Moreover, bringing online another large \ndomestic supply of energy can lower prices for consumers, bring in \nroyalties to States and the Federal Government, and enhance the \nstability of oil prices in the marketplace.\n  With a cautious but deliberate approach that involves consultation \nwith State and local governments, we have the best opportunity of \ndetermining if producing oil from shale is possible. We must give this \nprocess an opportunity to work before we cut it off at the knees. The \nlanguage included in this bill does just that. It is not sound policy \nfor our country. From a process standpoint, we should not be undoing \ncarefully crafted policy choices that were negotiated for months by the \nauthorizing committees of jurisdiction and passed by the Congress on a \nmassive appropriations bill that is being pushed through this Chamber \nat the eleventh hour.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator from Colorado, \nbefore he yields, would engage in a brief dialog with the Senator from \nNew Mexico. I ask unanimous consent for 2 minutes for that purpose.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I withdraw my request to yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Colorado. I \nunderstand he is the ranking member on that subcommittee.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Yes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The Senator tried his best to inform those working on \nthis that this was not the way to handle one of America's most \nsignificant resources that might, indeed, sooner rather than later take \nthe place of the crude oil we import from all over the world.\n  Right now, some of the major companies in America are investing in \ntechnology which will completely change the way this asset oil shale \nwill be developed; is that not right? It is going to be in situ instead \nof the old mining system that would have been so tough environmentally.\n\n[[Page S15850]]\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, this is a new process. I thank the Senator \nfrom New Mexico for his question. This process is becoming economically \nfeasible and certainly protects the environment. I know the Senator has \nbeen working hard on this particular issue on the committees on which \nhe is a leader, and I appreciate his recognizing the importance of us \nbeing less dependent on foreign oil and the importance of this huge \nreserve that exists in several States throughout the West. This is new \ntechnology. It is very promising. It is exciting. The byproduct from \nthis particular process I have been told--and I have seen samples of \nit--is high-grade jet fuel that needs further refining because of the \nhigh sulfur nitrogen content. But it is a remarkable product, and it is \ndone in an environmentally friendly way.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator. I want to say this is exactly what \nwe should not be doing: putting on a moratorium that stops rulemaking \nand the ordinary professional evolution of standards by the appropriate \nFederal agencies to address the utilization of one of America's most \nprofound solutions to our energy crisis. Because the price of oil has \ngotten so high, it is indeed feasible to develop shale oil in America \nand substitute it for diesel and crude oil products that are bought \nfrom overseas. I know that. I need not ask anybody any questions about \nthat. That is why we put the language in the big energy package, and \nthat is why a candidate running for Senate in the State of Colorado \nshould not pander to those who just want to take out after this product \nthat could indeed be one of America's salvations. The people in the \nState of Colorado and in America ought to know it. The person who did \nthis, who put the moratorium on wants to be a Senator, I understand.\n  The first thing we ought to find out is does he want America to have \na chance to be independent of foreign oil. This is one that might do \nit. You can imagine that in 15 or 20 years, oil would be produced from \nthis shale, and it can be taken right out of the ground and used, \nbecause they boil it in the ground. That is the new technology.\n  I am not very impressed with somebody who comes along on a bill such \nas this and deals with this kind of resource in a willy-nilly manner, \nto respond or pander to those who don't want the United States on its \nown to do anything to develop energy. They might say we could not do it \nbefore. Of course not. You could not develop it at $25-a-barrel oil. \nBut you certainly can at $50, and there is no question you can at $80 \nor $90. That is what America's future is all about.\n  I thank the Senator for his work. I am sorry it didn't work. At least \nthose who put that in know somebody is looking out for them. It won't \nbe there next year. This Senator will see to it that we have a debate \nand vote on that issue before that happens. I thank the Senator for \nyielding.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his comments on \nthis very important issue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. How much time remains on this amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The proponents have 6 minutes 41 seconds. The \nopponents have 5 minutes 20 seconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself the 6\\1/2\\ minutes. I ask \nif the Chair will let me know when 1 minute remains.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will do so.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I support this amendment, and I commend \nmy friend and colleague Senator Feingold. It is wrong, basically and \nfundamentally, to give another blank check to President Bush for his \nfailed Iraq policy. I support our troops, but I oppose our war.\n  We have heard here in the last few minutes and in the last few hours \nthe rather rosy picture about what is happening over in Iraq. I think \neverybody in this Chamber salutes the brave men and women for their \ncourage, bravery, and valor over the last 5 years. This war has been \ngoing on for 5 years. We do know there has been some progress made in \nrecent times on the military aspect. But as every member of the Armed \nServices Committee understands, everyone who has had a responsibility \nin Iraq who appeared before the committee has said there are two \ndimensions for finally getting peace in Iraq: One is military, and one \nis political reconciliation. That has not taken place.\n  Day after day after day after day, our men and women are on the \nstreets of Baghdad and around Iraq, and more American servicemen have \nlost their lives this year than in any other year of the Iraq war, make \nno mistake about it. As we can see, these brave men and women in \nBaghdad, and all over, are still being targeted in Iraq. They are \nbasically being held hostage by the Iraqi political establishment. \nAmerican military personnel, American service men and women are being \nheld hostage by Iraq's political leadership, which refuses to come \ntogether and reconcile their differences and form a government.\n  Every day that goes on, the American taxpayers' money is being poured \ninto the sands of Iraq, because Iraqi politicians refuse reconciliation \nand political judgments in Iraq. That is what is going on over there \ntoday. That was going on yesterday, and it has been going on for 5 \nyears.\n  What the other side says is let's give this administration and this \nPresident a blank check to continue it. How long do they want it for? \nWhen is enough enough? That is what they are asking for. That is what \nthey are asking for. For 5 long years, these brave men and women in the \nArmed Services have done what they have been asked to do, and the best \nway you can honor them is to get the policy right, get the policy \ncorrect.\n  That is what the Feingold amendment does. How? Very simple. It says: \nOK, Mr. Iraqi politician, you have had your chance, your day; now you \nhave to take responsibility for your own country. The way you are going \nto do that is that we are going to start bringing American service men \nand women home. They have been unwilling to take the political \ndecisions up until now. The other side says pour more money in here and \nlose more American lives.\n  The Feingold amendment is a changed policy. It says we believe that \nwith the judgment and decision we are going to take to American \nservicemen, then they will make the judgment and decision that is in \nthe interest of this country. Their way hasn't worked. This way will. \nWhy not give it a try and a chance?\n  What are some of the American military personnel saying over there? \nBG John Campbell, deputy commanding general of the 1st Cavalry Division \nin Iraq, spoke bluntly about the faults of Iraq's political leaders. He \nsaid:\n\n       The ministers, they don't get out . . . They don't know \n     what the hell is going on on the ground.\n\n  This is the brigadier general, the deputy commander, talking about \nthe Iraqi political leaders, and you want to give them a blank check? \nWell, those of us who support the Feingold amendment say no.\n  Army LTC Mark Fetter put it this way:\n  ``It is very painful, very painful'' to deal with the obstructionism \nof Iraqi officials.\n  There it is. How much clearer does it have to get? How much more of a \nblank check do you need? How many more billions of dollars do you have \nto spend--let alone that we will never recover the 81 brave men and \nwomen from Massachusetts who lost their lives. That cannot be \nrecovered.\n  Think of this: For every month that goes on in that battle over in \nIraq, we could have 250,000 more schoolteachers who are experts in math \nand science teaching our young people. For every month that goes on, \njust think that every child who needs after school help and assistance \nwould be able to receive it in the United States of America. Just \nthink, for every month this goes on, we could provide Head Start for \nevery young person who needs it. Just think of this: If we could have \nthe resources for 2 years, we could rebuild and repair every public \nschool in this country that is in need. Doesn't that matter? Well, it \nmatters to this Senator, and it matters to those who are supporting the \nFeingold amendment.\n  It is wrong to neglect priorities such as these at home and pour \nhundreds of billions of dollars into the black hole that the Iraq war \nhas become. It is wrong to give the President another huge blank check \nfor the war in Iraq. Enough is enough.\n\n[[Page S15851]]\n\n  I urge my colleagues to take a strong stand and vote against this \ngigantic blank check for more war.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I support the Feingold-Reid-Leahy Amendment \nbecause it specifically requires the President to begin the \nredeployment of American forces in Iraq within 90 days. Within 9 months \nof enactment, the redeployment would be completed and funding \nterminated for Iraq operations with narrow exceptions for a limited \nnumber of counterterrorism, force protection, and troop training \nmissions.\n  The President's so-called ``surge'' is just another word for \nescalation. It has failed to set the lasting conditions for peace. \nViolence, though down, still continues at horrifying rates. The various \nIraqi factions have made little progress towards political \nreconciliation. The deadly rifts in that war-torn country have only \ngrown deeper. The Iraqi government has done little to support the few \nencouraging trends like the willingness of some Sunni groups to turn \nagainst the insurgency.\n  The only thing that is going to force the Iraqis to come to terms--\nthe only way to get Iraq's neighbors involved in bringing about peace \nthere--is to make clear that our country is not going to be there \nforever. We cannot afford to spend more of our precious resources and \nto spill more of the precious blood of our troops if the Iraqis will \nnot take responsibility for their own future.\n  There is a way to begin to right the wrongs of the President's failed \npolicy on Iraq. That better path involves effective diplomacy and a \nstrong signal about our finite military presence in Iraq, not this \nsenseless waste of money and lives. The Feingold-Reid-Leahy Amendment \noffers the real promise of a long-term positive outcome for our \nsecurity and the people of Iraq. I urge the amendment's adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, what is the time remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Seventeen seconds.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we have 1 \nminute evenly divided added to the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I came here at the time of the Vietnam war. \nI remember how people said maybe it should end and maybe we should do \nsomething; the Vietnam war has gone on too long. We finally stopped it. \nI am the only Vermonter ever to vote against the war in Vietnam. I \nvoted against funding for it, and the funding failed in the Senate in \nApril of 1975 by one vote. The war ended. Two years later, it was hard \nto find anybody who supported the war, even though we paid for it for a \nlong time.\n  We have been in Iraq longer than we were in World War II. It is time \nto bring our brave men and women home. Let them be with their families \nand let the Iraqis take care of Iraq.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nrecognized for 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 2 minutes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, we know what the situation is, and we \nare a great nation. We are not at liberty to flip-flop around every \ntime there is some change afoot in some polling data. We voted this \nsummer 80 to 14 to give General Petraeus a chance. We funded the surge \nand we funded his new strategy. At the time we did that, things were \nnot going well in Iraq. We had a tough year, there is no doubt about \nit. In the last few months and in the last few weeks, we have seen \ndramatic changes under the surge and under the classic \ncounterinsurgency strategy this brilliant general is conducting. So I \nsay let's allow him to conduct this war. Let's allow General Petraeus, \na proven leader, to do so. Let's reject the tactical decisions of \n``General'' Feingold and ``General'' Kennedy. We have a professional \nthere who is achieving things beyond what I would have thought possible \na few months ago, actually. I hoped and believed we were going to see \nprogress, but the extent of it is remarkable.\n  The last thing we need to do is to take action to pull the rug out \nfrom under the fabulous men and women who are serving us at great risk \nthis very moment, whose highest and deepest wish is to be successful, \nto execute the policy we gave them by a three-fourths-plus vote several \nyears ago.\n  I thank the Chair and reserve the remainder of the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nClinton be added as a cosponsor of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to oppose the \nFeingold amendment. Simply put, this amendment mandates withdrawal from \nIraq within 90 days, notwithstanding the substantial progress that even \nthe harshest critics acknowledge is occurring there. Further, it cuts \noff funds for those troops in 9 months. We have taken this vote three \ntimes already this year. That is three times we voted on this this \nyear. It has failed on a bipartisan basis each time, and with good \nreason.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose the Feingold amendment one more time.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, in a short time we will move to vote on \nthree amendments to the Omnibus appropriations bill.\n  Each of them takes a different approach to funding the war in Iraq.\n  I will vote for the Feingold/Reid amendment, which I have cosponsored \nand voted for several times this year.\n  Feingold/Reid is the right approach to begin to responsibly end the \nwar, and I will vote for it again today.\n  The second amendment is Levin/Reed, which I will also vote for.\n  Finally, we will vote on the McConnell amendment, which I will \nstrongly vote against. This amendment simply does more of what \ncongressional Republicans have done since the war began:\n  It rubberstamps President Bush's reckless management of the war that \nhas cost us so dearly in lives, limbs, and treasure.\n  The debate over supplemental war funding is nothing new.\n  Every year, President Bush comes to us demanding more and more funds \nfor Iraq, with absolutely no accountability. This year, he requested a \nstaggering $200 billion for Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  At a time when he and his allies in Congress are telling us we can't \ninvest in medical research, education, infrastructure, or public \nsafety, they want billions and billions more for Iraq.\n  How will our country pay the bill for the Iraq war? A Cost that when \nall is done will likely exceed $2 trillion?\n  The President has no idea. He has no plan or intention to pay the \nbill. He is simply sticking it in a drawer like an overdue credit card \nstatement, leaving it to our children and grandchildren to pay for \ngenerations to come.\n  That is not just fiscal irresponsibility, it is fiscal madness. But \nit is par for the course for a President who inherited record budget \nsurpluses from President Clinton and turned them into record deficits.\n  Every year, this war gets more expensive, and the American people \ndeserve to know why.\n  The answer is waste. The answer is fraud. The answer is \nmismanagement. The answer is incompetence.\n  On President Bush's watch, the companies he chooses to do business \nwith--like Halliburton and Blackwater--have wasted billions and \nbillions of our tax dollars.\n  The President has allowed billions to be spent on buildings that were \nnever built, projects that were never seen through, and contractor \nmilitary operations that did far more harm than good.\n  That is why he asks for more every year--because he has grossly \nmisspent the funds he has received.\n\n[[Page S15852]]\n\n  This year, we have already passed a $460 billion Defense budget--and \nthis bill includes another $31 billion for Afghanistan and troop \nprotection.\n  Democrats have fully funded the needs of our men and women in uniform \nand given the President more than enough to conduct the war and begin \nto bring our troops home.\n  But one thing we can't control is his reckless financial \nmismanagement.\n  We have held hearings and brought cases of waste and fraud to the \nlight of day.\n  But ultimately, the inability to conduct the war with the billions \nalready allocated is no one's fault but his.\n  The President and his allies here in Congress will doubtlessly push \nthe panic button and say that if we don't approve the funds \nimmediately, our troops will suffer.\n  This argument is untruthful and beyond the pale.\n  Our Secretary of Defense, Robert Gates--a man for whom I have great \nrespect--told Congress that the Army has enough money to get through \nthe end of February and the Marines have enough funds to get through \nmid-March.\n  If President Bush hadn't wasted untold billions, our troops would be \nfunded for far longer than that.\n  If the President had followed the wishes of the American people by \nspending the funds we gave him to wind down the war instead of ramp it \nup, the existing funds would be more than sufficient.\n  But he didn't. He ignored the calls of the American people to \nresponsibly end the war. And he should accept the consequences of his \nmistakes by finally changing course.\n  But let me be clear: Democrats will never let our troops suffer for \nthe President's misdeeds.\n  Democrats always have and always will support our courageous men and \nwomen in uniform who have given so much and received so little in \nreturn.\n  It is Democrats who insisted upon a 3.5 percent across-the-board pay \nincrease for everyone in uniform, which the President opposed.\n  It is Democrats who made right the awful conditions at Walter Reed \nand other veterans' health care facilities that took place on this \nPresident's watch.\n  It is Democrats who provided a $3.5 billion increase for veterans' \nhealth care after Republicans underfunded it for years.\n  It is Democrats who passed the Wounded Warriors Act to honor our \nservicemembers and their families.\n  I think we have heard enough of the tired old Bush-Republican scare \ntactics that Democrats are putting our troops at risk.\n  The facts speak for themselves.\n  We have always stood with our men and women in uniform. We always \nwill.\n  But unlike Republicans, we believe that truly supporting our troops \nmeans beginning to bring them home to the hero's welcome they have so \nbravely earned.\n  My fellow Democrats and I come to the Senate floor more times than I \ncan count to discuss the horrible cost of the Iraq war on our troops, \nour national security, and our reputation in the world.\n  We have lost nearly 4,000 young Americans. Tens of thousands more \nhave been gravely wounded.\n  As I have said already, hundreds of billions of dollars have been \nspent--tens of billions have been recklessly wasted--and the total \nprice will climb into the trillions before all is said and done.\n  Our military has been stretched paper thin. Colin Powell has said our \nArmed Forces are ``about broken.''\n  Every single one of our available combat units is deployed to either \nIraq or Afghanistan, leaving no strategic reserves for other conflicts.\n  And as the situation in Iran, the faltering of democracy in Pakistan, \nand the escalating violence in Afghanistan show, the world can evolve \nliterally overnight.\n  We must have the flexibility to respond, but right now we do not.\n  Our troops are being forced into repeated deployments, and the length \nof those deployments has gotten longer.\n  Military families are deeply strained, military mental health is \nsuffering, and the Armed Forces are reporting problems with both \nrecruitment and retention.\n  Just this week, General Casey acknowledged this problem, saying--``We \nare running the all-volunteer force at a pace that is not \nsustainable.''\n  Our National Guard is hamstrung in its efforts to keep us safe at \nhome, because much of their equipment has been shipped to Iraq. Every \nnatural disaster, from fire to flood, reminds us of this growing \ncrisis.\n  Yet for all the cost and all the courage of our troops, this war has \nmade us no safer.\n  Let me remind my colleagues of the most recent National Intelligence \nEstimate, which found that al-Qaida has regrouped and is now directing \noperations from Pakistan, stronger than ever.\n  Bin Laden remains free, taunting and threatening us with new videos.\n  Afghanistan--once viewed as a great military success--has spiraled \nout of control.\n  The opium trade there is at an all-time high, violence is at its \nhighest level since American intervention, and recent reports indicate \nthat the Taliban has vastly stepped up its efforts.\n  It is no wonder that this week has brought new reports that a \npanicked Bush administration is conducting a top-to-bottom review to \nstave off all-out chaos in Afghanistan and the backslide of all past \ngains.\n  I welcome this review. But as long as more than 160,000 troops remain \ncaught in the crossfire of the Iraqi civil war, our ability to address \nconditions in Afghanistan--and elsewhere--will be constrained.\n  The American people are rightly frustrated that more has not been \ndone to responsibly end the Iraqi war.\n  I share that frustration.\n  But within the confines of a stubborn, obstinate President and a \nRepublican Congress that knows no other way but to carry his water, \nDemocrats have made a difference--and a majority of Senators have \nconsistently voted with us.\n  Before Democrats controlled the Congress, the Bush White House \nconducted the war with total impunity.\n  No dissent was tolerated. The patriotism of those who raised \nquestions was openly attacked.\n  This year, Democrats have brought the President's recklessness into \nthe harsh light of day.\n  We forced the President to set benchmarks for legislative and \npolitical progress and required regular reports on whether those \nbenchmarks were being met.\n  These reports have shown that the surge has failed to reach the \nobjective set forth by the President of political reconciliation.\n  We forced General Petraeus to testify--and he has said repeatedly \nthat the war cannot be won militarily and must be won politically.\n  We brought to light the Blackwater controversy and forced Eric Prince \nto testify.\n  And we put an end to the duplicitous Republican practice of claiming \nto support the troops but failing to protect them in the field or \nprovide for them back home.\n  Do I feel that enough has been done? Of course not.\n  Time after time, the Republican minority has had a choice: stand with \nthe President or stand with the American people.\n  Each and every time, they have chosen the President.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject the McConnell amendment. The time for \nzero accountability is long past.\n  I urge my colleagues to embrace the amendments offered by Senator \nFeingold and Senator Levin.\n  Let's send our troops and all Americans a holiday gift: a message \nthat the United States Congress is ready to bring this war, now nearly \n5 years long, to its responsible end.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Delaware (Mr. Biden), \nthe Senator from New York (Mrs. Clinton), the Senator from Connecticut \n(Mr. Dodd), the Senator from California (Mrs. Feinstein), and the \nSenator from Illinois (Mr. Obama) are necessarily absent.\n\n[[Page S15853]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order requiring 60 votes for the adoption of \nthis amendment, the amendment is withdrawn.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, what is the parliamentary situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nMichigan is recognized to offer an amendment.\n  Mr. LEAHY. And, Mr. President, is there a time allotted on the \namendment of the Senator from Michigan?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 1 hour.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Equally divided in the usual fashion?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Equally divided.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  the PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3876 to Amendment No. 3874\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on behalf \nof myself, Senator Reid, Senator Voinovich, Senator Hagel, Senator \nSnowe, Senator Reed, Senator Smith, and Senator Salazar, and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Michigan [Mr. Levin], for himself, Mr. \n     Reid of Nevada, Mr. Voinovich, Mr. Hagel, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Reed \n     of Rhode Island, Mr. Smith, and Mr. Salazar, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3876 to amendment No. 3874.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To express the sense of Congress on the transition of the \n   missions of United States Forces in Iraq to a more limited set of \n     missions as specified by the President on September 13, 2007)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Sec.  . It is the sense of Congress that the missions of \n     the United States Armed Forces in Iraq should be transitioned \n     to the more limited set of missions laid out by the President \n     in his September 13, 2007, address to the Nation, that is, to \n     counterterrorism operations and training, equipping, and \n     supporting Iraqi forces, in addition to the necessary mission \n     of force protection, with the goal of completing that \n     transition by the end of 2008.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, our amendment expresses the sense of the \nCongress that we should have a goal for the removal of most of our \nforces in a reasonable time mainly as a way of telling the Iraqi \nleaders they must accept responsibility for their own future. Our \namendment expresses the sense of the Congress. It is not legally \nbinding, but it puts us on record, and it sends a message. It says it \nis the sense of the Congress that:\n\n       The United States Armed Forces in Iraq should transition to \n     the more limited set of missions laid out by President Bush \n     in his September 13, 2007, address to the Nation--\n     counterterrorism operations and training, equipping, and \n     supporting Iraqi forces--\n\n  And we add--\n\n     in addition to the necessary mission of force protection, \n     with the goal of completing that transition by the end of \n     2008.\n\n  The primary aim of this amendment is to keep the pressure on the \nIraqi politicians to do what only they can do: Work out compromises, as \nthey promised to do long ago--to compromise the differences which \ndivide them so as to ensure the currently relatively calm situation in \nmany parts of Iraq, including Baghdad, remains calm. Our sense of \nCongress language is aimed at pressuring the Iraqi politicians to seize \nthe window of opportunity, as General Odierno put it, to avoid a return \nto the violence that characterized the presurge period.\n  The New York Times, in a story on December 5, quoted Iraqi Deputy \nPrime Minister Chalabi as saying about the present situation in Iraq: \n``It is more a cease-fire than a peace.'' Well, we need to make it \nclear to those Iraqi political leaders that a cease-fire is not good \nenough. They must take the steps to turn that cease-fire into a real \npeace.\n  From all accounts, the surge has already produced some military \nprogress. The problem is that while the surge has, up to this point, \nachieved some military progress, it has not accomplished its primary \npurpose, as announced by President Bush last January. President Bush \nsaid the surge's purpose was to give the Iraqi Government ``the \nbreathing space it needs to make progress in other critical areas'' and \nthat ``reducing the violence in Baghdad will help make reconciliation \npossible.''\n\n  The President also said ``America will hold the Iraqi government to \nthe benchmarks that it has announced.'' Well, the administration has \nnot done what it said it would do--hold the Iraqi Government to the \nbenchmarks that it, the Iraqi Government, has announced. Those \nlegislative benchmarks include approving a hydrocarbon law, approving a \ndebaathification law, completing the work of a constitutional review \ncommittee, and holding provincial elections. Those commitments, made \n1\\1/2\\ years ago, which were to have been completed by January of 2007, \nhave not yet been kept by the Iraqi political leaders despite the \nbreathing space the surge has provided.\n\n  Despite the breathing space the brave men and women wearing our \nuniform have provided the Iraqi leaders, despite the breathing room and \nthe breathing space which young men and women putting their lives in \nharm's way on behalf of this Nation to give the Iraqis an opportunity \nto create a nation, they have not used that breathing space. And as a \nmatter of fact, the Iraqi leaders appear to be farther apart today than \nthey were at the start of the surge.\n  The Iraqi political leadership's response to the breathing space \nprovided by the surge has been stunning inaction. The Iraqi Parliament \nhas suspended its session until the New Year, thus ensuring that not \n1--not 1--of the 18 legislative benchmarks that they committed to meet \nwill be met this year. The President's statement that he will hold the \nIraqi Government to the benchmarks it has announced is hollow \nrhetoric. To date, there have been no consequences for Iraqis' failures \nto meet those benchmarks.\n\n  Whether the Iraqi political leaders decide to take advantage of this \nwindow of opportunity is, of course, their decision. The United States \ncannot make that decision for them. They are a sovereign country and \nhave to decide what is best for themselves. But whether the United \nStates keeps an open-ended commitment or establishes a goal for \nredeployment of most of our forces is our decision. That is not the \nIraqis' decision. They can decide whether to live up to the commitments \nthey made to themselves and to us--solemn commitments, as far as I am \nconcerned, because it involves the lives of American troops. Those \nsolemn commitments have not been kept. We cannot force them to keep \nthem, but we can decide whether we are going to maintain an open-ended \ncommitment of our troops.\n  Mr. President, how much time do we have?\n\n[[Page S15854]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). The Senator from Michigan has 24 \nminutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield myself 3 additional minutes.\n  According to our own State Department, the key threat to our effort \nin Iraq is the failure of the Iraqi political leaders to reach a \npolitical settlement. Listen to what the State Department said in its \nown weekly status report of November 21, 2007. This is our State \nDepartment:\n\n       Senior military commanders [U.S. commanders] now portray \n     the intransigence of Iraq's Shiite-dominated government as \n     the key threat facing the U.S. effort in Iraq rather than al-\n     Qaida terrorists, Sunni insurgents or Iranian-backed \n     militias.\n\n  Let me read that once again. This is our State Department saying what \nis the key threat to our forces in Iraq. What they are saying is that \nit is not the Iranian-backed militias, it is not the Sunni insurgents, \nit is not the al-Qaida terrorists; the key threat facing the U.S. \neffort in Iraq, according to our State Department, is ``the \nintransigence of Iraq's Shiite-dominated government.''\n  We have to break that intransigence. How can Congress do it? How do \nwe put pressure on the Iraqi political leaders? At a minimum, by at \nleast expressing our view that U.S. forces in Iraq should transition to \na more supporting and a less direct role, with a goal--a goal, just a \ngoal--of completing that transition by the end of 2008. The message the \nIraqi political leaders need to hear is that Congress has lost patience \nwith them, as have the American people. By their own Prime Minister's \nacknowledgment, a political solution is the only way to end the \nconflict, and ending the conflict is in their own hands.\n  I wish we could legislate a legally binding way forward for U.S. \nforces in Iraq. We have tried to do that. We have not been able to \nbreak the filibuster, to get to 60 votes. But at least expressing the \nsense of the Congress on this matter is better than silence because \nsilence implies acquiescence in the open-endedness of our presence. It \nis that open-ended commitment which takes the pressure off the Iraqi \npolitical leaders, and Congress needs to act to correct that. Our \namendment is a small but important step in that direction.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes from the time on \nthis side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I do not support the Levin amendment. I \nrise in strong support of the amendment offered by our leader, Senator \nMcConnell, and the Senator from Connecticut, Mr. Lieberman. That \namendment will provide the Department of Defense and our deployed \nmilitary personnel the resources they need to continue the mission they \nhave been assigned. It will also eliminate the distinction proposed by \nthe House to fund only those troops that are assigned to Afghanistan. \nIn my view, it is unconscionable for Congress to send the message to \nour troops that they will only get what they need if they are lucky \nenough to be assigned to fight the war in Afghanistan. What if they \nwere assigned to Iraq? Should they go without funds?\n  I believe it is our duty as Senators to support the troops in the \nfield and provide them all the resources they need to complete the \nmission they have been assigned. Unlike us, they do not get to choose \nwhich battle they fight. They go where duty calls, without hesitation.\n  Senator Inouye and I were in Iraq during the Thanksgiving recess, and \nI can tell the Senate that the troops are watching what is going on \nright here. They will get the message over there, and if the House \namendment is approved, it will be a real blow to the morale of our \nforces. This particularly concerns me, that some of my colleagues would \nconsider cutting off funds in Iraq at a time when we are starting to \nsee real progress and reconciliation.\n  I listened to the comments made by the Senator from Arizona, Mr. \nMcCain. I am really pleased to see his strong approval of the funding \nof our troops that are deployed in harm's way.\n  In March, Ambassador Crocker and General Petraeus will be testifying \nbefore Congress to give us their assessment of the situation in Iraq. \nWe know General Petraeus's plans are working. To withhold funding now \nwould only invite defeat and step back from the progress that has been \nhard fought and won over the last few months.\n  I have urged Congress for quite some time to approve this funding and \nallow progress to continue until we hear from our leaders on the ground \nin Iraq. The funds that are sent--the President sent us the request for \nthese funds 10 months ago. For the past 3 years, the Committee on \nAppropriations has included bridge funding as part of the annual \nappropriations bill to cover the cost of war, until a supplemental bill \nwas passed in the following year. This amendment would continue what \nCongress has done in prior years by providing funds to cover the cost \nof continued operations, including special pay and subsistence to our \ntroops, fuel, transportation, supplies, and equipment reset and \nprocurement.\n  The amendment is intended to cover half-year costs for keeping troops \nin the field. It also provides resources to provide critical force \nprotection equipment, including body armor, helmets, armor plate for \nvehicles, and aircraft survivability equipment.\n  There is also other equipment procurement funding to reset our forces \nreturning from theater. This includes buying down shortfalls for the \nNational Guard and Reserve units. Specifically, the McConnell-Lieberman \namendment would provide $1.1 billion military pay and benefits to \ninclude support for our wounded warriors and death gratuities; $50.2 \nbillion for operation and maintenance activities to include fuel, spare \nparts, transportation, and equipment maintenance, including $500 \nmillion for the commander's Emergency Response Program, $1.4 billion \nfor body armor and personal protection equipment, and $9 billion for \ndepot maintenance funding to reset equipment and maintain force \nreadiness.\n\n  This amendment also provides funds to continue our efforts to train \nand equip the Iraqi and Afghan security forces. That funding is \ncritical so that the elected governments in those countries can \neffectively provide for their own security and our troops can come \nhome.\n  There is also $4.3 billion for the Joint Improvised Explosive Devise \nDefeat Fund which will help our troops detect and defeat the No. 1 \nkiller of our troops in Iraq--the IEDs, the improvised explosive \ndevices we have heard so much about.\n  Mr. President, $6.1 billion is included for the procurement of \nequipment, ammunition, vehicles, missiles and aircraft, including $946 \nmillion for Army aircraft, $3.46 billion for Army vehicles and \nequipment, $703 million for Marine Corps vehicles and equipment, and \n$266 million for special operations forces equipment.\n  The amendment also includes $1 billion for the Defense Working \nCapital Fund, which includes $587 million to reset prepositioned stocks \nstationed around the world, which greatly enhances our Nation's ability \nto respond to contingencies, and we have forces in 141 different--I ask \nfor 1 more minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. It also provides $141 million for increased fuel costs, \n$3.7 billion to continue to enhance our intelligence activities in the \ntheater, $600 million for the Defense Health Program to provide for the \ncare and recovery of our wounded servicemembers, and $193 million for \ncounterdrug activities to curb production of opium in Afghanistan.\n  Without these funds, the Department of Defense would be forced to pay \nfor the cost of war out of the regular DOD moneys we have already \nappropriated. This cost of this war is approaching $15 billion a month, \nwith the Army spending $4.2 billion of that every month. Without \nrelief, the Army will totally deplete their 2008 operations and \nmaintenance funding by mid-February.\n  I urge the Senate not to take the risk that our troops in the field \nwill not have those resources they need in time to complete the mission \nthey have been assigned. I urge the Senate to support the McConnell-\nLieberman amendment.\n  I ask to have a chart showing the $70 billion bridge fund, as I tried \nto outline, printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S15855]]\n\n                        $70 Billion Bridge Fund\n\n       $1.1 billion for military pays and benefits to include \n     support to wounded warriors, and death gratuities.\n       $50.2 billion for operation and maintenance activities to \n     include fuel, spare parts, transportation, and equipment \n     maintenance in the field and at our national depots.\n       Provides $500 million for the Commander's Emergency \n     Response Program.\n       Provides $1.4 billion for Body Armor and Personal \n     Protection Equipment.\n       Provides $9.0 billion of Depot Maintenance funding to reset \n     equipment and maintain force readiness.\n       Provides for the transfer of $110 million to the Coast \n     Guard for support to GWOT.\n       Provides $300 million for Coalition Support.\n       $2.9 billion to continue our efforts to train and equip the \n     Iraqi and Afghan security forces.\n       $4.3 billion for the Joint Improvised Explosive Device \n     Defeat Fund to help our troops detect and defeat the number \n     one killer of our troops in Iraq.\n       $6.1 billion for procurement of equipment, ammunition, \n     vehicles, missiles, and aircraft.\n       Includes $946 million for Army Aircraft; and $3.46 billion \n     for Army vehicles and equipment.\n       Includes $703 million for Marine Corps vehicles and \n     equipment.\n       Provides $266 million for Special Operations Forces \n     equipment.\n       $1.0 billion for the Defense Working Capital Funds.\n       Includes $587 million to reset Prepositioned Stocks \n     stationed around the world and greatly enhances our nations \n     ability to response to contingencies.\n       Provides $141 million for increased fuel costs.\n       $3.7 billion to continue and enhance our Intelligence \n     activities in theater.\n       $600 million for the Defense Health Program to provide for \n     the care and recovery of our wounded service members.\n       $193 million for Counter-Drug activities.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. I also thank my colleagues for their continued support \nof the troops in the field.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The senior Senator from \nVirginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if I could get the attention of the \ndistinguished chairman, might it be advisable that we rotate sides? I \nwill be happy to follow a colleague on your side for purposes of this \ndebate.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Fine. That is fine with us. I yield 5 minutes to the \nSenator from Ohio, and we will come back to you.\n  Mr. WARNER. Fine. The Senator from Ohio is in support of the \namendment of the Senator from Michigan?\n  Mr. LEVIN. That is correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask that I be recognized following the \nSenator from Ohio for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in favor of the \nLevin amendment on Iraq. As my colleagues know, I have long supported a \ngreater level of oversight in the war in Iraq. Many of us feel we \nshould have done a better job of force oversight at the beginning of \nthe war. I was quite taken with a quote from Condoleezza Rice recently, \nwho said, ``I wish we had known more about Iraq before we went in.''\n  While in Iraq in August, I witnessed a great deal of progress on the \nground. That gave me encouragement. However, I was also convinced that \nit would not be possible to sustain the current level of troops and \nfunding for Iraq over the long term without damaging our national \nsecurity and long-term fiscal health.\n  As stated before, I believe we need to implement a plan to reduce our \nmilitary presence in Iraq and focus the remaining military presence on \na more limited role. This is clearly the plan General Petraeus is \nimplementing now, and it is the stated goal of the President, as \nmentioned in the Levin amendment, supported by Secretary Gates and \nothers who are concerned about our force level, and that we need more \ntroops in Afghanistan. I have been working with Senator Levin for \nseveral months now to come up with a piece of legislation that could \nsecure bipartisan support in the Senate and send a message to the \nPresident and the world that the Congress intends to exercise oversight \nto ensure we are making progress toward this goal. I have been careful \nto avoid supporting any measure that I thought would hurt our troops in \nany way, tie the hands of our brave commanders in the field, or prevent \nthe President from responding to the situation on the ground.\n  In September, I introduced a bill with Senators Alexander, Coleman, \nand Dole to strive for a goal to reduce our military presence. We had \nbipartisan support for that, but Senator Levin and I had a problem with \nthe date. Unfortunately, it fell by the wayside.\n  I support the Levin amendment, and I am a cosponsor to this \nlegislation because I believe it is a very simple piece of legislation \nthat accomplished the goals we all share. It sends the message that we \nsupport the President's declared goal of reducing our presence in Iraq \nover time so we can play a more supportive role, bring our forces home, \nand reduce the burden on our military. It is a sense of Congress and \nwill not bind the President in any way or tie the commanders' hands in \nthe field. It is supported by the President's own declared goals and \nthat of his commander, General Petraeus--who is doing, by the way, an \nincredible job. It provides a goal for limiting our role in Iraq, and \nthat goal is to end at the end of next year. But, unlike other past \nlegislation, this date is not legally binding and would allow the \nPresident to respond according to the security conditions on the \nground.\n  I believe this amendment will not hurt our aspirations in Iraq in any \nway but will actually help our President and General Petraeus, who are \nstriving now to hand over more responsibility to the Iraqis.\n  This week, it was announced that the Iraq Government is ready to take \nover local security groups, with our support. This is an important \nstep, and it is a step in the right direction. We need to continue in \nthis direction. We need to make it our goal. We need to let the Iraqis \nknow that they must take more responsibility for their own security.\n  We must make it clear to them that we spent over $550 billion, that \nwe have lost almost 3,900 individuals, 26,000 people have been wounded \nover there, and half of them are going to be disabled for the rest of \ntheir lives.\n  We have paid a tremendous price. It is time for them to step up to \nthe table and start doing more for themselves. I support this amendment \nso Congress can send that message that we are not simply funding a \nnever-ending conflict in Iraq, we have a goal of reducing our presence \nthere, and we are working toward it.\n  I hope my colleagues realize the sensibility behind this very simple \npiece of legislation and join me in supporting it today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, it had originally been established that I \nwould speak now, but I am going to yield the time I have to the \ndistinguished Senator from South Carolina for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Virginia, thank \nyou. I do hope you will take an opportunity to speak because your voice \nneeds to be heard.\n  I say to my good friend Senator Levin, we have had a number of \nchances to work together. I am afraid this is not one of those moments.\n  What does all of this mean if this language passes? The bill will get \nvetoed. And when you read the language, what is so bad about it? I know \nthe intent of the author is to try to make Iraq a better place, and he \nsaid for as long--I do not want to misquote him--as long as you have \nthis many troops in Iraq, they are not going to do what they need to do \npolitically. They use the troops as a crutch. I think that is the \ngeneral theme, that we need to somehow let the Iraqi Government know we \nare not going to be there forever with this number of troops. You need \nto step up to the plate, generally speaking. I think that is your view \nof how to put pressure on the Maliki government to reconcile, but, \nagain, I will let you speak for yourself.\n  My view is that the lack of security has been the biggest impediment \nto reconciliation, and the security changes in Iraq give us the best \nhope we have had in 4 years of finding a way forward politically in \nIraq. If we change by word or deed or perception our commitment to the \nmilitary strategy that is currently working, we would be undercutting \nour best chance for reconciliation.\n\n[[Page S15856]]\n\n  This amendment, this sense-of-the-Senate amendment, does not do \nanything positive. It sends the signal I have been trying to avoid for \nwell over a year now. For 3\\1/2\\ years we had the wrong strategy. \nFinally we have the right strategy, and in my opinion, the best, \nsensible thing the Senate could do is allow the surge to go forward \nwithout any interference, give General Petraeus and those under his \ncommand what they need to finish the job. They have done a wonderful \njob. We are going into the holiday season here and every American, \nevery political leader, should celebrate what I think has been the most \noutstanding military operation in counterinsurgency history, and we \nshould not have any more debates about that. It is a fact now. We \nshould support it without reservation.\n  This amendment, the sense of the Senate, will send a confusing signal \nabout what we intend to do militarily. The Senate, in my opinion, \nshould not try to change the mission. The mission is to win. Very \nsimply put, what is my goal in Iraq? My goal is to win a war we cannot \nafford to lose, to have a military footprint in Iraq as long as it \ntakes to keep al-Qaida on the run, and when we come home, which we \nsurely will, to come home with victory in hand and let the military \ncommanders who are not worried about the 2008 election decide when that \ntransition should take place. Quite frankly, as much as I love my \ncolleagues in this body, I do not trust anybody, including myself, to \ntransition this mission other than General Petraeus.\n  This statement will be seized upon by people who are following this \nbill very closely and will send all of the wrong signals, and that is \nwhy it will be vetoed. The most sensible thing the Senate could do, and \nwe should have done this 4 or 5 months ago, is allow the surge to go \nforward without political interference. This is not the time to take \ncommand of the operation in Iraq from General Petraeus and his command \nteam and give it to the Senate.\n  I hope and pray we will allow the surge to be funded, to go forward, \nand to achieve the goal that is in the national interest of the United \nStates, and that is victory, victory over extremism and support of \nmoderation. So this attempt at making a political statement is ill-\nadvised, comes at the wrong time, sends the wrong signal. The most \nsensible thing the Senate could do is reject this and allow our \nmilitary commanders to transition based on facts on the ground, not the \nnext poll or the next election.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Rhode \nIsland, Mr. Reed.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, Senator Levin has very eloquently pointed \nout the premise of the President's surge strategy; that was to provide \nthe political space so that the Iraqi Government could essentially \nbegin a reconciliation among its own people, begin to function \neffectively. Little or none of that has happened.\n  What has happened is that the violence has been reduced. That is \ncommendable. It is attributable to several factors; first, the increase \nof American forces there and the way they have been deployed very \nadroitly by our military commanders; secondly, the fact that \ncoincidentally but propitiously in Anbar Province, Sunni tribesmen have \nfinally figured out that al-Qaida is as much a threat to them as to \nanyone else, particularly Americans. They have banded together with us \nto attack al-Qaida elements there. How long that relationship of \nconvenience lasts is a question that has not been resolved.\n  Within Baghdad, there has been significant ethnic cleansing. In fact, \nwe recall just weeks ago, refugees started coming back. They were told \nby the Government in Baghdad: Do not come back. You are going to \nprovoke another destabilizing situation. That ethnic cleansing is one \nother factor.\n  Sadr, the leader of the Shia in the South, one of the purported \nleaders in the South, has basically told his Mahdi army to stand down \nfor 6 months so he can reorganize, so he can regroup, so when he feels \nthe moment is right he is in a much more powerful position to strike.\n  Then the administration has finally embraced some diplomatic efforts; \nquietly, I think, with the Iranians, much more publicly with the \nSyrians and others. All of those factors together have contributed to \nthis reduced violence.\n  But here is one of the most significant and salient facts we have to \nrecognize: The surge is over. Our force structure will not allow a \ncontinuation of 160,000 American forces in Iraq beyond the middle of \nthis year, beyond this summer. That is not because some politician in \nWashington said so, that is because the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff, because the Chief of Staff of the Army understand that the \noperational tempo will not allow that.\n  The question before us is: Well, what is the strategy now? Is the \nstrategy coming here and asking for billions of dollars every 3 or 4 \nmonths? Asking for troops that cannot be actively or effectively \nprovided, because our force structure is too small?\n  The essence of this amendment, an amendment that Senator Levin and I \nand others have been pursuing for months now, is to focus on a strategy \nthat can be sustained and supported so we can do what we must do. That \nstrategy, in our view, boils down to three very specific missions: Go \nafter the terrorists, the al-Qaida people, wherever they are; train \nIraqi security forces to support their country, because ultimately the \nIraqi people and their leaders will decide whether their country will \nsurvive and prosper, not American forces; and, finally, protect our \nforces on the ground.\n  Those are three discrete missions that can be done, should be done. \nThere is no attempt in this amendment to cut off funding. There is an \nattempt, though, to focus our policy on a strategy that will work over \ntime. What we have here is no simple situation in which you have got an \nal-Qaida rogue group we are going after. This is a very complicated \nsituation.\n  Ultimately at the heart of this, it is a political struggle between \nSunni, Shia, and Kurds; Sunnis, who feel a profound sense of \nentitlement which has been frustrated by our operations over there, and \nthe departure of the Baathist regime; Shia, who feel profoundly \nparanoid because they suffered grievously under that regime; and Kurds, \nwho want their autonomy.\n  These political forces have to be settled. They will only be settled \ninternally by the Iraqis standing up. This amendment will help direct \nthat policy, force them to recognize we are not there indefinitely with \na blank check. It will also guide our forces to missions that we can \nperform, that will be essential to our security and will allow us, I \nbelieve, to do what we can to help that country stabilize itself.\n  This is a message. It is a message to the troops that we are going to \nadopt a wise, sustainable policy that is worthy of their sacrifice. It \nis a message, I hope, to the President that he cannot come back here \nevery 6 months and ask for 5, 10, 50, 70, 80, $100 billion. It is a \nmessage to the Iraqi politicians that they must seize this moment.\n  I urge passage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank my friend from Virginia.\n  I rise to support the amendment I am privileged to cosponsor with the \nSenator from Kentucky, Mr. McConnell, which would give our troops, \nGeneral Petraeus in the field, the funding they need to carry on the \nfight they are carrying on so successfully.\n  As a result, I rise to oppose the amendment introduced by my friend \nfrom Michigan and others. Nine months ago, when General Petraeus took \ncommand in Baghdad, people of good conscience could disagree about \nwhether his new counterinsurgency strategy would succeed, unless you \ndecided that everything was lost in Iraq or it did not matter if we \nlost in Iraq. I think most of us do not feel that way. We know it would \nmatter, because we are engaged in a battle with al-Qaida, the same al-\nQaida that attacked us on 9/11, and Iran, the most significant state \nsponsor of terrorism, according to our own State Department, supporting \nmilitias and extremists in Iraq. So it matters.\n  But 9 months ago, people who cared about whether we won or lost in \nIraq could argue about whether the surge strategy would work. After so \nmany\n\n[[Page S15857]]\n\nmistakes, frankly, in the conduct of the war in Iraq, many Americans, \nmany Members of this Chamber, were understandably skeptical about the \npossibility of this new counterinsurgency strategy succeeding.\n  Now, however, the evidence is unequivocal. I will say it is \nremarkable. In some cases it is downright miraculous. The surge is \nworking. As a result, it is time to support General Petraeus, his plan, \nand his troops, not to second guess, not to editorialize about it, not \nto add conditions or goals to it.\n  Let's do something that we in Congress do not do very well, which is \nto remain silent in the face of something that is working. With all \nrespect, the Levin amendment is a classic case of snatching defeat from \nthe jaws of victory, because we are on the road to victory in Iraq.\n  The extra American troops have played a critical part, the broad-\nscale counterinsurgency strategy. And what has happened? Violence is \ndown. I think this number has been cited, but this week, MG Joseph Fil, \nwho is the commander of our operations in Baghdad, said that attacks in \nthe capital city have fallen nearly 80 percent since November of 2006; \nmurders in Baghdad Province are down by 90 percent over the same \nperiod; and vehicle-borne bombs which have killed so many of our troops \nand the Iraqi people have dropped by 70 percent.\n  There is a people's uprising occurring in Iraq today. It started with \nthe awakening in Anbar. It has now gone on to Baghdad and other \nprovinces throughout the country. I know those sponsors of this \namendment have said they want to send it as a message to the Iraqi \nnational political leadership to get with it, to reconcile. Of course, \nwe are all frustrated by their lack of progress in doing that. A lot of \nus thought that the political changes in Iraq would come from the top \ndown. But what has happened is something not to disparage, not to \nignore. What has happened is classically democratic, in the best \ntraditions of America. The political changes in Iraq are coming from \nthe bottom up, from the grassroots up. Local councils are governing in \narea after area. The local people have taken charge of their destiny. \nThey have kicked out al-Qaida. They have kicked out al-Qaida because \nthey decided that al-Qaida was their enemy. And we, much to their \nsurprise, turned out to be their friends, their supporter. They \nunderstand we do not want conquest in Iraq. We want to liberate them \nfrom the forces of extremism. The same is happening throughout the \ncountry.\n  I urge my colleagues, let success alone. Let it work. Oppose the \nLevin-Reed amendment and support the McConnell-Lieberman amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I think I can almost speak for our side \nwith certainty. I have a few comments, followed by perhaps a minute and \na half by the Republican leader, and then that way we can yield back \ntime. I will proceed to give my comments.\n  I say to my good friend from Michigan that I picked one word out of \nhis very impressive opening comments. I agree with his opening comments \nabout the tragic situation by which the leadership in Iraq, their \nlegislative body, has failed to act.\n  But one word you said impressed me, and that is ``military progress \nis being made.'' That is an exact quote you used. You felt if we didn't \nspeak by adopting your amendment, there would be silence. I say to my \ngood friend, the amendment by the distinguished Republican leader and \nthe Senator from Connecticut, the McConnell-Lieberman amendment, will \nsend a very strong message. Were we to adopt your amendment, it would \nbe in conflict with that message. That is my concern. Therefore, I must \nsay, I strongly support the McConnell-Lieberman amendment. I hope that \nwill be voted on very shortly. I do believe, in all sincerity, your \namendment would send a conflicting message. That message could be \nexceedingly troublesome. People don't understand the phraseology \n``sense of the Senate.'' Al-Qaida would simply clip that off and then \nannounce that we are going to leave in December, irrespective of the \nfacts on the ground. Furthermore, we have not been in this fight alone. \nWe put together a coalition of forces, a coalition of nations, \nprimarily Great Britain and others, Poland. So far as I know, there has \nbeen no consultation with respect to your amendment to announce a goal \nby December of next year with those other fighting forces that, while \nthey are smaller in number, are no less important as a symbol of the \nunited effort of many nations to achieve, first, sovereignty in Iraq, \nwhich has been a wonderful goal that has been achieved, and now to \nenable that country to take its place rightfully in that region and be \na strong voice for freedom and to fight al-Qaida.\n  I say to my friend, I will have to oppose his amendment because it \nwould send a totally conflicting message with the underlying amendment, \nwhich is a very significant appropriation of funds to continue, as you \nsay, in your very words, the ``progress'' of the military so far.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Before I yield to the Senator from California, let me \nrespond briefly to my friend from Virginia. There is no inconsistency \nbetween voting to adopt a sense-of-the-Senate resolution expressing as \na goal, nonbinding, that we complete a transition to a more limited \nmission, a mission which the President says he wants to transition to \nby the end of next year and at the same time voting for the McConnell \namendment. There will be many Senators voting for the Levin-Reed \namendment who are also going to vote for the McConnell amendment. There \nis no inconsistency whatsoever between sending our troops the funding \nwhich has been requested and having a goal for the transition of their \nmission to something which gets them out of the middle of a civil war. \nThat is the one point I wish to make immediately to my good friend from \nVirginia.\n  I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, it seems to me if you want to liberate the \nIraqi people, then you give them back the country and you let them know \nthat is what this is all about. We have been there 1 year, 2 years, 3 \nyears, 4 years, 5 years. We have spent a half a trillion dollars; 3,893 \nof our own killed, 28,711 wounded. Is this forever? I went through the \nperiod of time in the Vietnam war where the people of this country \nstood up and said: Enough is enough is enough. It seems to me what \nSenator Levin is doing--and I am so proud he has bipartisan support, \nSenators Hagel, Voinovich, Snowe, Smith--is good. This shows we are \nbeginning to cross over party lines, which is so important, and say: It \nis time the mission changes.\n  My dear friend from Virginia talks about the Brits. This is exactly \nwhat the Brits have already done. They are getting out. They have \nturned the keys of the city over to the Iraqis. They are ahead of us. \nIn many ways, this resolution tracks what they have done. I read it. It \nis very simple. It is a sense of the Congress that the missions of the \nU.S. Armed Forces should be transitioned to a more limited set--\ncounterterrorism, training, equipping, supporting Iraqi forces, and \nforce protection. Yes, we are sending a message to the Maliki \nGovernment, get your act together because we are not going to be here \nforever. The American people are generous and good people. But there is \na limit to how much they can give in terms of blood and treasure.\n  It is true that many people supporting this resolution are going to \nvote for the McConnell amendment. I will not be one of them. I wish to \nspeak against it for my remaining time. I have a list of what we have \nalready spent. A half a trillion dollars, that is what we have already \nspent, and we are about to go well over that mark, toward a trillion \ndollars. There comes a time when we have to ask ourselves: What are we \ndoing in Iraq? If you listen to the President, it is to bring freedom. \nHe said it was the weapons of mass destruction. Then he changed that. \nHe said it was to get Saddam. We got Saddam. Then he changed it. He \nsaid we have to have free and fair elections. They had two. He said we \nhave to reconstruct. We are spending money to reconstruct.\n  It is now time to say enough is enough. I think the Levin resolution \nis not putting into place binding deadlines. It is merely saying to the \nIraqi Government we want them to step up to the plate.\n\n[[Page S15858]]\n\n  If my colleagues want to be seen as occupiers, vote against this \namendment because that is what is happening. We are seen as occupiers, \nwhen we want to be seen as liberators. If you want to be seen as \nliberators, you do what the Brits did. This is exactly what Senator \nLevin is doing. I am pleased to support this. I will be voting no on \nMcConnell.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I believe we are about ready to vote on \nthis side. We are going to have our leader speak for a minute, and then \nwe can proceed. I simply, once again, say to my distinguished colleague \nfrom Michigan, while we are waiting for the Republican leader, with due \nrespect, this will send a very conflicting message. If the Senate acts \nupon this appropriations tonight favorably, as I anticipate it will, \ncoupled with your message, it could be misconstrued. Therefore, I \nstrongly urge that the Senate accept the McConnell-Lieberman amendment \nbut reject the amendment of the distinguished Senator from Michigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The message is not conflicting at all. There is no \nconflict between saying we are going to support our troops, we are not \ngoing to reduce funding for them, and at the same time have a goal a \nyear hence for when they transition to the more limited mission. There \nis not the slightest inconsistency. It is not a conflicting message. If \nwe are interested in success in Iraq, there is only one way to achieve \nit--for the Iraqi politicians to reach agreement on their differences \nwhich have continued the conflict. That is not just me saying it. That \nis our military leaders.\n  I wish to read this quote because I am not sure people have focused \non it. This is our State Department. I ask my colleagues to listen to \nthis very brief quote from our State Department:\n\n       Senior military commanders portray the intransigence of \n     Iraq's Shiite-dominated government as the key threat facing \n     the U.S. effort in Iraq rather than al-Qaida terrorists, \n     Sunni insurgents or Iranian-backed militias.\n\n  Is that a conflicting message from our State Department, when they \nidentify the political leaders of Iraq as being the major threat to our \nsuccess? They are the major threat to our success. We all know it. Our \nmilitary leaders have said it is the failure of the political leaders \nof Iraq to work out their differences, which is the key problem that \nkeeps the battle going on between Iraqis. That is our State Department. \nIs that a conflicting message? I don't think so.\n  It is the truth. Most of us recognize it. We are all completely \nunhappy with the Iraqi political leaders. Most of us, when we go to \nIraq, tell them that. The President of the United States has even said \nit is useful for that message to be delivered. Let us deliver it \ntonight.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Republican leader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, if we want a Presidential signature on \nthe Omnibus appropriations, thereby finishing our work this year, we \nneed to defeat the Levin amendment and approve the McConnell amendment, \nwhich will come shortly after the Levin amendment. The McConnell \namendment provides $70 billion for our troops, whether they are in \nAfghanistan or Iraq, without any strings attached, without any \nstipulations. The key to finishing our work this year successfully lies \nin defeating the Levin amendment and approving the McConnell amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an explanatory statement \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nExplanatory Statement Submitted by Senator McConnell, Senator Stevens, \n   Senator Cochran, Senator Inouye, and Senator Lieberman Regarding \n       Supplemental Appropriations for the Department of Defense\n\n       The following tabular data delineates by appropriation the \n     funding provided by the McConnell amendment (related to \n     supplemental appropriations for the Department of Defense) to \n     H.R. 2764, the State, Foreign Operations, and Related \n     Programs Appropriations Act, 2008.\n       In regard to classified activities funded in this \n     amendment, a separate letter from the Chairman and Ranking \n     Member of the Defense Subcommittee of the Committee on \n     Appropriations will delineate the programs and activities \n     funded by this amendment.\n\n                         [Dollars in thousands]\n\n

I intend to yield back all that time but 30 seconds. I \ncannot believe the President of the United States is going to veto a \nbill providing this additional funding for the troops because the \nSenate, in a nonbinding resolution, expresses its belief that we ought \nto have a nonbinding timetable for the reduction of our troops by the \nend of the year. If the President has said that, I have not seen it. I \ncan't believe he would so try to squelch the Senate from expressing a \nnonbinding opinion.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the President will veto the bill if the \nLevin amendment is approved. The McConnell amendment must be approved \nin order to get a Presidential signature.\n  Is there time remaining on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 6 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Under the previous order, requiring 60 votes \nfor the adoption of the motion, the motion is agreed to.\n  The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have just a few matters left. We have a \nvote on AMT. This is a vote we have had before. Senator Baucus, the \nFinance chair, will talk about it when we get to it in a few minutes. \nIt is an issue on which I agree with the House. I think we should have \npaid for it. We have had this vote several times before--at least once \nbefore. We have tried different ways of getting the matter before the \nSenate.\n  We have an agreement in the order entered earlier today that we are \ngoing to vote on whether AMT should be paid for. Senator Baucus will \nspeak on that.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3877\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is my understanding there is a motion to \nconcur at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the motion.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Reid] moves to concur in the \n     House amendment No. 1 to the Senate amendment to H.R. 2764, \n     with an amendment numbered 3877.\n\n  (The amendment is printed in Today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will be 1 hour of debate equally \ndivided.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have a vote on this, and we have a vote \non whether we will concur with the House on a matter that we have \nchanged and sent back to them. Then I am going to speak with the \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee. Under the order entered several \ndays ago, we have a judge who is on the calendar. I will talk with the \ndistinguished manager of this bill and the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee to find out if we are going to have a recorded vote.\n  My point is that people should not run off after the second vote. \nThere may be three votes tonight.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The senior Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the next vote is on AMT, paid for. We have \nhad this vote several times. It requires 60 votes. I personally believe \nthat the AMT relief we will be providing for here, so the taxpayers \nwill not have to pay additional AMT for 2007, should be paid for. I \ndon't think the votes are here. There are not 60 votes to pay for it. \nBut once this goes down because it doesn't have 60 votes, it is then my \nexpectation that the House will then vote for AMT not paid for so that \nwe can get AMT passed this year. Americans will know they will not have \nto pay the additional AMT tax, done in a way that is satisfactory.\n  There is an hour allocated on this amendment, a half hour each side. \nMr. President, I don't plan to take many more minutes than I have \nalready consumed. I expect the other side will not either.\n  I will reserve the remainder of my time, with the expectation that I \nwill yield back the remainder of my time. For now, I will reserve my \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume. I haven't had a request on this side for many people to speak. \nI think I will speak for 9 or 10 minutes on my side. If people want \ntime, I will be glad to yield time.\n  When we were debating the Tax Relief Act of 2005, the other side \nforced a series of debates on the same subject matter. We had the same \ndebate three times, and it culminated on Groundhog Day, February 2, \n2006. Despite numerous votes and debates in each round, we went through \nessentially the same debate and vote not once or twice but three times.\n  I have two charts that will remind folks of that exercise.\n  My first chart depicts a groundhog. For those of you who see the \ngroundhog, you will recall that the centerpiece of that debate involved \nthe alternative minimum tax patch. During the first groundhog debate, \nthe bipartisan majority had to prove that we meant business on the \ncornerstone of that bill, which was the last AMT patch that was \nenacted. I am referring to the AMT patch that protected then about 15 \nmillion families, and now we are talking about protecting about 23 \nmillion families.\n  The bipartisan majority, I am pleased to remind everybody, stuck to \nour guns in conference on that bill. We made sure the AMT patch was one \nof the cornerstones of the conference agreement. So despite the \nextended debate, what we said would happen did happen.\n  Now, the next Groundhog Day is February 2, 2008. That is just 45 days \nfrom now. That may seem like a long time, but given recent history, I \nam worried. Here is why.\n  About 47 days ago, the two tax-writing committee chairmen, \nCongressman Rangel and Senator Baucus, and the ranking members, \nCongressman McCrery, and this Senator, wrote Secretary Paulson and \nacting IRS Commissioner Stiff and pledged to get an AMT patch bill to \nthe President before the end of the year. We wrote the letter for a \ncouple of reasons. The first reason is to spare 23 million middle-\nincome families from an average tax increase of $2,000 per family. As \neveryone now agrees, this monster tax was not meant to hit 23 million \nmiddle-income families. The second reason was to assure the Secretary \nof the Treasury and the IRS Commissioner that we would do everything \npossible to minimize delays in refunds for another 27 million families \nand individuals, on top of the 23 million who would be hit for the \nfirst time.\n  After pledging to get mutually agreeable AMT patch legislation to the \nPresident in a form he could sign--that is what the letter was about--\nwe are instead now engaged in this Groundhog Day type of exercise. We \nare essentially having the same debate, and we will go through the same \nvotes the Senate went through just a couple of weeks ago. In other \nwords, the floor debate tonight illustrates my worry that we are \nrepeating the Groundhog Day exercise.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a copy of that \nletter by the two chairmen and ranking members.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                Congress of the United States,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 30, 2007.\n     Ms. Linda E. Stiff,\n     Acting Commissioner, Internal Revenue Service, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Acting Commissioner Stiff: Under present law, more \n     than 23 million taxpayers will be subject to higher taxes in \n     2007 unless legislation is enacted to limit the reach of the \n     Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT). We realize that this fact is \n     causing concern for many taxpayers and is creating \n     administrative difficulties for the IRS as the agency \n     prepares for the upcoming filing season.\n       As the leaders of the Congressional tax-writing committees, \n     we want to assure you that legislative relief is forthcoming \n     so that no new taxpayers will be subject to the AMT for \n     taxable year 2007. To accomplish this, we are committed to \n     extending and indexing the 2006 AMT patch with the goal of \n     ensuring that not one additional taxpayer faces higher taxes \n     in 2007 due to the onerous AMT. In addition to allowing the \n     personal credits against the AMT, the exemption amount for \n     2007 will be set at $44,350 for individuals and $66,250 for \n     married taxpayers filing jointly.\n       We plan to do everything possible to enact AMT relief \n     legislation in a form mutually agreeable to the Congress and \n     the President before the end of the year. We urge the \n     Internal Revenue Service to take all steps necessary to plan \n     for changes that would be made by the legislation.\n       Thank you for your immediate attention to this matter.\n           Sincerely yours,\n     Max Baucus,\n       Chairman, Committee on Finance.\n     Charles E. Grassley,\n       Ranking Member, Committee on Finance.\n     Charles B. Rangel,\n       Chairman, Committee on Ways and Means.\n     Jim McCrery,\n       Ranking Member, Committee on Ways and Means.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. So we are not quite there yet, but the way we are \ngoing, we\n\n[[Page S15862]]\n\nmight not get this year's AMT patch done until the next Groundhog Day.\n  Let me bring up another chart to expand on this point. I have next to \nme the portrait of Punxsutawney Phil, that famous groundhog. In \nthinking of Phil and the weather report he will provide in 45 days, I \nalso thought about the popular film entitled ``Groundhog Day.'' That \nmovie stars Bill Murray, in which a man relives the same day--Groundhog \nDay--over and over and over. This film has taken on greater \nsignificance for me as I seem to be in a very similar situation. More \nthan just a sense of the deja vu, I feel I am reliving a past \nexperience.\n  We are going through the same debate we had a couple of weeks ago. We \nare on a different bill and the amendment has different offsets. Yet I \nseem to remember already having this debate.\n  So, Mr. President, instead of taking the next steps and focusing on \nwhat we said we would do in the letter and finding a mutually \nagreeable--those are words from the letter--resolution to the AMT \npatch, the House Democratic leadership is insisting that the Senate \nrepeat the same debate and vote of just last week.\n  At 5:01 p.m., on Tuesday, December 4, 2007, we took up H.R. 3996, \nwith the title ``Temporary Tax Relief Act of 2007.'' For several hours \non Tuesday, Wednesday, and into Thursday, we debated the bill. The \nfinal vote on final passage came at 7:25 p.m., Thursday evening, \nDecember 6.\n  According to the Secretary of the Senate, 93 of us were here for that \nvote. So I must not be the only one reliving this experience.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the results of \nthat final vote.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       The result was announced--yeas 88, nays 5, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 415 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--88\n\n     Akaka\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Barrasso\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Bennett\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Brown\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burr\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Cardin\n     Casey\n     Chambliss\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Corker\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeMint\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Durbin\n     Enzi\n     Feinstein\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Isakson\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Klobuchar\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Martinez\n     McCaskill\n     McConnell\n     Menendez\n     Mikulski\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Salazar\n     Sanders\n     Schumer\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Tester\n     Thune\n     Vitter\n     Warner\n     Webb\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--5\n\n     Carper\n     Conrad\n     Dorgan\n     Feingold\n     Whitehouse\n\n                             NOT VOTING--7\n\n     Biden\n     Clinton\n     Dodd\n     Ensign\n     McCain\n     Obama\n     Voinovich\n\n                        Majority \\1/2\\ Required\n\n       Vote date: 12/06/2007, 6:23:00 p.m., Business Type: L.\n       Result Code: 1 (Bill Passed).\n       Vote title: H.R. 3996 as Amended.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, as we consider the Senate amendment to \nthe omnibus bill, I have to ask: Why are we still here? I have to ask: \nDidn't we already go through this exercise? I have to ask: Aren't we \nfinished with the Senate debate?\n  In the face of the urgent need to enact an AMT patch, does the House \nDemocratic leadership want the Senate to reenact recent debates and \nresuscitate old talking points? Our un-offset AMT patch already passed \nwith the support of 88 Senators.\n  While I believe this legislation is extremely important and we will \ndebate it for as long as is necessary, I question the necessity of \ngoing through a process that resulted in overwhelming bipartisan \npassage of the same bill 2 weeks ago.\n  That is my first point. This is, in fact, a curious exercise. It is \nan exercise with no apparent purpose other than delay. Is the delay on \nthe part of the House Democratic leadership important? Why doesn't the \nHouse send the amended House bill which cleared this Chamber by a vote \nof 88 to 5 to the President of the United States for signature? Because \nPresident Bush will sign it. That bill does meet--again the words from \nthe letter of the chairman of the committee--that bill does meet the \nmutually agreeable criteria of the tax writers' letter. The amendment \nbefore us, just as the prior House vote, does not meet the mutually \nagreeable criteria that was in that letter.\n  Nearly all House and Senate Republicans have a problem with this \namendment and its predecessor that failed in the Senate. The problem is \nnot necessarily with the offsets themselves. Some of them might be \nacceptable tax policy to this Senator and others on our side. The \ndebate and resistance on our side rests with a bigger principle. It is \nabout accepting the notion that the unintended reach of the AMT should \nbe permitted unless we find offsetting revenue from other taxpayers; in \nother words, other taxpayers being taxed to offset revenue from middle-\nincome taxpayers who were never supposed to pay this tax in the first \nplace. It is the use of the AMT then as an open-ended revenue-\ngenerating machine that creates problems on the Republican side of the \naisle.\n  I am going to point to another chart to illustrate this debate. This \nis a chart of a very fine horse, a horse named Trigger and his rider \nRoy Rogers. Trigger is a fine horse, but he is dead. He is very dead. \nTrigger is so dead that he is stuffed and resides in a museum. This \ndebate is the practice of beating a dead horse. It would be like \ntourists taking swipes at Trigger as they go through the museum. \nEveryone knows beating a dead horse is a waste of time, but that is \nwhat we are doing. We need to stop beating a dead horse. We need to \nshow our good friends in the House Democratic leadership that they need \nto stop reviving a dead horse of an offset AMT patch. It is a dead \nhorse. Let's stop beating it. Vote against this amendment.\n  After this exercise is done, then I urge my friends in the House \nleadership to pass the un-offset AMT patch bill we sent them several \ndays ago, that very same bill that passed this body 88 to 5.\n  Think, will you, on the other side of the Capitol, think of the 23 \nmillion families that will face a tax increase of $2,000 per family if \nwe don't get this bill to the President. Think of the 27 million \nfamilies and individuals that will face even longer delays in getting \ntheir refunds next year if we don't get this bill passed, or even if we \ndo get this bill passed, it is going to be delayed. Think of these \nhard-working taxpayers. Stop beating a dead horse and let's get the \npeople's business done.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Pryor). The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the Senator from North Dakota has some \ncomments about not beating a dead horse. I now yield 7 minutes to the \nSenator from North Dakota.\n  I might say, we should not beat a dead horse, that is clear, but also \nwe should not look a gift horse in the mouth. We have an opportunity to \nresolve this and get it done. I urge us to vote quickly so we can \ndispose of this matter so the American taxpayers get their AMT relief \nvery quickly.\n  I yield to the Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank the chairman.\n  I say to the Senator from Iowa when he tells us that we should stop \nbeating a dead horse, the picture he used shows that Trigger rides \nagain. That wasn't a dead horse. That horse is alive, and as well it \nshould be, because the underlying question is whether we pay for \nanything in this Chamber or do we borrow the money? When we borrow the \nmoney, do we borrow it from the Chinese and the Japanese, or do we \nstart paying our bills right here at home? That is the issue before the \nChamber. It is not a question of a dead horse or a live horse. It is a \nfundamental question of whether we pay our bills or put it on the \ncharge card.\n  The issue before us is very simple. If we do not offset the \nalternative minimum tax or alter it in some way, it will hit 23 million \nAmerican families, up from some 4.2 million this last year.\n  The bill before us says, yes, adjust the alternative minimum tax so \nmore\n\n[[Page S15863]]\n\npeople are not hit by it, but it also says something very important. It \nsays pay for it; don't go out and borrow the money, don't go out and \nborrow billions more from China and Japan.\n  The House has it right. We ought to pay for it. Certainly it makes no \nsense to let the alternative minimum tax sweep up millions more people, \nbut it also makes no sense to fail to pay for it. That is not just my \nview; that is also the view of the former chairman of the Federal \nReserve who said on ABC's weekend program in response to a question \nfrom George Stephanopoulos, the question was put to the chairman:\n\n       So when the Congress this week . . . fixes this patch in \n     the alternative minimum tax . . . and doesn't pay for the \n     increase in the deficit, that is something you're against?\n\n  Mr. Greenspan:\n\n       Yes.\n\n  No qualifications, a simple clear statement in support of paying for \nfixing the alternative minimum tax.\n\n  Why is paying for it so important? Because if we fail to do so, we \nput it on the debt, and already the debt has skyrocketed under this \nadministration, from $5.8 trillion in 2001 to, at the end of the fiscal \nyear that just ended, a debt of $8.9 trillion.\n  Future generations will look back on this one. Perhaps they will be \namused by the debate tonight. They will not be amused by the debt we \nleave them. This generation will not be known as the greatest \ngeneration. This generation will be known as a greedy generation, a \nself-oriented generation, one that was not responsible with the \npeople's money.\n  Some of my colleagues claim we never intended to raise this money, \nthat it was no part of any budget, that it was not part of any revenue \nprojection. I beg to differ. As chairman of the Senate Budget \nCommittee, I can tell you that these revenues have been in every budget \nwritten by this President, and written by the Congress, whether \ncontrolled by the Republicans or the Democrats. The only way any of \nthese budgets have balanced was to assume this revenue which is the law \nof the land would either be collected or would be offset, would be paid \nfor.\n  This chart shows the revenue assumptions in the Bush budget. We find \nalternative minimum tax revenue assumed for each and every year of the \n5 years of this budget.\n  I won't belabor the point. This is a question of whether we are going \nto be responsible. This is an opportunity to fix the alternative \nminimum tax, to prevent it from being spread to 23 million American \nfamilies, but to do it in the responsible way: to offset it with other \nrevenue so it does not get added to the deficit, so it does not get \nadded to the debt, so we are not compelled to borrow even more billions \nfrom the Japanese and the Chinese and around the world.\n  I hope my colleagues will vote ``aye'' and demonstrate their fiscal \nresponsibility tonight.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, yes, we have been here before. I hear the \nSenator from Iowa, whom I greatly respect, say we have been here before \nand have done this over and over. In the last 2 hours, we have made the \nsame mistake, or about to make the same mistake, that we have made in \nthe last 6 years. About 7 groundhog days ago, if you will, we went from \na budget surplus to huge budget deficits, as Senator Conrad pointed \nout. Do you know why? Because we are in the middle of a war that \nSenator Byrd spoke so eloquently against time and again on this Senate \nfloor, a war that has cost us $500 billion and counting, and we have \ndone tax cuts over and over. Every groundhog day we do another tax cut.\n  So tonight, in the space of 2 hours, we are going to encapsulate that \nin one evening. We did $70 billion for a war nobody is willing to pay \nfor. Let our grandchildren pay for that one. And then we are doing more \ntax cuts, hundreds of billions of dollars we are not paying for, so let \nour grandchildren take care of it.\n  We have been here before, and it is about time we vote ``yes'' on \nthis and do the right thing, so instead of these going from a budget \nsurplus 7 groundhog days to hundreds of billions of dollars in budget \ndeficits, instead we have an opportunity, as Senator Conrad said, to do \nthe right thing to begin to pay for things as we go so that our \ngrandchildren will not continue to be burdened with our profligacy and \nour irresponsibility.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, if the other side is ready to yield back \ntheir time, I will yield back our time, but I want to find out if they \nare interested in doing that.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I yield back our time.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield back our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Delaware (Mr. Biden), \nthe Senator from New York (Mrs. Clinton), the Senator from Connecticut \n(Mr. Dodd), the Senator from California (Mrs. Feinstein), and the \nSenator from Illinois (Mr. Obama) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. LOTT.

Under the previous order requiring 60 votes \nfor the adoption of this motion, the motion is withdrawn.\n  The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I move to concur in the House amendment.\n  Mr. President, there is a proverb from the Book of Matthew that says: \n``For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.''\n  In the past few weeks, as we have put together the budget that is now \nbefore us, Democrats have sought to put our hearts and our treasure \nwhere the American people need them most.\n  President Bush and his Republican allies in Congress have been \ndetermined from the start to stand in our way.\n  The President picked a top line budget number out of thin air and \nsaid he would veto any bill that invested another dime above this total \nin the needs of the American people--no matter how many children, \nstudents, working families veterans or senior citizens would be harmed.\n  This from the President who inherited record surpluses when he took \noffice and turned them into record deficits.\n  This from the President who has spent nearly $500 billion--all of it \nborrowed--to fight a war of choice in Iraq, while ignoring the \ndesperate needs that we face here at home.\n  And this from congressional Republicans who have rubber-stamped his \nevery irresponsible, wasteful, reckless choice.\n  But now, this year, this President and these Bush-Cheney Republicans\n\n[[Page S15864]]\n\nclaim--after years leading our country down a path of fiscal ruin--they \nhave been baptized into the church of fiscal responsibility.\n  Under this false pretense, they went about to prevent us from \npresenting appropriations bills that help America's working families.\n  With the power of the President's veto and a core group of \ncongressional Republicans willing to back it up, this fight has not \nbeen easy. That is an understatement.\n  Nevertheless, in the past few weeks, we have worked within the \nPresident's arbitrary top line to make it clear to the American people \nwhere our hearts and our fiscal priorities lie.\n  Every victory in the appropriations bills now before us--every \nbenefit to working families, every investment in our Nation's future--\nwe have had to fight for, tooth and nail.\n  Bush-Cheney Republicans turned their backs on medical science in this \nbudget.\n  They tried to cut 800 grants for medical research at the National \nInstitutes of Health--programs that would help find cures for dread \ndiseases.\n  Our Democratic priorities are different.\n  We want to spread hope--real scientific hope--that those who suffer \nfrom Alzheimer's, cancer, Parkinson's and diabetes and other maladies \nwill see a brighter, healthier day.\n  So we restored the Bush-Cheney Republican cuts to the NIH and \ninvested more than $600 million in medical research.\n  We refused to back down and we won that fight.\n  The Bush-Cheney Republican budget would have slashed access to health \ncare by $600 million--leaving many of the most vulnerable Americans \nwith nowhere to turn.\n  But our Democratic priorities are different.\n  We believe in helping the little girl with asthma, for whom the \nemergency room is a revolving door because her parents can't afford a \ndoctor; or the uninsured laborer who gets injured on the job; or the \nsenior citizen who suffers from arthritis.\n  We gave these Americans a better chance to live healthy lives--with \n$1 billion above the President's request for programs like community \nhealth centers, high risk insurance pools and rural hospitals--programs \non which hundreds of thousands of low-income Americans rely.\n  We refused to back down on America's health care needs, and we won \nthat fight.\n  If the Bush-Cheney Republicans got their way, this budget would have \nstripped $1.2 billion from education, eliminated major student aid \nprograms and cut vocational education by 50 percent.\n  But Democrats have different priorities here, too.\n  We believe that education is the great equalizer in America, and that \nevery American child deserves the right to a quality education and the \nkeys to a better future.\n  We backed that commitment with major investments in Title 1, special \neducation, teacher quality grants, after school programs, Head Start, \nstudent aid grants and technical training--all above the Bush-Cheney \nRepublican request.\n  Democrats refused to back down and let Republicans rob children of \nthe chance to succeed, and we won that fight.\n  Bush-Cheney Republicans talk tough on law enforcement, but when it \ncame time to actually give our State and local law enforcement the \ntools they need to keep us safe, Bush-Cheney Republicans said no.\n  Their budget cut law enforcement funds by $1.4 billion at the \nDepartment of Justice.\n  Once again, Democrats' priorities are different. We invested $1.2 \nbillion more than the President's request to help our police fight \ncrime.\n  We refused to back down from our commitment to safer neighborhoods, \nand we won that fight.\n  Bush-Cheney Republicans try hard to scare us with the threat of \nterrorism. Did their budget match their rhetoric? No.\n  They cut more than $1 billion in homeland security grants for police, \nfirefighters and medical personnel.\n  What are our priorities? Democrats increased our commitment to \nfighting terrorism by nearly $2 billion.\n  We refused to believe that at a time we are spending $12 billion a \nmonth in Iraq and Afghanistan, we couldn't spend an additional $2 \nbillion per year to fight terrorism in America.\n  We won that fight, too, and America will be safer because of it.\n  The same year when the Minneapolis bridge collapse tragically \nreminded us that our roads, bridges and tunnels are crumbling, Bush-\nCheney Republicans tried to strip critical infrastructure projects from \nthe budget.\n  Democrats refused to stand by while the President spends billions to \nbuild roads in Iraq, but tells us we can't do anything about our roads \nin America.\n  We can do something and we did. We refused to back down and we won \nthe fight for American infrastructure.\n  When it came time to choose between energy independence and big oil, \nbetween a clean environment and the special interests, the Bush-Cheney \nRepublicans chose the special interests.\n  Our priorities are consumers who are spending more than ever to pay \nfor gas for their cars and heat for their homes.\n  We take the side of cleaner air and renewable fuels by investing in \nsolar energy, wind energy, biofuels and energy efficiency.\n  We stood up to Bush-Cheney Republicans, who once again turned their \nbacks on science and cozied up to the major polluters.\n  We won that fight, and America will be safer and cleaner because we \ndid.\n  I am so grateful for my Democratic colleagues in the House and \nSenate.\n  We have faced a level of arbitrary stubbornness from President Bush \nand his congressional allies that no Congress has ever faced before.\n  We turned a horrible budget into a budget that does some good, \nimportant things.\n  And we did it responsibly: without raising taxes or adding anything \nto President Bush's epic pile of debt.\n  Our country owes enormous gratitude to the senior Senator from West \nVirginia, Chairman Robert Byrd, for his leadership on this budget.\n  Chairman Obey also did a tremendous job on this legislation.\n  I would also like to acknowledge the work of Senator Cochran, who \nworked with Senator Byrd and others to move this bill through committee \nand to the floor.\n  This budget includes funds to help prevent Western wildfires and \nbetter fight the ones that do occur.\n  It includes vital education funding for Nevada's universities.\n  It invests in Nevada's renewable energy.\n  It provides funds for vital Nevada water projects.\n  And it honors our troops and veterans with more than $340 million for \nthe southern Nevada veteran's hospital.\n  But let me be clear: this compromise budget could have been much, \nmuch better if not for Bush-Cheney Republicans' double standard on \nfiscal responsibility.\n  They chose to enforce an arbitrary topline on America's priorities--\neven as they continue to borrow billions to fund the endless war in \nIraq, to support corporate cronyism, and to look the other way on \nglobal warming and pollution.\n  Because Republicans have made these choices, the American people will \nhave to keep waiting for the kind of budget they deserve.\n  But because Democrats refused to back down, this budget is a step \nforward.\n  The American people deserve to know that Democrats will keep taking \nstep after step after step to set the right priorities and make the \nprogress that our country so desperately needs.\n  Mr. President, as things now stand, we have about 20 minutes of \ntalking on the Republican side and we have Senator Byrd, who has less \nthan 10 minutes on our side. Those are the only speeches I know of.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am going to require 5 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. That is what I was starting to say. On our side, we have \nSenator Byrd plus the manager of the bill, Senator Leahy.\n  Following that, there is going to be a vote on a judge. I don't know \nhow much time Senator Leahy and Senator Specter want on the judge, but \nwhatever time they want, they can have it. But we will have a vote on \nthe judge.\n\n[[Page S15865]]\n\n  Tonight, when these speeches are finished, we will have one final \nvote, a vote on the judge. We are going to be in session tomorrow. \nThere will be no rollcall votes after 9, unless something untoward \nhappens that Senator McConnell and I do not expect. So we will be in \nsession if somebody wants to come in and give some speeches. We have \nsome nominations we are trying to clear, maybe some bills from the \nHouse. I do not expect any heavy lifting tomorrow, at least I hope not.\n  I wish to express my appreciation to everyone for their cooperation \nin getting to the point where we are. As some have heard me say before, \nusually you recognize you have something that is OK when both \nnegotiators are unhappy with what they have gotten. That is what we \nhave. We are not happy with how we have been pushed into doing what we \nhave done. The President is not happy, as his people say he has been \npushed into doing things he didn't want to do. We are where we are. We \nare going to be able to finish our appropriations process, and we \nshould all hold our heads high in that regard.\n  Again, I wish everyone a very merry Christmas, a happy New Year, and \nlook forward to a productive year next year, the last of the 110th \nCongress.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, it has been a challenging year for the \nSenate Appropriations Committee. When the 110th Congress convened in \nJanuary 2007, only two of the annual appropriations bills had been \nenacted. Working with the chairman of the House Appropriations \nCommittee, Mr. David Obey, Senator Cochran, and Representative Lewis, \nwe immediately began work on a joint funding resolution to fund the \nFederal Government.\n  We focused on funding a short list of priorities, such as adding $3.6 \nbillion for VA medical care; $1.6 billion for State and local law \nenforcement; $620 million for the National Institutes of Health; and \n$1.4 billion to fight AIDS and malaria in the developing world. That \njoint funding resolution was passed by the House and the Senate and \nsigned into law by the President on February 15, 2007.\n  Almost immediately, the committee was called back into action to \ntackle a bill to make emergency appropriations for the wars in Iraq and \nAfghanistan. The committee produced a prudent and responsible bill that \nrequired a new course for the war in Iraq. The bill set a goal for \nhaving most of our troops out of Iraq by January 1, 2008. Had the \nPresident signed that bill, most of our troops would already be home \npreparing to celebrate the new year.\n  Unfortunately, the President found that the bill did not support his \n``stay the course'' policies and vetoed that bill on May 1, 2007. The \nAppropriations Committee produced another bill, totaling $120 billion, \nunfortunately this time stripped of the important guidance on the \nfuture of the war. That bill was again passed by the House and Senate, \nand this time the President signed it into law on May 25, 2007.\n  The committee then began its annual work of producing the regular \nappropriations bills. I am proud to say that the committee reported 12 \nindividual appropriations bills, many of which were reported by \nunanimous, bipartisan votes. The bills that were considered on the \nfloor of the Senate received broad, bipartisan support, and each \nreceived the affirmative vote of more than 75 Senators. And finally, \nthe, committee--working on a bipartisan, bicameral basis--produced the \ncomplex legislation, which is now before the Senate.\n  My reason for detailing the work of the Appropriations Committee this \nyear is simple: I wish to convey my personal appreciation for all of \nthe work and cooperation of the committee's ranking member, Senator \nCochran, who has time and again used his skill and experience to bring \ncredit upon himself, the committee, and the Senate as a whole.\n  I also wish to commend the chairmen and ranking members of each of \nthe 12 subcommittees. It is through their knowledge and leadership that \nthe committee is able to craft the individual appropriations bills. It \nis to their great credit that the committee was able to rise to the \nmany challenges presented this year.\n  I wish to express my gratitude to the staff of the Appropriations \nCommittee. They are dedicated public servants: professional, expert, \nand diligent. The committee is extremely fortunate to have their \nservices, and I thank them for all the many hours they have devoted to \nperforming their duties.\n  And finally, I send to my colleague, Senator Cochran, each member of \nthe Appropriations Committee, and all of the staff, my warmest wishes \nfor a safe and joyous Christmas in the spirit of the old-Time \nChristmases and a very happy New Year.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I do not know where the time is. I do \nnot to want to interfere. I want 2 minutes before they are finished. \nThank you.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, what is the parliamentary situation on \ntime?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 50 minutes remaining on the majority \nside and 1 hour on the minority side.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I see the Senator from Georgia rising. Do \nyou wish to speak?\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Yes, I do have a statement I want to make, followed by \nSenator Isakson.\n  Mr. LEAHY. If the Senator is willing to wait for a few minutes?\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Surely.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I commend the distinguished Senator from \nWest Virginia. In a few weeks, I will have served with him for 33 \nyears. Now, in Robert C. Byrd time, 33 years is but a moment. In \nPatrick J. Leahy's time, it is a wee bit of time. But I remember coming \nhere as a 34-year-old Senator--Senator Byrd was the majority whip at \nthe time--and how much he taught me, and his colleague, the leader, \nMike Mansfield, and then later when he was our leader, and, of course, \nsat on Appropriations. He has been my leader for all of those years. I \nappreciate his help.\n  His late wife Erma was a very special friend of my wife's and mine, \nand I hope he does not mind me mentioning her at this time. I always \nthought when she and my wife Marcelle would meet at the grocery store \nthat perhaps Bob and I were at a lower level. It went to a higher level \nwhen it was not Senator Byrd and Senator Leahy. But it was Marcelle and \nErma talking about Bob and Patrick, and what should we do to take care \nof those folks. Well, Robert C. Byrd has taken care of all of us these \nyears. It has been a privilege to serve on the Appropriations Committee \nwith him. It is especially nice, because one of the closest friends I \nhave in the Senate, Thad Cochran, has been both chairman and ranking \nmember of that committee, and those of us who have been here for over a \nthird of a century, as I have, know the majority and minority goes back \nand forth.\n  The thing that does not go back and forth is the friendships we have \nacross the aisles. The distinguished Presiding Officer knows that his \nfather and I were very close friends and served together. His mother \nand my wife were close friends. Those kinds of friendships go on \nthrough the years and through the decades.\n  We have spoken of the Senate as being a family. Indeed it is. It is \nprobably a family that wants to go home and go to bed, so I will not \npush this much longer. But I think how important it is that we do have \nthese chances to be together. So I applaud Senator Byrd, I applaud \nSenator Cochran, and their staffs.\n  Because this is the Foreign Operations Bill we are on, I want to \nmention my own staff: Tim Rieser, Kate Eltrich, Nikole Manatt, who \nhandle the Appropriations subcommittee for me, and the various other \nmatters they are involved in here; J.P. Dowd, my legislative director; \nEd Pagano, my chief of staff; Bruce Cohen, who is always listed as one \nof the 50 most important people here in the Senate--I get listed as an \nasterisk--because of what he does to make sure the Judiciary matters \nare kept here; Jessica Berry and so many others who keep this thing \ngoing.\n  I said to Senator Reid, our distinguished leader, we Senators are but \nmere constitutional impediments to our staffs. We know they are the \nones who run it. Roscoe Jones of my staff was here, probably never \nheard me say that. He is trying desperately to keep a straight face, \nbut it is a fact.\n  We have included within this money for DNA funding $4.8 million for \nthe Kirk Bloodsworth post-conviction DNA testing grants, and $147 \nmillion for the Debbie Smith DNA backlog grants.\n  I am privileged to know both Kirk Bloodsworth and Debbie Smith.\n\n[[Page S15866]]\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to note that we included \nfunding in the appropriations package for landmark programs created by \nthe Justice For All Act of 2004. Specifically, we provide $2.5 million \nfor Capital Litigation Improvement Grants to improve the quality of \nlegal representation in State capital cases, and over $152 million to \nimprove Federal and State DNA collection and analysis systems critical \nto the prosecution of the guilty and the protection of the innocent \nfrom wrongful prosecution.\n  The Justice For All Act capped more than 4 years of effort by a \nbipartisan House and Senate coalition that included both supporters and \nopponents of the death penalty. It is the most significant step we have \ntaken in many years to improve the quality of justice in this country \nand restore public confidence in the integrity of the American justice \nsystem.\n  That law increased Federal resources for combating crimes with DNA \ntechnology, established safeguards to prevent wrongful convictions and \nexecutions, and enhanced protections for victims of Federal crimes.\n  It authorized the Debbie Smith grant program to address the DNA \nbacklog crisis in the Nation's crime labs, and created new grant \nprograms to reduce other forensic science backlogs, train criminal \njustice and medical personnel in the use of DNA evidence, and promote \nthe use of DNA technology to identify missing persons. It also \nestablished enhanced and enforceable rights for crime victims in the \nFederal criminal justice system.\n  The law also included legislation I authored called the Innocence \nProtection Act. That measure provides access to postconviction DNA \ntesting in Federal cases, helps States improve the quality of legal \nrepresentation in capital cases, and increases compensation in Federal \ncases of wrongful conviction. It established the Kirk Bloodsworth \nPostConviction DNA Testing Program to help States defray the costs of \npostconviction DNA testing.\n  Getting the Justice For All Act fully-funded has proven to be tough, \nespecially given the fiscal crunch that all criminal justice programs \nhave faced in recent years. However, as a senior member of the \nAppropriations Subcommittee that sets the Justice Department budget, I \nhave worked closely with CJS Chairwoman Mikulski and Ranking Member \nShelby to include in the omnibus package roughly $155 million to \nadvance the comprehensive and far-reaching reforms in the criminal \njustice system established under the Justice For All Act. I thank my \ncolleagues for their leadership in this area.\n  State and local authorities will be better able to implement and \nenforce crime victims' rights laws, including Federal victim and \nwitness assistance programs. They can apply for grants to develop and \nimplement victim notification systems so that they can share \ninformation on criminal proceedings in a timely and efficient manner.\n  The intent of the Justice For All Act was to create a fairer and more \naccurate system of justice for all Americans. The spending priorities \nset forth in the Justice Department portion of the fiscal year 2008 \nOmnibus appropriations package will help protect crime victims, \nmaximize the use of forensic DNA evidence testing, and provide \nsafeguards to prevent wrongful convictions and executions.\n  I note that this bill is the product of more than 9 months of work by \nthe Senate and House Appropriations Committees. It meets the \nPresident's arbitrary budget ceiling, but because of the arbitrary \nceiling, we have had to cut a number of things. Senator Gregg, \nCongresswoman Lowey, Congressman Wolf, and I worked on that to agree to \nthe numbers so that the foreign ops part is not a Democratic bill or a \nRepublican bill, it is a bipartisan bill that attempts to address a \nmyriad of foreign policy, national security, and domestic needs of this \ncountry.\n  Other subcommittees worked just as hard and in a similar bipartisan \nmanner. None of us are completely happy with the outcome. We had to \nmake exceedingly difficult cuts to get to the President's number. But \nthat is the nature of this process.\n  It is ironic that a President who said he would veto this bill unless \nit was within his self-proclaimed budget ceiling because he wants to \nkeep a lid on spending, is asking Congress for another $70 billion in \nemergency funding to continue the war in Iraq.\n  Those dollars do not score against the budget, so the White House can \nespouse the fiction that the President is being fiscally responsible at \nthe same time that he piles on the debt for future generations.\n  Of course, he never threatened to veto any of the appropriations \nconference reports during the past 6 years.\n  It is a political ploy after inheriting a balanced budget and \ntripling the national debt, but it is going to be hard felt by the \nAmerican people. Cuts in funding for education, health care, public \ninfrastructure, homeland security, environmental protection, \ntransportation--no part of the federal budget was exempted except \ndefense.\n  The State and Foreign Operations portion of the bill is $2 billion \nbelow the President's budget. A full $1.3 billion of that cut was the \nresult of the President's veto threat.\n  It means fewer children will receive vaccinations in the poorest \ncountries, less money for international peacekeeping, less for HIV/AIDS \nprevention, care and treatment, less for non-proliferation and anti-\nterrorism programs, less for disaster relief, less for education, \nenvironment, energy and agriculture programs.\n  But, if the President gets his way, there will be tens of billions of \ndollars more to keep our troops bogged down in Iraq, while the Iraqi \nSunnis and Shiites continue to fight among themselves.\n  Despite that, this omnibus bill is a far, far better outcome than \ncontinued spending at the fiscal year 2007 levels, and the dire \nconsequences that would bring.\n  The State and Foreign Operations portion totals $35.1 billion in \ndiscretionary budget authority including $2.4 billion in emergency \nspending.\n  Without emergency spending, the bill totals $32.8 billion, which is \n$2 billion below the President's regular fiscal year 2008 request and \n$1.52 billion above the fiscal year 2007 level.\n  Here are some of the highlights:\n  We provide $6.5 billion for global health programs, including $345 \nmillion to combat malaria, $150 million for tuberculosis, and $5 \nbillion for HIV/AIDS.\n  We provide $546 million for the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, \nTuberculosis and Malaria. Added to funds in the Labor, Health and Human \nServices bill, this omnibus bill provides a total of $841 million for \nthe Global Fund, an increase of $115 million above last year's level.\n  It includes $446 million for child and maternal health, which is \nalmost $100 million above last year's level.\n  We provide $1.69 billion for United Nations peacekeeping, $550 of \nwhich will support the desperately needed UN-African Union force in \nDarfur.\n  The bill provides $1 billion to assist the world's refugees, and $100 \nmillion to help Jordan cope with the hundreds of thousands of Iraqi \nrefugees that have flooded that country, which is already home to tens \nof thousands of Palestinians.\n  The bill provides the requested funds for Israel, Egypt, Pakistan, \nAfghanistan, the West Bank, Lebanon, and other needy countries.\n  It provides $1.54 billion for the Millennium Challenge Corporation, \nwhich is $344 million above the Senate-passed level.\n  It provides $501 million for Educational and Cultural Exchange \nPrograms, an increase of $55 million above the fiscal year 2007 level.\n  The bill does not include the so-called Mexico City language \nconcerning international family planning which would have led to a \nPresidential veto. It is regrettable that the President would rather \nscore political points than support private organizations that would \nuse our funds for voluntary family planning services.\n  The bill provides $968 million for embassy security, which is $190 \nmillion above the fiscal year 2007 level.\n  There are several other important provisions in the State and Foreign \nOperations portion of this omnibus bill.\n  One would make long overdue reforms to current law by allowing \nthousands of persecuted refugees, barred because they were members of \narmed groups that were allied with the U.S., or who were forced to \noffer food, shelter or other services to terrorist groups, to seek \nasylum here.\n\n[[Page S15867]]\n\n  This change was worked out by myself and Senator Kyl, and would \nprovide relief to such Vietnam-era allies as the Hmong tribesman of \nLaos and the Montagnards of Vietnam, and for child soldiers and others \nwho were forced against their will to provide support to terrorist \ngroups.\n  These people were there for us when we needed them, and we should not \nturn our backs when they need the safety of our shores. It is an \naffront to our values and to our reputation as a safe haven for victims \nof persecution.\n  The changes we are making will also provide relief for Iraqi \nrefugees, some of whom have been barred for paying ransom to secure the \nrelease of a family member who was kidnapped by insurgents.\n  This change will not raise the number of refugees admitted to the \nUnited States, but it will bring our laws back in line with our values.\n  This bill contains other provisions, some proposed by Democrats, some \nby Republicans, which make important improvements in our foreign \nassistance programs.\n  We provide $300 million for safe drinking water and sanitation \nprograms, consistent with the Senator Paul Simon Water for the Poor \nAct.\n  There are funds set aside for reconciliation and people-to-people \ncoexistence programs in the Middle East, as well as in other countries \ndivided by ethnic, religious, or political conflict.\n  There are new provisions which address the problem of corruption and \ngovernance in countries that receive U.S. assistance.\n  There are new provisions to improve monitoring of U.S. military aid \nto countries that have human rights problems, and to address the \nproblem of child soldiers.\n  Mr. President, these are only a few of the items supported by both \nDemocrats and Republicans in this omnibus bill, and they are only \nwithin the State and Foreign Operations portion.\n  There are thousands of other important domestic programs funded by \neach of the other subcommittees whose bills make up this omnibus \nappropriations bill.\n  Lastly, I wish the American public realized how much Senators on both \nsides of the aisle work together. I wish the American public realized \nthe number of friendships there are on both sides of the aisle, both \namong the Senators and their families. Are we going to pass a perfect \nbill here? No. Am I opposed to the blank check for Iraq? Yes.\n  We have been in Iraq longer than we were engaged in World War II. It \nis time to let our brave men and women come home to their families. I \nbelieve that from the bottom of my soul. The opposition I have to this \nbill is because of that.\n  I know how proud I was when my youngest son, LCpl Mark Patrick Leahy \nof the Marine Corps, was one to answer the call in Desert Storm, as \nmuch as I feared for his safety, and how pleased I was that war ended \nso quickly, that he was not in harm's way.\n  I also worry that that is not something parents can say when they see \nparents and wives and husbands, children and brothers and sisters when \nthey see their family members in a war that has lasted longer than \nWorld War II. It is time to say: Come home, America. Come home, \nAmerica, and face the problems in our country. Let the Iraqis now face \ntheir problems. Let them stand at the plate. Let us address the fact \nthat we have so many unanswered problems in health and science, in \naddressing our myriad diseases, education, infrastructure, and \neverything else in this country.\n  One thing I must say is that is in this bill, Senator Stevens and I \nchanged the so-called WHTI provision in the omnibus. It shows some \nrealities across the border into Canada and vice versa. There are those \nof us who think of Canada as that great country to the North. There are \nsome of us who have family ties in Canada, some of us who feel that \nCanada is not a threat to the United States and we should not treat it \nas such.\n  Mr. President, one important issue I wish to highlight today is an \ninternational border issue with our friendly neighbors in Canada, \nMexico, and the Caribbean that could have severe implications for the \nsocial and economic ways of life for communities all across our \ncountry.\n  In the wake of the September 11 terrorist attacks, Congress has \nenacted a number of new border security measures, all with the \nexpressed goal of preventing another terrorist incident. In this bill, \nwe have worked hard to provide the needed resources for these programs \nin a fair and balanced manner. Post 9/11, everyone recognizes that \nthere are potential threats and security needs, but we must implement \nthem sensibly and intelligently.\n  Over the past few years, I have heard from many Vermonters about \nproblems they have encountered at U.S. border crossings, from long \ntraffic backups to invasive searches and questioning to inadequate \ncommunication from Federal authorities about new facilities and \nprocedures. Such a top-down approach does not work well in interwoven \ncommunities along the border, where people cross daily from one side to \nthe other for jobs, shopping, and cultural events. We have hardened \nsecurity around this Capitol and the White House and built fences near \nSan Diego. But those procedures do not work on Canusa Avenue in Beebe \nPlain, a two-lane road where one side of the street is Vermont and the \nother side is Quebec, or at the Haskell Free Library and Opera House, \nwhich straddles the international border in Derby Line, Vermont, and \nStanstead, Quebec.\n  That is why I am pleased that this bill includes a much-needed delay \nfor full implementation of the so-called Western Hemisphere Travel \nInitiative, which will require individuals from the United States, \nCanada, Mexico, and the Caribbean to present passports or other \ndocuments proving citizenship before entering the United States. I was \npleased to join with Senator Stevens and many other colleagues from \nboth bodies in pushing for inclusion of this important provision \nbecause it is clear that the Department of Homeland Security and the \nDepartment of State are not ready for a full rollout of the new \npassport checks next summer.\n  Muddled thinking, poor planning, and administrative hubris have \nplagued implementation of the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative. The \nDepartment of Homeland Security has rushed to implement the new \npassport checks before the necessary technology, infrastructure and \ntraining are in place at our border stations. If these critical \nfeatures of the deployment are not in place when the new program \nstarts, we will see severe delays at our border and law-abiding \ncitizens from the United States, Canada, Mexico, and the Caribbean will \nhave great difficulty moving between our countries. Most importantly, a \nhasty implementation will undermine the intended goals of the program.\n  The massive backlogs in processing passport applications we saw \nearlier this year when the Departments of Homeland Security and State \nstarted to require passports for air travel is just a taste of the \nchaos that is likely when they start enforcing citizenship checks at \nour Nation's land and sea borders in January. There is another train \nwreck on the horizon if these Federal agencies continue pushing forward \nwith full implementation of the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative \nbefore the necessary policies and procedures are in place to handle the \nsurge in applications and the lengthy border crossing delays that are \nsure to come.\n  I appreciate the recognition by this Congress that premature \nimplementation will recklessly risk the travel plans of millions of \nAmericans and the economies of scores of U.S. States and communities. \nThe Departments of Homeland Security and State have shown that they \nneed more time to establish a set of rules and procedures that will do \nmore than just shut our borders down to legitimate travel and trade.\n  Mr. President, there is one item that was in the Senate passed \nversion of H.R. 2764, the State and Foreign Operations Appropriations \nbill, that the conferees agreed to address in the explanatory statement \naccompanying the amended bill that is Division J of the omnibus bill, \nrelating to Uganda.\n  That language directs the Secretary of State to submit a report \nwithin 90 days detailing a strategy for substantially enhancing United \nStates efforts to resolve the conflict between the Lord's Resistance \nArmy and the Government of Uganda. The language specifies certain \nissues to be addressed in the strategy. It also indicates that\n\n[[Page S15868]]\n\n$5 million is provided to implement the strategy.\n  Due to an oversight, the $5 million was omitted from the funding \ntable in the explanatory statement under the Economic Support Fund \nheading. However, it is the intent of the conferees that this amount in \nunallocated Economic Support Fund assistance be made available for this \npurpose.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I see the Senator from Georgia is \nabout to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I know many of my colleagues have \nbecome involved in issues in their States stemming from a shortage of \nwater over the years. Sometimes these issues are intrastate, sometimes \nthey are interstate. Regardless of the size or scope, they always get \nvery complicated quickly.\n  The water wars between Georgia, Florida, and Alabama that have been \ngoing on for decades are no different in that regard. They too get very \ncomplicated very quickly. There are decades of negotiations, \nagreements, lawsuits and settlements, and the Governors of the three \nStates are still attempting in good faith to come to a resolution. In \nfact, those three Governors met in Tallahassee, FL, yesterday, along \nwith Secretary Kempthorne, to create a roadmap forward on this very \ncomplicated issue.\n  There is language included in this Omnibus appropriations bill that \ndoes not resolve the very complex problems that the three States \ncontinue to deal with, the allocation of water among them. Rather, the \nlanguage in this bill seeks to, one, insert Congress into the middle of \nan ongoing dispute and attempts to pick winners and losers in that \ndispute; two, it attempts to limit the ability of the Corps of \nEngineers to provide complete and accurate technical data to make \nrecommendations to the States involved in the dispute; and, three, \nprohibits the Corps of Engineers from completing the process of \nupdating water control manuals, which they have begun to do on one \nbasin, and which they are required to do by statute and their own \nregulations.\n  I object strongly to the language regarding this issue included in \nthis bill. The Army Corps of Engineers operates a number of different \nreservoirs across river systems around the country. Normally they \nconduct their operations under a water control plan, which is a plan \nthat identifies the objectives for managing the system; basically, the \nrelease and retention of water for different needs, such as navigation, \nwater supply, hydropower production, recreation, as well as other \nneeds.\n  The water control plan is the manual by which the Corps of Engineers \nmanages the river systems, and they do so within the confines of water \nallocations set for each State.\n  Now water can be allocated among States in one of three ways: \ninterstate water compacts, direct congressional appointments, or \nequitable apportionment by the Supreme Court of the United States.\n  Obviously, interstate water compacts are the preferred method for \nallocating water, because they allow the States, which are the most \nknowledgeable about their own water resources and needs for water, to \ndo the apportioning. That is what the Governors of Georgia, Alabama, \nand Florida are currently trying to do.\n  The State of Georgia shares the Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint \nRiver Basin with Alabama and Florida. Georgia also shares the Alabama-\nCoosa-Tallapoosa River Basin with Alabama. After 17 years of \nlitigation, the Governors of these three States are finally at the \nnegotiating table finding a way forward on this very difficult issue.\n  I commend them for doing so during these exacerbating drought \nconditions we are now experiencing. It is always harder to discuss \nsharing water when there is less of it to go around. So during this \ntime of progress, it is mind boggling to see this language in the \nomnibus bill intended to block that progress. It is a blatant dilatory \ntactic. I am disappointed it is included in this bill. I am \ndisappointed for several reasons.\n  First, this is not an issue into which Congress should be inserting \nitself. The Corps of Engineers is required by Federal statute and their \nown regulations to operate the reservoirs with up-to-date water control \nmanuals. However, for the ACF basin, the only approved water manual was \nprepared in 1958 and does not even include the Federal facilities at \nWest Point, Walter F. George, or George W. Andrews.\n  The process of updating the manuals has been on hold for almost 20 \nyears as litigation between the States has been ongoing. However, last \nyear, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ordered that \nthe Corps of Engineers proceed with its NEPA studies, which is the \nnecessary first step in updating the water control manuals. The court \nordered it be done as expeditiously as possible.\n  Apart from the fact that Congress should not be inserting itself in \nthis issue, apart from the fact that everyone knows updated water \ncontrol manuals are required by law, have been ordered by a Federal \ncourt and are beneficial to all parties, I am also disappointed to see \nthis language because of the process by which it got into this bill.\n  This language was not in the House-passed version of the Energy and \nWater appropriations bill. And, in fact, the only instance in which the \nHouse has considered this issue was last year during the debate on the \nfiscal year 2007 Energy and Water appropriations bill. Similar language \nwas removed from that legislation by a House vote of 216 to 201. So \nthis language was not in the House-passed bill.\n  The full Senate did not even debate the fiscal year 2008 Energy and \nWater appropriations bill. Only the Senate Energy and Water \nAppropriations Subcommittee approved this language. It has now been \nincluded in this omnibus bill. That simply is not right.\n  Finally, let me say that I noted with interest the fact that last \nweek, seven States in the western part of the United States signed a \nhistoric water-sharing agreement.\n  I congratulate those from Utah, Arizona, California, Colorado, \nNevada, New Mexico, and Wyoming who worked on this issue and were able \nto complete what I am sure was a very difficult process. It gives those \nof us in the Southeast hope for that light at the end of the tunnel, \nhope that we, too, can reach agreement one day. I ask my colleagues to \nconsider for a moment that if during the midst of progress on that \nhistoric water agreement a Member of the Senate attempted to use the \nappropriations process to prevent the Corps of Engineers from \nimplementing the most up-to-date information in the management of the \nwater that crosses those States. I hope those colleagues would consider \nthe negative impact that would have on the process in which their \nStates were engaged.\n  I read very carefully the language my colleague from Alabama inserted \ninto this omnibus bill. I can only take solace in the fact that at \nleast the language allows the Corps of Engineers to continue the \nprocess of updating the water control manuals, even though it seems to \nprevent them from actually implementing those manuals, whatever \nrecommendations come out of those manuals. We all know updating water \ncontrol manuals is a 2-year process. You can rest assured that we will \nrevisit this issue and rest assured when the time comes, I will do \neverything in my power to make sure these critical updated manuals are \nactually implemented. I think at the end of the day my colleague from \nAlabama will discover that updated water control manuals will benefit \nall parties involved in the difficult negotiations of water allocation \namong the three States.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I associate myself entirely with the \nremarks of the distinguished Senator from Georgia. Secondly, I express \nmy appreciation to Senator Reid for his attempt when this was \ndiscovered to allow us a chance to debate the merits of the proposal in \ndivision C of section 134 of the Omnibus appropriations act. \nUnfortunately, that could not be done. Senator Chambliss and I are left \nwith expressing our deep disappointment on the floor of the Senate \ntonight.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record the complete article \nof a December 18, 2007, front-page article from the Marietta Daily \nJournal entitled ``Drought Talks to Speed Up.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S15869]]\n\n                   [From the Marietta Daily Journal, \n                             Dec. 18, 2007]\n\n                       Drought Talks To Speed Up\n\n                            (By David Royse)\n\n       Tallahassee, Fla.--The governors of three drought-stricken \n     Southeastern states agreed Monday to speed up talks on \n     sharing water during scarcities, hoping to end a nearly 18-\n     year fight over the issue by March.\n       The governors of Florida, Alabama and Georgia and federal \n     officials also agreed not to reduce for now the minimum \n     amount of water that will flow into the Apalachicola River, \n     which feeds a major oyster breeding ground in the Florida \n     Panhandle. That eases the minds of some fishermen and Florida \n     officials--they had feared the flow could be further reduced \n     to meet drinking water needs in Atlanta. Florida's Charlie \n     Crist, Georgia's Sonny Purdue and Alabama's Bob Riley said \n     they agreed that their staffs will continue to work together \n     to come up with a plan for dolling out the region's water by \n     March 15.\n       That was hopeful news to fishermen along the Panhandle Gulf \n     Coast, who were looking at the prospect of water flows \n     remaining lower than they say they can tolerate until June 1, \n     when an interim agreement on flow levels originally had been \n     set to expire. Now, there's a possibility of agreeing on \n     raising the amount of water coming into Florida earlier.\n       ``We're cautiously optimistic,'' said Kevin Begos, the \n     director of the Franklin County Oyster & Seafood Task Force.\n       U.S. Secretary of the Interior Dirk Kempthorne, who also \n     participated, said he was pleased the governors have agreed \n     to try to end the states' nearly two decades of disagreement \n     on the issue as early as this spring.\n       ``This was real. It was meaningful,'' Kempthorne said. \n     ``The atmosphere today reinvigorates me that we can get this \n     done.''\n       One of the worst droughts in years in the Southeast has \n     created a sense of urgency, all three governors acknowledged.\n       ``We're talking about solving something we've been working \n     on for 18 years within the next two months,'' Riley said.\n       The fast-growing Atlanta area gets most of its water from \n     Lake Lanier, at the head of the river basin shared by the \n     states. But drawing more water from the lake means less for \n     downstream uses in Alabama and Florida.\n       Alabama is concerned about water for the Joseph M. Farley \n     Nuclear Plant, near Dothan.\n       Florida is concerned about freshwater flowing into \n     Apalachicola Bay, a prime shellfish producing area, that \n     produces about 1 in 10 of the oysters eaten in the country.\n       The amount of freshwater flowing through the Apalachicola-\n     Chathoochee-Flint river system into the Gulf at the mouth of \n     the Apalachicola River has been reduced to near historic \n     lows, threatening the fishing industry there.\n       The flow increased in recent days because of a downpour \n     over the weekend, but it had been reduced to a level that \n     fishermen had said wouldn't sustain their industry. Making \n     them more nervous, U.S. Corps of Engineers officials had said \n     they might reduce the flow further. And it wasn't likely to \n     be renegotiated until June 1.\n       At a Cobb County-Marietta Water Authority meeting on \n     Monday, authority General Manager Glenn Page said that for \n     the first time since May, the level of Lake Allatoona \n     increased.\n       At full pool, Lake Allatoona is 840 feet above sea level. \n     Page said the lake on Monday was at 819.15 feet, about 5.5 \n     feet below average for this time of year. On Friday, the lake \n     level was 818.88 feet.\n       But fishermen have said that to keep the low amount of \n     water going into the bay through the spring spawning season \n     would devastate the industry.\n       Crist said he understands the needs of the bay's fishermen \n     and oystermen, who complained in a recent meeting that the \n     river mouth and bay are already so salty that oysters can't \n     survive. Speeding up the timeline could mean earlier relief.\n       ``Florida's oyster industry faces an uncertain spring, due \n     to the current drought,'' Crist said. ``Spawning season is \n     critical to our northwest Florida economy.''\n       Crist also hinted that Georgia might need to increase its \n     conservation--noting Florida has made moves to cut use since \n     the drought began.\n       ``We all share the difficulties of the current drought--all \n     three of our states must provide for comprehensive water \n     conservation efforts,'' Crist said.\n       None of the governors, however, would talk specifics about \n     where their chief remaining obstacles lie.\n       Water flows into the bay are also a concern for \n     environmentalists, who worry about the effect of less water \n     on other species besides oysters.\n       The endangered Gulf sturgeon, and two species of mussel, \n     the fat threeridge and the threatened purple bankclimber, are \n     also imperiled by lower flows.\n       In early December, authorities said there was less than \n     four months of available water left in Lake Lanier. Perdue \n     said recent reductions in flow that Florida opposed have \n     aided in raising the lake's level.\n       ``The flow reductions have helped, the ability to recover \n     some of the rainfall and store that has helped,'' Perdue \n     said. ``But we've got to have a protocol that determines how \n     we're going to share in times of scarcity, and that's what \n     we're all trying to figure out.''\n       Just last week, Florida water managers approved \n     restrictions on water use in the southern part of the state. \n     Starting early next year, outside watering will only be \n     allowed once a week from Orlando south to the Keys.\n       The meeting also follows a major agreement signed last week \n     that will allow seven western states to conserve and share \n     Colorado River water, ending a divisive battle among those \n     states.\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. I would like to read one sentence from that article: \nGovernors Charlie Crist of Florida, Sonny Perdue of Georgia, and \nAlabama's Bob Riley said ``that their staffs will continue to work \ntogether to come up with a plan for doling out the region's water by \nMarch 15.''\n  That common goal stated by those three Governors today in Florida \nputs us within less than 90 days' reach of what has been out of the \ngrasp of the States of Georgia, Alabama, and Florida for 18 years, \nsince 1989. At the last minute, because of a broken process for an \nOmnibus appropriations bill to contain legislation that directs, \npotentially limits, or sets the parameters by which the Corps of \nEngineers might be able to implement control of the waterways is just \nnot right. It is my sincere hope at some time in the future those who \nmight have thought this was a good idea will recognize it is actually \ncontrary to what we in the Senate from the three States have attempted \nto do when we had a summit in Washington less than 2 months ago with \nour three Governors and the Secretary of the Interior.\n  There is no more precious gift than water, no better and more \nprecious resource than water. There also is nothing better in the \nlegislative process than a spirit of cooperation between each of us who \nshares borders in our States so as to find the right way to solve \nproblems, not have dilatory tactics to postpone or delay problems.\n  I conclude by expressing my deep disappointment that the Omnibus \nappropriations bill contains division C, section 134, which has those \npotentially limiting factors and urge my colleagues to look to the \nfuture to find solutions, rather than a way to protract and delay and \nfind confusion.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I wanted to say to the two Senators who \nhave just spoken, this Senator from New Mexico is ranking member of \nthat committee. I am not chairman any longer of the committee they have \nalluded to. I can assure them that it was not overt action on this \nSenator's part that put that provision in the bill. I think you know \nthat. We would be talking; I am pretty accessible. You two have already \nbeen telling me. I am hopeful that my presence on that committee will \nbe of help to you in resolving whatever problems might be caused by its \nbeing there. Having said that, I want to make a comment. If it takes me \nan extra minute, I ask for an extra minute at this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I come to the floor as I embark upon my last year as a \nSenator after 35 years. Tonight, today, this week, this month reminds \nme of something. It reminds me that it is time for the Senate to have a \nserious debate on whether we should be doing appropriations every year \nand doing a budget resolution every year or whether it is time for the \nSenate to do that on a 2-year basis, as many States do, and as we \ncertainly could do, taking the first year for appropriations and \nbudgeting and the second year of the bi-cycle with no appropriations \nother than emergency supplementals or whatever we define. I believe it \nwill work. I believe it will work because it is better than what we \nhave. I also believe things are so bad in terms of not being able to \nget our work done and ending up with appropriations like this.\n  As good as they are, as hard as people work, everybody knows it is \nnot the way to do business. We have done it. Democrats have done it. I \nlay blame on no party. I merely say the Senate can't sleepwalk through \nthis for much longer. This is a huge problem with a simple solution. \nThe solution will be a little one that will address a huge problem. \nPlain and simple, the legislation is drawn, committees have had \nhearings, a 2-year cycle for the processes of budgeting and \nappropriations. I hope those who have come up to me in the\n\n[[Page S15870]]\n\nlast week will follow through. I hope the chairman of the Committee on \nthe Budget, who has indicated he is going to look carefully and study \nthoroughly, will do that quickly.\n  I would like to join with those early on next year in seeing what we \ncan do to better a process that has served us well but, clearly, at \nthis point in history, considering the size of government, how often \ngovernment must produce budgets, how wasteful that is, all the other \nthings that go with it, I would hope we might make some giant move in \nthe right direction.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am advised that there are between both \nsides nearly an hour and a half left to debate. My colleagues have been \nasking when we might vote on this and on the judge who is also to be \nvoted on. If my friends on the other side are willing to yield back all \ntheir time, I am willing to yield back all time on this side and go to \na vote on this measure. I am not trying to cut off anybody from their \nlong speeches. But if they are willing to do that, we could save an \nhour and a half, yield back time on both sides, and then yield back \neverything but 1 minute per side on the judicial nomination and go \nstraight to a vote on that. Do I hear any takers?\n  I ask unanimous consent that all time be yielded back on both the \nRepublican and Democratic side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DeMINT. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. LEAHY. You want to stay here for the next hour and a half and \nvote and the next hour or so for the judge and vote.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Will the Senator yield? I think there are a few of us who \nwould like to make comments on the omnibus, but I don't think we are \ngoing to use all of our time.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I recommend that the Senators, for those who wish to go \nhome, may want to make speeches after the vote. If they would like to \nmake them before, of course. If they would like to make them before, \nthey have that absolute right, and we would not yield back any time.\n  Mr. DeMINT. That is my preference, to make some comments.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Then I will not yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, hopefully, we can cut the time short. We \ninsist on some comments about this bill because it is probably the \nlargest bill that has ever passed in the Senate. It is sitting in front \nof me tonight. It amazes me we are willing to take this lightly. This \nis the bill we are getting ready to vote on, probably the biggest \nspending bill that has ever passed in the Senate. It was received \nyesterday. Normally it is a courtesy in the Senate that the bills we \nare debating are placed on every Senator's desk so that we can at least \nhave the pretense that we have looked at them. But you will notice that \nthis bill is not on any desk in the Chamber because there is not one \nsingle Senator here tonight who can say they have read this bill.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DeMINT. No, sir, I am going to make my statement. I know we are \nall tired and ready to go home. I do appreciate the work of my \ncolleagues. I wish them all a very Merry Christmas and a wonderful time \nwith their families. But this is the last bill of the year. It is not \njust any bill. We began the year, all of us, very hopeful. Oftentimes a \nchange is helpful as we rethink how we do things. In fact, I began this \nyear introducing one of Speaker Pelosi's bills that provided more \ntransparency to earmarks that I thought was better than ours. I \nintroduced it on the Senate side. But, unfortunately, as we have gone \nthrough the year, we haven't been able to get our work done.\n  We like to say we are the world's greatest deliberative body. I have \nto ask my colleagues tonight, on the largest bill we have ever \nconsidered, the most expensive bill we have ever considered, what \ndeliberation?\n  We don't even know what is in this bill. We haven't had any real \ndebate. We are going to try to cut it off in an hour or so. This is a \ncouple of times bigger than the Bible. It is bigger than Webster's \nDictionary. It has some of the most important provisions to direct our \ncountry over the next year that we could possibly consider. We don't \neven have a desk copy.\n  I would like to make a few things clear about this bill. This does \nnot include the Iraq and Afghanistan money. We voted on that \nseparately. It is done. It is going to go back to the House. A vote \nagainst this bill is not a vote against our troops, but it is a vote \nagainst how this has been done and the mismanagement that has occurred. \nTo bring this much spending and this many provisions, 3,400 pages plus \nin 24 hours, and ask us to vote on it is irresponsible.\n  There should be no confusion tonight. We are not going to vote on the \nIraq funding, which we passed. I am here to encourage my colleagues to \nconsider for many reasons voting against this omnibus spending bill. I \nam afraid it is indicative of the way we have run this year, as we look \nat this big bill sitting in front of us.\n  I am afraid the new majority has attempted to cater to so many \nspecial interests with so many diverse interests that we have really \nbecome dysfunctional and have not been able to get our work done. They \ncannot really support the funding of the troops or they will irritate \nthe antiwar left. They cannot vote for fiscal responsibility or they \nwill irritate the special interest lobbyists who need a lot of the \nspecial projects and earmarks in this bill.\n  So instead, we have come up with this arcane procedural process. This \nis not really a bill; it is some form of message. And we are going to \npass it separately so that we can have it both ways and no one can be \nblamed for the mismanagement. But there should be no mistake. Nancy \nPelosi is the Speaker of the House, and Harry Reid is the Senate \nmajority leader. The Democrats are in charge of Congress. This is their \nprocess. It is their bill. And I am afraid, my colleagues, it is a \ndisgrace.\n  This is the bill. As I have said, it might be the largest bill in the \nNation's history. It is the most expensive bill in America's history--\n3,400 pages-plus; 24 hours to consider its contents. It took over 6 \nhours just to print this out. There is one copy in the cloakroom on \nboth sides. We have not even read it. It contains over 9,000 earmarks. \nIf we can see this chart over this large stack of legislation: 9,100 \nearmarks, plus the 2,100 that have already been passed.\n  If you remember, a lot of the culture of corruption we talked about \nat the beginning of this year was attributed to the earmarks--trading \nearmarks for bribes and earmarks for campaign contributions. The new \nmajority promised the American people, with my support, that we would \nreduce the number of earmarks significantly.\n  One of the last acts of the Republican majority was to stop the big \nomnibus last year and to force a continuing resolution where the result \nwas only 2,600 earmarks.\n  Those who say this large number of earmarks has always been a part of \nthe Senate do not know our history. All you have to do is go back to \n1995: 1,400 earmarks. If you go back past then, there were fewer than \nthat.\n  This is not a constitutional function. It has not been part of the \nhistory of the Senate. This growth in earmarks is a perversion of the \npurpose of this Congress, where we have changed our focus from national \ninterests, the future of this country, to parochial, special interests \nthat we work on every year and hardly even talk about those issues that \nchallenge our Nation--such as a Tax Code that is sending jobs overseas; \nentitlement programs, where we do not have a clue how we are going to \npay for them; health care, when people cannot receive it in our \ncountry. We are fighting over bike paths and museums and little special \nprojects all year long.\n  This year, with the new majority, we are back up to the second \nhighest level in history of the number of earmarks, special project \nearmarks, that we are supporting in this bill right here, and we do not \neven know everything that is in it as yet. It contains at least $20 \nbillion in budget gimmicks and so-called emergency spending. I could go \ndown the list. It would put a lot of people to sleep. There are a \nnumber of ridiculous provisions that we are just finding.\n\n[[Page S15871]]\n\n  The serious debate over immigration came down to at least one \nstarting solution: that we are going to secure our borders. We voted \nthe money to build fence and barriers on our borders. But this bill \nchanges what we have already passed. It allows for only a single-layer \nfence and takes out the requirement for the location of the fence in \nStates, that the money cannot be released until 15 new requirements \nauthored by the Appropriations Committee are satisfied. It is just \ndesigned to delay what the American people made clear to us earlier in \nthe year. They want us to have a country with secure borders. This bill \nchanges that. It also provides $10 million to pay for lawyers for \nillegal aliens.\n  The English requirement. The Senate passed language earlier in the \nyear to ensure that employers are not subjected to Government-funded \nlawsuits if they require English in the workplace. This bill takes that \nprotection away from employers and exposes them to lawsuits because \nthey need English spoken in the workplace.\n  Sanctuary cities. The prohibition against sanctuary cities was taken \nout.\n  There are special earmarks for the AFL-CIO, a number of others.\n  We could go down the list. Again, we are just starting to find out \nwhat is in the bill. I know very few Senators here tonight know what is \nreally in it.\n  The organizations that are watching this Congress to try to identify \nwaste are going to be key voting this tonight. I think my colleagues \nknow they consider that a very serious issue. The Citizens Against \nGovernment Waste are saying vote no. The Club for Growth says vote no. \nThe American Conservative Union says vote no. The Americans for \nProsperity: No. Americans for Tax Reform: No. National Taxpayers Union. \nWe can continue to go down the list. All the organizations that \ndownloaded this off the Web last night and began looking through it \nwithin an hour or two found things that made it unacceptable.\n  It is an unacceptable bill, and it should not be part of the world's \ngreatest deliberative body tonight. But I think we agreed--I think the \nAmerican people asked the new majority to end business as usual. I hope \nwe can do that tonight. I hope we can give the American taxpayers a \nreal Christmas present and stop wasting their money, stop breaking the \npromises. While we are making all the new promises in here, we are not \nmaking provisions to keep the promises we make.\n  I know most of my colleagues believe this is not the way we should be \nrunning the Senate and that they would like for there to be a better \nway. We do not have to vote against the troops to vote against this \nbill. I would encourage my Democratic colleagues, many of them who have \nstood with us this year on earmark reform, that is one reason alone to \nvote against this bill: the policy changes, the moving more money to \nPlanned Parenthood, the compromising of our border security. The list \nis getting longer and longer, and we are not even a quarter of the way \ndown the bill yet.\n  I encourage my colleagues to join the American people and help us \nstop wasteful spending. This is the last bill of the year. It is the \nlast vote. It is going to say a lot about this Congress and what we \nhave accomplished. This is our chance to at least say: No more business \nas usual. We are not going to do business this way, where we pile \n3,400-plus pages on a desk, in 24 hours, and ask the Senators of this \ncountry to vote for it without even knowing what is in it. It is not \nthe way to run a Senate. It is not the way to run a country.\n  I plead with my colleagues, let's leave this year on a positive note. \nVote against this omnibus and give Americans a real Christmas present.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, for 46 hours and 8 minutes--for 46 hours \nand 8 minutes--the Senator from South Carolina has had an opportunity \nto go to the Internet and see this bill in its entirety, with his \nstaff, and to read every page--46 hours and 8 minutes. For this Senator \nto suggest on the floor that we are sneaking this bill in, that people \nhave not had a chance to see it, I would just say to the Senator from \nSouth Carolina: Welcome to the world of the Internet. This bill has \nbeen posted since 12:15 a.m. Monday morning on the Internet for your \nperusal. That is early to get up, I understand. It is an early time to \nbe reading the bill. But, please, do not come to the floor and suggest \nthat this is a mystery bill which no one has seen. For 2 days, this has \nbeen posted on the Internet. You have had your chance. Every Senator \nhas had a chance. And incidentally, this bill was passed pursuant to a \nbudget resolution.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Has the Senator read the bill? Have you read the bill?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Regular order, Mr. President. The Senator from South \nCarolina would not yield for my questions, and ordinarily I do, but I \nam going to make this quick because it is late at night.\n  I say to the Senator from South Carolina: Welcome to the Senate where \nwe pass a budget resolution. We did that this year. It is new to the \nSenate. We did not do that last year. Welcome to the Senate where we \nare going to pass appropriations bills. It did not happen last year. \nThe Senator may recall when he arrived that the Republican-controlled \nSenate failed to pass 11 appropriations bills, and we had to pass them \nwhen we arrived in the new Senate.\n  So for him to suggest that what we are doing here does not give the \nAmerican people a chance to see what has happened--this has been the \nmost transparent approach to passing these bills. In fact, I might say \nto the Senator--he has probably followed this--the Senate \nAppropriations Committee has considered all of the bills that are \ncontained therein. There have been changes, for sure, but those that \ncame to the floor--about 7 of them--passed with over 75 votes apiece. \nSo to suggest that this is a mystery document is to ignore the \nInternet, ignore the availability, and ignore the obvious. The last \ntime, the Republican majority passed two appropriations bills. \nCongratulations. We want to pass them all. And this is your chance. You \ncan vote no. That is your right as a Senator.\n  Let me say a word about earmarks. About 4 inches of the document in \nfront of you consists of complete disclosure on earmarks--the most \ndetailed disclosure in the history of Congress. And your chart, \nunfortunately, tells the story from the wrong angle. The total dollar \namount of the earmarks contained in those appropriations equals 43 \npercent of the earmarks contained in the Republican appropriations \nbills of 2 years ago. A 43-percent reduction in the dollar value of \nearmarks, total transparency, total disclosure--I thought that is what \nyou were asking for when you stood up during the ethics debate.\n  Let me also say that the Senator is opposing the removal of \nauthorization language from appropriations bills. That is a point under \nour rules that is debated all the time. It happens. It happened in my \nbill, in my appropriations bill. And most of the time it happens \nbecause the White House tells us they do not want the language.\n  The last point I want to make to you is that to suggest that this \nbill is wasteful spending comes at just the right moment--just the \nright moment--after the Senator from South Carolina voted for $70 \nbillion on a war that is not paid for. And the Senator joined in \nopposing our efforts to pay for a reduction in taxes. Wasteful \nspending? What the Senator did in those two votes is to pass billions \nof dollars in debt on to future generations.\n  I would urge the Senator, discover the Internet, discover the \nopportunity to read these bills. And when you do, you will see that \nthis information has been available now for 46 hours and 13 minutes.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, in this discussion of earmarks, of course, \nthe elephant in the room--and I do not necessarily mean that as a pun--\nare the hundreds of billions of dollars of earmarks from the President \nof the United States: the blank check to the war in Iraq; the blank \ncheck to the people who are hired as contractors, various companies--\nHalliburton is one that comes to mind, but many others, Blackwater and \nso on. These blank checks--nobody wants to talk about those.\n  But every President--not just this President but every President--has\n\n[[Page S15872]]\n\nhundreds of billions of dollars in earmarks in the bill. This President \nhas had trillions of dollars. That is why this President, who inherited \nthe largest surplus in the Nation's history, has turned it into the \nlargest deficit in the Nation's history. And it is why? Because with \nthe combination of his deficits and his war in Iraq, he is just paying \nthe interest on the Bush administration's debt and the war--just the \ninterest and the cost of the war.\n  Every day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year--366 in leap year--we spend \n$1 billion every single day--every single day--in interest and the war \nin Iraq. That is money that does not go to education, does not go to \nfinding a cure for cancer or Alzheimer's or diabetes or AIDS. It is $1 \nbillion a day that does not go to educate our children and our \ngrandchildren. It is $1 billion a day that does not go to find a way to \nmake sure our schools can start competing again with schools around the \nworld. It is $1 billion a day that does not go to paying down the \nnational debt.\n  So those are the earmarks we do not talk about.\n  Mr. President, I yield to the senior Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished \nSenator from Vermont. I will be very brief. I will vote for this bill. \nThere are good things in the bill and there are bad things. One bad \nthing, as the Senator from Vermont was listing off a number of things \nthat have not been adequately funded, is the fact that the widows and \norphans of the people who have served our Nation in uniform are not \nbeing compensated a paltry $1,200 a month due to an offset between what \nthey paid--what their spouse paid for in the spouses's benefit, and \nwhat, under the dependents indemnity compensation, they are entitled to \nby law.\n  This bill, to its credit, tries to address that offset but addresses \nit with a paltry $50 per month for those widows and orphans. It was \nPresident Lincoln who said a Nation has an obligation for those who \nwent to war to care for the widows and orphans. Widows and orphans are \na cost of war, and we have denied that cost and we still do so again \ntonight. We have only been working on this for 7 straight years, and at \nleast we got a paltry $50. But there is much more that needs to be done \nto right this wrong.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I see the Senator from Iowa, who obviously \nhas the right to speak. Let me ask again how much time remains on both \nsides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority controls 30 minutes and the \nminority controls 32 minutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I hope we can quickly reach a point where \nSenators on both sides are willing to finish speaking. Obviously, I am \nnot going to ask to cut off anybody's time. As soon as there is no \nSenator seeking recognition, I will move again to yield back all time \non this vote and all time on the judge's vote, so we can go to both \nthose votes back to back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I do need to rise to speak in strong \nopposition to what folks in Wyoming have figured out is an ominous \nomnibus appropriations bill, and they think there are literally \nbillions of reasons to vote against this bill, and that is what I \nintend to do when I vote on it.\n  We are nearly a quarter of the way through fiscal year 2008 and only \none of the 12 appropriations bills is law. The remaining 11 bills are \nstuck together in this bill. There is one-half trillion dollars of \nspending in the 3,000-page bill. Now, when I was going to school, we \nspent a lot of time figuring out what a million was, and I think I kind \nof figured that out after I got here. But we talk mostly about \nbillions, and that is a little tougher to do. But I did run into one \nexample that explains a billion a little bit, and that is if we are \ntalking about a billion seconds ago, we are talking about 1959. If we \nare talking about a billion minutes ago, Christ was walking the Earth. \nIf we were talking about a billion dollars of spending ago, we are \ntalking about 8 hours and 20 minutes, the way we are spending it right \nnow.\n  There was some comment about not having access to the bill. Well, the \nWeb site had the bill the way the House was to address it 2 days ago. I \nsuspect you can get through the 3,400 pages if you stayed up the whole \n48 hours and read it, but we didn't know what that bill was going to be \nafter their action until less than 12 hours ago--perhaps a few more \nthan that, considering the time of night it is now. But this is a real \nunreal state of affairs and it has become the norm.\n  It has been pointed out that this isn't the only year we have done an \nomnibus bill, but this is exhibit No. 1 on what is wrong with \ngovernment in this country, and I don't want to condone it. Every year \nthis happens, every year we drive an omnibus, we get closer to \nfinancial ruin when we do that. What have we been spending our time on \nthis year? Political votes, not policy votes. And the American taxpayer \nis paying the price here in the eleventh hour to the tune of billions \nof dollars.\n  In the 2006 mid-term elections, the American people called on us to \nstop business as usual. They called on us to stop overspending. They \ncalled on us to change. That is the message we gave them, that we were \ngoing to change. But instead of change, we have seen Washington run in \na more partisan manner than ever before. This bill contains 3,400 \npages, and I can't imagine that many of my colleagues have read it, \neven those who knew it was on the Web site 48 hours ago.\n  In the crazy world that is Washington, the bill complies with the \nspending level set forth by President Bush, but it does so in a way \nthat uses budget gimmicks and hides billions of dollars in extra \nspending. As the only accountant in the Senate, I can tell you the \nFederal Government's budgeting is criminal. If a private company forgot \nto count $11 billion against their budget, the CEO would go to jail.\n  I support some of the funding in this bill. I support full funding \nfor our veterans. I support providing money for border security. Almost \nall of these provisions are worthy areas for Federal funding. But we \ncannot spend money on everything we want and call ourselves fiscally \nresponsible. If the money is needed for these programs, maybe we should \ncut out the more than 9,000 earmarks that were in the bill to pay for \nthem. At some point, someone will have to pay for our overspending, and \nI would ask: Where do my colleagues think that money comes from? This \nmoney is coming from mothers working at the mall or fathers who are \nbuilding buildings or farmers plowing their fields. They do not work so \nhard so they can serve up a dish of pork to people thousands of miles \naway without their consent. But that is what the architects of this \nbill are doing.\n  My concerns with this bill are more than just fiscal. We do have a \nprocess around here for considering legislation. I am talking about \nlegislation versus appropriation. This bill ignores that process and \nthe Senate rules that expressly prohibit legislating on appropriations \nbills. By making it an omnibus bill, it makes things that are important \nseem insignificant when compared to the one-half trillion dollars we \nare spending. So it seems petty if anybody suggests taking out some \nminor item of a few million, or even a few billion, considering the \nsize of the bill.\n  But I am talking about the legislation part. It ignores the process \nand the Senate rules that expressly prohibit legislating on \nappropriations bills. Again, because it is an omnibus bill, we don't \nhave the same right to challenge parts that would be legislating. We do \nhold hearings in committee. We work within the committee to develop and \npass legislation. Then we consider the bill on the Senate floor. We do \nthis so that important issues get the input and attention the American \npeople expect and deserve. It might take longer to go through these \nsteps, but the product is better; not perfect, but certainly better \nthan the product that is before us today.\n  The amount of legislating in the Omnibus appropriations bill, \nparticularly the Labor-HHS title, is criminal and outrageous. HIV/AIDS \nfunding is a perfect example. A year ago, we passed a bill with a \nformula in it that made sure that money for HIV/AIDS followed the \npatients. How well did that do? It passed unanimously in the Senate and \nit passed unanimously in the House. You can't be more bipartisan than \nthat. You can't be more agreeable than that. We said the formula was \nright and that the money should follow the\n\n[[Page S15873]]\n\npatients. Well, there is legislation in this bill that changes that \nformula, and it never received a hearing before a congressional \ncommittee, it has never been marked up, and it was inserted in the \nHouse bill without a full debate or even a vote.\n  We struck that part over here. We struck that part by a very \nsignificant vote because it was mostly 7 cities stealing from 42 other \ncities. That is not the way to legislate. So striking that part did \noccur in the Senate by a significant vote. So much for transparency and \nsunshine in Washington.\n  The Labor-HHS section of the bill is not the only section that \nincludes problematic legislation. The bill includes provisions that \nallow a 2-percent deduction of State mineral royalty payments to help \ncover administrative costs at the Department of Interior. Let's see, \nwhat does the Department of Interior do? They get a check from Wyoming \ncompanies, collected by the State of Wyoming, audited by the State of \nWyoming, and they take half of it and send us a check back for the \nother half. That check is going to cost us $20 million.\n  Whoever heard of paying somebody $20 million to write you a check? \nWell, maybe there is some accounting they have to do to figure out \nwhether the money sent was exactly right. You know, accountants are not \nallowed to take a percentage of the money. That is what lawyers do. \nAccountants are supposed to stay on flat fees, and I guarantee you \nnobody ever got $20 million for a few minutes work. That is another \nexample of the Government taking money that is owed to States to pay \nfor the unrelated Federal priorities because a majority in Congress \ndoesn't control spending.\n  The omnibus contains provisions to prohibit the Department of the \nInterior from issuing final regulations for oil shale development, even \nthough the process for development was laid out through careful \nbipartisan negotiations that came through a committee and that were \nvoted on by the people in the committee, that were voted on here on \nfloor of the Senate, that were voted on the House floor, and that were \ncombined into what we call the Energy Policy Act of 2005. We said: Get \nthat process set up. We didn't say: Do the process. We said: Get the \nprocess set up.\n  Well, there is language in this bill that says: You can't set it up. \nYou can't do what we said in 2005 as a necessity for getting energy \ngoing in this country. Now, there are plenty of possibilities for \nstopping that process through things that are already in place, but, \nno, there is legislation in this bill that says: We don't want energy. \nWe don't want you to even consider energy. We don't even want you to \nset up the regulations for how you might proceed in an orderly way so \nthat we can object to that orderly way if we want to.\n  It also includes the new $4,000 fee for each application for a permit \nto drill oil and gas wells, with no guarantees that the permits will \nmove forward in an expeditious manner so they can produce more domestic \nenergy. If we don't produce more energy, the price, I guarantee you, \nwill go up. You cannot constrain the supply and get the price to go \ndown.\n  It is unfortunate that Congress waited until December 18 to advance \nthese appropriations bills. Without the ``gotcha'' politics part, they \ncould have been completed more than 2 months ago. They could have been \ncompleted in a very bipartisan way. We have to quit playing ``gotcha'' \npolitics. Congress wasted countless weeks writing and debating bills \nthat were never going to be signed. The President has been quite vocal \nabout his objections. People on both sides of the aisle have expressed \nobjections on a lot of the things we have voted on.\n  So here we are today, a week before Christmas, cramming through in 1 \nday a project larger than several Manhattan phone books, and that most \nof my colleagues have not had the time to read and review, and that is \neven if they divided it up among all their staff and had them look at \nall the parts they are familiar with. So I am telling you I am offended \nby the process. I am disappointed in the institution. I vote ``no'' on \nthe bill. I want us to change it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am disappointed with the omnibus \nappropriations bill that is before us today. With the McConnell \namendment, this omnibus bill will write yet another blank check--this \none for a whopping $70 billion--for the President to spend on his wars \nin Iraq and Afghanistan. At the same time, this bill will grossly \nunderfund urgent priorities here at home--everything from cancer \nresearch to law enforcement to home heating assistance.\n  And why is this happening? It is happening because President Bush has \nrefused to compromise, refused to negotiate, refused to respect \nCongress as a coequal partner in the budgeting process.\n  The President claims that he is standing on principle, the principle \nof budget restraint and fiscal conservatism. But this claim is \nlaughable.\n  Think about it: Mr. Bush provoked a bitter confrontation with \nCongress over the $22 billion that we proposed spending on urgent \ndomestic priorities above his budget request. Democrats offered to \nsplit the difference, lowering that amount to $11 billion. But Mr. Bush \nstill refused to negotiate or compromise.\n  Meanwhile, he and his allies have insisted on vastly more than that--\na total of $144 billion--for the war in Iraq this year, all of which \nwill simply be added to the deficit. At the same time, he demands a $50 \nbillion AMT fix--which we all favor--but he insists that we not pay for \nit. That's another $50 billion piled onto the deficit.\n  So the President has forced Congress to cut $22 billion in domestic \nfunding from the budget, and he turns right around and demands that \nCongress add more than 10 times that--more than $200 billion--for wars \nand tax cuts, all of it unpaid for, all of it added to the deficit. And \nthis is what he calls budget restraint and fiscal conservatism? As I \nsaid, that claim is simply laughable.\n  Actually, this is not so much laughable as it is shameful. Bear in \nmind that in October the Senate passed an appropriations bill for \nLabor, Health and Human Services, and Education by an overwhelming 75 \nto 19 margin, including a strong majority of Republican Senators. That \nbipartisan support reflected the fact that the bill funded essential, \nlife-supporting, and life-saving services for millions of people in \nthis country. That bill reflected the values and priorities of the \nAmerican people.\n  But even before we brought the health and education appropriations \nbill to the floor, President Bush threatened to veto it. He dismissed \nthe bill as ``social spending,'' as though it pays for Saturday night \nsocials or something. Then, on November 13, in one fell swoop, Mr. Bush \nvetoed the bill, and insisted, again, that we bend to his budget \ndemands.\n  Let me remind our colleagues what Mr. Bush was demanding. The \nPresident demanded that we cut cancer research and other medical \nresearch at the National Institutes of Health.\n  He demanded that we cut thousands of families from the Low Income \nHome Energy Assistance Program.\n  He demanded that we completely eliminate the safety net that includes \njob training, housing, and emergency food assistance for our most needy \ncitizens, including seniors and people with disabilities.\n  He demanded that we slash funding for Community Health Centers, \npreventing 225 new centers from opening.\n  He demanded that we dramatically cut funding for law enforcement and \nthe COPS program.\n  He demanded that we cut funding for special education and Head Start.\n  I am pleased to say that we did not allow these heartless, misguided \npriorities to prevail entirely. The President has refused to \ncompromise, refused to negotiate--and, no question, this is going to \nhurt millions of Americans, including the most needy among us. \nNonetheless, I am pleased with what we have been able to salvage in \nthis bill.\n  The omnibus bill before us today technically yields to the \nPresident's top-line number of $515.7 billion. But I am pleased to \nreport that it shifts funding in order to address some of the bottom-\nline priorities of the American people and of the Democratic majority \nin Congress.\n  Even within the constraints of this bill, the final Labor-HHS-\nEducation section of the omnibus includes significant increases above \nthe President's budget. For instance, it includes: an\n\n[[Page S15874]]\n\nadditional $607 million for the National Institutes of Health, \nadditional $788 million for LIHEAP, the home-heating assistance program \nfor low-income families.\n  It provides $77 million above the President's budget for community \nHealth Centers, allowing more than 50 new centers to be opened.\n  It provides an additional $955 million for Head Start, Title I, \nspecial education, and teacher quality.\n  It also provides an additional $150 million for the Social Security \nAdministration to help clear out the backlog of disability claims.\n  However, because of the President's veto threat and refusal to \ncompromise, law enforcement remains woefully underfunded, in particular \nsupport for local police departments. Fewer community health centers \nwill be opened and fewer children will be vaccinated. More than 80,000 \nfewer children will be served under Title I.\n  Every dime of additional funding in this bill goes to meet basic, \nessential needs here at home--needs that have been sadly neglected in \nrecent years, even as we have squandered hundreds of billions of \ndollars in Iraq.\n  I voted against the McConnell amendment to provide another $70 \nbillion in funding, mostly for Iraq. The war in Iraq has not reduced \nthe threat of another terrorist attack in America, it has increased \nthat threat. It has not defeated Islamic terrorists, it has brought \nmore recruits to the ranks of al Qaeda.\n  Nor has the so-called ``surge'' in Iraq succeeded as advertised. The \nwhole rationale for the surge was to create breathing space for new \nelections in Iraq and reconciliation between Sunnis and Shiites. These \nthings have not happened.\n  I joined with Senator Feingold to attempt to link any new funding for \nIraq to a deadline for redeployment of our troops. Unfortunately, that \namendment failed. This means that the next $70 billion appropriation \nfor Iraq will not require any redeployments, nor will it include any \nbenchmarks that the Iraqi government must meet. It is simply a blank \ncheck, untied to any demands or expectations, and that is unacceptable.\n  Indeed, I find it ironic that Mr. Bush has been more than happy to \nspend untold billions of dollars on schools, hospitals, job training, \nand law enforcement--in Iraq. But when we try to address those \npriorities here at home, Mr. Bush gets out his veto pen and hoists the \nflag of what he calls ``fiscal conservatism.''\n  But, as I have said, Mr. Bush's pose as a fiscal conservative is \nabsurd.\n  During the six years that the Republicans largely controlled \nCongress, Mr. Bush did not veto a single appropriations bill, including \nmany that exceeded his budget requests.\n  He is demanding that we pass supplemental bills that bring war \nspending, this year alone, to more than $196 billion, mostly for Iraq. \nThe Congressional Budget Office now estimates that Mr. Bush's war in \nIraq will cost a staggering $1.9 trillion through the next decade. Yet, \njust last week, he pledged to veto the omnibus bill because of $11 \nbillion in funding for education, health, biomedical research and other \ndomestic priorities.\n  Think about it: The President is demanding that we continue to spend \n$12 billion a month on his war in Iraq, yet he objected to an \nadditional $11 billion over a full year for domestic funding. This is \nsimply not reasonable or rational.\n  At the same time, the President is insisting that we send him an \nAlternative Minimum Tax fix costing $50 billion. Yes, we need to fix \nthe AMT, and we need to do so in a responsible way. But, Mr. Bush has a \ndifferent idea. He refuses to pay for the AMT fix. He insists that we \nsimply pile it onto the deficit, dumping it on our children and \ngrandchildren.\n  Bear in mind, by the way, that this AMT problem is not a surprise to \nanyone. The 2001 tax cut bill deliberately refused to address the AMT \nissue in order to squeeze in hundreds of millions of dollars in \nadditional tax cuts, overwhelmingly for the well-off. Mr. Bush used the \nAMT to mask the true cost of the tax cuts. But, in doing so, he left \nthe AMT as a ticking time-bomb that would soon double the number of \nAmericans subject to the tax.\n  Today, that time-bomb is exploding, threatening to hurt millions of \nmiddle-class families. The House of Representatives, to its great \ncredit, came up with a responsible way of paying for the AMT fix. The \nHouse proposed to eliminate the so-called ``carried interest'' tax \nbreak for hedge fund managers with multi-million-dollar incomes--a tax \nbreak that allows them to pay their taxes at lower marginal rates than \nmiddle-income Americans.\n  Eliminating this egregious tax break is a matter of basic fairness. \nIt also would help to pay for the AMT fix. But the President said no. \nHe promised to veto it. All of which means that the $50 billion we \nspend on the AMT patch will not be paid for; it will be added to the \ndeficit and the debt. That is not just a shame; it is shameful.\n  So I regret that the President vetoed a good, bipartisan Labor-HHS-\nEducation appropriations bill that passed this body overwhelmingly. I \nregret that Mr. Bush has refused to negotiate or compromise. I regret \nthat he demands that we spend endlessly on his war in Iraq, even as he \ndemands that we slash essential services and programs here at home.\n  But, despite all of these disappointments, we can take pride in the \nfact that this omnibus bill, in important ways, reflects the values and \npriorities of the American people. We have found additional funding for \nour priorities--priorities ranging from cancer research to education to \nlaw enforcement. I urge my colleagues to join me in voting for this \nbill.\n\n\n                       PECUNIARY INTEREST LETTERS\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today I rise to discuss an unintended \noversight by my office in connection with the disclosure of a \ncongressionally directed funding project in the House message to \naccompany H.R. 2764, the Omnibus appropriations bill. When I filed my \noriginal requests for funding for projects in May of this year, I did \nnot realize the letter included a request to fund the Old Dome Meeting \nHall Renovations project in Riverton, UT. Subsequently, with the \nenactment of Public Law 110-81 on September 14, 2007, along with other \nMembers of the Senate, I was asked to sign, and did sign, various \ncertification letters in connection with our requests for project \nfunding.\n  Upon a review of our files last night, with respect to the \nforthcoming House message to accompany H.R. 2764, the Omnibus \nappropriations bill, we determined that the certification letters sent \nto the committee may have been incorrect, as a member of my family may \nbe deemed to have an indirect pecuniary interest in one of the items \nrequested in my letter to the Appropriations Committee dated May 15, \n2007. Upon discovering this oversight, I forwarded a letter to the \nattention of Appropriations Committee chairman, Robert Byrd, and \nranking Republican member, Thad Cochran, which I believe to be in \naccordance with the facts now known to me.\n  I have chosen to address these issues openly on the floor of the \nSenate to clear up any facts regarding this completely unintended and \nunfortunate oversight. I want my colleagues to know that I always have \nand will continue to do everything possible to ensure I meet all ethics \nlaws, rules, and requirements here in the U.S. Senate.\n  For the reasons I have outlined and in an effort to meet the highest \nethical standards, I will be voting present on the Omnibus \nappropriations bill when I otherwise would have supported the \nlegislation.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I appreciate this colloquy and your intent to meet all \nthe new, as well as old, ethics requirements regarding earmarks in \nappropriations bills. This is the first year for implementation of many \nof these new ethics rules and there has been some not unexpected \nconfusion over how some of the new requirements must be implemented. I \napplaud your aggressiveness in making sure that you have done \neverything within your knowledge and power to ensure that you have \ncomplied with all the rules and requirements that are specified by the \nrules of the Senate with regard to the use of earmarks. Our discussion \ntoday provides the type of transparency intended by the ethics rules \nand should satisfy all requirements with regard to letters of pecuniary \ninterest and earmarks as they relate to your situation.\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask unanimous consent that a copy of my letter to \nChairman Byrd and Ranking Republican Member Cochran be printed in the \nRecord.\n\n[[Page S15875]]\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, December 18, 2007\n     Hon. Robert C. Byrd,\n     Chairman, Committee on Appropriations, Senate, Washington, \n         DC.\n     Hon. Thad Cochran,\n     Ranking Republican Member, Committee on Appropriations, \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Byrd and Ranking Member Cochran: I certify \n     that neither I nor my immediate family has a pecuniary \n     interest in any congressionally directed spending that I \n     requested the Committee on Appropriations for Fiscal Year \n     2008, except that a member of my immediate family may have an \n     indirect pecuniary interest in the Old Dome Meeting Hall \n     Renovations; Riverton, Utah; Economic Development Initiative \n     project, requested in my letter dated May 15, 2007 to the \n     Senate Subcommittee on Transportation, Treasury, the \n     Judiciary, Housing and Urban Development, and Related \n     Agencies, Committee on Appropriations.\n       I respectfully ask that my request to fund this project be \n     withdrawn.\n       Once this has been effectuated, my request will be \n     consistent with the requirements of Paragraph 9 of rule XLIV \n     of thc Standing Rules of the Senate.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Orrin G. Hatch,\n                                                     U.S. Senator.\n\n\n       Low-Volume Hospital Medicare Inpatient Payment Adjustment\n\n  Mr HARKIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to support the legislation \npending before the Senate today, which will ensure that Iowa's seniors \ncontinue to have access to their physicians and will reauthorize the \nSCHIP program through March 31, 2009, with additional funds for the \n``shortfall States,'' like Iowa. I am however concerned about one \nprovision that is not included in the legislation, a provision that is \ncritically needed to help Iowa's midsized hospitals.\n  Unfortunately, current Medicare payment rates for hospitals do not \naccount for the fact that most rural facilities cannot achieve the same \neconomies of scale as large hospitals. This leads to inadequate \nreimbursement, which threatens the very existence of some of these \nfacilities. To help address this situation, the Medicare Payment \nAdvisory Committee MedPAC has recommended implementing a payment \nadjustment for certain small rural hospitals that serve a lowvolume of \npatients. For example, Grinnell Regional Medical Center in Grinnell, \nIA, is having difficulty keeping their doors open simply because of its \nsize and location. Due to Medicare policies, they are currently \nreimbursed at 60 percent of its costs. This cannot continue. These \nhospitals are essential to giving our seniors good access to \nhealthcare.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I want to thank my distinguished colleague for raising \nthis issue, which has also been a concern of mine. I agree with him \nthat these rural hospitals--the so-called ``tweener'' hospitals--should \nbe given some assistance. These hospitals play a critical role in the \nmedical care of our seniors throughout Iowa, and I remain committed to \nworking with Senator Baucus to include ``tweener'' hospital \nimprovements in next year's Medicare legislation.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Senator Harkin, I agree with you that this is an issue we \nneed to address. As you know, I intend to work with Senator Grassley to \nmove a Medicare reform package early in 2008. Given the importance of \nthis issue, I am committed to working with you to find solutions that \nwill assist these hospitals within the context of our Medicare efforts.\n  Mr HARKIN. I appreciate that commitment. I look forward to working \nwith both of you early next year to move legislation to assist these \nhospitals, in Iowa and throughout the country.\n\n\n                  ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY LOAN GUARANTEES\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I would like to ask the distinguished \nchairman of the Energy and Water Development Appropriations Committee, \nSenator Dorgan, to clarify for me the scope of the budget authority \ncontained in the fiscal year 2008 Consolidated Appropriations Act for \nthe Department of Energy's guarantee loans for development of advanced \nenergy technologies. My understanding is that there would be $10 \nbillion in budget authority for the Department to guarantee loans in \nthe broad technology areas of renewable, energy efficiency, \nmanufacturing, electricity transmission and distribution technologies.\n  I believe there is tremendous potential for new technologies to \nproduce ethanol from cellulosic materials through all phases of \ndevelopment, including pretreatment. An important step toward proving \nthese technologies will be the development of pilot-scale facilities. \nIs it the chairman's understanding that a range of technologies and \npilot-scale demonstration facilities would be eligible for a loan \nguarantee issued by the Department of Energy using the budget authority \nincluded in this Consolidated Appropriations Act?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Yes, cellulosic ethanol projects are consistent with the \nintent of title XVII of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and would clearly \nbe within the scope of technologies that would be eligible for a loan \nguarantee from the Department of Energy.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I am also very interested in ensuring that advanced \nbatteries and battery systems are fully developed and believe that loan \nguarantees for projects and facilities to develop lithium ion batteries \ncould provide a significant boost for U.S. competitiveness. In the case \nof battery technologies, we need to develop the manufacturing \ncapability in this country to ensure that these batteries will be \nproduced here. Is it the chairman's understanding that advanced battery \ntechnologies would be included in the scope of the budget authority in \nthis bill and would be eligible for a loan guarantee from the \nDepartment of Energy?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Yes, I believe that loan guarantees for development of \nadvanced battery technologies would also fit into the scope of \nmanufacturing technologies contemplated by the language in the \nConsolidated Appropriations Act of 2008 and should be consistent with \nthe intent of title XVII of the Energy Policy Act of 2005.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise today to comment on section 691 of the \nConsolidated Appropriations Act, 2008. This provision amends section \n212(d)(3)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act in order to allow \nthe executive to make REAL ID immigration bars inapplicable to \nindividuals or groups whose presence in this country would not pose a \nthreat to the United States, while continuing to bar from the United \nStates all persons who are tied to the worst terrorist organizations. \nThe provision also gives automatic exemptions to the Hmong and \nMontagnard soldiers who fought alongside the United States during the \nVietnam war, providing overdue relief to the members of these armies. \nAnd section 691 also designates the Taliban as a Tier I terrorist \norganization for immigration purposes, effectively eliminating \nexceptions to the applicability of REAL ID immigration bars for \nmembers, combatants, and others tied to the group that harbored Al \nQaeda at the time when that organization was plotting the terrorist \nattacks of September 11, 2001.\n  Section 691 is the result of a negotiated compromise between Senator \nLeahy and me a compromise that was encouraged and assisted by Senator \nColeman and other Members who have taken an interest in this issue. The \nfinal language allows the Secretaries of Homeland Security and State to \ndecide that the barriers to entry and stay in the United States in \nsection 212(a)(3)(B) of the INA do not apply to certain individuals or \ngroups. The language also clarifies that such non-applicability \ndeterminations are not subject to judicial review.\n  Under current law, the REAL ID immigration bars can only be deemed \nnon-applicable to an alien if the alien is a representative of a \npolitical or social group that endorses terrorism, has himself endorsed \nterrorism, or has given material support to a terrorist group, and may \nonly be extended to a group if that group is a Tier III group that only \nhas a subgroup that engages in terrorism. The amendment expands the \nnon-applicability determination authority to all terrorism-related \nbars, except that the bars cannot be deemed non-applicable if an alien \nis expected to engage in future terrorism, is a member or \nrepresentative of a Tier I or II group, voluntarily and knowingly \nengaged in terrorist activity or endorsed terrorism on behalf of a Tier \nI or II group, or has voluntarily and knowingly received military-type \ntraining from a Tier I or II group. Also, no group nonapplicability \ndetermination may be applied to a group that attacks democratic \ncountries or intentionally engages in a practice of attacking \ncivilians.\n\n[[Page S15876]]\n\n  Section 691's expansion of section 212(d)(3)(B) nonapplicability \nauthority generally draws a line between Tier I and II terrorist \norganizations, on the one hand--groups which have been designated as \nForeign Terrorist Organizations by the State Department or other agency \nof the Federal Government--and Tier III organizations, on the other \nhand, which are swept into the definition of ``terrorist organization'' \nas a result of their conduct. The State Department's FTO list includes \nsome of the most bloodthirsty terrorist organizations on the planet. \nThe list includes groups such as al-Qaida, Hamas, Hezbollah, and the \nSalafist Group for Call and Combat. By precluding non-applicability \ndeterminations with regard to persons tied to these groups, section 691 \nnot only helps to protect the U.S. homeland from terrorism--it also \ncontributes to making these groups radioactive in the foreign countries \nwhere they are based. Joining or helping one of these groups or \naccepting military training from them will bar an individual from ever \nbeing allowed to enter or reside in the United States, in all cases and \nwithout exception. And making these groups radioactive makes it more \ndifficult for them to recruit members or to carry out terrorist \nattacks.\n  Information that has been developed in hearings before the Senate \nJudiciary Committee explains why it is imperative that the United \nStates discourage individuals from providing any type of aid or \nmaterial support to foreign terrorist organizations. In an April 20, \n2005, hearing before the Terrorism Subcommittee, for example, Barry \nSabin, the Chief of the Counterterrorism Section of the Justice \nDepartment's Criminal Division, explained how the provision of material \naid to terrorist groups is critical to the functioning of these \norganizations. Mr. Sabin noted:\n\n       We know from experience that terrorists need funding and \n     logistical support to operate. They need to raise funds, open \n     and use bank accounts to transfer money, and to communicate \n     by phone and the Internet. They need travel documents. They \n     need to train and recruit new operatives, and procure \n     equipment for their attacks.\n\n  It is also important to emphasize that all provision of material \nsupport to terrorist organizations is bad. There is no such thing as \n``good'' aid to a terrorist organization, because all aid is fungible \nand can be converted to evil purposes, and because even humanitarian \naid can be used by a terrorist organization to help it to recruit new \nmembers. These points were developed in detail in answers to written \nquestions provided by Chris Wray, the Assistant Attorney General for \nthe Criminal Division, following a May 5, 2004, hearing before the \nJudiciary Committee. Mr. Wray explained why there is no such thing as \nbenign material support to a designated foreign terrorist organization:\n\n       First, because material support of any kind is fungible and \n     frees up resources that may then be used to promote violence, \n     the provision of any material support facilitates and \n     furthers the organization's unlawful and violent activities \n     regardless of the benign intent of the donor. As the Ninth \n     Circuit recognized in rejecting the argument that 18 U.S.C. \n     section 2339B is unconstitutional because it proscribes the \n     giving of material support even if the donor does not have \n     the specific intent to aid in the organization's unlawful \n     purposes, ``Material support given to a terrorist \n     organization can be used to promote the organization's \n     unlawful activities, regardless of donor intent. Once the \n     support is given, the donor has no control over how it is \n     used. Humanitarian Law Project v. Reno, 205 F. 3d 1130, 1134 \n     (2000).\n       Even support designed and intended to encourage a group to \n     pursue lawful, nonviolent means to achieve its ends may be \n     used to further the organization's violent aims.\n       [S]ome terrorist organizations use their humanitarian \n     activities as an integral part of an overall program that \n     includes murdering innocent civilians and assassinating \n     government officials. For example, one expert on terrorist \n     organizations, Matthew Levitt, describes in ``Hamas from \n     Cradle to Grave,'' Middle East Quarterly, Winter 2004, at 3-\n     15, that this foreign terrorist organization is one unified \n     body, and that its social welfare organizations, supported by \n     numerous charities, answer to the same leaders who set Hamas \n     political and terrorist policy. Levitt describes how Hamas \n     charity committees, mosque classes, student unions, and sport \n     clubs serve as places where Hamas activists recruit \n     Palestinian youth for terrorist training courses in Syria and \n     Iran, or for suicidal terrorist attacks. And, he discusses \n     how a single soccer team from the Jihad mosque in Hebron has \n     produced several Hamas terrorists responsible for five \n     suicide bombings in 2003.\n       Even more frightening, Levitt explains how Hamas charities, \n     social service organizations, hospitals, schools, and mosques \n     openly laud suicide bombings. Hamas-run schools and summer \n     camps begin indoctrinating children as early as kindergarten \n     for later use as suicide bombers. As Levitt notes, \n     Palestinian children raised in this environment make willing \n     terrorist recruits. This program is accomplished in \n     significant part by the multi-faceted nature of Hamas, which \n     gains strength through its humanitarian and charitable \n     activities in the community.\n       Thus, even if individuals are providing material support, \n     such as money, for groups like the Hamas, and are somehow \n     able to ensure that this money is spent by these FTOs only \n     for humanitarian activities, such as a school, the problem \n     remains that this money enables these groups to gain more \n     general support, loyalty, and popularity among the local \n     people and to earn a measure of legitimacy. This support and \n     legitimacy then allows groups such as Hamas to recruit \n     suicide bombers, as well as accomplices to provide critical \n     services such as transportation, lodging, and local \n     intelligence for terrorist operations. Accordingly, even \n     those who are providing material support with the sincere \n     hope and assurance that their money is not being used \n     directly for terrorism are nevertheless providing groups such \n     as Hamas with the type of overall support they need in order \n     to operate successfully as terrorists.\n\n  Section 691 of the Consolidated Appropriations Act also bars the \nextension of a non-applicability determination to any alien who has \nvoluntarily and knowingly received military-type training from a Tier I \nor II terrorist organization. Again in his April 20, 2005, testimony \nbefore the Terrorism Subcommittee, Counterterrorism Section Chief Barry \nSabin explained why individuals who have received such training are \ndangerous to the United States and why an individual's participation in \nsuch training benefits the terrorist organization. Mr. Sabin explained:\n\n       Various investigations have uncovered individuals who have \n     traveled overseas to training camps to receive military-style \n     training. These individuals, who in many cases have received \n     firearms and explosives training, appear to be preparing to \n     conduct terrorist activity or violence and pose a clear \n     threat here and abroad. Investigations have also disclosed \n     that attendees sometimes maintain longstanding relationships \n     with other training camp ``alumni,'' who may later seek to \n     recruit and utilize them in their plots. In an even more \n     basic way, a trainee's participation in a terrorist \n     organization's training camp, without more, benefits the \n     organization as a whole. By attending a camp, an individual \n     lends critical moral support to other trainees and the entire \n     organization, a support that is essential to the health and \n     vitality of the organization.\n\n  Section 691 also clarifies that the decision to extend or to not \nextend a non-applicability determination to a particular group or \nindividual is not subject to judicial review. A decision as to whether \na particular individual or group that would otherwise be within the \nscope of a section 212(a)(3)(B) bar should instead be deemed outside \nthe scope of that bar is a decision that is inherently executive in \nnature. Such a decision will often involve consideration of classified \ninformation that would be compromised if litigated in open court, and \nit will involve sensitive judgments about which terrorist groups are \nmore dangerous than others.\n  Vesting this discretion solely in the executive allows executive \nofficers to consider the full range of information about a particular \ngroup that is available to the State Department, the Justice \nDepartment, Homeland Security, and to intelligence agencies. It allows \nthe executive to decide that some groups are less dangerous and \ntherefore the REAL ID bars may be deemed to not apply to activities \ntied to that group, and that other groups are extremely dangerous and \nthat even tenuous connections to such a group should serve as grounds \nfor exclusion, with no exceptions allowed.\n  Were decisions about nonapplicability to be made in the courts, their \nprecedent-based system of decisionmaking would require the courts to \nextend the same ``rights'' to members of one group as had extended to \nthe last group whose case was reviewed. What is sufficient to justify a \nnonapplicability determination with regard to the FARC in Columbia, for \nexample, would also be good for al-Qaida. By keeping these non-\napplicability decisions out of the courts, section 691's amendments to \nINA section 212(d)(3)(B) allow the Government to take the common-sense \napproach of treating different groups differently based on how violent \nthey are and how much of a threat they pose\n\n[[Page S15877]]\n\nto the United States. For that reason, section 691 does not allow \njudicial relief from an executive determination. Rather, it is the \nexecutive alone that will decide whether a bar should be inapplicable--\nthat it should not even apply to the alien in the first instance.\n  Subsection (b) of section 691 statutorily exempts several groups from \nthe definition of ``terrorist organization'' for purposes of INA \nsection 212(a)(3)(B). These groups--which include Hmong and Montagnard \ngroups that fought alongside the United States in the Vietnam War--have \nalready been cleared by the administration and do not pose a threat to \nthe United States. This subsection will immediately resolve any legal \nambiguity as to these groups' status.\n  Subsection (c) of section 691 corrects a technical error in the \noriginal REAL ID Act. With this change, the otherwise-automatically-\ndeportable spouse or child of a barred alien is not barred if the \nspouse or child did not know of the husband/father's terrorist activity \nor has renounced that activity.\n  Subsection (d) designates the Taliban as a Tier I terrorist \norganization for immigration purposes. As a result of the distinctions \ndrawn in subsection (a) of section 691, this designation will render \nindividuals tied to the Taliban ineligible for most waiver authority.\n  Subsection (e) requires a report by the Department of Homeland \nSecurity on the use of its authority to waive material-support bars on \ngrounds of duress.\n  Subsection (f) makes all of these changes apply retroactively.\n  I think that section 691 reaches a reasonable compromise that allows \nremoval of the applicability of the REAL ID immigration bars for groups \nand individuals to whom those bars should not apply, but allows REAL ID \nto continue to protect the United States and its citizens from foreign \nterrorist organizations. I would like to thank Tim Rieser of Senator \nLeahy's staff, and Jennifer Daskal, on detail to Senator Leahy, for \nworking with my staff to draft this section. Whom to exclude from the \nUnited States for terrorism-related reasons is a difficult and very \nserious matter, and one that I am glad has been the subject of a \ncarefully developed bipartisan compromise in this bill.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, fiscal year 2008 began 79 days ago. And \nyet here we are at the end of the calendar year--with Christmas one \nweek away--and everyone scrambling to finally get our work done and get \nout of town. This process, and the monstrosity it has produced, is the \nheight of irresponsibility. We owe the taxpayer more than this.\n  In the past, I have stood here on the Senate floor to speak about how \nour economic situation and our vital national security concerns require \nus to take greater effort in prioritizing our Federal spending and that \nwe could no longer afford, literally, ``business as usual.'' Actually, \nMr. President, what we have before us is even worse than business as \nusual because the bill we received from the House provides not a single \npenny to fund our ongoing mission in Iraq. We are at war and our men \nand women serving in Iraq today continue to face a fierce and \ndetermined enemy--and this bill does not fund their mission. The \nomission of Iraq funding is no more than a political stunt--and we all \nknow it. What kind of message does this send to those brave men and \nwomen in the field?\n  Unfortunately, little has changed over the years. Here we are again, \nnearly 3 full months into fiscal year 2008, and we have before us \nanother appropriations monster. Let me remind my colleagues that, \nbecause of our inability to get much done around here under the regular \norder, we have been forced to consider huge omnibus appropriations \nbills and one long-term continuing resolution in 5 of the last 6 fiscal \nyears.\n  The bill before us today is more than 1,400 pages long and is \naccompanied by a joint explanatory statement that was so big they \ncouldn't even number the pages. This bill consolidates 11 of the 12 \nannual appropriations bills with a price tag of nearly $475 billion. \nAmazingly, this bill contains 9,170 earmarks. Add those to the 2,161 \nearmarks that were contained in the Defense appropriations bill and the \ngrand total for fiscal year 2008 earmarks stands at 11,331 unnecessary, \nwasteful, run-of-the-mill pork barrel projects. And that is just for \nthe House and Senate-passed bill. I can only imagine what this will \nlook like when it comes out of conference.\n  A New York Times/CBS News poll that was released today shows that the \napproval rating of Congress stands at 21 percent. Can we blame the \nAmerican people for holding us in such low esteem? Let's look at how we \nare spending their hard earned tax dollars.\n  Here is just a sampling of some of the earmarks contained in this \nbill: $150,000 for the STEEED, Soaring Toward Educational Enrichment \nvia Equine Discovery, Youth Program in Washington, DC. Basically this \nis an earmark of $150,000 so that disadvantaged kids can ride horses; \n$50,000 for the construction of a National Mule and Packers Museum in \nBishop, CA; $100,000 for Cooters Pond Park in Prattville, AL; $625,000 \nfor the Historic Congressional Cemetery right here on Capitol Hill; \n$1.95 million for the City College of NY for the Charles B. Rangel \nCenter for Public Service; $975,000 for the Clinton School of Public \nService at the University of Arkansas, Little Rock, AR; $1.628 million \nfor animal vaccines in Greenport, NY; $477,000 for Barley Health Food \nBenefits in Beltsville, MD; $244,000 for Bee Research in Weslaco, TX; \n$10 million to Nevada for the design and construction of the Derby Dam \nfish screen to allow passage of fish; $1.6 million for sensitivity \ntraining for law enforcement in Los Angeles; $1.786 million to develop \nan exhibit for the Thunder Bay National Marine Sanctuary in Michigan; \n$846,000 to the Father's Day Rally Committee in Philadelphia, PA; \n$125,000 for International Mother's Day Shrine in Grafton, WV; $470,000 \nfor an Oyster Hatchery Economic Pilot Program, Morgan State University, \nMD; $446,500 for Horseshoe Crab Research, Virginia Tech, VA; $125,000 \nfor the Polish American Cultural Center in Philadelphia, PA; $400,000 \nfor the National Iron Worker's Training Program; $350,000 for leafy \nspurge control in North Dakota; $1.725 million for the Hudson Valley \nWelcome Center in Hyde Park, NY.\n  This omnibus was made available just yesterday, yet approved by the \nHouse last night. Imagine that--a 1,445 page bill, with a joint \nexplanatory statement that is nine inches tall and costs $475 billion \nwas made available and voted on by both chambers in less than 48 hours. \nSimply remarkable. It is impossible for us to know exactly what is in \nthis thing, and we are expected to simply take the appropriators word \nthat it is all okay. Well, I have been around here long enough to know \nthat a bill of this size, put together behind closed doors and rammed \nthrough at the last minute, cannot be all good. And I know it will be a \nlong time before all of the hidden provisions in this legislation are \nexposed.\n  I fully recognize that it isn't necessarily the fault of the \nappropriators that we are forced into this new pattern of adopting \nomnibus appropriations measures. Overly partisan politics has largely \nprevented us from following the regular legislative order, and that \nfact must change. But while it may not be the appropriators fault that \nwe are forced to consider omnibus appropriations measures, it is their \ndecision to continue to load them up with unauthorized earmarks and at \na rate that seems only increases year after year.\n  When we ram through a gigantic bill, spending hundreds of billions of \ntaxpayer's dollars with little or no debate because we want to go home \nfor Christmas, we send the message to the American people that we are \nnot serious enough about our jobs. We essentially accomplish little \nalmost all year long because everything requires 60 votes, and then, at \nthe very last minute, we scramble around and throw together a mammoth \nbill like the one before us today. We are sending the signal that it is \nmore important for us to be able to issue press releases, and I am sure \nhundreds of them will be going out today, about how much pork we have \nbeen able to get for our States and districts, than we are about good \ngovernment and fiscal responsibility. How can we, in good conscience, \ndefend this behavior to the American people?\n  Among the most egregious aspects of this bill are the so-called \n``economic development initiatives'' funded under the Department of \nHousing and Urban Development. This account is nothing more than a \nslush fund for the appropriators--plain and simple. Contained\n\n[[Page S15878]]\n\nwithin this section of the joint explanatory statement are 741 \nlocality-specific earmarks costing nearly $180 million. These pork \nbarrel projects are spread out over 42 pages and fund everything from \nconstruction of coastal trails, nature education centers, public parks \nand renovations for museums and theaters.\n  On defense matters, the omnibus appropriations bill proposes funding \n$1.18 billion in military construction projects that were not requested \nby the President. Of that amount, $584 million was vetted by both the \nSenate Armed Services and Appropriations Committees to ensure that the \nservices' critical unfunded priorities requirements were met. On the \nSenate floor, those projects were further reviewed, and approved in the \nSenate versions of the authorization and appropriations bills.\n  However, this bloated omnibus appropriations bill also includes \nanother $580 million--for 108 military ``airdropped'' construction \nprojects, that is, funding for projects that were not included in any \nprevious appropriations bill passed by the House or Senate. The House \nappropriators have once again waited until the last minute to present \nthese new spending items to skirt responsibility for their pork \nspending. Mr. President, in the ethics reform law we passed with much \nfanfare earlier this year, we amended Senate rule 44 specifically to \ndiscourage such ``airdropping'' of projects in the dead of night. In an \nunprecedented and unfortunate act, the majority accepted $328 million \nof airdropped military construction authorizations into the recently \npassed national defense authorization bill. It was in part for this \nreason that I reluctantly decided not to sign the defense authorization \nconference report. I could not then, and cannot now, support the \nparachuting of new spending items into final reports that have not been \ntransparently vetted on the floor of Congress. I am very disappointed \nthat we in the Senate continue to condone this irresponsible practice \nin light of our efforts to prevent it with ethics reform.\n  The omnibus appropriations bill also earmarks over $41 million for \nthe planning and design of pork military construction projects \nrequested by Members of Congress. Congress normally authorizes funding \nannually for each military service to plan and design their critical \nfuture military construction priorities. This bill disregards the \nmilitary's priorities and earmarks funds towards specific projects--\nwithout the Department being given the opportunity to determine whether \nor not those projects reflect actual military requirements.\n  Even more egregious is that we are proposing to pay for this \nairdropped pork by cutting over $900 million from the amount of $8.1 \nbillion requested by the President to carry out the critical military \nconstruction activities related to the 2005 defense base closure and \nrealignment round. The Department of Defense and the local communities \naffected by BRAC need enough funding to meet the statutory deadline of \nSeptember 2011. To underfund BRAC in order to pay for earmarks is a sad \nreflection on the priorities of this Congress, which has again \nunabashedly put parochial interests above the needs of the Defense \nDepartment, our local communities and the American taxpayer.\n  We simply must start making some very tough decisions around here if \nwe are serious about improving our fiscal future. We need to be \nthinking about the future of America and the future generations who are \ngoing to be paying the tab for our continued spending. It is simply not \nfiscally responsible for us to continue to load up appropriations bills \nwith wasteful and unnecessary spending, and good deals for special \ninterests and their lobbyists. We have had ample opportunities to \ntighten our belts in this town in recent years, and we have taken a \npass each and every time. We can't put off the inevitable any longer.\n  In a report on our long-term budget outlook issued this month, the \nCongressional Budget Office states this: ``Significant uncertainty \nsurrounds long-term fiscal projections, but under any plausible \nscenario, the federal budget is on an unsustainable path--that is, \nfederal debt will grow much faster than the economy over the long run. \nIn the absence of significant changes in policy, rising costs for \nhealth care and the aging of the U.S. population will cause federal \nspending to grow rapidly.''\n  The report goes on to say that: ``If outlays increased as projected \nand revenues did not grow at a corresponding rate, deficits would climb \nand federal debt would grow significantly. Substantial budget deficits \nwould reduce national saving, which would lead to an increase in \nborrowing from abroad and lower levels of domestic investment that in \nturn would constrain income growth in the United States. In the \nextreme, deficits could seriously harm the economy. Such economic \ndamage could be averted by putting the nation on a sustainable fiscal \ncourse, which would require some combination of less spending and more \nrevenues than the amounts now projected. Making such changes sooner \nrather than later would lessen the risk that an unsustainable fiscal \npath poses to the economy.'' Again--this is not my dire prediction, it \ncomes from our own CBO.\n  To underscore the urgency of the problem, in a speech at The National \nPress Club just yesterday, David Walker, the Comptroller General of the \nUnited States announced that--for the eleventh straight year--the \nFederal Government failed its financial audit. Mr. Walker said that \n``the federal government's total liabilities and unfunded commitments \nfor future benefits payments promised under the current Social Security \nand Medicare programs are now estimated at $53 trillion, in current \ndollar terms, up from about $20 trillion in 2000. This translates into \na defacto mortgage of about $455,000 for every American household and \nthere's no house to back this mortgage. In other words, our government \nhas made a whole lot of promises that, in the long run, it cannot \npossibly keep without huge tax increases.''\n  The Comptroller General also highlighted a specific program that \nserves as an example of the serious problems we face. He said: ``The \nprescription drug benefit alone represents about $8 trillion of \nMedicare's $34 trillion gap. Incredibly, this number was not disclosed \nor discussed until after the Congress had voted on the bill and the \nPresident had signed it into law. Generations of Americans will be \npaying the price--with compound interest--for this new entitlement \nbenefit.'' He went on to note that: ``Unfortunately, once federal \nprograms or agencies are created, the tendency is to fund them in \nperpetuity. Washington rarely seems to question the wisdom of its \nexisting commitments. Instead, it simply adds new programs and \ninitiatives on top of the old ones. This continual layering is a key \nreason our government has grown so large, so expensive, so inefficient, \nand in some cases, so ineffective.''\n  Mr. Walker ended his speech by saying ``If all of us do our part, and \nif we start making tough choices sooner rather than later, we can keep \nAmerica great, ensure that our future is better than the past, and \nensure that our great nation is the first republic to stand the test of \ntime. To me, that is a cause worth fighting for.'' I agree \nwholeheartedly. And I say to my colleagues: Let's start making those \ntough choices today. We have to face the facts, and one fact is that we \ncan't continue to spend taxpayer's dollars on wasteful, unnecessary \npork barrel projects or cater to wealthy corporate special interests \nany longer. The American people won't stand for it, and they shouldn't. \nThey deserve better treatment from us.\n\n\n                  St. John's Bayou/New Madrid Floodway\n\n  Mrs. BOXER, Mr. President, I wish to speak to the intent of section \n123 of title I of division C of the bill, which addresses the Corps of \nEngineers project--Saint Johns Bayou/New Madrid Floodway. As the \nchairman of the Committee on Environment and Public Works with \njurisdiction over the Corps of Engineers, the Clean Water Act and the \nNational Environmental Policy Act,\n  I offer my understanding of section 123. Section 123 does not \ninterfere with or overturn any court decision concerning this project \nwith regard to either or both of the Clean Water Act and the National \nEnvironmental Policy Act. The language provides that the project as \ndescribed in the June 2002 Revised Supplemental Impact Statement, as \nsupplemented by the March 2006 Revised Supplemental Environmental \nImpact Statement 2 is determined to be economically justified.\n\n[[Page S15879]]\n\nThe language does not affect the application of the Clean Water Act and \nNEPA to this project. Because of the specific reference to the project \ndocuments, the language in section 123 does not alter legal \nrequirements regarding cost/benefit analysis for subsequent or revised \nproject documents, including environmental impact statements, or any \nrequirements with regard to NEPA and the Clean Water Act.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, nearly a year ago, when President Bush \nannounced his decision to send 30,000 additional troops to Iraq, he \npredicted that increased U.S. troop levels would stabilize the country \nso that its national leaders could reach political agreement. More \ntroops would enable us to accelerate training initiatives so that the \nIraqi army and police force could assume control of all security in the \ncountry by November 2007. According to this plan, the Iraqi army and \npolice force were to assume control of Iraq's security last month.\n  Well, the information before us in December, like the reports before \nus in September and July, show us that President Bush's troop \nescalation hasn't delivered on the President's promises. It has failed \nto stem the civil war going on in Iraq, failed to allow Iraqi forces to \ntake control over their own security, and failed to lead to political \nreconciliation. That failure was clear when I last came to the floor to \ndiscuss this issue in September, and it is clear today.\n  With troop levels still 24,000 above where they were a year ago, and \nwith no plans to lower them below pre-surge levels, not even President \nBush's claims that substantial progress toward the ultimate goal of the \nescalation--political reconciliation--has occurred. There have been no \nagreements on de-Ba'athification reform, oil revenue sharing, \nprovincial elections, or amnesty laws, nor has the Iraqi government or \nthe Administration offered a clear plan for achieving a sustainable \npolitical reconciliation. Just 2 days ago, LTG Raymond Odierno, the No. \n2 commander of U.S. forces in Iraq, was quoted pleading with the Iraqi \ngovernment to make progress on national reconciliation and improving \nbasic services.\n  Our country's resources remain locked in Iraq. Iran is emboldened. \nInsurgent violence is at its highest level in Afghanistan since U.S.-\nled forces first ousted the Taliban and our military reports signs of \nal Qaeda is returning to Afghanistan from Iraq. Pakistan is facing \npolitical turmoil and Turkey has begun military incursions into Iraq's \nKurdish regions.\n  We have to change our mission in Iraq. The cost of further delay in \nlives, materiel, treasure, and our standing in the world is too great. \nThe United States cannot impose the political reconciliation necessary \nto bring long-lasting security to that nation. It is time to direct our \nresources toward the rest of the region and to needs here at home.\n  A new policy begins by removing our troops from the middle of a civil \nwar and giving them a more realistic mission, one that is in the best \ninterests of Iraq and the United States. Given the facts and the \nrealities independent reports provide us, I continue to support an \namendment, this time sponsored by Senators Feingold and Reid, to change \nour mission in Iraq from providing security and services to a focus on \ntraining, counter-terrorism and force protection.\n  I voted against an amendment to add $40 billion to the omnibus \nspending package without any limits on the President's use of that \nmoney. The military has no immediate need for additional funds for \nIraq. Congress just passed a $456 billion Defense Appropriations bill. \nThe omnibus provides the Army and Marine Corps an additional $20 \nbillion. Given the Department of Defense's ability to shift funds, this \nmoney should pay for the war through March. We will have a chance to \nvote on additional funding next year when we will have more information \nabout trends on the ground in Iraq.\n  Further, while negotiating this year's spending levels this President \nhas vetoed additional health and education funding and refused to \nnegotiate over a modest increase in overall appropriations to fund \ncritical needs here at home, and he continues to insist Congress fund a \nfailed strategy in Iraq. The President's intransigence undermines our \nposition in the world and has left this Congress fewer resources to \ndirect toward priorities here at home. Those are the wrong priorities \nfor our nation.\n  The world has an interest in a safe and secure Iraq. It is time to \ntake steps to protect our troops and our all volunteer force, change \nthe mission, step up our diplomatic efforts, and internationalize the \neffort to bring stability to that country and to the Middle East.\n  We don't need additional funds for Iraq, we need a new direction.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to discuss one provision of the \nfiscal year 2008 Omnibus appropriations bill which is of great \nimportance to the security of our nation, and of particular importance \nto my State of New Jersey. That is Section 534, which will overturn the \nDepartment of Homeland Security's efforts to preempt the rights of \nState and local governments to adopt chemical security protections \nstronger than the standards adopted by the Federal Government.\n  The effort by DHS to prevent States from going beyond the measures \nadopted by DHS to protect their residents from terrorist attacks on \nchemical facilities was never authorized by Congress, and the inclusion \nof my provision overturning the Department's effort represents a strong \nrejection by Congress of the Department's attempt to do so.\n  Opposition to the Department's efforts has been widespread and \nbipartisan, including from the National Governor's Association, the \nNational Conference of State Legislatures and the Chairmen of the 9/11 \nCommission, Representative Lee Hamilton and former New Jersey Governor \nTom Kean. Nevertheless, DHS continues to insist that its partnership \nwith industry rather than a partnership with States--will be sufficient \nto protect the American public. By including this provision in the \nomnibus bill, Congress is making clear that the role of State and local \ngovernments is not to be undermined by the Department of Homeland \nSecurity.\n  The provision included in the omnibus bill amends Section 550 of the \nDepartment of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2007 to clarify \nthat DHS does not have the authority to preempt State or local \ngovernments from adopting chemical security measures stronger than \nthose adopted by DHS. The language in this bill will allow States to go \nbeyond the Federal regulations as long as there is no actual conflict \nwith the Federal regulations. This means that unless it is impossible \nto comply with both State and Federal law, the State law is not \npreempted. Determinations on whether it is impossible to comply with \nboth State law and Federal law are properly decided by the Federal \ncourts, and DHS should not be prejudging or interfering with this \ndetermination.\n  While we all wish it were not so, the threat of terrorists using our \nchemical plants as a mechanism for killing hundreds or thousands of \ncitizens is not far-fetched. It was reported as far back as December \n2001 that chemical trade publications had been found in a hideout in \nAfghanistan used by Osama bin Laden. Numerous Government agencies and \nindependent bodies have identified the Nation's chemical facilities as \nan attractive target for terrorists. And New Jersey has good reason to \nbe concerned about a terrorist attack on a facility storing large \namounts of dangerous chemicals. The FBI has called the stretch between \nPort Newark and Liberty International Airport ``the most dangerous two \nmiles in America.'' According to a 2005 CRS report, 7 of the 111 sites \nidentified by EPA that could put more than 1 million people at risk in \nthe event of an attack or serious accident are in New Jersey. According \nto the same report, up to 7 facilities in New Jersey put up to 1 \nmillion people at risk, and up to 20 more facilities pose a risk to up \nto 100,000 people.\n  I want to thank the leadership of the Appropriations Committee and my \ncolleagues in the Senate and the House for their support for including \nthis critically important national security provision in the Omnibus \nappropriations bill.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, like many of my colleagues, I worked very \nhard to assure that, given the veto threats of President Bush, the \nOmnibus appropriations bill was as strong as it could be. In that \nregard, we have made some real progress. Unfortunately,\n\n[[Page S15880]]\n\nhowever, this bill contains $40 billion for Iraq operations, with no \nstrings attached the money to be used as the President wishes, with no \naccountability for when our involvement in Iraq will end. With \nexpenditures of $12 billion a month, it is now estimated that the total \ncost of our Iraq involvement will end up being more than $1 trillion.\n  I cannot support providing more money for continuing our ill-\nconceived and tragic presence in Iraq, money provided with no \nrequirement for plans as to when the redeployment will begin, when it \nwill be concluded, and what our future course in Iraq will be. \nConsequently, I will vote against the Omnibus appropriations bill.\n  My vote against this bill also reflects genuine concern regarding \nlast-minute additions of loan guarantees for questionable energy \nsources, which move us in exactly the wrong direction. More \nspecifically, the report language accompanying the Omnibus \nappropriations bill provides $18.5 billion in loan guarantees for \nnuclear powerplants, $2.0 billion in loan guarantees for uranium \nenrichment, $6.0 billion in loan guarantees for coal, which I have \nreason to believe includes coal to liquids, and $2.0 billion in loan \nguarantees for coal gasification, which I also fear could be used for \ncoal to liquids. It is, quite frankly, beyond belief that we would be \npassing legislation to support these questionable energy sources. In my \nview, we should be doing everything we can to transform our energy \nsystem so as to move away from unsafe and polluting sources to energy \nefficiency and sustainable and renewable technologies. Congress can, \nand must, do better.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, now December 18 and we are all anxious to \nget home. Additionally tomorrow is my 48th wedding anniversary. That's \nwhy I want to get home. Standing in our way is final disposition of the \n2008 appropriation bills. The leadership has brought before us an \nomnibus bill that combines the remaining 11 regular appropriation bills \nnot yet signed by the President. That in and of itself is a failure. \nInstead of working to pass the annual appropriations bills and ensure \nthe continued operation of our Government, congressional Democrats have \nspent the majority of the 110th Congress playing political games with \ncritical funding for our troops, attempting to pass surrender \nresolutions, and pushing a path to amnesty for the millions of illegal \nimmigrants in our Nation. Two months past the end of the fiscal year, \nCongress only managed to pass one of the annual appropriations bills, \ninstead choosing to roll billions of dollars in funding into an Omnibus \nappropriations bill hours before Congress is supposed to recess for the \nyear. In fact, this year we observed the latest date in 20 years that \nCongress failed to send a single annual appropriations bill to the \nPresident's desk. This Democrat-controlled Congress should be labeled \nas nothing but irresponsible. Additionally, I am here to point out that \nthis bill violates rule XVI of the Standing Rules of the Senate because \nit is legislating on an appropriations bill.\n  Title I of Division C, which appropriates money for the Civil Works \nprogram of the Army Corps of Engineers, the following projects have \neither not yet be authorized or the amounts appropriated for them under \nthis bill exceed the authorized levels:\n  Louisiana Coastal Protection and Restoration study; coastal \nMississippi hurricane and storm damage reduction study; rural health \ncare facility on the Fort Berthold Reservation of the three affiliated \ntribes; North Dakota environmental infrastructure project.\n  During consideration of H.R. 1492, the Water Resources Development \nAct, Public Law 110-114, I elaborated for my colleagues in great detail \nthe history and function of the authorization process and stated that I \nwould oppose any appropriation bill that attempted to fund projects \neither not previously authorized, or above their authorized level. As I \nmade clear in my statements on September 24 prior to passage of the \nconference report and again on November 8, prior to the Senate's veto \noverride vote, the authorization process is the foremost mechanism we \nhave to control spending. We are violating it in this bill.\n  In addition to these increases in spending, the omnibus includes \nnumerous provisions authorizing or modifying other projects and \npolicies of the Corps in nonspending ways. These legislative \nprovisions, too, should be decided within the authorization process, \nnot in an omnibus appropriations bill.\n  Just over a month ago, we authorized $23 billion in projects for the \nCorps of Engineers, and Chairwoman Boxer and I have already begun \ndiscussions on a new authorization bill for 2008. So, I have to ask why \nare we violating not only the Standing Rules of the Senate, but \ncreating an opportunity for criticism on our ability to control \nspending. It makes no sense, it is not necessary and I believe goes to \nthe heart of why the public has such a low opinion of Congress. They \ndon't trust us. Why should they, we cannot seem to follow our own \nrules.\n  Before I close, I would like to point out one more area of \nunnecessary and irresponsible legislating in this omnibus appropriation \nbill. There are several provisions to address climate change scattered \nthroughout the bill. These provisions include creation of new \nrequirements and a new mitigation incentives fund for the Economic \nDevelopment Administration, in title I of Division B; a sense of \nCongress with a call for a mandatory program to reduce greenhouse gas \nemissions, in Division F; and the creation of a mandatory greenhouse \ngas registry, in title II of Division F, which appropriates money for \nthe Environmental Protection Agency. We are in the middle of a regular \norder process for the consideration of climate change legislation. To \ninclude these provisions now, at the last minute on an omnibus, is a \ntotal affront to that process.\n  The proposed registry language is a completely standardless grant to \nthe EPA, possibly an unlawful delegation of Congress' power to \nlegislate. The language directs EPA to develop a mandatory reporting \nprogram of greenhouse gas emissions ``above appropriate thresholds in \nall sectors of the economy of the United States.'' There are no other \nstandards or directions to the Agency. There are no standards by which \na reviewing court can judge EPA's actions.\n  This registry language should be removed or, at a minimum, allowed to \nsunset at the end of fiscal year 2008 without implementation or effect.\n  In another provision, the appropriators express concern about \nproposed new power plants in Texas. This provision, at the very least, \nshould refer to all fossil fuel generation, not just single out coal-\nfired generation.\n  Colleagues, I have no illusions that my attempt here today to bring \nabout discipline on the spending process will succeed, but I cannot \nallow the bill to go through without registering in the strongest \npossible terms my objections to what we are doing here today.\n  I have no doubt that each of the Army Corps projects mentioned above \nhave merit, and I would be happy to work with the sponsors, as would, I \nam sure, Chairwoman Boxer, during the authorization process, but doing \nit now is wrong. It violates our rules, it removes discipline from the \nprocess.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in \nsupport of the consolidated appropriations bill before the Senate and \nto discuss one small part of the bill that is an important component to \nour many efforts to advance the biofuels industry and to wean our \nnation off of its reliance on oil.\n  In the Energy and Water Appropriations bill, the Senate \nAppropriations Committee provided $2 million to the Department of \nEnergy for ``E-85 infrastructure deployment.''\n  I want to highlight the importance of this funding and stress the \nneed for DOE to utilize this money in the most cost efficient and \neffective manner possible.\n  E85 is an alternative form of transportation fuel that consists of 85 \npercent ethanol and 15 percent gasoline. It has been developed, in \npart, to address American's air quality issues and its dangerous \ndependence on foreign oil.\n  Currently, there are over 6 million E85 capable vehicles on the \nNation's highways, and the use of E85 in these vehicles has the \npotential to significantly reduce the Nation's dependence on foreign \noil, add billions to total farm income, help improve rural and the \nAmerican economies, and help reduce levels of greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n[[Page S15881]]\n\n  Recognizing the importance of E85, President Bush and Secretary of \nTransportation Mary Peters participated with the CEOs of General \nMotors, Ford, and Chrysler in an event on March of 2007, where they \nannounced the growth in the production of flexible-fuel vehicles, FFVs, \nthat can run on E85.\n  The automakers pledged to double their existing production of \nflexible fuel vehicles by 2010. They also pledged that by 2012 fully 50 \npercent of all vehicle production would be FFVs.\n  This pledge, however, was predicated on the fact that adequate \nfueling infrastructure would be available by that time to fuel the \nmillions of additional E85-compatible vehicles.\n  It is the responsibility of Congress to provide adequate funding to \nhelp advance the deployment of E85 fueling infrastructure. I was \nencouraged then that the Senate elected to set aside $2 million for \nthis purpose in the Energy and Water Appropriations bill. Once \nfinalized, it will become the Department of Energy's responsibility to \nallocate this funding to the entity that can provide the most effective \nand cost-efficient service.\n  As Governor of Nebraska I helped create the Governors' Ethanol \nCoalition. In 1997, this coalition, along with the National Corn \nGrowers Association, domestic automakers, and others, established a \ngroup named the National Ethanol Vehicle Coalition, NEVC, to be the \nNation's primary advocate for the use of E85 ethanol as an alternative \nto oil-based transportation fuel.\n  Working with its many partners, NEVC maintains the primary national \ndatabase on E85 fueling locations, E85 fuel providers, and \ncomprehensive data on the technical requirements necessary to install \nE85 fueling systems. NEVC also provides the marketing and promotional \nmaterials used by all E85 fueling stations in the nation.\n  NEVC accomplishes all of these actions in a cost effective, timely, \nand prudent manner. In addition to having assisted with the opening of \n1,413 existing stations, NEVC has provided assistance to station \noperators for securing reasonably priced supplies of ethanol. NEVC has \nalso provided assistance regarding State and Federal tax credits and \nthe materials needed for proper marketing and promotion by these \nstations.\n  NEVC has an extensive background, high level of technical competence, \nand vast experience in establishing and maintaining E85 fueling \nfacilities, and they have proven themselves capable of effectively \ndelivering assistance in a cost-efficient manner.\n  I note that there is broad consensus that additional alternative \nfueling infrastructure is needed in this country, and I stress the need \nfor DOE to wisely use the limited funds we have made available.\n  As such, Mr. President, I strongly urge the Department of Energy to \nwork closely with NEVC and give them all due consideration when it is \nexpending the funding Congress has provided to meet the needs and goals \nfor E85 fueling stations.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, it is no secret that every Senator who \ncomes to Washington, DC, comes with a few select issues in mind which \nhe makes his own, and which he takes a particular interest in. For me, \nopen and transparent government has been one of those issues.\n  From my time as a Texas lawyer, supreme court justice, and attorney \ngeneral I know firsthand the importance, but also the difficulty of \ncreating and enforcing open government and the free flow of \ninformation. I have always taken to heart, however, the words of James \nMadison, who once declared: ``The advancement and diffusion of \nknowledge is the only guardian of true liberty.''\n  Of course, I have the advantage of coming from Texas, one of the \nstrongest States in terms of free information and open government. In \nTexas, it is a matter of principle that everyone should be able to \nquickly and easily find out what their government is doing and how.\n  That is why I was so pleased last week when the Senate passed the \nOpenness Promotes Effectiveness in our National Government, or OPEN \nGovernment Act of 2007. Now, the House has likewise passed this \nimportant bill, and I eagerly await the President signing it into law.\n  I have to thank my colleagues, the chairman of the Judiciary \ncommittee, Senator Leahy, and Lydia Griggsby of his staff; Senator Kyl, \nand Joe Matal of his staff; and two of my former chief counsels, James \nHo and Reed O'Connor. Without their hard work, we wouldn't be \ncelebrating this legislative victory today.\n  I have spoken on several occasions in this Chamber about the \nimportance of reforming and updating the Freedom of Information Act, so \nthat undue delays and onerous burdens which plague American citizens \nlooking for information that they by right should have. After 40 years \nof FOIA there still remain pending requests for information more than a \ndecade old. And many requests result in costly and drawn out lawsuits \nwhich effectively prevent the average citizen from receiving the \ninformation they deserve.\n  This bill will restore this most fundamental principle of a free and \ninformed citizenry. It reinforces Lincoln's notion of a government ``of \nthe people, by the people, for the people,'' placing information back \nin the hands of Americans. It is nothing short of a victory for \ndemocracy.\n  This bill restores meaningful deadlines with real consequences to the \nFOIA system, ensuring Government agencies will provide timely responses \nto requests. It creates a new system for tracking pending FOIA requests \nand an ombudsman to review agency compliance. At the same time it \ncloses loopholes and strengthens FOIA law ensuring all journalists have \nequal access to information.\n  These reforms are long overdue, and are but a part of creating a \ngovernment focused on openness. Still, I look forward to the President \nsigning this bill and pacing the way for a culture of transparency in \nAmerica. In my home of Texas, we have worked hard to establish the \nideals of openness and transparency, and I know that the Nation can \nfollow suit. It is in everyone's best interest to throw a little more \nsunshine on Washington, DC.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to draw your attention to a \ncritical amendment that I am offering to the Omnibus appropriation \nbill. As ranking member of the Subcommittee on Oceans, Atmosphere, \nFisheries, and the Coast Guard, I am working with my colleagues in the \nNew England delegation to seek support for this amendment. Our \namendment would allow fisheries disaster relief funds to be made \navailable to hard-hit fishermen in all New England States, not just \nMassachusetts as is currently stipulated\n  From the time the first Europeans arrived in the region that would \nbecome New England, fish--particularly groundfish such as cod and \nhaddock--were the fundamental natural resource. It was said that fish \nwere once so bountiful that one could walk across the Gulf of Maine on \nthe backs of codfish. But today, our centuries-old tradition of \ngroundfishing is at a critical juncture, and many of our fishermen are \nincreasingly finding that they can no longer find enough fish to make a \nliving in an industry that has sustained their families for \ngenerations. This is because ongoing requirements to rebuild New \nEngland's groundfishery have resulted in drastic cuts to the fishing \nindustry and severe economic impacts to our fishing communities. Since \n1996, groundfishermen in the Northeast Multispecies Groundfish Fishery \nhave seen their allotted days-at-sea slashed by over 75 percent, from \nan average of 116 to just 24 days a year. This effectively closes the \nfishery 93 percent of the time.\n  I understand the need to reduce catch on a temporary basis in order \nto allow the stocks to rebound from decades of overfishing, but if we \nare going to have any fishermen left to harvest those rebuilt stocks, \nwe must have Government assistance to sustain the fleet through this \nrebuilding period. The Maine groundfishing fleet already has been cut \nin half over the past 13 years, from more than 220 boats in 1994 to \njust 110 today. Groundfish landings in Maine are down 58 percent over \nthat same time period. Shoreside support industries such as fish \nprocessors, and ice, bait and fuel suppliers have suffered similar \nlosses--with jobs in fish processing and wholesaling dropping 40 \npercent, from nearly 3,000 jobs to less than 1,800 today.\n\n[[Page S15882]]\n\n  Because of these severe economic impacts and their ramifications to \nshoreside infrastructure and the overall health of coastal communities, \nearlier this year the Governor of Maine appealed to the Secretary of \nCommerce, asking that he officially declare a ``fisheries failure'' in \nthis region. Such a declaration under existing law would allow the \nrelease of vital disaster assistance to help minimize the devastating \nlosses our fishing communities are experiencing.\n  Unfortunately, the Secretary of Commerce failed our fishermen, when \nhe failed to make this declaration. He misinterpreted Congress's intent \nwhen, in the most recent reauthorization of the Magnuson-Stevens \nFishery Conservation Management Act, we authorized disaster relief \nfunding for fisheries crippled by overly onerous regulations. And that \nmistake was fueled by his decision to cherry-pick numbers and \ntimeframes that provided a rosier analysis of the true cumulative \neconomic impact of the groundfish regulations. It was his contention \nthat the fishery was ``rebuilding.'' While this may be true, the fact \nremains: today, our fishermen are only allowed to work 24 days a year. \nIf these are the regulations we require, I think that is evidence \nenough that the fishery should be considered a failure.\n\n  But given the Secretary's decision, and his rejection of numerous \nappeals to reconsider, it is now up to Congress to provide this vital \neconomic relief, which will enable our fishing communities to survive \nwhile groundfish stocks rebuild over the next several years. But as it \nnow stands in the omnibus, Congress is poised to repeat the mistakes \nmade by the Secretary of Commerce by denying this relief where it is \nmost needed.\n  Currently, the language in the bill would only allow disaster relief \nfunding to groundfishermen in the State of Massachusetts. This language \nmarks a significant departure from the New England delegation's past \nefforts to address the impacts of groundfish regulations. For nearly a \ndecade, until this language appeared, my staff and I have worked \nclosely with Senators Kerry and Kennedy--as well our colleagues from \nother New England States--to develop and put forth a comprehensive, \nconsistent, regional approach for achieving the goal of fairly and \neffectively helping our groundfishermen. The simple fact is that this \nis a regional fishery. Massachusetts fishermen are chasing the same \nfish as their Maine or Rhode Island or New Hampshire counterparts. And \nI am deeply troubled to see that this regional, cooperative approach \nhas been abandoned by my colleagues from Massachusetts, and they now \nchoose to ``go it alone'' without seeing that this is a regional \ncrisis. After all, considering that devastating economic impacts have \nhit all New England States, especially Maine, it is simply unfair and \nunreasonable to keep this funding contained to one State.\n  We first worked to remedy this situation and restore a strong \nregional solution last October. When the Senate passed our Commerce-\nJustice-Science Bill, S. 3093, we included a Sununu amendment, which I \ncosponsored, that would have directed $15 million of the funds provided \nto the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to be available \nto carry out disaster relief activities of the Magnuson-Stevens Act. To \nmy great dismay--and without consultation to the New England \ndelegation--the omnibus before us no longer contains the Senate-passed \nlanguage allowing this disaster relief for New England's \ngroundfishermen. The Senate must now act to restore this funding.\n  If we fail to do the right thing today, the result will be that \ndisaster relief funding will go to only Massachusetts--arguably the \nState that needs it the least. For example, the port of New Bedford, MA \nconsistently ranks first in the Nation in the value of fisheries \nlandings. Fishermen brought $281.2 million worth of fish to New Bedford \nalone in 2006, continuing a 7-year trend of increasing value of \nlandings. On top of that--Massachusetts fishermen are already set to \nreceive approximately 6 million of additional fisheries mitigation \nfunding from operators of a liquefied natural gas facility.\n\n  If Congress does not act to remedy this situation, we could be \nsounding the death knell for groundfishermen in other New England \nStates. The fishermen in Maine, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and \nConnecticut would simply be unable to compete with their counterparts \nin Massachusetts, who will soon find themselves awash in an influx of \ncash, boosting their bottom lines and increasing their competitiveness. \nThis would be a grievous injustice--one that we cannot countenance.\n  For the sake of the hard-working groundfishermen throughout the other \nNew England States, who have already endured years of costly \nregulations and are working hard to help stocks recover, I implore my \ncolleagues to support this amendment. Congress must right the wrongs \nthat continue to be carried out on our hardest hit fishermen and \ncoastal communities.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to support the fiscal year \n2008 omnibus appropriations bill. I know it has been difficult to reach \na compromise on this bill, and I realize that many funding levels for \nimportant programs were reduced so we could reach an agreement.\n  Despite these cutbacks, I believe we can still be proud of this bill. \nIt contains considerable funding for counterterrorism and crime \nprevention, scientific and medical research, Pell grants, title I \nschools, special education, small business programs, consumer product \nprotection, Amtrak, State and local first responder grants, and low-\nincome energy assistance. To meet the President's top line budget \nnumber, my colleagues had to make hard choices. To their credit, the \nbill before us today prioritizes the most critical domestic programs in \nthe Federal Government.\n  The omnibus also contains an additional $3.7 billion in emergency \nfunding for veterans, constituting the largest increase in veterans' \nspending in the history of our Nation. $1.9 billion of the increase is \ntargeted for VA medical services. This much needed funding will improve \ntreatment for traumatic brain injury and post-traumatic stress \ndisorder, two of the most prevalent injuries from the global war on \nterrorism.\n  I am also proud of what this bill will do for the people and \ncommunities of Connecticut. The money I requested will assist many \nworthy local efforts, such as hospital renovations, the construction of \na small craft maintenance facility at Naval Submarine Base New London, \na community college manufacturing technology program, and improvements \nto several intermodal transportation facilities.\n  I would like to clarify conference language concerning two specific \nprojects in the bill. Currently, the Interior, Environment, and Related \nAgencies conference report lists a State and tribal assistance grant \nproject as ``$300,000 for The City of Southington for wellhead \ncleanup.'' This language should be interpreted as if it stated \n``$300,000 for the Southington Water Department for wellhead cleanup.''\n  The Labor, Health and Human Services, Education and Related Agencies \nconference report lists an Office of Museum and Library Services \nproject as ``$97,000 for the Connecticut Historical Society, Hartford, \nCT for educational programs and interactive school programs at the Old \nState House.'' This language should be interpreted as if it stated \n``$97,000 for the Connecticut Historical Society, Hartford, CT for \neducational programs and interactive school programs at the Old State \nHouse and the Connecticut Historical Society Museum.''\n  Once again, I commend the efforts of my colleagues on the \nconsolidated appropriations bill for fiscal year 2008. They deserve \nhearty congratulations for their demanding work and considerable \nwillingness to compromise.\n  Mr. COBURN. As we approach the end of the year, Congress once again \nfinds itself on a last-minute spending spree, approving billions of \ndollars of new spending with few questions asked, no amendments \nallowed, and little debate, discussion, or inspection permitted.\n  The U.S. national debt now exceeds $9.13 trillion. That means almost \n$30,000 in debt for each and every man, woman, and child in the United \nStates. The U.S. debt is expanding by about $1.4 billion a day, or \nnearly $1 million a minute. The unfunded liability placed on a child \nborn today is $400,000.\n  The ``Financial Report of the United States Government'' released \nthis week found that the Federal deficit would be\n\n[[Page S15883]]\n\nnearly 70 percent higher than the $162.8 billion reported 2 months ago \nif the Government used the same accounting practices as private firms. \nAccounting for such liabilities as pensions and health care costs when \nthey are incurred rather than when they are paid would have boosted the \ndeficit to $275.5 billion, the report noted.\n  It is completely irresponsible for Congress to add to this debt that \nthreatens the retirement security of our senior citizens and the \neconomic prosperity of our children and grandchildren who will inherit \nthe debt that results from the spending decisions Congress is making \ntoday.\n  The Omnibus appropriations bill, which combines the 11 unfinished \nappropriations bills to fund the Federal Government's operations in \nfiscal year 2008, provides approximately $515.7 billion in \ndiscretionary spending. The bill also adds approximately $11 billion in \nemergency spending, of which $3.7 billion is contingent emergency \nspending for veterans programs.\n  This bill was approved by the House of Representatives last night, \nand the Senate will vote on it today, even though it has only been \navailable now for 36 hours. The bill is more than 3,400 pages, and I am \nfairly certain that not a single Member of either chamber of Congress, \nor anyone else, for that matter, has read it in its entirety. What is \nmost shocking, however, is that the eagerness of Members of Congress to \nrecess for the year and to satisfy the desire to secure pork projects \nhas taken precedent over our responsibility to properly manage the \nNation's finances and set national spending priorities.\n  While this bill does not provide the funding that is needed for our \nbrave men and women in uniform fighting on the front lines in Iraq, it \ndoes contains over 9,000 special interest pork projects, known as \n``earmarks.''\n  ``An earmark Christmas, Lawmakers deck out omnibus with many a \nspending project,'' proclaims the front page of the Hill newspaper. \n``Earmark Extravaganza, Nearly 9,000 Requests in Omnibus,'' exclaims \nthe front page of Roll Call.\n  Nearly 300 of the earmarks in this bill costing over $800 million \nwere air dropped into this bill during closed- door meetings not open \nto the public or most Members of Congress.\n  Among the thousands of earmarked projects tucked into this bill are:\n  $113,000 for rodent control in Alaska;\n  $213,000 for olive fruit fly research in France;\n  $1,645,000 for the City of Bastrop, LA. According to Bastrop Daily \nEnterprise, ``The money is officially earmarked for the purchase of \nbulletproof vests and body armor. Bulletproof vests only cost about \n$700-800, however, so $1.6 million would appear to be overkill.'' \nPolice detective Curtis Stephenson agrees, conceding ``There's no way \nwe'd need that kind of money just to put all our people in vests.'';\n  $200,000 for a Hunting and Fishing Museum in Pennsylvania;\n  $150,000 for a Louis Armstrong Museum in New York;\n  $700,000 for a bike trail in Minnesota;\n  $1,000,000 for river walk in Massachusetts;\n  $200,000 for a post office museum in downtown Las Vegas;\n  $1,000,000 for an earmark requested by a House Member who has been \nindicted on Federal charges of racketeering, money-laundering and \nsoliciting bribes;\n  $824,000 for alternative salmon products;\n  $146,000 for an aquarium in South Carolina;\n  $1,000,000 for managing weeds in Idaho; and\n  $37,000 for the Lincoln Park Zoo in Illinois.\n  It is hard to argue that any of these are national priorities or more \nimportant than funding the troops in Iraq or worth increasing the \nnational debt. Members of Congress have, however, learned to \nrationalize the practice of earmarking, but the truth is every earmark \ndiverts funds away from more important national priorities.\n  I filed two amendments to this bill that would have demonstrated this \npoint that I had hoped to offer but was blocked from doing so. These \namendments would have given Congress the opportunity to choose between \nimproving deficient roads and bridges and providing health care to \nwomen and children before steering funds toward special interest \nearmarks.\n  The first amendment, 3860, would have allowed the Department of \nTransportation to redirect earmarked funds to improve unsafe roads and \nbridges.\n  On August 1, 2007, the Interstate 35 West, I-35W bridge over the \nMississippi River in Minneapolis, MN, collapsed during rush hour, \nkilling 13 people and injuring another 123. This tragedy exposed both a \nnationwide problem of deficient bridges as well as misplaced priorities \nof Congress, which has focused more on funding earmarks than improving \naging infrastructure.\n  According to the U.S. Department of Transportation, one out of every \neight bridges in our Nation is structurally deficient. Of the 597,340 \nbridges in the United States, 154,101 bridges are deficient. Yet, \ninstead of addressing needed bridge maintenance, Congress has \nprioritized earmarks for politicians' pet projects, many which do not \neven involve roads or bridges.\n  The $286 billion, 5-year Transportation authorization bill approved \nby Congress in 2005, for example, included 6,373 earmarks, totaling $24 \nbillion, including the infamous ``Bridge to Nowhere'' in Alaska.\n  An investigation by the inspector general of the Department of \nTransportation found that ``Many earmarked projects considered by the \nagencies as low priority are being funded over higher priority, non-\nearmarked projects.'' The IG notes that ``Funding these new low \npriority projects added to the already substantial backlog of \nreplacement projects and caused [Federal Aviation Administration] to \ndelay the planning of its higher priority replacement projects by at \nleast 3 years.''\n  Earmarks have siphoned away tens of billions of dollars that could \nand should have been spent to upgrade deficient bridges or improve \naging roads rather than being spent on politicians' pet projects.\n  The Senate has already rejected a similar amendment in September, and \nthis bill shows once again that Congress is more interested in securing \nearmarks than securing our Nation's roads and bridges.\n  The second amendment, 3861, would have allowed the Department of \nHealth and Human Services to redirect earmarked funds to the Maternal \nand Child Health Block Grant Program.\n  Congress has spent much of this year posturing about who cares most \nabout providing health care for children and the uninsured. Yet \nCongress has failed to enact any reforms to expand health care access. \nAccording to the Kaiser Family Foundation, in this country there were \n9.5 million children who lacked health insurance for at least part of \nlast year, and over 17 million women are uninsured.\n  This amendment ensures that many of these uninsured women and \nchildren would receive services from the Maternal and Child Health \nBlock Grant, which provides funding for urgent health needs for \npregnant women, mothers, infants, children, and adolescents. It is \nshameful that Congress has diverted tens of millions of dollars in the \nhealth title of this bill towards special interest pork projects when \nmillions of children and women do not have access to critical health \ncare.\n  The Senate rejected a similar amendment in October, and this bill \ndemonstrates once again that while Congress may talk about prioritizing \nchildren's health care, the real priority of Congress is its own \nspecial interest pork projects.\n  There are plenty of other examples in this bill of Congress's \nmisplaced priorities. The bill, for example, terminates the Baby AIDS \nProgram that provides resources to prevent perinatal HIV transmission \nand care for mothers with HIV, while ensuring that San Francisco \nreceives funding for deceased AIDS patients. The bill provides another \n$100 million for the 2008 political party conventions. It allows the \nDepartment of Justice to again provide Federal financial support for \ngroups linked to terrorism by removing the prohibition passed by the \nSenate in October.\n  Who know what other travesties are hidden within this 3,400 page \nomnibus spending bill that Congress is expected to pass without having \ntime to read, review, or amend? Members of Congress may never know, and \napparently few seem to care.\n\n[[Page S15884]]\n\n  It should come as no surprise to anyone that the approval ratings of \nCongress have reached alltime historical lows.\n  Congress has ignored the needs of our troops in combat, the looming \nbankruptcy of Social Security and Medicare, and the nearly \ninsurmountable national debt that threatens the future prosperity of \nour Nation while showing virtually no restraint on spending, especially \nfor parochial pork projects.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise today to offer my distinct dismay \nwith the outcome of what has become omnibus funding legislation for 11 \nof the 13 appropriations bills for fiscal year 2008. H.R. 2764 is a sad \ntestament to Congress's inability to draft and pass responsible Federal \nfunding legislation. I am very disappointed that critical funding for \ndrug abuse education efforts, crime victims and, more specifically, \nvictims of domestic violence has been stripped from this bill. Idaho \nwill lose more than 10 percent of Victims of Crime Act Funding, money, \nincidentally, which was never supposed to be subject to the \nappropriations process in the first place. Furthermore, funding for \nprograms that help victims of sexual assault in 15 cities in Idaho and \na program that has helped thousands of Idaho schoolchildren learn of \nthe dangers of Internet predators have been eliminated during the \nconference process on this omnibus spending bill. Justice assistance \ngrants have been significantly reduced. The Office of National Drug \nControl Policy Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign was significantly cut, \nwhich jeopardizes important anti drug and, particularly anti meth media \nmessaging for Idaho's youth. Although I have supported important \nfunding along the way in these bills including veterans funding, border \nfunds and other Idaho priorities, in my view, victims of crime and our \nyouth are the clear losers in this legislation, and because of this and \nother substantial concerns I have with this, I have to vote against the \nbill.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I would like to express my support for a \nprovision of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008. Specifically, I \nwould like to take this opportunity to highlight and clarify language \nincluded in Division E, the Department of Homeland Security \nAppropriations Act of 2008 regarding the secure handling of ammonium \nnitrate.\n  This legislation reduces the risk of large quantities of ammonium \nnitrate falling into the wrong hands, while ensuring access for \nagriculture professionals and farmers who use this fertilizer for \nlegitimate purposes. It requires that ammonium nitrate sellers and \npurchasers register and receive a registration number in order to \ndistribute or buy the product. Doing so reduces the possibility that \nammonium nitrate will be misused. First, it allows Department of \nHomeland Security and relevant law enforcement agencies to know who has \naccess to ammonium nitrate. Second, it requires registration number \napplicants to be matched against the terrorism screening database \nbefore being authorized to buy or sell ammonium nitrate. Finally, by \nmaking the sale or purchase of ammonium nitrate more difficult, it \ndeters acquisition of this explosive precursor by dangerous persons.\n  Farmers who use ammonium nitrate in agriculture production normally \nobtain the ammonium nitrate from a retail fertilizer dealership. Any \nretail fertilizer dealership that stores and sells ammonium nitrate \nwould have to register under this legislation. The intent of this \nlegislation is ``track and trace''--to provide law enforcement \nofficials with the ability to know where ammonium nitrate is being \nstored and the establishment of a prescreening process before a person \ncan purchase and take away ammonium nitrate.\n  Retail fertilizer dealerships provide many services for farmers and \none of those services is custom application. Many farmers buy the \nfertilizer, but never physically take possession of the ammonium \nnitrate. Instead, farmers purchase the services of a dealer who spreads \nthe ammonium nitrate on their fields. In the southeastern United \nStates, nearly 90 percent of the 41,800 tons of ammonium nitrate \npurchased is directly applied to the field from the custody of the \nfertilizer dealer or applicator company. Only 10 percent of the \nammonium nitrate purchased in the southeastern United States is ever \nunder the direct control and possession of the farm customer.\n  Businesses and employees who provide custom application services \nwould be subject to the registration requirements of the legislation. \nIt is not the intent of this legislation to require registration by \nindividuals who use custom application services but never physically \ncontrol any ammonium nitrate.\n  I believe this bill will help keep ammonium nitrate out of would-be \nterrorists' hands while allowing farmers to use it for legitimate \npurposes.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the Omnibus \nappropriations bill that is before us today. Although I am supportive \nof a number of important items in the bill, I have serious concerns and \nreservations about how this voluminous package was put together and how \nit has reached this point. As we are all aware, none of the 11 bills in \nthis package have ever been considered on the floor of this chamber. I \nbelieve this is a travesty and entirely contrary to our democratic \nprocess. I, for one, believe that next year we must make it a priority \nto consider all of the appropriations bills in regular order so that \nall Members can participate in the process. We are appropriating nearly \n$933 billion through this bill and only a select few Members in both \nChambers have participated in the allocation of those dollars.\n  Despite my deep concerns about the process of putting this bill \ntogether, I have chosen to support it because it is within the \nPresident's budget request, it provides bridge-funding to support our \ntroops in Iraq and Afghanistan, and it contains a number of other items \nthat I support.\n  I am pleased that the bill contains funds to continue Marriage \nDevelopment Accounts in the District of Columbia. We began this program \nin fiscal year 2006 as a way to stem the erosion of marriage in DC. \nSadly, marriage is all but disappearing in low-income communities in \nthis city and across the country because couples lose important \nbenefits such as food stamps, low-income housing credits, Temporary \nAssistance to Needy Families, and Medicaid merely for taking a wedding \nvow. In addition, these couples often have to pay higher taxes when \nthey choose to marry. For most low-income couples, the welfare system \nhas made marriage a bad economic decision. MDAs are one way we are \nmaking marriage a good economic decision. With an MDA, a low-income \ncouple can save for a house, for higher education, or to start a small \nbusiness and we will match those funds 3-to-1 with two Federal dollars \nand one private matching dollar. In just its second year of operation, \nover 100 DC residents have opened MDAs and 7 have already bought houses \nwith their matched savings.\n  I am also pleased that we were able to include language in this bill \nrequiring the U.S. Mint to return the words ``In God We Trust'' to the \nface of the $1 Presidential coins and the $1 Sacagawea coins. ``In God \nWe Trust'' is our national motto and since the beginning of our Nation, \nAmerica's citizens have acknowledged how God is very much a part of the \nfounding principles and traditions of our democracy. I would like to \nnote that in 1861, Secretary of the Treasury Samuel P. Chase ordered \nthat coins bear a motto expressing the American people's trust in God. \nThe first coins with the phrase ``In God We Trust'' were minted in \n1864. In 1955, the phrase was required for all new coins, and in 1956 \nCongress officially endorsed ``In God We Trust'' as the national motto. \nTherefore, I was troubled to learn that the words ``In God We Trust'' \ndo not appear on the face of the new Presidential coins. These words \nare barely visible and almost hidden on the edge of the new coins. To \nrectify this situation, we have included language in this bill that \nwill require the U.S. Mint to return our national motto to the front of \nthe coin.\n  I would like to note that we have provided $80 million for the \nConsumer Product Safety Commission, an increase of $17 million over the \nfiscal year 2007 level. I believe that this increase is important and \nnecessary because it will allow the CPSC to hire additional inspectors \nto ensure that toys and other consumer products entering our country \nare safe. We have all been deeply concerned over the flood of shoddy \nand dangerous products entering our ports. Most troubling is that\n\n[[Page S15885]]\n\nmany of these products are designed for our smallest and most \nvulnerable consumers: everything from baby cribs and strollers to \nchildren's toys and baby teethers have been recalled just this past \nyear. I believe these additional funds will help CPSC address this \ngrowing problem.\n  I am supportive of the $60 million available in this bill to support \ndemocracy in Iran. Although I am pleased that this money is in the \nbill, I would have hoped we could have come up with an additional \namount for this important and essential work. I am also concerned about \noversight of these funds. In my view, this money is a crucial part of \nour overall policy on Iran, and I will closely monitor how it is spent.\n  Finally, I would not be able to vote for this bill if it did not \ncontain the necessary funding for our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. \nThe amendment that Senator McConnell has offered today contains those \nimportant and necessary funds. We are making progress in the war in \nIraq and we must continue to provide our brave servicemen and \nservicewomen all the armor and ammunition and support they need to \ncontinue to secure a peace in that region of the world.\n  I reiterate my deep concerns and consternation with how this omnibus \nbill was put together. To say that this behemoth bill was cobbled \ntogether in the dead of night among just a few Members is no \nexaggeration. Such an approach is undemocratic and dangerous. Although \nI will vote for the bill, I must insist that we abandon this \nundemocratic process and return to regular order when we take up next \nyear's appropriations bills.\n  Ms. MIKULKSI. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the Commerce, \nJustice, Science and Related Agencies, CJS, division of the Omnibus \nappropriations bill before the Senate. The CJS agreement in this bill \nis a bipartisan, bicameral compromise that is a product of hard work \nand tough choices. In order to meet a very stringent allocation \nmandated by the President, we had to cut $2.6 billion from the Senate \nCJS bill, which passed the Senate on October 16, 2007.\n  Although we were forced to make substantial cuts, we protected the \nsubcommittee's priorities. First, security--keeping Americans safe from \nthreats at home and abroad. Second, promoting competitiveness--\ndeveloping new technologies that create jobs for the future. Finally, \nproviding congressional oversight by demanding accountability from the \nagencies funded in this bill to ensure they act as good stewards of \nU.S. taxpayer dollars. Significant improvements to the President's \nbudget were made in this bill to make America safer and stronger and \nensure taxpayer dollars are being spent wisely.\n  Despite the tough choices we had to make, there are accomplishments \nfor which we can be proud. First, the CJS subcommittee's top priority \nis to protect America from terrorism and violent crime. The \nsubcommittee provided the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), our \ndomestic counterterrorism agency, $133 million above the President's \nrequest, for a total of $6.7 billion. The CJS agreement bolsters the \nFBI's efforts to fight emerging cyber security and terrorist threats \nand provide for 160 new FBI agents to track and dismantle terrorist \ncells in the United States For the Drug Enforcement Administration, \nDEA, we provide $53 million more than the President's request, for a \ntotal of $2.1 billion. These funds will lift the hiring freeze and give \nDEA the resources they need to hire 200 additional special agents. \nThese agents will fight illegal drugs like heroin and methamphetamine \nthat are destroying our communities and disrupt the poppy trade in \nAfghanistan, which funds terrorist activity.\n  In addition, the President's budget gutted funds for State and local \nlaw enforcement by $1.5 billion from last year's level. The CJS \nagreement provides a total of $2.7 billion to help State and local law \nenforcement fight crime, drugs and gangs. The agreement includes $1.2 \nbillion more than the President's request. With the limited resources \nthe subcommittee had, we were able to make modest increases to \ncritically important State and local law enforcement programs. For \nexample, we provided $20 million to put 260 new cops on the beat in our \nlocal communities; $400 million to keep women and children safe from \ndomestic violence; $383 million to keep children safe from child \npredators, gangs and drugs; and $15 million to put cops in schools to \nfight the rising trend of violence on school grounds. These are \ncritical programs and I wish we could have provided more funds to keep \nour children safe, protect our communities and provide those on the \nthin blue line the resources they deserve to protect us.\n  The CJS agreement continues the subcommittee's commitment to the \ndevelopment of new technologies that create jobs for the future. The \nCJS agreement fully funds the President's request of $17.3 billion for \nNASA. NASA is our premier innovation agency that is creating new \ntechnologies and inspiring future scientists and engineers. The CJS \nagreement maintains our commitment to the space station and the aging \nspace shuttle fleet and fully funds the new space transportation \nvehicle. The CJS agreement also keep our commitment to NASA's \nscientific discovery and aeronautics research.\n  In addition, the CJS agreement rejects the President's cuts to \nDepartment of Commerce initiatives that create technologies and jobs. \nThe agreement restores $80 million above the President's request for \neconomic development grants to help our communities develop \ninfrastructure to create new jobs. The agreement provides $90 million \nfor the Manufacturing Extension Partnerships, MEP, which help small \nU.S. manufacturers stay competitive. Also, the agreement provides $65 \nmillion for the newly authorized Technology Innovation Partnership, \nTIP, program to encourage innovation.\n  The CJS agreement emphasizes oversight and accountability to prevent \nmismanagement of taxpayer dollars. Specifically, the agreement \nprohibits funds for lavish banquets and conferences and requires the \nInspector General in each agency to stand sentry over grant spending to \nensure taxpayer dollars are not squandered. The subcommittee agreement \ninstitutes an early warning system for cost overruns and schedule \nslippages on major satellite procurement programs so that costs to the \ntaxpayers do not grow unchecked. The agreement also requires management \nreforms at the Patent and Trademark Office, PTO, to reduce application \nbacklogs and waiting times. Currently there is a 2 year backlog to \nprocess a patent application and this backlog could reach over 800,000 \napplications this year.\n  Unfortunately, the subcommittee also had to make some very difficult \nchoices. There were reluctant cuts dictated by the President's budget \nthat forced the Subcommitte to cut things that we wanted to fund. For \nexample, Byrne formula grants to States are funded at only $170 \nmillion. The President zeroed out Byrne formula grants, but our \nagreement is still $350 million below 2007. Byrne formula grants go to \nStates to pay for police training and technology and crime prevention \nprograms at the State and local level. This cut means there will be \nless direct Federal funding for State law enforcement budgets, \nstraining State budgets that are already stressed.\n  Regrettably, the CJS agreement is $424 million below the President's \nrequest for the American Competitiveness Initiative, ACI, at the \nNational Science Foundation, NSF, and National Institute of Standards \nand Technology, NIST. Our Senate bill fully funded the President's \nrequest for ACI, which has bipartisan support, but our allocation \nrequired very difficult choices and this was one of them.\n  Finally, I want to express about my disappointment that the House \nwould not agree with two provisions that were included in the Senate \nCJS bill. First is emergency funding for NASA. Our Senate bill included \n$1 billion in emergency funding to reimburse NASA for the costs of \nreturning the space shuttle to flight after the Columbia accident. This \nfunding had bipartisan support in the Senate, but the House would not \nagree to it. The consequence will be a continued gap in time between \nshuttle retirement and development of our new vehicle.\n  Second, I included a provision in our Senate bill to extend the H-2B \nreturning worker exemption. This was a simple 1-year extension of \ncurrent law. On a bipartisan basis, the Senate wanted to protect small \nand seasonal businesses from going bankrupt. I regret\n\n[[Page S15886]]\n\nthat the House would not agree to the extension.\n  Overall, the CJS agreement is a bipartisan effort, a product of hard \nwork and tough choices in order to meet a very tight allocation. Even \nwithin the tight allocation, we provide funding to keep America safe, \nwe secure America's competitiveness, and we provide strong oversight \nand accountability to ensure stewardship of taxpayer dollars.\n  I want to thank my ranking member, Senator Shelby for his \ncollegiality and cooperation. I also want to thank Chairman Byrd and \nRanking Member Cochran for their hard work and advocacy. And I thank \ntheir staff, specifically, Art Cameron, Chuck Kieffer, and Bruce Evans. \nI encourage my colleagues to support of the CJS agreement.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Feingold amendment \nbecause the strategy it mandates gives us the best chance to succeed in \nIraq and strengthen America's security around the world. In fact, \nrecent developments in Iraq and Afghanistan have made it clear that \nthis amendment is as important now as it was when Senator Feingold and \nI first introduced a similar measure a year and half ago.\n  I have heard the arguments that the escalation has worked, that we no \nlonger need to change the mission, and that we are now on the path to \nvictory in Iraq. Every one of us agrees that the troops in Iraq have \ndone an extraordinary job under unbelievably difficult circumstances. \nThe entire country owes them a profound debt of gratitude for their \nincredible sacrifices.\n  But we must not lose sight of the bigger picture, which is that the \nbrave men and women of our armed forces no matter how heroically they \nperform cannot end an Iraqi civil war. Every one of our generals, the \nSecretary of Defense, and the Secretary of State have all told us \nrepeatedly that there is simply no military solution to this conflict. \nThe President himself has acknowledged as much and that is why he made \nclear that the purpose of the escalation was to give the Iraqis one \nlast opportunity to make the tough political compromises that are the \nonly hope for bringing lasting stability to Iraq.\n  But the bottom line is that we have not seen any political progress \nfrom the Maliki government since the escalation began nearly one year \nago. Not one single additional political benchmark has been met and by \nsome accounts they are even further away from compromising than they \nhave ever been. So when we assess progress in Iraq over the past few \nmonths, let's be clear: by the measure that ultimately counts the most \npolitical reconciliation this strategy has not accomplished the goal \nthat the President himself established.\n  The reason is simple: the Iraqi government has proven time and again \nthat without a deadline they will not make the tough compromises \nnecessary to bring about a political solution that is the only \nsolution. And as long as we continue to follow the same course of \ngiving them an open-ended commitment, they will continue to pursue \ntheir narrow sectarian interests while our troops continue to pay the \nultimate price.\n  To succeed over the long term in Iraq, we must change course. We must \ninsist on a strategy that honors what our troops have accomplished and \nforce the Iraqis to finally take advantage of the opportunity they have \nbefore them. That's what the Feingold amendment does. It changes the \nmission to one that can be sustained even as we draw down troops to \npre-surge levels which our overstretched military requires us to do: \ntraining Iraqi security forces, conducting targeted counter-terrorism \nmissions, and protecting U.S. forces and facilities. And most \nimportantly, it sets the deadline we need to create the leverage \nnecessary to bring about real political reconciliation.\n  In fact, if you look closely at what has occurred over the past few \nmonths in Iraq, it is clear that a significant amount of the progress \nwe have seen in terms of reducing violence has been the result of \npolitical decisions. That's not to understate the key role our troops \nhave played it's simply to recognize the realities of this type of \ncounterinsurgency mission.\n  We all know that the Sunni tribal leaders in Anbar province made a \ncalculated decision, based on their own self-interest, to turn against \nal-Qaida in fact, many of us have argued for some time the Iraqis \nthemselves would never tolerate foreign extremists in their midst.\n  We also know that one of the key factors in reducing the violence has \nbeen the decision by Moktada al-Sadr to tell his Mahdi militia to stand \ndown--at least temporarily. This was reportedly due, at least in part, \nto a request Prime Minister Maliki made of Iran in August to help rein \nin the Shia militias. In fact, according to the New York Times, \nspokesmen for our own military ``have gone out of their way to publicly \nacknowledge Iran's role in helping to slow the flow of weapons into the \ncountry.''\n  And finally, we know that the flow of foreign fighters into Iraq from \nSyria has diminished considerably at a time when we have finally begun \nsome level of diplomatic engagement with Syria.\n  So we must learn the right lessons from the positive developments we \nhave seen over the last few months and recognize that the way forward, \nthe best chance for lasting progress, is through political and \ndiplomatic efforts. We must act now to take advantage of the window our \ntroops have provided. I applaud the summits that have been held on Iraq \nin Sharm el Sheikh and Istanbul, but we need to see much more \nsustained, hands-on engagement at the highest levels of the \nadministration. And we need a deadline to fundamentally change the \ndynamic for Iraq's political leaders.\n  The alternative is to continue giving the President a blank check \nwhich is exactly what the McConnell amendment does. There's no \nrequirement to transition the mission, and no deadline to leverage \npolitical process. And there's no relief for a military stretched to \nthe breaking point. That will not resolve the sectarian divisions that \nhave fed this civil war, it will not bring longterm stability to Iraq, \nand it will not protect our national security interests around the \nworld.\n  Nowhere is that more important than in Afghanistan, where the same \nkillers who attacked us on 9/11 are right where we left them, plotting \nmore attacks on our homeland. The simple fact is that because of the \nattention, energy, and resources we have devoted to Iraq, we're now in \ndanger of losing Afghanistan. The Taliban and al-Qaida have regrouped \nalong the Afghan-Pakistan border, currently hold large swathes of \nterritory, and are expanding their reach into regions that haven't seen \nthe Taliban since 2001. Violence may be down in Iraq, but it's at its \nhighest levels in Afghanistan since the invasion. Opium cultivation has \nsoared to 93 percent of the world's market. Reconstruction efforts have \nstalled, and Oxfam International is reporting ``humanitarian conditions \nrarely seen outside sub-Saharan Africa.''\n  That is why Secretary Gates and Admiral Mullen called for more \ntroops, equipment, and a strategic plan to get it right in Afghanistan \nlast week. But because we have expended valuable American blood and \ntreasure in Iraq and allowed our focus to wander from our top national \nsecurity priority, the resources just aren't there to fight Taliban and \nal-Qaida in Afghanistan. If we change the mission in Iraq and return \nour focus to Afghanistan, we still have time to achieve the stable \ndemocracy we promised.\n  But we must act now. In Iraq and in Afghanistan, time is not on our \nside. We must seize this moment to put America on course to a safer and \nmore secure future.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the fiscal year 2008 appropriations bills \ndo not adequately address all of the long-term needs of the American \npeople. We have no one to blame but the President and his Republican \nallies who have chosen to stand by his side.\n  The bills we drafted and passed out of the Appropriations Committees \non a bipartisan basis went far beyond what we have here today, but the \nPresident has made it clear he would veto any bills that were above his \ngrossly inadequate budget.\n  These allies stood with the President and his budget, a budget that I \ncannot believe anyone would be proud to support. The President's budget \ncontained cuts of 800 grants for medical research at NIH, cuts in \nprograms that provide access to health care by $595 million, cuts in \nrural health initiatives by 50 percent, cuts for crucial Department of \nEducation programs by $1.2 billion, and\n\n[[Page S15887]]\n\ncuts in Homeland Security Grants for police, firefighters, and medical \npersonnel by $1.1 billion.\n  This is what we were presented with take it or leave it. The \nPresident refused to compromise and instead made it very clear that in \nhis eyes, cuts for health care, education, jobs, and homeland security \nare nonnegotiable. For the cost of what we spend in 2 months in Iraq, \nthe President was more than willing to sacrifice a year's worth of \nbadly needed investments into health research, our children's \neducation, worker safety, and homeland security.\n  The President has done all of this under the banner of fiscal \nresponsibility. This is hard to believe from a President who increased \nspending 50 percent since he came to office, saddled our children and \ngrandchildren with $3.3 trillion in new debt, doubled the size of \nforeign debt held by other countries, and asked for another $200 \nbillion for the war in Iraq without paying for it.\n  This President also had no problem with a Defense spending bill that \nwas 11 percent more than he asked for. He has no problem asking us for \na blank check to fund war in Iraq. This is a President who says it is \nOK to increase spending for those in other countries, but not here at \nhome. When it comes to raising money for our needs at home his answer \ncomes with a stroke of his new-found veto pen.\n  When the President drew his line in the sand, we reached out to our \nRepublican counterparts in an effort to build a bipartisan coalition to \novercome his veto, but Republicans gave us the cold shoulder and have \ndecided to stand with the President. These are the same Republicans who \nlast Congress failed to pass a budget or complete any of its work on \ndomestic funding bills. They have criticized us for the size of this \nbill, but compared to nothing, I will take our work here.\n  We realize we have an obligation to the American people to fund the \nimportant functions of our Government and to finish our work as a \nCongress. To complete these bills we had to make tough decisions in the \nface of the President's unreasonable demands and work toward \nprioritizing the needs of the country.\n  Even within the unreasonable constraints of the President's budget \nnumbers, we still put veterans first. This bill added $3.7 billion \nabove the President's budget request for veterans and their health \nneeds. This $3.7 billion in veterans spending is a proposal the \nPresident once threatened to veto. These funds will be used for medical \nand prosthetic research, health services for injured and ill veterans, \nand the construction of new medical facilities to help those returning \nhome from Iraq and Afghanistan. The additional $3.7 billion for \nveterans is contingent on Presidential action. The President must make \nan emergency spending request by January 18, 2008.\n  Within the President's overall budget numbers, we were still able to \nincrease spending for health, education and workers by $3.9 billion. \nThat is $3.9 billion for our needs here for Americans at home. Even \nwith the President's hard-line position on his overall budget numbers, \nthe fiscal year 2008 Consolidated Appropriations Act better reflects \nAmerican priorities.\n  Democratic increases above the President's budget request include \n$3.7 billion for veterans healthcare, $613 million for medical \nresearch, $3 billion for education, $486 million for renewable energy \nsources, $788 million for heating assistance for low-income households, \n$1.6 billion for highways and bridges, $1.2 billion for State and local \nlaw enforcement, $1.8 billion for homeland security, and $17 million \nfor consumer protection.\n  I am also very pleased and proud of what we were able to do with very \nlimited funding within the Financial Services and General Government \nAppropriations Subcommittee.\n  Our bill provides $20.6 billion in funding for the Department of the \nTreasury, the Internal Revenue Service, the Executive Office of the \nPresident, the Federal judiciary, the District of Columbia, and an \narray of 20 independent agencies, including the Consumer Product Safety \nCommission, the General Services Administration, the Federal \nCommunications Commission, the Federal Election Commission, the Federal \nTrade Commission, the Postal Service, the Securities and Exchange \nCommission, and the Small Business Administration.\n  Therefore, while I would like to highlight some of the features in \nthe Financial Services title, I note that the circumstances that led to \nthe final bill forced us to make regrettable cuts, because of the \nPresident's insistence on his overall bottom line on domestic spending.\n  I am pleased this bill provides $80 million for the Consumer Product \nSafety Commission, a 30-percent increase of $17.3 million above the \nfiscal year 2007 enacted level and $16.75 million above the budget \nrequest.\n  This increase in funding will allow the agency to hire employees, \nfind space for additional employees, and make critically needed IT \nimprovements.\n  In addition, the bill includes $115 million for election reform \nprograms to be available for States for assistance in meeting the \nrequirements of the Help America Vote Act of 2002. The amended bill \nalso provides $10 million for an election data collection pilot \nprogram.\n  Within the IRS, funding of $2.15 billion is provided for the Taxpayer \nServices account. This is $11.7 million above the fiscal year 2007 \nenacted level, $46.9 million above the President's request, and \n$800,000 above the Senate committee-reported level. The President's \nbudget sought to cut Taxpayer Services by $35.1 million below the \nfiscal year 2007 level. The bill also establishes a new $8 million \npilot grant program to improve the Community Volunteer Income Tax \nAssistance Program to serve underserved populations and hardest-to-\nreach areas.\n  The bill boosts funding for Treasury's Community Development \nFinancial Institutions, CDFI, Fund to $94 million, reflecting an \nincrease of $39.5 million over the fiscal year 2007 enacted level, \n$65.4 million above the President's request, and $4 million above the \nSenate committee-reported level. The President's request would have \ndecimated the fund, which promotes access to capital and local economic \ngrowth by directly investing in and supporting community development \nfinancial institutions and by expanding lending, investment, and \nservices offered by banks and thrifts within underserved markets.\n  The Federal judiciary receives a 4.3 percent increase over fiscal \nyear 2007 in both mandatory and discretionary funding. Within the \nJudiciary title, the bill provides $410 million--an 8.3 percent \nincrease over fiscal year 2007--for court security. The bill also \nauthorizes a pilot program to permit the U.S. Marshals instead of the \nFederal Protective Service to provide security for seven Federal \ncourthouses including the Dirksen Courthouse in Chicago.\n  Finally, among an array of general provisions applicable government-\nwide in Title VII of Division D, the bill provides for a 3.5 percent \ncost-of-living adjustment for civilian Federal employees as included in \nboth the House-passed and Senate committee-reported bills.\n  I am frustrated that we were not able to do more and that the process \nhas been delayed, but the fiscal year 2008 funding levels we consider \nthis evening reflect America's priorities and I am pleased to support \nthe final package.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, with the Senate's passage of the Omnibus \nappropriations bill for fiscal year 2008 and H.R. 6, the Energy \nSecurity and Independence Act of 2007, the Department of Energy must \nnow finally understand that its irrational hostility toward geothermal \nenergy research and development has come to an end, pursuant to these \ntwo acts of Congress.\n  First, H.R. 6 will become law ahead of the omnibus and thereby \ncontrols the primary use and priorities for funds provided by Congress \nfollowing its enactment. As Senators may know, the United States and \nparticularly Nevada and the West have tens of thousands of megawatts of \nclean power generation potential from geothermal energy sources just \nwaiting to be developed. In title VI, H.R. 6 contains very important \nresearch and development provisions collectively referred to as the \nAdvanced Geothermal Energy Research and Development Act of 2007 that \nwill help realize that enormous potential and create significant \nsustainable economic growth in rural areas throughout America.\n  The Department must, by law, comply with the program direction \nprovided in H.R. 6. The Department staff\n\n[[Page S15888]]\n\nneed not reinvent the wheel or plead that they cannot accept or \nacknowledge statutory direction from Congress at this point in the \nfiscal year, since they have not and will not have had any conflicting \ndirection from Congress.\n  Second, the Omnibus appropriations bill requires that the Department \ncease and desist its efforts to shut down the existing geothermal \nprogram. Instead, the bill provides approximately $20 million for \ngeothermal energy technology research. This is an increase of $20 \nmillion over the budget request for the deployment of large-scale \nenhanced geothermal systems, to include accelerating the development of \nsubsurface technologies, including geological and geophysical data \ncollection and synthesis. This direction to the Department is entirely \nconsistent with that provided in H.R. 6.\n  The Congress expects the Department to use that money wisely and in a \nbalanced fashion that comports with the direction in the appropriations \nbill's statement of managers and the statutory direction provided in \nH.R. 6. Clearly, the funds should not and cannot be used to focus on \none or even a narrow set of technologies to the exclusion of the \ncontinuum of geothermal energy technologies. I also expect that next \nyear's budget request will reflect the direction given to the \nDepartment by Congress in H.R. 6.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n  Mr. LEAHY.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now \nproceed to executive session to consider Executive Calendar No. 373, \nthe nomination of John Daniel Tinder, to be United States Circuit \nJudge.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of John Daniel Tinder, of \nIndiana, to be United States Circuit Judge for the Seventh Circuit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 2 \nminutes of debate on the nomination, equally divided.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, we end the 2007 legislative session as we \nbegan it, by making significant progress confirming the President's \nnominations for lifetime appointments to the Federal bench. At the \nJudiciary Committee's first business meeting of the year, held less \nthan 2 weeks after the Republican caucus agreed to the resolutions \norganizing the Senate, I included on our agenda five judicial \nnominations. On January 30, the Senate confirmed the first two judicial \nnominations of the session. Today's confirmation of John Daniel Tinder \nto the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit will be the 40th, \nincluding 6 of this President's nominations to powerful circuit courts.\n  I thank the members of the Judiciary Committee for their hard work \nall year in considering these important nominations. I thank especially \nthose Senators who have given generously of their time to chair \nconfirmation hearings throughout the year.\n  Given the work of the Senators serving on the Judiciary Committee, we \nwill have exceeded the yearly total in each of the last 3 years when a \nRepublican majority managed the Senate and the consideration of this \nRepublican President's nominations. Indeed, with the confirmation today \nof Judge Tinder to replace Judge Daniel A. Manion, like that of Reed \nO'Connor who was confirmed last month to the Northern District, we are \nproceeding to fill vacancies before they even arise.\n  The progress we have made this year in considering and confirming \njudicial nominations is sometimes lost amid the partisan sniping over a \nhandful of controversial nominations and attempts to appeal to some on \nthe far right wing. When we confirm the nomination we consider today, \nthe Senate will have confirmed 40 nominations for lifetime appointments \nto the Federal bench this session alone. That is more than the total \nnumber of judicial nominations that a Republican-led Senate confirmed \nin all of 1996, 1997, 1999, 2000, 2004, 2005 or 2006. It is 23 more \nconfirmations than were achieved during the entire 1996 session, more \nthan double that session's total of 17, when Republicans stalled \nconsideration of President Clinton's nominations. It is seven more than \nthe confirmations in the second to last year of President Clinton's \nfinal term.\n  We continue to make progress on circuit court nominations. We began \nthe year by resolving an unnecessary controversy over Judge Norman \nRandy Smith's nomination to one of California's seats on the Ninth \nCircuit. That nomination could easily have been confirmed--and a \njudicial emergency addressed--in the last Congress had the Bush \nadministration chosen the commonsense approach of nominating Judge \nSmith, who is from Idaho, to Idaho's seat on the Ninth Circuit. After \nmany months of urging by me and others, President Bush finally did the \nright thing at the beginning of this Congress by pulling the \ncontroversial Myers nomination to Idaho's Ninth Circuit seat and \nnominating Judge Smith, instead. He was confirmed in February. We could \nmake even more progress if the President would make a California \nnomination to fill the long-vacant California Ninth Circuit seat left \nopen by Judge Stephen Trott's retirement.\n\n  We continued through the year to consider and confirm district and \ncircuit court judges. In October, the Senate confirmed the nominations \nof Judges Jennifer Walker Elrod and Judge Leslie Southwick, who became \nthe fourth and fifth circuit court nominees confirmed this year.\n  After this confirmation today, the Senate will have confirmed six \ncircuit court nominees, matching the total circuit court confirmations \nfor all of 2001. We will also have exceeded the circuit court totals \nachieved in all of 2004 when a Republican-led Senate was considering \nthis President's circuit\n\n[[Page S15889]]\n\nnominees; all of 1989; all of 1983, when a Republican-led Senate was \nconsidering President Reagan's nominees; all of 1993 when a Democratic-\nled Senate was considering President Clinton's nominees; and, of \ncourse, the entire 1996 session during which a Republican-led Senate \ndid not confirm a single one of President Clinton's circuit nominees \nthe entire session.\n  The treatment of President Clinton's nominees contrasts harshly with \nthe treatment Democrats gave the circuit court nominees of Presidents \nReagan and Bush in the Presidential election years of 1988 and 1992. In \nthose two election years, the Democratic-controlled Senate averaged \nnine circuit court confirmations. Regrettably, the Republican Senate \nreversed that course in the treatment of President Clinton's circuit \ncourt nominations, confirming an average of only four in the \nPresidential election years of 1996 and 2000, and none in the entire \n1996 session.\n  At the end of the 106th Congress, the last 2 years of the Clinton \nadministration, the Republican-led Senate returned to the President \nwithout action 17 of his appellate court nominees. I have not \nduplicated that record and I do not intend to, any more than I intend \nto see the Senate pocket filibuster more than 60 of President Bush's \njudicial nominees, as Republicans did with President Clinton's.\n  It is a little known fact that during the Bush Presidency, more \ncircuit judges, more district judges--more total judges--were confirmed \nin the first 24 months that I served as Judiciary chairman than during \nthe 2-year tenures of either of the two Republican chairmen working \nwith Republican Senate majorities.\n  I continue to try to find ways to make progress. Last month, I sent \nthe President a letter urging him to work with me, Senator Specter, and \nhome State Senators to send us more well-qualified, consensus \nnominations. Now is the time for him to send us more nominations that \ncould be considered and confirmed as his Presidency approaches its last \nyear, before the Thurmond Rule kicks in.\n  As I noted in that letter, I have been concerned that several recent \nnominations seem to be part of an effort to pick political fights \nrather than judges to fill vacancies. For example, President Bush \nnominated Duncan Getchell to one of Virginia's Fourth Circuit vacancies \nover the objections of Senators Warner and Webb, one a Republican and \none a Democrat.\n  They had submitted a list of five recommended nominations, and \nspecifically warned the White House not to nominate Mr. Getchell. As a \nresult, this nomination that is opposed by Democratic and Republican \nhome-state Senators is one that cannot move.\n  The Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts will list 43 judicial \nvacancies and 14 circuit court vacancies after today's confirmations. \nCompare that to the numbers at the end of the 109th Congress, when the \ntotal vacancies under a Republican controlled Judiciary Committee were \n51 judicial vacancies and 15 circuit court vacancies. That means that \ndespite the additional 5 vacancies that arose at the beginning of the \n110th Congress, the current vacancy totals under my chairmanship of the \nJudiciary Committee are below where they were under a Republican led-\nJudiciary Committee.\n  The President has sent us 27 nominations for these remaining \nvacancies. Sixteen of these vacancies--more than one third--have no \nnominee. Of the 17 vacancies deemed by the Administrative Office to be \njudicial emergencies, the President has yet to send us nominees for 7, \nnearly half of them. If the President would decide to work with the \nSenators from Michigan, Rhode Island, Maryland, California, New Jersey, \nand Virginia, we could be in position to make even more progress.\n  Of the 16 vacancies without any nominee, the President has violated \nthe timeline he set for himself at least 11 times--11 have been vacant \nwithout so much as a nominee for more than 180 days. The number of \nviolations may in fact be much higher since the President said he would \nnominate within 180 days of receiving notice that there would be a \nvacancy or intended retirement rather than from the vacancy itself. We \nconservatively estimate that he also violated his own rule 15 times in \nconnection with the nominations he has made. That would mean that with \nrespect to the 43 vacancies, the President is out of compliance with \nhis own rule more than half of the time.\n  We have succeeded in dramatically lowering vacancies and, in \nparticular, circuit court vacancies. We have helped cut the circuit \nvacancies from a high water mark of 32 in the early days of this \nadministration to as low as 13 this year. Contrast that with the \nRepublican-led Senate's lack of action on President Clinton's moderate \nand qualified nominees that resulted in increasing circuit vacancies \nduring the Clinton years from 17 when he was inaugurated to 26 at the \nend of his term. During those years, the Republican-led Senate engaged \nin strenuous and successful efforts under the radar to keep circuit \njudgeships vacant in anticipation of a Republican President. More than \n60 percent of current circuit court judges were appointed by Republican \nPresidents, with the current President having appointed more than 30 \npercent of the active circuit judges already.\n  The American people expect the Federal courts to be fair forums where \njustice is dispensed without favor to the right or the left. I have set \nout since the beginning of this Congress to do all that I can to ensure \nthat the Federal judiciary remains independent and able to provide \njustice to all Americans. These are the only lifetime appointments in \nour entire government, and they matter. I will continue in the 2008 \nsession to work with Senators from both sides of the aisle as I have in \nthe 2007 session.\n  John Daniel Tinder has a decade of service as a District Court Judge \nfor the Southern District of Indiana. Before his tenure on the bench, \nhe worked for 7 years at the Justice Department as U.S. Attorney and \nAssistant U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Indiana. He has \nworked in private practice and has experience as a county prosecutor \nand county public defender. His nomination has the support of both home \nState Senators. I acknowledge the support of Senators Lugar and Bayh, \nand want to thank Senator Durbin for chairing the hearing on this \nnomination.\n  While I support Judge Tinder's confirmation, I am concerned about his \nanswer to a question I sent him on the legal significance of \nPresidential signing statements. I asked Judge Tinder if an alleged \nviolation of the law prohibiting cruel, inhuman, and degrading conduct \nby American personnel were to come before a court, would it be \nappropriate for that court to consider the President's signing \nstatement as legislative history, in addition to the text of law \nitself. I am troubled by Judge Tinder's answer that he is open to \nlooking at signing statements as a tool for determining the meaning of \na statute.\n  Throughout the country's history, Presidents used signing statements \nfor limited purposes, such as explaining to the public the likely \neffects of legislation or providing direction to administrative \nagencies within the Executive Branch. It has long been considered out \nof bounds for any President to use signing statements--which are at \nmost post-passage remarks--for the more expansive and controversial \npurpose of creating legislative history that our courts would be \nexpected to follow. Legislative history is created within the Congress, \nwhich is charged by the Constitution with considering and passing laws. \nThe President may veto legislation, but the constitutional system of \nchecks and balances does not allow the President to speak for Congress.\n  The Nation stands at a pivotal moment in history, where Americans are \nfaced with a President who makes sweeping claims for almost unchecked \nExecutive power. This President has used signing statements to \nchallenge laws banning torture, laws on affirmative action, and laws \nthat prohibit the censorship of scientific data. When the President \nuses signing statements to unilaterally rewrite laws enacted by \nCongress, he undermines the rule of law and our constitutional checks \nand balances. It is incumbent upon the Federal judiciary, to safeguard \nand protect the constitutional balance when necessary.\n  I hope that Judge Tinder will fulfill his oath and be an independent \nbuffer against constitutional overreaching. I congratulate the nominee \nand his family on his confirmation today.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I appreciate this opportunity to support \nthe\n\n[[Page S15890]]\n\nPresident's nomination of Judge John Daniel Tinder to serve as a United \nStates Circuit Judge for the Seventh Circuit.\n  I would first like to thank Senate Judiciary Chairman Pat Leahy, \nRanking Member Arlen Specter, the respective Leaders, and Senator Bayh \nfor their important work to facilitate timely consideration of this \nnomination.\n  Late last year, Circuit Judge Dan Manion informed me of his decision \nto assume senior status after a distinguished career of public service. \nGiven this upcoming vacancy and the need for continued strong \nleadership, I was pleased to join with my colleague Evan Bayh in \ncommending John Tinder to President Bush. This selection was a product \nof a bipartisan process and reflective of the importance of finding \nhighly qualified Federal judges to carry forward the tradition of fair, \nprincipled, and collegial leadership.\n  As the Founders observed when our Constitution was drafted, few \npersons ``will have sufficient skill in the laws to qualify them for \nthe stations of judges,'' and ``the number must be still smaller of \nthose who unite the requisite integrity with the requisite knowledge.'' \nJudge Tinder embodies the rare combination that the Framers envisioned.\n  I have known John for many years and I have always been impressed \nwith his high energy, resolute integrity, and remarkable dedication to \npublic service.\n  John graduated with honors from Indiana University while earning his \nBachelor's degree and then later graduated from Indiana University \nSchool of Law in Bloomington.\n  John served in a variety of critical legal roles early in his career \nwhich helped to shape his strong litigation background and experience. \nAmong many legal positions, he has served as an assistant United States \nAttorney, a public defender, chief trial deputy in the county \nprosecutor's office and as a partner in private practice.\n  Given his broad experience and great abilities, John was a natural \nselection to serve as United States Attorney for the Southern District. \nAfter 3 years of active and distinguished service, John was then tapped \nagain by President Reagan to serve as United States District Court \nJudge for Southern Indiana where he has served since 1987. In 20 years \non the bench, he has presided over more than 200 jury trials in this \ndistrict. His decisions are well known to be clear, well-reasoned, and \nthorough while applying appropriate precedents to the facts in each \ncase. He is fully aware of the importance of appellate court decisions \nand their impact on the trial courts.\n  Throughout John's career, his reputation for personal courtesy, \nfairness, decency and integrity was equally well-earned and widespread \namong colleagues and opposing counsel alike and on both sides of the \npolitical aisle. The Senate has already unanimously confirmed him \ntwice, and it is not surprising that news of his Circuit Court \nnomination has been well received by stakeholders in the legal \ncommunity and the public.\n  I am also pleased that John's experience and professionalism were \nrecognized by the American Bar Association which bestowed their highest \nrating of ``well qualified'' for his nomination.\n  I would again like to thank Chairman Leahy and Ranking Member Specter \nfor their important work on this nomination. I believe that Judge \nTinder will demonstrate remarkable leadership and will appropriately \nuphold and defend our laws under the Constitution.\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, this past spring, Senator Lugar and I made a \njoint recommendation to President Bush to nominate Judge John Tinder \nfor a seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, the \nsecond highest court in the land. President Bush followed our advice, \nthe Judiciary Committee unanimously approved his nomination, and today \nI am pleased to announce that the Senate will vote on Judge Tinder's \nnomination.\n  I take very seriously the Senate's constitutional duty to provide \nadvice and consent for all judicial nominees. The Senate shares a \nresponsibility with the President to ensure that the judiciary is \nstaffed with men and women who possess outstanding legal skills, \nsuitable temperament, and the highest ethical standing.\n  I regret, however, that the process for confirming judicial nominees \nhas become too partisan in recent years and has produced too many \ncontroversial nominees.\n  I have worked hard with my friend and colleague, Senator Lugar, to \nrestore civility in Washington and to end the politics of personal \ndestruction. We have worked closely together to build consensus and \nmove forward in a responsible way to address the challenges that face \nthe American people.\n  John Tinder is the embodiment of good judicial temperament, intellect \nand evenhandedness. He has been praised from both sides of the \npolitical spectrum for his service in the Southern District of Indiana, \nand I am confident he will receive those kinds of reviews, as well, on \nthe Seventh Circuit.\n  I have known John for 20 years. Judge Tinder was born in Indiana, \nwent to law school in Indiana, and has spent his entire legal career in \nIndiana, where he and his wife Jan currently reside. Judge Tinder is a \nHoosier through and through.\n  At only 57, Judge Tinder has had a distinguished legal career that \nwould make most lawyers envious. Judge Tinder has served as a Federal \ndistrict court judge, Federal and local prosecutor, public defender, \nadjunct professor, and private practitioner. In 1984, at 34 years of \nage, he was nominated by President Reagan to become the U.S. attorney \nfor the Southern District of Indiana. Three years later, Reagan \nnominated him to become a Federal judge. With over 30 years of \nexperience, Judge Tinder has already practiced on both sides of the \nbench in the Seventh Circuit, arguing cases before it as an assistant \nU.S. attorney and presiding by designation in 12 cases. Overall, he has \npresided over 750 trials and has published over 700 opinions.\n  By all accounts, Judge Tinder is a good, smart, honest judge, who is \nhighly experienced and capable. Judge Tinder has received the highest \npossible rating from the ABA.\n  If we had more nominees like John Tinder, we would have less fighting \naround this place. He is a good judge, he is a good lawyer, he is \nthoughtful, and he is nonpartisan. I hope that going forward, perhaps, \nothers of a similar mold will come before us so that we can do our duty \nwith less acrimony.\n  Judge Tinder enjoys my whole-support, and I ask my Senate colleagues \nto confirm Judge Tinder to the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, with this nomination, I note we have \nconfirmed more in this session of the Senate--of President Bush's \njudges--than the total number of judicial nominations the Republicans \nconfirmed in all of 1996, 1997, 1999, 2000, 2004, 2005, and 2006.

Mr. President, as the Senate finishes its business for the \nyear, it is my privilege to rise today in recognition of the 50th \nanniversary of the Orvis School of Nursing at the University of Nevada, \nan important part of Nevada's health care community.\n  The beginnings of the Orvis School are humble. During a brief \nhospitalization in Reno, Arthur Orvis, a stockbroker and Nevada \nresident, noticed the lack of student nurses and began to wonder about \nthe educational opportunities for health care providers in Nevada. On \nDecember 15, 1955, in a letter to University President Minard W. Stout, \nOrvis wrote, `` I desire to give $100,000 to the University of Nevada \nfor the establishment of a department to be known as the `Orvis School \nof Nursing.' This is a free will offering with no strings attached.''\n  As a result of this generosity, the Orvis School of Nursing was \nfounded by Arthur and Mae Orvis at the University of Nevada in 1957. \nWhen the Orvis School opened its doors in the fall of that year, there \nwere 12 students and 5 faculty members. Unusual for the time period, \nthe Orvis School's first class was very diverse, including one African-\nAmerican student, one male student, one Asian-American student, and \nnine white female students.\n  The Orvis School of Nursing has come a long way from that first class \nof 12 students. Today, a wide group of students attend a world-class \ninstitution that offers the highest quality of nursing education. While \ntraditional nursing programs focus only on hospital nursing, the Orvis \nSchool is distinctive in that it offers a bachelor's of science degree \nin nursing, emphasizing nursing leadership, community health, and \nnursing research. I confidently believe that this unique focus will \nlead to greater innovations and ideas for the future of health care.\n  In closing, I extend my most sincere gratitude to the Orvis School of \nNursing, its alumni, and greater community. Nevadans are fortunate to \nhave such a talented and skilled institution in our State.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/18/senate-section/article/S15891-4", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15891]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            GLOBAL HIV/AIDS\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise in recognition of World AIDS Day, \nwhich millions around the globe commemorated on December 1. Although \nthis event will be a recent memory as the new year begins, it is my \nhope that its purpose will be reflected in our thoughts and actions \nthroughout 2008 and beyond.\n  World AIDS Day is a solemn opportunity to remember that HIV/AIDS \ncontinues to wreak havoc on individuals, families, and communities \naround the globe. Although the new estimates on HIV prevalence is good \nnews, we cannot forget that AIDS is still a leading cause of death. \nMore than 5,700 lives are taken by this disease every day, many just at \na time when they are attending school, raising children, or \ncontributing to society as productive adults. At the same time, nearly \n7,000 people become infected every day, meaning that as 2.5 million \nmore people--about as many people in my home state of Nevada--will face \nthe start of the new year with HIV/AIDS. More than 30 million globally \nare already living with HIV/AIDS today.\n  In Nevada, the number of HIV and AIDS cases diagnosed each year since \n2000 is on the upward trend, and AIDS rates continue to \ndisproportionately impact ethnic and racial minorities. Our State also \nranks 14th in the Nation for the rate of adolescents and adults living \nwith AIDS. As a Nevadan, as well as a Member of Congress, I know that \nmore must be done to tackle the epidemic at home and abroad.\n  In Congress, we must continue to support international AIDS relief \nprograms like PEPFAR and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, \nand Malaria. It should be a priority to fund vital programs that fight \nHIV/AIDS domestically as well, especially the Ryan White Care Act and \nthe National Family Planning Program, which works to prevent the spread \nof HIV/AIDS and other diseases. Medicaid in particular is a lifeline \nfor vulnerable HIV/AIDS patients who would otherwise have no other \nmeans of receiving the care they need.\n  In giving recognition to the human toll of the HIV/AIDS global \nepidemic, let us also heed the resulting call to action. From \nsupporting prevention to treatment, individual remembrance to public \nawareness, let us all keep working together to ensure that the goals of \nWorld AIDS Day will soon become reality.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/18/senate-section/article/S15891-5", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15891-S15892]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 DARFUR\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I have repeatedly come to the floor to \nspeak\n\n[[Page S15892]]\n\nabout one of the worst human tragedies in recent memory--the crisis in \nDarfur.\n  For 4 long years the world has watched as thousands of innocent \nvictims have been murdered, tortured, and raped--their villages burned, \ntheir livelihoods stolen. More than 2 million people have been chased \nfrom their homes--many trapped in dangerous refugee camps for almost 5 \nyears.\n  Many of us on both sides of the aisle and in the international \ncommunity have repeatedly called for greater U.S. and global action. \nPresident Bush has rightly called the situation in Darfur genocide. \nBritish Prime Minister Gordon Brown has said, ``Darfur is the greatest \nhumanitarian crisis the world faces today.''\n  And U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon has made ending the crisis one \nof his top priorities.\n  His efforts and those of many others led to 2 promising breakthroughs \nearlier this year.\n  First, the various parties agreed to start peace talks. With more and \nmore rebel groups involved in the violence, a long-term political \nsettlement will be vital in bringing stability to the region.\n  Second, the U.N. Security Council voted to deploy a 26,000-member \npeacekeeping force to bring the ongoing carnage to an end and help \ncreate an atmosphere for such negotiations.\n  Under pressure from the international community, the Sudanese \ngovernment--notorious for its delays, denials, and obstruction--\ngrudgingly accepted this new force.\n  Despite these assurances, we had many reasons to be skeptical of the \nregime's true intentions.\n  For example, Sudan has appointed its own former minister of interior, \nMr. Ahmed Harun, to lead a committee to investigate human rights abuses \nand also to help oversee the deployment of the peacekeeping force.\n  Mr. Harun is wanted by the International Criminal Court for war \ncrimes.\n  As interior minister, Mr. Harun helped fund, recruit, and arm the \nJanjaweed militia which was directly involved in perpetuating the \ngenocide in Darfur.\n  Mr. Harun's place in on trial in The Hague, not investigating \nviolence he helped perpetuate.\n  Equally troubling are the continued attacks on international aid \nworkers, fissures in the peace agreement between North and South Sudan, \nand continued violence in Darfur.\n  While the Khartoum government thumbs its nose at the international \ncommunity, thousands of innocent victims remain trapped in sprawling \nrefugee camps--their lives horribly uprooted, their families \ntraumatized with fear and dislocation.\n  And now, tragically, it appears that the Sudanese government was \nnever serious about the U.N. peacekeeping force. With only 3 weeks \nuntil the deployment is scheduled to begin the Sudanese government is \nback to its old tricks.\n  A few weeks ago, the U.N.'s top peacekeeping official, Jean-Marie \nGuehenno, told the Security Council that obstacles created by the \nSudanese Government were jeopardizing the deployment of the new \npeacekeeping force.\n  In particular, Sudan is now objecting to the deployment of non-\nAfrican peacekeepers.\n  Sudan's obstruction is madness and must not be tolerated.\n  In fact, 13 former world leaders and current activists, including \nformer President Jimmy Carter, former U.N. Secretary General Kofi \nAnnan, Bangladeshi microfinance champion Muhammed Yunus, and Archbishop \nDesmond Tutu have called for the immediate deployment of the \npeacekeeping force.\n  This group of ``Elders'' noted in a recent report that the residents \nof Darfur, as well as Sudanese elsewhere, are desperate for the \npeacekeepers to arrive.\n  The stakes are too high and the humanitarian crisis has dragged on \ntoo long to allow any further backsliding by the Sudanese Government.\n  That is why I believe it is time to increase the pressure on the \nSudanese Government.\n  Earlier this year I introduced 2 versions of legislation that would \nincrease economic pressure on the Sudanese regime. Each of those bills \nsupported state and local divestment efforts, and therefore would allow \neach of us to do our part to end the madness in Darfur by selling off \nany investments in companies that support the Sudanese regime.\n  I am pleased that Senator Dodd, as chairman of the Banking Committee, \nadopted ideas from these bills into the Sudan Accountability and \nDivestment Act of 2007--a bill the Senate passed last week and the \nHouse just moments ago passed by a unanimous vote of 411 to 0.\n  I thank him, as well as Ranking Member Shelby and others who have \nworked on this bill--especially Senators Cornyn and Brownback, who \njoined me as lead sponsors of the legislation I originally introduced.\n  I hope Congress's support for this bill sends the Government of Sudan \nan important message--that its brazen delays and obstruction of an \ninternationally sanctioned peacekeeping force in Darfur can no longer \nbe tolerated.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/18/senate-section/article/S15892-1", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15892]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               CONGRATULATING OLIVET NAZARENE UNIVERSITY\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate Olivet \nNazarene University on its 100th-year anniversary.\n  Olivet Nazarene University was founded by a group of families led by \nEdward Richards and Orla Nesbitt in 1907, first as a grade school and \nlater as a liberal arts college. From humble beginnings, the university \nhas endured bankruptcy, fire, a change of location to Bourbonnais, and \ntornado devastation to become the fine institution of higher learning \nthat it is today. Olivet Nazarene University has grown as a liberal \narts institution, with additional locations now throughout the greater \nChicago area and in Hong Kong.\n  The university also has the distinction of serving as the summer home \nof the Chicago Bears. Olivet has hosted the NFL team for its training \ncamp since 2002.\n  Currently, 4,400 undergraduate and postgraduate students attend the \nuniversity. Olivet Nazarene offers these students 100 undergraduate \nfields of study, nearly 20 master's degrees, nontraditional adult \ndegree completion programs, and a doctor of education in ethical \nleadership.\n  Olivet Nazarene University has graduated many notable alumni who have \ngiven back to the university, the State of Illinois, and this country \nin significant ways. An estimated 30,000 Olivet Nazarene University \nalumni live and work around the world, including Georgia Southwestern \nState University president Kendall A. Blanchard and Ticketmaster \ncofounder Cecil Crawford.\n  Olivet Nazarene University sets a standard of affordable excellence, \nwith a cost below average for private colleges nationwide. \nApproximately 96 percent of traditional undergraduates receive a total \nof $24.9 million in scholarships and grants.\n  I congratulate Olivet Nazarene University, its president, Dr. John C. \nBowling, and all the staff on 100 years of service to their students \nand alumni, the State of Illinois, and our Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/18/senate-section/article/S15892-2", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15892-S15893]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          FARM BILL CONFERENCE\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I want to speak about an issue that may \ncome up during the negotiations between the House and the Senate to \nreconcile the farm bill.\n  The bill we passed last week in the Senate included a sense-of-the-\nSenate resolution addressing trade in sweeteners between parties to the \nNorth American Free Trade Agreement, also known as NAFTA.\n  Apparently, some view this language as just a placeholder for new \nlanguage that will be inserted in conference.\n  Even more troubling, the new language that is being contemplated \nwould call for managed trade in sweeteners between the United States \nand Mexico.\n  The issue of trade in sweeteners between the United States and Mexico \nhas a long history.\n  For years, Mexico put up barrier after barrier to our exports of high \nfructose corn syrup.\n  It started in 1998. That year, Mexico imposed an antidumping duty \norder on imports of high fructose corn syrup from the United States.\n\n[[Page S15893]]\n\n  We challenged that order, and we won. In 2001, a dispute resolution \npanel determined that Mexico was out of compliance with its obligations \nunder NAFTA.\n  The appellate body of the World Trade Organization reached a similar \nconclusion.\n  The antidumping duty order on our high fructose corn syrup was \ninconsistent with Mexico's obligations under the WTO.\n  Mexico finally lifted its antidumping duties in 2002. But that same \nyear, Mexico imposed a 20 percent tax on soft drinks flavored with high \nfructose corn syrup.\n  This soda tax was designed specifically to discriminate against high \nfructose corn syrup imported from the United States.\n  As a result of this unfair discrimination, our exports of high \nfructose corn syrup to Mexico fell dramatically.\n  We challenged Mexico's discriminatory tax at the World Trade \nOrganization.\n  In 2006, the appellate body determined that this tax was inconsistent \nwith Mexico's obligations under the WTO.\n  Mexico complied with the WTO decision earlier this year by repealing \nits discriminatory soda tax.\n  Now, after years of pressuring Mexico to drop its unfair barriers to \nour exports of high fructose syrup, we're finally at a good spot.\n  Mexico has eliminated both its antidumping duty order and its \ndiscriminatory tax.\n  We are on the verge of seeing high fructose corn syrup start to flow \nfreely across our border.\n  Starting January 1, 2008, Mexico is obligated to provide duty-free \naccess to our exports of high fructose corn syrup under NAFTA.\n  That is why I am so concerned. This new language being contemplated \nfor the farm bill could disrupt our legitimate expectations of free \ntrade in high fructose corn syrup next year.\n  If instead of free trade we end up with managed trade, it could \nsignificantly impede our exports of high fructose corn syrup to Mexico.\n  Under a managed trade regime, we would presumably limit the amount of \nsugar that we import from Mexico.\n  And in response, Mexico would presumably limit imports of high \nfructose corn syrup from the United States.\n  Simply put, managed trade could reverse all the gains we have made \nover the years to get Mexico to take our high fructose corn syrup.\n  Corn farmers and high fructose corn syrup producers in Iowa and other \nStates would, of course, be harmed by any import restrictions imposed \nby Mexico as a result of managed trade.\n  And managed trade could well result in Mexico further violating its \nobligations under NAFTA.\n  Many of my colleagues complain, legitimately, when our trading \npartners fail to comply with their international trade obligations.\n  The last thing we should do is give Mexico an excuse to violate its \nNAFTA obligations, particularly when it would harm U.S. agricultural \nproducers.\n  The current language in the Senate-passed bill does not call for \nmanaged trade.\n  The current language would not likely induce Mexico to impose further \nrestrictions on our exports of high fructose corn syrup.\n  As a Senator from Iowa, as well as the ranking member of the Senate \nFinance Committee and a member of the Committee on Agriculture, I have \nworked hard over the years to get a fair deal for agriculture when it \ncomes to international trade.\n  In particular, I have put considerable effort into opening foreign \nmarkets to our exports of agricultural products.\n  Too often our trading partners have imposed barriers to U.S. farm \nexports. And too often those barriers are in violation of international \ntrade obligations.\n  Those barriers harm American farmers and agricultural producers.\n  Whether it is unfair restrictions on U.S. beef exports to Japan and \nKorea, or under restrictions on U.S. corn exports to Europe, it is \nimperative that we focus our efforts to remove barriers to trade.\n  With effort, we have been successful in getting our trading partners \nto remove such barriers.\n  That is the case with Mexico's treatment of high fructose corn syrup, \nas I have described.\n  We can't go backwards.\n  Our corn farmers and our producers of high fructose corn syrup are \ncounting on us.\n  I will be working hard to see that the current language on trade in \nsweeteners is retained without change in the conference report to the \nfarm bill.\n  Free trade in high fructose corn syrup with Mexico is long overdue.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/18/senate-section/article/S15893-1", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15893]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   FURTHER CHANGES TO S.

Res. 21, the \n2008 budget resolution, permits the chairman of the Senate Budget \nCommittee to adjust the section 207(b) discretionary spending limits \nand allocations pursuant to section 302(a) of the Congressional Budget \nAct of 1974 for legislation reported by the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee that provides a certain level of funding for fiscal year 2008 \nfor four program integrity initiatives. The initiatives are continuing \ndisability reviews and supplemental security income redeterminations, \nInternal Revenue Service tax enforcement, health care fraud and abuse \ncontrol, and unemployment insurance improper payment reviews.\n  On July 23, 2007, I revised both the discretionary spending limits \nand the allocation to the Senate Appropriations Committee for \ndiscretionary budget authority and outlays to reflect that the \ncommittee had reported legislation that met the conditions of 207(c) \nfor the four program integrity initiatives. The total amount of that \nadjustment was an additional $1,042 million in budget authority and \n$699 million in outlays for fiscal year 2008.\n  The level of funding provided for each of the program integrity \ninitiatives in H.R. 2764, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008, \nhowever, is lower than the levels mandated by section 207(c). \nConsequently, I am reversing the adjustments made on July 23, 2007, to \nboth the discretionary spending limits and the allocation to the Senate \nAppropriations Committee for discretionary budget authority and \noutlays.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have the following revisions to S.

Section 301 authorizes the revisions provided \nthat certain conditions are met, including that such legislation \nmaintains coverage for those currently enrolled in SCHIP and that it \nnot worsen the deficit over the period of the total of fiscal years \n2007 through 2012 or the period of the total of fiscal years 2007 \nthrough 2017.\n  In addition, section 304(b)(2) of S. Con. Res. 21 permits the \nchairman of the Senate Budget Committee to revise the allocations, \naggregates, and other appropriate levels for legislation that both \nincreases the reimbursement rate for physician services under section\n\n[[Page S15894]]\n\n1848(d) of the Social Security Act and includes financial incentives \nfor physicians to improve the quality and efficiency of items and \nservices furnished to Medicare beneficiaries through the use of \nconsensus-based quality measures.

Con. Res. 21 permits the chairman of \nthe Senate Budget Committee to revise the allocations, aggregates, and \nother appropriate levels for legislation that provides for a delay in \nthe implementation of the proposed rule published on January 18, 2007, \non pages 2236 through 2248 of volume 72, Federal Register, or any other \nrule that would affect the Medicaid program or SCHIP in a similar \nmanner, or place restrictions on coverage of or payment for graduate \nmedical education, rehabilitation services, or school-based \nadministration, transportation, or medical services under title XIX of \nthe Social Security Act. The adjustment is contingent on such \nlegislation not worsening the deficit over the period of the total of \nfiscal years 2007 through 2012 or the period of the total of fiscal \nyears 2007 through 2017.\n  Finally, section 320(c) of S.

Mr. President, I wish to address the issue of what is \ncommonly referred to as the Medicare ``doctor fix.'' Unless Congress \nacts, there will be a 10-percent reduction to Medicare reimbursement \nrates in the coming year; putting good doctors further at odds with \nMedicare payments for their service.\n  This is a problem that not only affects patients with Medicare but \nalso our military veterans, many of whom rely on Medicare as their \nprimary health care provider.\n  Delaying the issue will put our veterans relying--on Tricare until \nthe age of 65 and Medicare after retirement--at increased risk of \nadditional health problems if their ability to see a doctor remains in \nquestion.\n  If not addressed, millions of Americans could be denied immediate \naccess to treatment when they need it most. It would also put an even \ngreater strain on doctors, who are already forced to be selective in \ndetermining which Medicare patients they can treat.\n  This is a choice no doctor should have to make, and our seniors and \ndoctors deserve better. We have the opportunity to act before we leave \nin the coming days, and I urge my colleagues to consider the \nconsequences that would result from an additional cut to the program.\n  In my home State of Florida, the dilemma has reached a critical mass, \nwith an increasing number of doctors leaving the program--refusing to \ncontinue treating a very vulnerable population. All because the \nbureaucracy is too much and reimbursement is too low.\n  These are doctors that play important roles in treating seniors in \ntheir communities. These are doctors like Dr. Troy Tippett, a \nneurosurgeon in Pensacola, who is often faced with the choice of \ncontinuing to treat Medicare patients at a loss or refuse them because \nof declining reimbursements from Medicare.\n  Dr. Tippett was so worried about the threat of further cuts to the \nMedicare reimbursements he receives, he recently called to let me know \nthe detrimental impact the declining reimbursement rate would have on \nhis ability to continue treating Medicare patients.\n  I hope for the sake of good doctors like Dr. Tippett we can develop a \ncomprehensive, long-term solution that fixes this problem once and for \nall.\n  This is a problem, I believe, that we must fix soon, rather than \nkicking the can down the road and hoping the next Congress will provide \nan answer to the more than 40-million Medicare patients. But today, we \ncan do our part by opposing a cut to the broken payment system that \npenalizes our doctors for treating Medicare patients.\n  We owe it to the people who have worked so hard in life and need \nquality care now more than ever. We also owe it to the doctors who \ntreat them on a regular basis.\n  I urge my colleagues to support fixing the reimbursement rate that so \nmany doctors in my State--and around the country--depend on, especially \nin the face of rising medical costs and skyrocketing medical \nmalpractice insurance premiums.\n  It is my understanding that we are very close to coming to agreement \non a doctor fix and that floor action could occur very soon. I am \nhopeful we will have the opportunity to approve that fix. We must act \nbecause our physicians and their patients are counting on us.\n  And while I am pleased we are about to address the problem--let's not \nmake the mistake of leaving it as a short-term fix. The American people \ndeserve a long-term solution. I look forward to coming back next year \nand working on a permanent ``doctor fix.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/18/senate-section/article/S15895-2", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15895]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              RENEWABLE CONSUMER AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY ACT\n\n  Mr. INOUYE.

Mr. President, this chamber approved the fiscal year \n2008 National Defense Authorization Act. I am particularly pleased with \nthe inclusion of an important provision contained in section 846 of the \nlegislation to modernize the whistleblower protections afforded to \ndefense contractor employees. At a time when reports of fraud, waste, \nand abuse in defense contracts are rampant, it is absolutely vital that \nwe have in place the types of whistleblower protections for contractor \nemployees that I will empower them in reporting such abuse and \ntherefore will protect those who wish to protect American I taxpayer \ndollars.\n  I would like to thank Senator Collins for working with me on this \nimportant provision and further thank Senators Levin and McCain for \ntheir leadership and stewardship of this provision through the Senate \nand conference-considerations of the Defense Authorization Act.\n  I come to the floor, however, to make one explanatory clarification \nas to the final language of this amendment because I think it critical \nthat the record be clear as to the intent of the Congress. Last year in \nGarcetti v. Ceballos, the Supreme Court canceled constitutional \nprotection for speech made within the normal course of an employee's \nexecution of his or her job duties, specifically because those \ndisclosures are covered by other whistleblower statutes. There should \nbe absolutely no confusion that the Congress believes that the logic \nand holding of Garcetti is inapplicable to the defense contractor \nwhistleblower protection statute, 10 U.S.C. 2409, as amended by section \n846 of this act.\n  Disclosures taken to carry out job responsibilities, within the \nnormal course of an employee's duties, are protected by this provision \nfor three core reasons. First, they are essential preliminary steps for \na responsible disclosure to the government. Second, often they in fact \nare indirect disclosures to Government inspectors, auditors, and \ninvestigators who must study associated internal corporate records to \nengage in informed oversight. Third, the purpose of whistleblower \nstatutes is to reduce waste. But waste would be maximized if employees \nhad to avoid their own organizations and go straight to the Government \nin order to avoid waiving their whistleblower rights. The law's goal is \nmaximized by employees being empowered to safely\n\n[[Page S15896]]\n\nwork within their employment structure, as a first step, so contractors \ncan clean their own houses. Any reading that would exclude disclosures \nwithin an employee's internal chain or command would simply be an \nillogical, exceedingly narrow reading of the statute. Congress fully \nintends the employee protections, as amended, to be interpreted to \ninclude disclosures within the employee's company.\n  I thank my fellow Senators for joining Senator Collins and me in our \nefforts to protect whistleblowers and provide greater contractor \naccountability and oversight.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/18/senate-section/article/S15896-1", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15896]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              LOOP FUNDING\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI.

Mr. President, I would like my colleagues to be aware of an \nimportant letter signed by 45 State attorneys general expressing \n``grave concerns'' about Representative Barney Frank's Internet \nGambling Regulation and Enforcement Act, H.R. 2046.\n  The State attorneys general note that the recently enacted Unlawful \nInternet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006 has ``effectively driven many \nillicit gambling operators from the American marketplace.'' The Frank \nbill ``proposes to do the opposite, by replacing state regulations with \na federal licensing program that would permit Internet gambling \ncompanies to do business with U.S. customers.'' The letter continues:\n\n       A federal license would supersede any state enforcement \n     action, because Sec.  5387 in H.R. 2046 would grant an \n     affirmative defense against any prosecution or enforcement \n     action under any Federal or State law to any person who \n     possesses a valid license and complies with the requirements \n     of H.R. 2046. This divestment of state gambling enforcement \n     power is sweeping and unprecedented.\n\n  One final but very important point from the letter is the impact of \nthe so-called ``opt-out'' provisions. Specifically, the letter reads:\n\n       [T]he opt-outs may prove illusory. They will likely be \n     challenged before the World Trade Organization. The World \n     Trade Organization has already shown itself to be hostile to \n     U.S. restrictions on Internet gambling. If it strikes down \n     state opt-outs as unduly restrictive of trade, the way will \n     be open to the greatest expansion of legalized gambling in \n     American history and near total preemption of State laws \n     restricting Internet gambling.\n\n  The Frank bill is unacceptable to the State attorneys general and it \nought to be unacceptable to Members of Congress as well. I urge my \ncolleagues to oppose the Frank bill or any similar proposals that would \ncreate a permissive Federal licensing scheme for Internet gambling.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the letter from \nthe National Association of Attorneys General.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                           National Association of\n\n\n                                            Attorneys General,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 30, 2007.\n     Hon.

John Boehner,\n     Minority Leader,\n     House of Representatives.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate.\n       To the Leadership of the U.S. House of Representatives and \n     Senate:\n       We, the Attorneys General of our respective States, have \n     grave concerns about H.R. 2046, the ``Internet Gambling \n     Regulation and Enforcement Act of 2007.'' We believe that the \n     bill would undermine States' traditional powers to make and \n     enforce their own gambling laws.\n       On March 21, 2006, 49 NAAG members wrote to the leadership \n     of Congress:\n       ``We encourage the United States Congress to help combat \n     the skirting of state gambling regulations by enacting \n     legislation which would address Internet gambling, while at \n     the same time ensuring that the authority to set overall \n     gambling regulations and policy remains where it has \n     traditionally been most effective: at the state level.''\n       Congress responded by enacting the Unlawful Internet \n     Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006 (UIGEA), which has \n     effectively driven many illicit gambling operators from the \n     American marketplace.\n       But now, less than a year later, H.R. 2046 proposes to do \n     the opposite, by replacing state regulations with a federal \n     licensing program that would permit Internet gambling \n     companies to do business with U.S. customers. The Department \n     of the Treasury would alone decide who would receive federal \n     licenses and whether the licensees were complying with their \n     terms. This would represent the first time in history that \n     the federal government would be responsible for issuing \n     gambling licenses.\n       A federal license would supersede any state enforcement \n     action, because Sec. 5387 in H.R. 2046 would grant an \n     affirmative defense against any prosecution or enforcement \n     action under any Federal or State law to any person who \n     possesses a valid license and complies with the requirements \n     of H.R. 2046. This divestment of state gambling enforcement \n     power is sweeping and unprecedented.\n       The bill would legalize Internet gambling in each State, \n     unless the Governor clearly specifies existing state \n     restrictions barring Internet gambling in whole or in part. \n     On that basis, a State may ``opt out'' of legalization for \n     all Internet gambling or certain types of gambling. However, \n     the opt-out for types of gambling does not clearly preserve \n     the right of States to place conditions on legal types of \n     gambling. Thus, for example, if the State permits poker in \n     licensed card rooms, but only between 10 a.m. and midnight, \n     and the amount wagered cannot exceed $100 per day and the \n     participants must be 21 or older, the federal law might \n     nevertheless allow 18-year-olds in that State to wager much \n     larger amounts on poker around the clock.\n       Furthermore, the opt-outs may prove illusory. They will \n     likely be challenged before the World Trade Organization. The \n     World Trade Organization has already shown itself to be \n     hostile to U.S. restrictions on Internet gambling. If it \n     strikes down state opt-outs as unduly restrictive of trade, \n     the way will be open to the greatest expansion of legalized \n     gambling in American history and near total preemption of \n     State laws restricting Internet gambling.\n       H.R. 2046 effectively nationalizes America's gambling laws \n     on the Internet, ``harmonizing'' the law for the benefit of \n     foreign gambling operations that were defying our laws for \n     years, at least until UIGEA was enacted. We therefore oppose \n     this proposal, and any other proposal that hinders the right \n     of States to prohibit or regulate gambling by their \n     residents.\n           Sincerely,\n         John Suthers, Attorney General of Colorado; Bill \n           McCollum, Attorney General of Florida; Douglas Gansler, \n           Attorney General of Maryland; Troy King, Attorney \n           General of Alabama; Talis J.

Mr. President, I thank Senators Harkin and Chambliss \nfor their tireless work on this important bill. I know that both worked \ndiligently on this legislation, and that, like all of us, they have the \nbest interests of America's farmers, ranchers, rural and urban \ncommunities at heart. I would also like to thank the committee staff \nfor the assistance and support they have provided to me and my staff \nthroughout the farm bill process. While I am disappointed at the lack \nof reform in the commodity programs, the bill does make significant \nimprovements in a number of other programs.\n  The committee bill included a number of provisions I included in \nlegislation that I introduced earlier this year, the Rural \nOpportunities Act, to help sustain and strengthen rural economies for \nthe future, and create more opportunities in rural communities. I am \npleased that the committee included a number of provisions similar to \nmy legislation to support local bioeconomies and food markets, \nencourage local renewable fuels and biobased products, expand broadband \nInternet service in rural areas, and help develop the next generation \nof farmers, ranchers, and land managers.\n  The bill also includes several important provisions to increase \naffordable broadband service in rural areas. Critical among the bill's \nprovisions is making sure that limited Federal resources are better \ntargeted to actual rural areas without broadband service. Several \nreports have highlighted problems with the current program including \nfunding projects in new suburban communities.\n  The bill also provides funding for the community food projects and \nother programs that promote local markets, which help farmers and \nconsumers by providing a direct connection between them. I know that \nthe local food movement is gaining more and more momentum, and I hope \nthat these provisions in the bill will help expand this wonderful \nopportunity to even more communities across the country. There is also \na clarification included in the bill that I first proposed in 2006 to \nhelp ensure that schools can use local preference when purchasing food \nfor meals and snacks. The bill also makes an investment in advanced \nbiofuels, as well as language from a bill I cosponsored to provide \nlocal residents an opportunity to invest in biorefineries located in \ntheir communities.\n  Mr. President, I am extremely pleased that the bill makes \nimprovements to the Milk Income Loss Contract--MILC--program. Along \nwith several of my colleagues, including Senator Kohl, I have called \nfor the MILC program's reimbursement rate to be raised to its original \n45 percent, which will happen in 2009 under this legislation. The MILC \nprogram is an important safety net for Wisconsin's dairy farmers, and \none that operates in a responsible way--only kicking in and providing \npayments to farmers when times are tough. Milk prices are higher now \nthan they have been in years; consequently, no MILC payments have been \nmade since February of this year. Further, the MILC program caps the \namount of payments one farmer can receive, ensuring that it helps small \nand medium farmers survive tough times without subsidizing expansion of \nlarger farms. The improvements to this program are vital to farmers in \nWisconsin.\n  The bill also makes significant improvements to existing nutrition \nand conservation programs. While there is room for more improvement in \nboth of these areas, I know the committee worked hard to provide \nadditional funds for these programs within a very tight budget. On the \nconservation side, the bill includes significant funding for a number \nof programs, including the Environmental Quality Incentives Program, \nEQIP, the Conservation Security Program, CSP, and the Conservation \nReserve Program, CRP. I know that these and other programs are \nextremely popular among Wisconsin farmers and residents, and I am \npleased that the committee worked to address some of the funding \nshortfall that exists.\n  The nutrition title of this bill makes significant investments in the \nFood Stamp Program. Perhaps most importantly, the bill ends benefit \nerosion by indexing benefits to inflation. The bill also removes the \ncap on deductions for childcare costs entirely, which had been set at \n$175 per month, though Wisconsin parents spend, on average, $780 per \nmonth on childcare. Lastly, the bill changes certain assets limits for \nthe Food Stamp Program, allowing recipients to save money for \nretirement or to help send their children to college or other training. \nI know that improving food stamps was a priority for Senator Harkin, as \nit was for me and many of the other Members of this body. Other \nimportant programs see an increase in this bill, including the \nEmergency Food Assistance Program, grants to promote use of food stamp \nEBT cards at farmers markets, the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Pilot \nProgram, and the Senior Farmers Market Program.\n  I was also extremely pleased to see the addition of a new livestock \ntitle in the bill to promote competition and fair practices in \nagriculture. As many of my colleagues know, most areas of agriculture \npresent different challenges, and often these situations are not fully \nanalogous to other businesses. I am glad the committee took this step \nto address the unique problems of agriculture. I am especially glad \nthat a provision I authored with Senator Grassley to prevent mandatory \narbitration clauses in agricultural contracts was included in the bill.\n  In addition to the improved competition protections that will benefit \nlivestock producers, the underlying bill contains two other provisions \nthat are also especially beneficial. I was glad to support Senator \nKohl's longstanding efforts to find a way for meat from small and often \nspecialty State-inspected meat processors to be sold across State lines \nso that consumers nationwide can enjoy these high quality Wisconsin \nproducts. The underlying bill contains a compromise that appears to \nstrike a fair balance on this issue, and this is a significant benefit \nto Wisconsin's local livestock producers and processors. I was also \nglad that the underlying bill will finally allow a country-of-origin \nlabeling requirement for meat and produce to be enforced.\n\n  In addition to the Agriculture Committee's portion of the bill, the \nFinance Committee also made a significant contribution to the Senate's \nlegislation. I was glad that my Farmer Tax Fairness Act was included in \nthe finance portion of the bill. This legislation will update the \noptional ability for farmers and other self-employed individuals to \nremain eligible for social security and disability benefits that had \nbeen eroded by inflation. It also indexes the program to inflation, so \nwe are not in the same situation again sometime in the future.\n  I would also like to thank the chairman and ranking member for \naccepting several of my amendments into the managers' package. First, \nin a continuation of an effort I began with Senator Jeffords in 1998, I \nam pleased that the committee accepted my amendment to improve the \nauthority of what we had called the small farm advocate in previous \namendment. I am pleased to have continued this effort with Senator \nSanders and hope that this small office can continue to help America's \nsmall and beginning farmers. On a related note, I was glad to have an \namendment accepted that will ensure that small farm research priority \ncontinues to be an option even with the proposed restructuring of \nagricultural research. These small efforts can make a tremendous \ndifference for our small farmers.\n  As many of my colleagues know, I have long been advocating for reform \nof the Federal milk marketing order system. To that end, I was pleased \nthat the chairman provided for a commission to examine dairy marketing \norders in his draft of the bill and hope that this commission takes a \nclose look at the antiquated rules that provide dairy farmers at a \ncompetitive disadvantage in the upper Midwest. I was also glad to have \nan amendment accepted to make a small modification to ensure the \ncommission is balanced to better consider the interests of dairy \nfarmers and ensuring fair competition.\n  Ensuring transparency and fair competition in the dairy industry has \nalso been a continuing effort throughout my Senate career. Over the \npast year, a couple developments showed a need for further action in \nthis area. First, the GAO report on cash cheese trading that I \nrequested with several of my colleagues confirmed that the market \nremains prone to manipulation even\n\n[[Page S15898]]\n\nthough there have been some improvements. Secondly, a sustained nonfat \ndry milk price reporting error that lasted over a year was found to \nhave cost dairy farmers millions in reduced prices. I was glad to have \nan amendment accepted that would require regular auditing of the dairy \nprice reporting and require the USDA to better coordinate oversight of \nthe dairy industry both within the Department and with other Federal \nagencies. I hope that this added diligence and transparency can help \ngive dairy farmers added confidence in the system.\n  With this year's high profile case of imported wheat gluten being \nadulterated with melamine, it is important to assess the risks and make \nsure that other high-protein products are safe. I am especially \nconcerned that unsafe imports of dairy proteins such as milk protein \nconcentrates and casein would have the potential to undercut consumer \nconfidence in dairy products in general and severely damage our \ndomestic industry and producers. Therefore, I am glad that the \ncommittee accepted an amendment to require a report on all high-protein \nimports including both gluten and dairy proteins to make sure that we \nare taking the proper precautions and testing.\n  Every year, I distribute a survey to farmers at a booth at the \nWisconsin Farm Technology Days and ask what their top challenges are. \nEven in this farm bill year, the responses have overwhelmingly \nindicated that health care is their top concern. I know that the farm \nbill cannot fix this problem completely and I have a proposal with \nRepublican Senator Lindsey Graham to move forward on the broader need \nfor health care reform. But in the meantime, farmers need help meeting \ntheir health care needs.\n  I have no doubt that many of my colleagues hear from farmers and \ntheir families regularly about the particular challenges they face in \nfinding and affording health care. More and more, one member of a \nfarming family is essentially forced to work off-farm just to be \neligible for a health care plan. I cannot tell you how many times my \nstaff and I have heard from a farmer's spouse about how much they would \nlike to be spending their days working on the farm, with their family, \nbut instead go into town to work as a teacher or at a bank just for the \nhealth care. I look forward to the results of a study that was \ncosponsored by Senator Harkin and was also accepted into the managers' \npackage on the challenges farmers--and the rural areas they live in--\nface in obtaining health care. I hope that this body can work in the \nfuture to alleviate this problem faced by so many hard-working American \nfarmers.\n  I also believe that as we look to expand our Nation's renewable \nenergy and lessen our dependence on oil, we need to provide \nopportunities for farmers and rural communities. Earlier this year, I \nintroduced the Rural Opportunity Act and am very pleased that several \nkey elements supporting local bioenergy were included in the farm bill. \nOne amendment I got accepted encourages the USDA's continued support \nfor and the expansion of regional bioeconomy consortiums, which can \nconsist of land grant universities and State agriculture agencies \ndedicated to researching and promoting sustainable and locally \nsupported bioenergy. I was also pleased to work with Senator Coleman on \nanother ``rural opportunity'' provision, which is based on our \nlegislation, S. 1813, to provide local residents an opportunity to \ninvest in biorefineries located in their communities.\n  Mr. President, my home State is home to many organic producers. I was \nglad that the chairman and ranking member accepted an amendment I \nauthored expressing the sense of the Senate that organic research at \nthe Agricultural Research Service should get a fair share of research \nfunding a--share proportional to its share of the market. It is hard to \nbelieve, but when we passed the 2002 farm bill, organics were a new, \ntrendy, item. Today organics account for about 6 percent of food \npurchases in the U.S.\n  While Wisconsin is perhaps more widely known as a leader in milk and \ncheese production, we also lead the Nation in production of cranberries \nand ginseng. I was glad to see a priority competitive research area for \ncranberries in the underlying legislation. Similarly, I was glad that \nmy legislation with Senator Kohl and Representative Obey to require \ncountry-of-harvest labeling for ginseng was accepted as an amendment. \nThis is an important step to help combat mislabeling of foreign ginseng \nas U.S. or Wisconsin grown, which receives a premium price for its \nhigher quality.\n  While there were many positives in this legislation, these \naccomplishments are bittersweet for me as the Senate missed an \nimportant opportunity for meaningful targeted reform of the farm \nsupport programs. I was deeply disappointed that several amendments to \nmake the commodity support programs more balanced to better target \nfamily farms and not concentrate payments in larger corporate-scale \noperations were unsuccessful.\n  While I cosponsored or supported several reform amendments, I was \nespecially disappointed that despite the support of a majority of \nSenators, the Dorgan-Grassley payment limit and Klobuchar adjusted \ngross income amendments were defeated because they could not reach a \n60-vote threshold. There is no good reason why large, wealthy corporate \nfarms, nonfarmers and even estates of dead people receive hundreds of \nthousands of dollars per year from taxpayers. The result on Dorgan-\nGrassley was particularly troubling because we able to pass a similar \nprovision in 2002.\n  I was also disappointed to be prevented from offering an amendment to \nmake a progressive cut to direct payments and redirect the savings to \nbenefit farmers and rural America with my colleague Senator Menendez. \nOur amendment would have addressed the most serious problems with \ndirect payments. Direct payments are particularly problematic because \nthey are based on a history of crop growing, regardless of what is \ncurrently being grown or even whether the land is being farmed at all. \nNor are they tied to need, crop prices, or weather conditions. When \nprices are low, they are insufficient; when prices are high, like now, \nthey are hard to justify.\n  With many needs and very few new resources available for this farm \nbill reauthorization, we recognized the need to keep the majority of \nthe savings in our farmers' pockets and in our rural communities, but \ninstead of going to the largest landowners, the money would have been \nrefocused to meet many of the unmet needs in programs that help a broad \nnumber of farmers.\n  Our amendment had the support of a diverse group of organizations \nincluding the Wisconsin Farmers Union, the New Jersey Conservation \nFoundation, the Sustainable Agriculture Coalition, the Cornucopia \nInstitute, the National Rural Health Association, the Rural Coalition, \nand the National Conference of Catholic Bishops.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/18/senate-section/article/S15898-1", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15898-S15899]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           PATENT REFORM ACT\n\n\n                          further improvements\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment, along with \nthe distinguished Senator from Utah, a longstanding member of the \nJudiciary Committee and a consistent partner of mine on intellectual \nproperty issues, to discuss S. 1145, the Patent Reform Act of 2007.\n  Mr. HATCH. I would be happy to discuss this important issue with my \ngood friend from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. First, I want to express my appreciation for my \ncolleague's efforts in working to ensure that our patent laws are \nmodernized. We first cosponsored patent reform last Congress. We again \njointly introduced comprehensive patent reform this Congress in the \nform of S. 1145 in April of this year. Both bills had their foundations \nin numerous hearings with the testimony of dozens of witnesses and in \ninnumerable meetings with the myriad of interested participants in the \npatent system. The message we heard repeatedly was of the urgent need \nto modernize our patent laws. The leaders of the House Judiciary \nCommittee also heeded that call to legislate, and working with them, we \nintroduced identical, bipartisan bills. H.R. 1908 was introduced the \nvery same day that we introduced the Senate bill.\n  In July, after several extensive and substantive markup sessions, the \nSenate Judiciary Committee reported S. 1145 favorably and on a clear \nand strong bipartisan vote. In the course of\n\n[[Page S15899]]\n\nour committee deliberations, a great many changes were made to improve \nand perfect the bill. These improvements included changes on the key \nissues of enhancing patent quality, clarifying rules on infringement \nand compensation of inventors, and improving the ability of the Patent \nand Trademark Office to do its job well.\n  Mr. HATCH. I am proud to be a leading cosponsor of patent reform. The \ninventiveness of our citizens is the core strength of our economy. Our \nFounding Fathers recognized the critically important role of patents by \nmandating in article 1, section 8, of the Constitution that Congress \nwas to enact a patent law. The Congress has periodically seen fit to \nupdate the law to ensure it meets the changing needs of both science \nand our economy. But the current law has not seen a major revision \nsince 1952. Much has changed since then. The courts have struggled \nvaliantly to interpret the law in ways that make sense in light of \nchange. but that piecemeal process has left many areas unclear and some \nareas of the law out of balance. So action by the Congress is needed, \nand needed urgently.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I agree with my distinguished colleague that now is the \ntime to enact patent reform, and we are in good company in that belief. \nOur leadership has committed to taking up S. 1145 as early in the new \nyear as possible, and we commend that commitment. I fully recognize \nthat when the bill was reported by the Judiciary Committee, a number of \nmembers expressed a strong view that the bill should be further \nperfected before it comes to a vote on the floor of the Senate. I made \na commitment to the members of the Judiciary Committee at the markup \nthat I would work closely with each of them, and other Members of the \nSenate, to make further improvements in the bill. I reaffirm that \ncommitment.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Thank you. I was among the members of the committee who \nexpressed the view that while I believed we were reporting a very sound \nbill, further improvements should be considered. I very much appreciate \nyour willingness to work with me and other Senators and very much \nappreciate your commitment.\n  Mr. LEAHY. As you and I have discussed, successful enactment of \npatent reform requires the input of all Senators. Over the past months, \nsince the committee reported the bill, I have had numerous meetings \nwith both members and affected interests. I know you have too. My staff \nhas had literally hundreds of meetings and discussions about this \nlegislation. In the course of those meetings, it has become clear to me \nthat several issues are on the minds of most people: ensuring \ncompensation for infringement is fair and adequate; clarifying rules on \nvenue; and improving the ability of parties to challenge the validity \nof granted patents through administrative processes.\n  Mr. HATCH. I agree with my colleague, further improvements should be \nconsidered to key provisions of the bill, including damages, postgrant \nreview, inequitable conduct defense, and venue.\n  Let me just say a few words about the need to make further reforms to \nthe inequitable conduct defense. I commend Senator Leahy for working to \ndevelop an effective solution to the problem of the inequitable conduct \ndefense during committee deliberation in July. No doubt he has done a \ngood job in initiating this process. We certainly share many \nperspectives on how to reform this area of the law, but I believe more \nmust be done to change the use of this defense as an unfair litigation \ntactic.\n  I know some have opposed any meaningful changes in this area because \nof how it would affect the generic pharmaceutical industry. As a \ncoauthor of the Drug Price Competition and Patent Restoration Act, \ninformally known as the Hatch-Waxman Act, I certainly understand the \ngeneric drug industry, but S. 1145 is an innovator's bill. Unless we \npromote and protect a structure that fosters a strong and vibrant \nenvironment for innovators, there will be fewer and fewer drugs for the \ngenerics to manufacture--and all, including patients, will suffer.\n  Much like Senator Leahy, my staff and I have met with many interested \nstakeholders and individuals about these provisions, and they have \nstated that further refinements to these four key provisions would \ngarner even greater support of S. 1145. I firmly believe that \ncompromise on each of these provisions is achievable, and I know that \nmy good friend from Vermont would agree.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Over the course of early January, I invite you and our \ncolleagues to work with me to find viable solutions. It is my intention \nto seek and hear the views of any and all parties and to include all \ninterested staff and Senators. This will continue to be an open and \ndeliberative process, with the goal of favorable Senate action as early \nas the floor schedule permits. I am committed to a strong and effective \nbalanced bill. I know there are some out there who would rather see us \ndo nothing and leave the systems now in place or merely codify current \njurisprudence. I believe that following this course would be shirking \nour responsibility to ensuring the economic strength of our country \nthat is built on inventiveness.\n  Mr. HATCH. I agree with your intentions and applaud your plan. I \nstand ready to work with you and each of our colleagues. I also agree \nthat this should not become an excuse for further delay or for doing \nnothing. Unfortunately, some would like to play political football with \nthis bill to pursue other agenda items. Make no mistake: this bill is \nfar too important and should not fall prey to such partisan tactics \nfrom either side. The Senate has a tremendous opportunity and \nresponsibility to further strengthen our Nation's competitiveness \nthrough meaningful patent reform.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/18/senate-section/article/S15899-1", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15899-S15900]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  HONORING REPRESENTATIVE JULIA CARSON\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, in remembrance of Congresswoman Julia \nCarson, who died on December 15, 2007, I have printed in the Record a \ncolumn written by former Representative Andy Jacobs Jr. of Indiana.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n                Remembering Congress's Jewel Named Julia\n\n       ``Look where he came from and look where he went; and \n     wasn't he a kind of tough struggler all his life right up to \n     the finish?'' The words are those of Carl Sandburg in praise \n     of Abraham Lincoln. The same praise could and should be said \n     of our sister, the late Rep. Julia Carson (D-Ind.), who has \n     passed beyond the sound of our voices into the sunset of her \n     temporal life and into a dawn of history.\n       Where did she come from? Same place as Lincoln--Kentucky. \n     And like him, she was born both to physical poverty and \n     spiritual wealth, and moved to Indiana.\n       Another similarity: Julia also had an ``angel mother,'' \n     Velma Porter, who put a lot of physical, mental and spiritual \n     nutrients into the little flowerpot of her only child.\n       Fast-forward to a month after my first and improbable \n     election to Congress. I was told by mutual friends that at \n     the Chrysler UAW office, I could find a remarkable woman to \n     join me as a co-worker in my Washington Congressional office. \n     Remarkable? Understatement. Thus began my 47-year friendship \n     and, eventually, virtual sibling-ship with the already \n     honorable Julia Carson, one of the most intelligent, ethical, \n     industrious and compassionate people I have ever known.\n       Check out her first Congressional brainstorm. It started a \n     national trend. Why make constituents in need of \n     Congressional assistance with bureaucratic problems travel \n     all the way to D.C. to get it? Why not take that part of the \n     office to them? So we adopted her suggestion and did our \n     ``case work'' in Indianapolis with Julia at the helm. It set \n     an example that has been followed by other Congressional \n     offices all over the country ever since. OK, there was one \n     other factor. She had two little kids she preferred to rear \n     in Indianapolis, doing well by her kids by doing good for her \n     country.\n       Later, my refusal to bring home a particularly pernicious \n     piece of political pork earned me a severe gerrymander that, \n     together with the Nixon landslide, ejected me from Congress. \n     Nothing is all bad; the beneficiary of the gerrymander was my \n     much-admired friend, Bill Hudnut (R). That was the year I had \n     to talk Julia into running for the state House of \n     Representatives. She thought it would be disloyal to our \n     friendship because it would take her away from my campaign, \n     which was a campaign of futility that year.\n       She was elected to the state House, where she served with \n     distinction and, in time, she became a state Senator, again \n     gaining friends and admirers on both sides of the aisle.\n       Still later, she became the Center Township trustee and \n     produced real ``welfare reform,'' not with ignorant \n     histrionic speeches and braggadocio, but with hard, quiet and \n     meticulous work. It was reform that broke no poor child's \n     heart, nor sent such a child to bed hungry. She not only \n     ferreted out welfare cheats, but also sued them and got the \n     money back for the taxpayers. Her reform wiped out a long-\n     standing multimillion-dollar debt, moving the then-Marion \n     County Republican auditor to say, ``She wrestled the monster \n     to the ground.''\n\n[[Page S15900]]\n\n       Julia was unique in that she was the only human being ever \n     to be named Woman of the Year by The Indianapolis Star on two \n     different occasions.\n       It was common parlance to say, ``Congresswoman Carson's \n     people,'' a reference to poor black constituents. Rubbish. \n     The 7th district is about 70 percent nonblack and ``her \n     people'' were all the people of the 7th, regardless of \n     physical or economic description. Millionaires can be treated \n     unjustly by the federal government just as middle- and low-\n     income citizens can. And wherever there was injustice, this \n     Lincoln-like lady was there to redress it. Her political \n     philosophy was a plank from the Sermon on the Mount: \n     ``Blessed are they who thirst for justice.''\n       There's another one: ``Blessed are the peacemakers.'' She \n     cast our vote against the conspicuously unconstitutional \n     resolution that gave the Cheney gang a fig leaf to order our \n     innocent military to the fraudulent and internationally \n     illegal blood-soaked blunder in Iraq.\n       Julia called me just before she cast that vote and said \n     that, in view of the dishonesty, panic and jingoism of the \n     moment, she expected to lose the next election. ``Courage,'' \n     my mother said, ``is fear that has said its prayers.''\n       Our Julia, who art in Heaven.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/18/senate-section/article/S15900-1", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15900]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           TRIBUTE TO FORMER GEORGIA HOUSE LEADER TOM MURPHY\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I want to associate the following \ncomments with my distinguished colleague and friend, Senator Isakson, \nto honor the late former Georgia House Leader Tom Murphy, who passed \naway last night.\n  Tom, known by his friends as Speaker and others as ``Mr. Speaker,'' \nwas once the longest serving State House speaker in the nation, serving \nGeorgia from 1974 to 2002. In describing the life's work of Tom Murphy, \none of our veteran reporters in Atlanta quoted an old 1960's western \nfilm and wrote, ``When the legend becomes fact, print the legend.'' The \nreporter goes on to say, ``There will be no such confusion over Tom \nMurphy, the tough-talking master politician whose gruff exterior \nconcealed a heart that ached for the poor and helpless and in the \nSpeaker's case, they were one and the same.''\n  He was a true champion for our great State, and all Georgians, from \nRabun Gap to Tybee Light, will reap the benefits of Tom's work legacy \nfor generations to come.\n  During the time Tom served our State, Georgia became one of the \nleading States to attract international business, our ports were \nexpanded, the Quick Start program was created and expanded to help \ncompanies train new workers, and teachers salaries were given higher \npriority.\n  The expressway system in Georgia was completed during his tenure, and \nif you live in the vicinity of Atlanta, you have Tom to thank for the \nwidening of the connector in Atlanta; additional runways at Hartsfield-\nJackson International Airport; and the World Congress Center that was \nbuilt and expanded to allow Georgia to compete for conventions and \ntrade shows.\n  He was always supportive of rural Georgia and agribusiness, and he \nwas part of a transformation of our state into a State that has a \nsignificantly more diversified and stronger economic base than ever \nbefore.\n  One of our former colleagues, former Senator and Governor, Zell \nMiller, one of our greatest Governors, describes his working \nrelationship with Tom as one that was tumultuous, but mutually \nbeneficial. They worked together for many years in the State \nlegislature, and it is no secret that the two often dueled over many \nissues, but they always had Georgia's best interest in mind. Zell has \nstated, ``If there had not been a Tom Murphy, I guess I would have \ncreated one, and if there had not been a Zell Miller, I guess he would \nhave had to create one. Because that's the way we rallied our troops.'' \nBoth recognized that they could not survive without the other.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nZell's interview.\n  Tom's integrity and fairness were his trademarks, and he will always \nbe remembered for his longstanding commitment to Georgia values.\n  When we depart from this world, we all hope to leave it a better \nplace. Tom Murphy left Georgia better than he found it.\n\n                 ``He Was A One-Of-A-Kind'' Individual\n\n                            (By Dick Pettys)\n\n       Make no mistake: there was real respect and, yes, even \n     affection between Tom Murphy and Zell Miller, though you \n     would never have known it from the way Murphy introduced \n     Miller on occasion as the ``extinguished'' lieutenant \n     governor, or the way Miller referred to Murphy's House as the \n     ``mausoleum'' for his legislative initiatives.\n       Murphy, who died Monday, and Miller came to the Georgia \n     Legislature in the same year--1961--and their careers were \n     forever entangled after Murphy became Speaker and Miller \n     became lieutenant governor and later governor.\n       ``I've often thought this as I looked back on (our) \n     careers--we worked off each other to benefit what we were \n     trying to get done,'' Miller said in a telephone interview \n     Tuesday. ``If there had not been a Tom Murphy, I guess I \n     would have created one, and if there had not been a Zell \n     Miller, I guess he would have had to create one. Because \n     that's the way we rallied our troops.''\n  At such times, it often took a woman's touch to keep them from doing \neach other a bodily harm, and Shirley Miller filled that role, Murphy \nused to say.\n       There was sadness in Miller's voice as he spoke of Murphy's \n     legacy.\n       ``He was a one-of-a-kind individual, and for four decades \n     whatever happened in Georgia, he was right in the middle of \n     it,'' Miller said. ``We will never see, I don't think, ever \n     again one Georgia leader have the power that he had for as \n     many years as he had it. It's really remarkable and I don't \n     think the way politics is today that you'll ever see that \n     again.''\n       Miller, who taught college history at an earlier point in \n     his career, said Murphy came along at an historic time in the \n     state's history.\n       ``We were all the same. We were white male Democrats, \n     mostly from rural Georgia. And then suddenly that all changed \n     with the court rulings and the county unit system, \n     reapportionment and all of that. And it became a very, very \n     volatile time to be in politics.\n       And the fact that he could hold that House together like he \n     did for so many years, it's really historic.\n       ``Loyalty is the most important ingredient in legislative \n     politics and he enjoyed that from his House like no one ever \n     has before or will again,'' he said.\n       Why?\n       ``They knew it was a two-way street; that he would look \n     after them and he would be as loyal to them as they were to \n     him. He, of course, very wisely would place people in various \n     positions which would be of benefit to him later . . . Next \n     to his real family, the House was his family.''\n       ``The night I was elected (November, 1990), he was one of \n     the first to come up to where we were, and I appreciated \n     that. The next day, I went up to the third floor, sat down \n     and told him I might could get elected without him, but I \n     sure couldn't govern without him. That was the truth.\n       ``We worked together and fought together for so many years, \n     it's hard to believe what a long period of time it really \n     was. I give him a lot of credit for the fiscal soundness of \n     the sound and bringing along rural legislators on things like \n     the World Congress Center, which was not an easy job. So many \n     things. It's a shame he didn't get that reservoir, which was \n     looked upon as sort of pork at the time. It would have helped \n     today if we had had it.''\n       For both men and for the state, that remarkable period of \n     time was quite a ride. ``I feel very, very fortunate to have \n     been part of it,'' he said.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/18/senate-section/article/S15900-2", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15900]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         COMMENDING CINDY CHANG\n\n  Mr. GREGG.

Mr. President, today I want to pay tribute to an \noutstanding friend and advisor, Wally Rustad, who will be concluding \nhis time as chief of staff on January 10, 2008.\n\n[[Page S15901]]\n\n  In July 2007, when my longtime chief of staff announced his intention \nto retire, Wally agreed to come out of retirement to serve as interim \nchief of staff during the transition period. Wally was no stranger to \nmy office. Following a long career working for the National Rural \nElectric Cooperatives, he served as my state liaison for 6 years. In \nfact, Wally and I have a history of working together that spans back \nover 40 years when I was an intern in the office of Congressman Rolland \nRedlin and he was serving as the young chief of staff for the \nCongressman. Wally and I have been working together in one form or \nanother ever since.\n  Wally came on board as my interim chief of staff and immediately \nprovided the steady leadership that is crucial during times of change. \nDuring his tenure in my office, Wally has done an outstanding job of \nseeing my staff through personnel changes and legislative challenges, \nand has provided me the steady advice of a seasoned veteran. His work \nhas been outstanding.\n  Finally, and most importantly, Wally Rustad is an outstanding person. \nHe has never forgotten the small-town values he learned growing up \nGrenora, ND. He has worked quietly and tirelessly behind the scenes to \nmake things happen and was always happy to divert credit to others. He \nhas been tremendously loyal, dedicated, and a passionate advocate for \nthe people of my State. He has never forgotten that he is working for \nthe American taxpayer. And he has been a good friend and a mentor to \nothers on staff.\n  With extraordinary gratitude for his time serving as my chief of \nstaff, I wish Wally well as he returns home to his lovely wife Marlys. \nI have been blessed to have Wally as a trusted advisor and confidante \nbut most importantly he has been a great friend. I wish him all the \nbest as he returns to retirement and look forward to continuing our \nassociation for many years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/18/senate-section/article/S15901-1", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15901]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           CONSTITUENT VIEWS\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter \nfrom Mr. Richard Morgan from Shavertown, PA, be printed in the \nCongressional Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                 December 7, 2007.\n     Re: Congressional members\n\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Specter: My name is Richard H. Morgan. I \n     reside at 145 Woodbine Road, Shavertown, PA. I am retired at \n     72 years of age and a military veteran of the U.S. Navy and \n     U.S. Coast Guard. I have been a Republican since 21 years of \n     age.\n       On November 20, 2007 at 11 a.m., you returned my phone \n     call. During our conversation I agreed to write a letter \n     stating my views of the job the Senate has done. You agreed \n     to read this letter on the Senate floor. I told you I would \n     really like to stand and talk in front of the Senate.\n       I am part of the great generation of people who lived, \n     worked, and died for this country. I often wonder to myself \n     where we as a society let our country go so wrong. We are not \n     safe in our own country. I am not afraid of terrorists from \n     other countries; I have greater fear from my own government. \n     I would like to list a few examples.\n       First, congressional personnel do not live their lives as \n     the working average middle class nor our lower class society. \n     They think of us as uneducated. They may be right since we \n     placed our trust in their hands and believed they would do \n     the job right. I question too what has happened to the oath \n     of office they took as a serious promise to us and God. The \n     majority of Congress lacks integrity and humility. They are \n     definitely not role models for our society. I know our \n     country's business can be conducted better. I have no special \n     interest groups to benefit by my vote.\n       Second, I have a problem concerning social security and how \n     the word entitlements is used. It makes me feel like they are \n     giving me personally a handout. The social security trust \n     fund is completely funded by the citizens of the United \n     States through payroll tax deductions and collected by the \n     Internal Revenue Service. I must add that they are elected by \n     citizens to manage these funds for us and not to fund other \n     programs. So, I feel the word of entitlements should have \n     reference to congressional perks, which are completely funded \n     by tax paying citizens.\n       Finally, my third area of concern is the marriage of \n     congressional members and corporate business. I am not sure \n     if it's illegal, but I do know it's unethical. This has \n     caused so much damage to my country. I have done the research \n     on many programs such as the Bureau of Public Debt, Federal \n     Accounting, and the U.S. Office of Personnel Management.\n       The answer to this whole problem is for all elected \n     congressional members to gain a conscience or to resign from \n     office.\n           Respectively,\n     Richard H. Morgan.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/18/senate-section/article/S15901-2", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15901]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 RESTORING JUSTICE FOR BOOKER TOWNSELL\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I want to take a moment to \nrecognize a victory for the cause of justice, albeit one that is long \noverdue. In 1944, Booker Townsell, a private in the U.S. Army, was \nconvicted of a crime in an unfair and racially biased trial, 63 years \nago to this day. I join Booker Townsell's family in heralding the \nrecent decision by the Army Board for Correction of Military Records to \noverturn this conviction and restore all rights lost as a result of the \nconviction. Although Booker Townsell is no longer with us, and no \nruling can change the injustice that Booker Townsell suffered when he \nwas wrongly convicted by the Army in 1944, I am pleased to see that the \nArmy is rejecting the original decision handed down 63 years ago.\n  Despite the injustice he suffered, Booker Townsell displayed \ntremendous strength, and went on to lead a full life in Wisconsin, \nincluding raising a wonderful family. I am glad to see the tremendous \nweight of this conviction lifted from his family. It is due to their \nvaliant effort that this decision was finally overturned. I also thank \nCongressmen Jim McDermott and Duncan Hunter for putting vital pressure \non the Army to review the 1944 decision. While it has taken far too \nlong, 63 years later, justice has finally been restored to Booker \nTownsell and his family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/18/senate-section/article/S15901-3", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15901]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        HONORING DENIS O'DONOVAN\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY.

She served in the Reagan administration and the first Bush \nadministration as a key adviser on health legislation. She has been an \naide on the Appropriations Committee covering bills as vast as funding \nfor the Commerce Department and our foreign aid programs.\n\n[[Page S15902]]\n\n  In no area has her able hand been more evident than health care. \nBefore her appointment as chief of staff, Trish served as chief health \nadviser to Senator Hatch. In that capacity, she was his lead staffer in \nthe creation of the Children's Health Insurance Program which today \nprovides health coverage to more than 6 million poor children. She was \na leader, too, in improving the work of the Food and Drug \nAdministration in enhancing the safety and efficacy of prescription \ndrugs and food.

Mr. President, I have had the privilege of attending \nperformances by the Eagles, and I have enjoyed a long friendship with \nDon Henley and the members of the band.\n  I talked with Don recently about their new double-disc set ``Long \nRoad Out of Eden'' and how they came about making it. We also talked \nabout the last impromptu performance of the Eagles I attended, which \nwas at Camp David at a farewell party for President Bill Clinton, who \nwas leaving office within 48 hours. As always, they were superb.\n  I have listened so many times to their music while traveling, at my \nhome in Vermont, and in my office, and I thought my colleagues may \nbenefit from the transcript of an interview Don Henley recently had \nwith CNN. I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Nashville, Tennessee (CNN).--It may have been 28 years \n     since the last Eagles studio album--yes, ``The Long Run'' \n     came out in 1979--but, in terms of sales, it's as if the \n     famed band has never left.\n       The group's new CD, the double-disc set ``Long Road Out of \n     Eden,'' debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard album charts with \n     more than 700,000 copies sold in its first week. This--\n     despite its being available only at Wal-Mart.\n       That relationship with America's biggest merchant has also \n     raised eyebrows. Wal-Mart's reputation does not seem to \n     dovetail with the interests of the Eagles, particularly the \n     band's Don Henley, an outspoken environmentalist.\n       In a rare interview, Henley addressed those concerns, along \n     with the idea of patriotism, the changing music business, and \n     why ``Long Road'' may be the group's last album.\n       CNN's Denise Quan spoke to Henley at the Country Music \n     Association awards last week, and said that Henley was a \n     ``true Southern gentleman,'' ending the interview by sending \n     the crew on its way with plates of mashed potatoes, corn and \n     biscuits.\n       CNN. Don Henley, congratulations on the first-week sales of \n     this album. I think it exceeded everyone's expectations.\n       Henley. More than 700,000 in this country. And I'm told it \n     has sold 3 million worldwide. So we're delighted.\n       CNN. Somewhere, Kanye West is quaking in his boots, I would \n     imagine.\n       Henley. I doubt it. (Laughs)\n       CNN. You made us wait 28 years for this new CD.\n       Henley. Yeah. Well, we don't like to rush into things.\n       CNN. I was surprised when it was announced you had gone \n     with a Wal-Mart deal exclusively. Why did you do that?\n       Henley. Our deal with the major label expired several years \n     ago, and we just decided we wanted to try something new. . . \n     . Everybody's been calling for a new paradigm in the record \n     industry. Some people have gone to the Internet and haven't \n     had a lot of success with that.\n       Some people have decided to go with the indie labels, who \n     are mostly distributed by the major labels. Some people have \n     signed with major coffee companies with varying degrees of \n     success.\n       So Wal-Mart came to us, and they made us a really good \n     offer. And they told us about their green initiative, and how \n     they're trying to make their company more ecologically \n     responsible. And we were impressed by their programs in that \n     regard, and what they're trying to do. And a lot of our fans \n     are customers of Wal-Mart, so we thought it was a good fit.\n       CNN. There are two discs in ``Long Road Out of Eden.'' One \n     disc is full of romantic ballads with those harmonies the \n     Eagles are known for, and the other disc is full of \n     satirical, witty, kind of biting--\n       Henley. (Interrupts) Thank you. Thank you for not using the \n     word ``cynical.'' (Laugh) Which has become a real cliche.\n       Protest songs are an old tradition that seems to be coming \n     back now. People writing about government has been going on \n     since the Middle Ages. . . . But to hear some journalists \n     tell it, this is like it's never been done before, and it's \n     outrageous!\n       If people don't agree with us, they can hit the skip \n     button. We are ticked off about some things, but we also do \n     some of it with humor. People seem to miss our humor. A lot. \n     It seems to go (brushes side of his head with his hand).\n       CNN. The Eagles have long been associated with the country \n     sound--only you brought the rock element to it when you first \n     appeared on the scene.\n       Henley. Yeah, yeah.\n       CNN. But your politics are different than a lot of people \n     in Nashville, who are more conservative than I would say you \n     are.\n       Henley. Yeah. Well, Nashville is changing. Nashville is not \n     nearly as conservative as it used to be.\n       CNN. People just don't talk about it, perhaps.\n       Henley. It's just like you don't talk about religion and \n     politics. This country was founded on rebellion. We believe \n     that we are patriotic. We believe that everyone has the right \n     to speak out. In fact, we believe that it's unpatriotic not \n     to speak out.\n       Lord knows, we've been criticized enough during our career. \n     When we were younger, (adopts Bugs Bunny voice) it hurt our \n     widdle feewings. But now we have no feelings! We had them \n     removed. Surgically. This is probably the last Eagles album \n     that we'll ever make. So we decided to just say whatever we \n     felt like saying. And let the chips fall where they may.\n       CNN. But doesn't the success of this album spur you to make \n     more music? Obviously, people want to hear it.\n       Henley. I can't sit here and tell you for certain that \n     there will never be another Eagles album, but we got 20 songs \n     on this album. You know, we got a lot of things off our \n     chest, so to speak.\n       I don't know if everybody's going to want to do another \n     one. If we do a world tour, that'll take at least two years. \n     We're all pushing 60. Well, some of us are 60. . . .\n       Anyway, we'll see. But we all have some solo plans still. I \n     still have a contract with a major label for a couple of solo \n     albums. I think parenting is one of the highest things on our \n     agenda right now. We all have young children. So making \n     another album is not our first priority right now.\n       CNN. It seems like you've mellowed quite a bit. Is it \n     fatherhood that's changed you, or perhaps just turning 60?\n       Henley. I think we've all mellowed in this group. I think \n     having children was really good for all of us. And you \n     supposedly get mellower with age. However, as some of the \n     songs will indicate, we're not too mellow. (Pauses)\n       CNN. What are you thinking?\n       Henley. I hate that word ``mellow,'' actually. We've been \n     saddled with that word since the very beginning of our \n     career, you know. It has something to do with Southern \n     California. I wish they would find a new word. We're either \n     ``mellow'' or we're ``cynical.'' They can't make up their \n     minds. It's sort of a contradiction.\n       CNN. But I think you've been sort of a contradiction. \n     Certainly an enigma to a lot of people.\n       Henley. Well, good! (Laughs) Yeah, well, this band is a \n     contradiction. This album is. But life is a contradiction, \n     isn't it? There are good things, and there are bad things \n     going on in the world simultaneously. There's love and hate. \n     There's war and peace. There are all kinds of things \n     happening at the same time. And so that's reflected on this \n     album, I think.\n\n[[Page S15903]]\n\n       CNN. So how are you guys all getting along these days?\n       Henley. The same. (Laughs)\n       CNN. For better or worse?\n       Henley. All that stuff has been exaggerated. You ask any \n     band if they get along all the time, and they will tell you, \n     ``Of course not.'' But we get along, I'd say, as well as any \n     band does.\n       There's something we've created called the Eagles that's \n     more important than any one of us individually. And we serve \n     that. You know, we call it ``The Mothership.'' We can all do \n     this, that and the other, but we always come back to the \n     Mothership. It's something that we all built together.\n       And all this stuff about fighting in the band, and \n     brawling, and fistfights and all that stuff has been grossly \n     exaggerated. When it gets reprinted, and our publicist says, \n     ``Well, where'd you get that information,'' they invariably \n     say, ``I read it on the Internet''--as if the Internet were \n     some source of truth! The Internet is no more accurate than \n     the New York Post, you know.\n       (Looks straight into the camera lens) Put that in!

Mr. President, I wish to recognize a group of hard \nworking student athletes from my hometown who continue to make history.\n  This past Saturday, on a mud soaked field in Savannah, TN, the \nCarroll College Fighting Saints football team claimed their fifth \nNational Association of Intercollegiate Athletics championship in the \npast six seasons. The Fighting Saints overcame the weather and a tough \nsquad from the University of Sioux Falls in South Dakota to prevail \nwith a 17 to 9 victory.\n  Carroll College is a private, Catholic college in my hometown of \nHelena, MT. Carroll boasts an enrollment of about 1,500 students and is \nknown around the country for its award-winning academic and \npreprofessional programs. Carroll is particularly strong in premedical, \nengineering, and nursing programs.\n  The Saints enjoy great support from the community of Helena and from \nfolks all across Big Sky country. Fans pack Nelson Stadium on the \nCarroll campus each Saturday when there is a home game. Rain, snow, \nsub-zero temperatures--nothing will stop the Carroll faithful from \ncoming out to cheer on their beloved Saints. I always look forward to \nbeing a part of the crowd whenever I can. The student cheering section \nknown as the ``Carroll Crazies'' joins with parents and community \nmembers to create an atmosphere that is so energetic on game day you \nwould think you were at a much larger school.\n  Like hard working folks all across Montana I value my money, but I \nwas so confident that Carroll would be victorious in the title game \nthat I made a little wager with my good friend from South Dakota, \nSenator Tim Johnson. The winner gets some delicious buffalo steaks my \nstaff and I look forward to enjoying them. A special thanks to Senator \nJohnson for being such a good sport.\n  In the title game the Saints were led by running back Gabe Le, who \nslogged through the mud to pick up 116 hard-fought yards and scored \nCarroll's only two touchdowns on the day. For his efforts Le, a \nsophomore from Hayden, ID, was named the offensive player of the game. \nLe started the season as a backup but found his way into the starting \nlineup and rushed for over 100 yards in each of Carroll's four \nvictories in the playoffs. The Carroll defense rose to the occasion and \nslowed down Sioux Falls' high-flying offense. Hard hitting linebacker \nOwen Koeppen, a junior from Florence, MT, took the honors as defensive \nplayer of the game. Koeppen has also been named to the 2007 American \nFootball Coaches Association NAIA All-America Team.\n  The 2007 edition of the Fighting Saints was particularly dominant. \nThey finished the season a perfect 15-0, running their record over the \npast 6 years to an astounding 79 to 6. The squad didn't surrender a \ntouchdown until the eighth game of the season and gave up an average of \nless than five points per game. Carroll outscored their opponents by a \ncombined total of 370 to 72.\n  Head football coach Mike Van Diest, a native of East Helena, came \nhome in 1999 to coach the Saints. In addition to the five national \ntitles, the Saints have won eight straight Frontier Conference \nchampionships and made it to the semifinal round of the NAIA playoffs \nseven times under his direction. Van Diest is not only a fantastic \ncoach who has built a winning football program; he is an even better \nperson, husband, and father. Mike has taught his players many life \nlessons along the way. He preaches the importance of getting a quality \neducation, the value of teamwork, and the need to give back to the \ncommunity. This embodies the service mission of Carroll College and the \nschool's motto, ``Not for school but for life.'' Coach Van Diest has a \nlifetime of respect and appreciation for the Carroll standard and \ntradition of excellence and the college is truly blessed to have him.\n  All of Carroll's athletic programs have enjoyed great success as of \nlate. This fall the women's soccer team won the first ever Frontier \nConference Championship and claimed their first ever victory at the \nNAIA national tournament. The men's and women's basketball team and the \nvolleyball team have also won numerous conference championships in \nrecent years and have represented the school proudly in regional and \nnational tournaments. This record of excellence can be attributed to \nthe fine student athletes that come to Carroll from towns small and \nlarge all across Montana and the Northwest. These individuals put it \nall on the line not only on the playing fields and courts but also in \nthe classroom. I appreciate and admire this tradition of excellence in \nboth athletics and academics. Many athletes achieve honor roll status \nand go on to experience success in their respective fields of study. \nThe dedicated coaches and their staff have nurtured and helped these \nathletes to grow by putting in countless hours throughout the year to \nprepare for their respective seasons. Athletic director Bruce Parker \nalso deserves recognition as he has helped to build and oversee the \nsuccess of Carroll athletics.\n  Finally, I would like to congratulate the president of Carroll \nCollege, Dr. Tom Trebon, whose leadership and dedication have made \nCarroll the highly regarded institution that it is. I look forward to \ncheering on the Saints again in 2008 as they begin their quest for an \nunprecedented sixth national title. I know they will make Montana \nproud.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/18/senate-section/article/S15903-2", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15903]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO FORT CAMPBELL HIGH SCHOOL\n\n Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to the Fort \nCampbell Varsity football team from Fort Campbell, KY. On December 8, \n2007, the Fort Campbell High School Varsity football team won the Class \n2-A State Championship in Louisville, KY.\n  For the young men on this team, this is not just a trophy; it is an \naffirmation that with hard work and determination, anything is \npossible. To accomplish this goal the members not only have to juggle \nlong practices and games, but they continue to achieve academic \nexcellence. Not only are these young men excellent athletes and \nstudents, but they pride themselves in giving back to their community \nfor all the support they have received by doing community service, \nfundraising, and school public relations.\n  Fort Campbell, KY, is proud to be home to the 101st Airborne Division \nand 160th Special Operations Airborne Division. Many of the players on \nthe Fort Campbell Falcons have loved ones currently serving our Nation \nabroad. I am confident that these loved ones would be proud of what the \nFalcons have accomplished this season.\n  The citizens of Fort Campbell, KY, are fortunate to have the 2007 \nClass 2-A State Champions and families living and learning in their \ncommunity. Their example of hard work and determination should be \nfollowed by all in the Commonwealth.\n  I am very proud of the accomplishments these young men have made. I \nwould like to congratulate the members of the Fort Campbell High School \nVarsity football team for their success. But, also, I want to \ncongratulate their peers, coaches, teachers, administrators, and \ndedicated parents for the support and sacrifices they have made to help \nthe Fort Campbell High School football team make their dreams a \nreality.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/18/senate-section/article/S15904-1", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15904]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S15904]]\n                   VALDOSTA STATE NATIONAL CHAMPIONS\n\n Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, today I wish to congratulate the \nValdosta State University Blazers football team for winning the 2007 \nNCAA Division II National Championship.\n  The Blazers celebrated their second national championship in 4 years \non December 15, 2007, in Florence, AL, and completed their season with \na final record of 13 to 1. Valdosta State's playoff run included \nvictories over Catawba University, University of North Alabama, and the \nUniversity of California-Pennsylvania en route to defeating Northwest \nMissouri State 25 to 20 in the championship game.\n  I am extremely proud of these talented men for all of their hard work \nand dedication that contributed to this victory. I congratulate all of \nthe team members, particularly the senior class. Their leadership and \ntalents will surely be missed. In addition, sophomore wide receiver \nCedric Jones and junior safety Sherard Reynolds were both named First-\nTeam All-Americans. The Blazers also had seven players named to the \nGulf South Conference All-Conference Team, including Cedric Jones, \nGerald Davis, William Montford, Sherard Reynolds, Maurice Leggett, \nMichael Terry, and Travis Harrison. Furthermore, I would like to extend \nmy appreciation to all the families and fans for their continual \nsupport of the Blazers throughout the season.\n  The success of the team could not have been achieved without the \nexceptional coaching staff, led by head coach David Dean. Coach Dean is \nin his first season as head coach of the Blazers, having been the \nteam's offensive coordinator for the past 7 years. He is only the \nsecond first-year coach in history to lead his team to a Division II \ntitle.\n  Valdosta, a city long known for its tradition in high school \nfootball, can now boast about the success of Valdosta State University, \nwhich has won 2 Division II National Championships in 4 years. It is my \nhope that the winning tradition at Valdosta State will continue for \nmany years to come.\n  Congratulations again to all of these young men and to all associated \nwith the Valdosta State Blazers football program for their great \naccomplishments and hard work.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/18/senate-section/article/S15904-2", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15904]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    BEST HIGH SCHOOLS IN NEW MEXICO\n\n Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, today I applaud the top public \nhigh schools in my home State of New Mexico. I was pleased to learn \nthat in U.S. News and World Report's first ranking of America's best \nhigh schools, 16 high schools in New Mexico were awarded with silver \nand bronze medals for their outstanding performance on standardized \ntests and in providing college-level coursework.\n  The students come from many different backgrounds, but they are \nsuccessful because of the mind-set that says every student can succeed. \nThese schools and the communities around them have embraced the \ndifferences in their student body and demonstrated that every single \nstudent, regardless of background, can and will learn. It takes the \ndedicated leadership of a good principal, a talented teaching corps and \nengaged parents to achieve this level.\n  The teachers and staff of these high schools have demonstrated their \ncommitment to excellence through quality education. I have always been \nvery proud to call New Mexico my home because of the countless \nopportunities it provides. This is a well deserved recognition for the \nexcellent work being done by these high schools, and I would like to \ncongratulate them on their great success.\n  The following schools were commended with awards: Academy for \nTechnology and the Classics in Santa Fe, NM; Bloomfield High School in \nBloomfield, NM; Clayton High School in Clayton, NM; Cliff High School \nin Cliff, NM; Eldorado High School in Albuquerque, NM; East Mountain \nCharter High School in Sandia Park, NM; Hagerman High School in \nHagerman, NM; La Cueva High School in Albuquerque, NM; Lake Arthur High \nSchool in Lake Arthur, NM; Logan High School in Logan, NM; Los Alamos \nHigh School in Los Alamos, NM; Magdalena High School in Magdalena, NM; \nSandia High School in Albuquerque, NM; Springer High School in \nSpringer, NM; Tatum High School in Tatum, NM; and Texico High School in \nTexico, NM.\n  Again, I commend these fine high schools on a job well done, and I \nhope that these awards will inspire high schools in my home State and \naround the country to strive for the best.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/18/senate-section/article/S15904-3", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15904-S15905]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO THE HONORABLE STEPHEN LOW\n\n Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate a \ndistinguished former member of the Foreign Service, the Honorable \nStephen Low, on the occasion of his recent 80th birthday on December 2, \n2007. He has rendered many years of service to our Nation, and I am \nhonored to celebrate this milestone and his achievements.\n  Upon receiving his doctorate from the Fletcher School of Law and \nDiplomacy in 1956, the future Ambassador joined the Department of State \nas an Intelligence Research Officer in what was then the Bureau of Far \nEastern Affairs. In the years that followed, Ambassador Low served as \nthe Economic-Labor Officer in Kampala, Uganda; the Chief of Political \nSection, Dakar, Senegal; the Special Assistant to the Deputy Under \nSecretary of State for Political Affairs; and the Counselor for \nPolitical Affairs in Brasilia, Brazil. He then returned to Washington \nwhere he was named the Director of Brazil Affairs in the early 1970s.\n  During the Ford administration, Stephen Low advised our Nation's \npolicymakers on the National Security Council as the senior staff \nmember for Latin America. He then returned to service abroad, as the \nU.S. Ambassador to Nigeria. Three years later he served as Ambassador \nto Zambia. Ambassador Low performed these duties admirably, receiving \nthe Department of State Distinguished Honor Award and two Presidential \nMeritorious Service Awards.\n  In 1982 Ambassador Low became the Director of the State Department's \nForeign Service Institute, the Federal Government's primary training \ninstitution for officers and support personnel of the U.S. foreign \naffairs community. His commitment to education has been steadfast ever \nsince. In addition to teaching and administrative posts at the Johns \nHopkins University and other schools, Ambassador Low was named \nPresident of the Association of Diplomatic Studies and Teaching, an \noffice he held until 1997.\n  Today the Ambassador continues his active career. As President and \nFounder of the Foreign Affairs Museum Council, Ambassador Low worked \nwith members of Congress and all living former Secretaries of State to \nimprove public understanding of the role of diplomacy and the Foreign \nService. As he has stated:\n\n       Many Americans have little idea what an embassy is, or what \n     an ambassador does. Nor are they aware that our diplomats and \n     other Foreign Service personnel work 24/7 around the world in \n     the interest of the American people.\n\n  His subsequent advocacy and leadership in the planning of a National \nMuseum of American Diplomacy at the Department of State has helped to \nensure that our Nation honors the past achievements and ongoing service \nof our country's diplomats.\n  I congratulate Ambassador Low on his 80th birthday and his lifetime \nof achievement. I wish him many more years of good health and active \nservice to our country.\n  I ask that the attached resolution be printed in the Record.\n  The material follows.\n       Congratulating Hon. Stephen Low on a lifetime of service to \n     the cause and promotion of American diplomacy, and on the \n     recent passing of his 80th birthday on December 2, 2007;\n       Whereas throughout his years as a career Foreign Service \n     Officer, Ambassador Low served as the U.S. Ambassador to \n     Nigeria and the U.S. Ambassador to Zambia;\n       Whereas while advising the National Security Council, \n     Ambassador Low served as a senior staff member for Latin \n     America;\n       Whereas Ambassador Low has received the Department of State \n     Distinguished Honor Award and two Presidential Meritorious \n     Service Awards;\n       Whereas in his commitment to education, Ambassador Low has \n     served as the Director of the State Department's Foreign \n     Service Institute, President of the Association for \n     Diplomatic Studies and Training, and several teaching posts \n     in the United States and abroad;\n       Whereas Ambassador Low continues to be active in the \n     creation of a museum and center for the study of American \n     diplomacy at the Department of State: Now, therefore, be it\n\n[[Page S15905]]\n\n       Resolved, That the Committee on Foreign Relations expresses \n     to Ambassador Low deep appreciation for his service to the \n     Department of State and the United States of America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/18/senate-section/article/S15905-1", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15905]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SERGEANT AARON HENEHAN\n\n Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, During this holiday season, I \nwould like to recognize the soldiers and veterans from Alaska who have \ngiven so much and continue to give so much. I would like them to know \nthat their sacrifices in Afghanistan and Iraq have not gone unnoticed \nby their fellow Alaskans. When I was in Iraq I had the pleasure of \nmeeting soldiers and National Guardsmen from Anchorage, Fairbanks, \nSeward, Soldotna, Eagle River, Slana, and Wasilla. Hearing their \nstories and commitment made me incredibly proud to be an Alaskan.\n  Every day, Alaskans write my office praising the service men and \nwomen who have returned and those still in combat. Sometimes it is just \na short message conveying their support, while other times is a long \nheartfelt letter praising our heroes and expressing solidarity with \nthem for the sacrifices they have made. I truly believe that the fact \nthat Alaska has the largest number of veterans per capita says a lot \nabout our State's character.\n  Alaskan veterans are some of the most exemplary in the Armed Forces. \nThe 172nd Stryker Brigade in particular had their tour in Iraq extended \nto 16 months, but when their country asked them for more they remained \nstrong and proud. Just last week I received an e-mail from the \ncommander of the 172nd. He informed me that on December 12 Sgt. Gregory \nWilliams from the 172nd was presented the Distinguished Service Cross, \nthe second highest award for valor, for his actions in combat while in \nBaghdad. Despite being injured himself when their vehicle was struck by \na bomb, Sergeant Williams was able to return fire and help a wounded \ncomrade to safety. To date, there have been only eight Distinguished \nService Crosses awarded since the war began in 2001.\n  We Alaskans often enjoy doing things our own way. In Iraq, one \nAlaskan marine discovered he had hidden talents he never imagined when \nhis innovative approach to searching out insurgents earned him the Navy \nand Marine Corps Commendation Medal. SGT Aaron A. Henehan led his squad \nto search out and detain 18 ``blacklist'' or high-value insurgents \nwhile on his third tour in Iraq.\n  An adventurous young man, Sergeant Henehan was barely out of high \nschool and anxious to see the world when he first thought of signing up \nto serve his country. September 11 and the outbreak of war did not \ncause his decision to waiver an inch.\n  Sergeant Henehan deployed in April of 2003 and spent his first tour \nin the town of Babylon in Najaf Province. He served his country well, \nlike many who fought alongside him, and began to learn the \nundercurrents and inner workings of Iraqi society. He returned for a \nsecond tour to Husaybah, near Iraq's border with Syria in August 2004. \nAt the time Husaybah was a dangerous town.\n  Sergeant Henehan served his second tour in Iraq with distinction \nagain but still felt he needed to do more. Before deploying for his \nthird and final tour in February of 2006 he told friends and family \nback home that he yearned to make a difference in Iraq, a sentiment \nmany American soldiers and guardsmen share with him. He spent a lot of \ntime between his second and third tours thinking about what he could do \ndifferently, how he could learn from his experience and achieve a \nbetter result.\n  Combining his marine training with information he learned from a \nretired LAPD officer deployed to Iraq to teach our troops urban \ntactics, Sergeant Henehan approached his third tour with what he \nreferred to as a ``beat cop mentality.'' He wanted to approach the \nproblem of rounding up insurgents as if he were a native of the area. \nHe spent his free time studying the tribal history and geography of \nHusaybah for hours at a time.\n  The ability to put his plan in motion, Sergeant Henehan says, was \nmade possible in part by Operation Steel Curtain, which had cleared \nHusaybah block by block, and set up outposts called ``firm bases'' \nthroughout the city. Upon returning for his third tour, Sergeant \nHenehan immediately noticed that after this push, while not always \nwilling to openly support the coalition forces, many Iraqis felt safe \nenough to give him tips on where the insurgents were hiding. This \nchange in mentality, coupled with Sergeant Henehan's knowledge of \nfamily and tribal connections, allowed him to determine which people to \nask about each of the 18 high value insurgents he located. He knew \nexactly who would be willing to tip him off about a social rival or \nhistoric foe.\n  Traveling with an interpreter, Sergeant Henehan had a talent for \nremembering names and personal details. He took every opportunity he \ncould to talk with the locals and learn about the town's social \norganization and tribal boundaries, often returning several times to \ntalk with the same families to gain their trust. Bringing with him \ncandy, doctors, and his good humor, he would knock on doors and \npolitely ask to chat. Entire families opened up to him. Sometimes it \nwould start with a toy given to a child; sometimes it was a heartfelt \nconversation with a shopkeeper. The response he got astonished \neveryone, including the insurgents hiding out in the town.\n  The 12 marines in his squad called him a fair, but tough leader who \nthey felt very safe with. His intense and proactive preparation for the \nmore than 80 combat missions which he led and his personal attention to \neach of his 12 soldiers' well-being gave them a sense of security. They \ntoo noted how his relaxed Alaskan exterior quickly helped earn him the \nrespect of the townspeople.\n  Even more remarkably, Sergeant Henehan's reputation for being fair \nand caring allowed him to detain all 18 high-value insurgents without \nany real violence. These 18 also led him to their associates, \nsignificantly disrupting insurgent operations in that part of Al Anbar \nProvince. Sergeant Henehan remained behind after his unit returned to \nthe States to train new troops about how he learned to wage urban \nwarfare while gaining the trust of the townspeople. The downturn in \nviolence in Al Anbar can be linked, in part, to his efforts and efforts \nof those like him.\n  Sergeant Henehan is currently attending a California community \ncollege and plans to transfer to a larger State school after completing \nhis distribution credits. He wants to major in computer programs and \neven talks of one day creating video games that more accurately portray \nwhat war in the modern era is like. He has already begun organizing \nphotographs from his three tours to use as backdrops. Clearly his \ntalent for careful planning and his desire to share his knowledge and \nexperiences with others did not leave with his donning of civilian \nclothes. I wish him the best in all his future endeavors, just as I \nwish the best for all of our Alaskan veterans and those now \nserving.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/18/senate-section/article/S15905-2", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15905-S15906]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO DR.

Upon receiving his \nbachelor's degree from Alabama College in 1967, Patterson was \ncommissioned a lieutenant in the U.S. Marine Corps and served as a \nplatoon commander for a Combat Engineer Platoon and as an intelligence \nofficer for the First Engineer Battalion of the First Marine Division \nin the Republic of Vietnam.\n  Upon returning from Vietnam, Patterson received his masters from the \nUniversity of Montevallo and his doctorate from the University of \nAlabama. Dr. Patterson's experience includes serving as a high school \ncounselor, director of Counseling and Career Services at Jefferson \nState Junior College, vice president for instruction at the Alabama \nInstitute for the Deaf and Blind and currently, he serves as the senior \nvice chancellor for administration for Troy University.\n  Dr. Patterson has served Troy University with great honor and \ndistinction as a senior administrator since 1989 and has provided \nexemplary service to the university and to the citizens of the State of \nAlabama. During his tenure as senior vice chancellor for \nadministration, Dr. Patterson directed\n\n[[Page S15906]]\n\nthe institution's finance and budgeting, information technology, \ninstitutional effectiveness, television and radio, strategic planning, \nathletics, and day-to-day operations. Under his leadership, the \nUniversity has enjoyed an unprecedented era of growth, doubling \nworldwide student enrollment to almost 30,000 students. Dr. Patterson \nhas been instrumental in Troy University's glowing record of \nstewardship and financial stability, garnering praise and awards from \nthe National Association of College and University Business Officers \nand earning TROY recognition as a ``Best Value'' university from such \npublications as MONEY Magazine and The Princeton Review. Dr. Patterson \nplayed a key role in the university's decision to move Troy University \nathletics to the highest level of NCAA competition, bringing national \nrecognition to the university and fostering pride among its students, \nalumni, and friends. Dr. Patterson was recently honored by Troy \nUniversity as the Honorary Alumnus of the Year for 2007.\n  I commend Dr. Douglas C. Patterson, on the occasion of his retirement \nfrom Troy University, for his leadership in Alabama higher education \nand for his outstanding service to Alabama and our country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/18/senate-section/article/S15906-1", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15906]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    HONORING SIMPLY DIVINE BROWNIES\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, with the holiday season upon us, I \nrise today to recognize a Maine small business that operates with a \nphilosophy of giving back to those in need. Simply Divine Brownies of \nBrunswick is a baker and distributor of gourmet brownies and assorted \ngift packages that recently received well-deserved attention for \nfinishing second in Forbes magazine's Boost Your Business contest.\n  Founded in November 2004 as a home business by Trina Beaulier, Simply \nDivine Brownies is a true treat for the taste buds. In just 3 years, \nthe company has grown to 20 employees, including Trina's daughter \nMeggen, and now operates in Brunswick's historic Fort Andross Mill. Its \ngourmet brownies range from the chocolate and nut-filled brownies to \nthe more eclectic cappuccino or peppermint frosted brownies. Seizing \nthe opportunity to bring a creative twist to the epicurean world, \nSimply Divine produces brownies with a unique Maine accent. The \nNeed'him is a chocolate and coconut brownie based on the needham, a \ntraditional Maine cookie. And the Singin' the Blues consists of a \nchocolate brownie that is covered with blueberry buttercream frosting \nand topped with wild Maine blueberries. Simply Divine's brownies also \ncome in a variety of shapes, such as Christmas trees, wedding cakes, \nand lobsters and even palm trees for those seeking a different climate. \nRemarkably, Simply Divine is also able to offer Reflection Brownies \nimprinted with a digital image of the client's choosing, as novel \nremembrances for special occasions.\n  What makes the company so special--aside from its delicious baked \ngoods--is what Trina and Meggen do to help the less fortunate. Seeking \nto use their skills to help others, they developed the Divine \nIntervention Brownie Collection. These specialty brownies come in the \nshape of hearts and stars, and after each purchase of one of these \nsets, Simply Divine donates a portion of the proceeds to Volunteers for \nAmerica, a national nonprofit group that assists people of all ages in \nrebuilding their lives. Whether it be helping the homeless find safe \nand affordable housing, or aiding at-risk teens and those with mental \nillnesses, Volunteers for America helps over 2 million people in over \n400 communities, a task that it has successfully performed since 1896. \nVolunteers for America's philanthropic acts of kindness and compassion \nare admirable, and at this time of year, we can be particularly \nthankful for the work that Simply Divine Brownies and other businesses \nlike it do to make these programs a reality.\n  For all their hard work and success, the Beauliers have been \ncelebrated in various capacities over the past several years. Their \nbrownies have been cited as the Snack of the Day on the ``Rachel Ray \nShow'' and have also been featured on NBC's ``Today's Show.'' Most \nrecently, and perhaps most prominently, Simply Divine came in second in \nonline voting for a Forbes magazine contest to receive a financial \nassistance package to grow its business. They beat out nearly 1,000 \nother small companies to place in the final round. Having to create a \nforward-looking business plan for the contest has been of tremendous \nbenefit to the Beauliers, who say that their newfound knowledge, \ncombined with increased sales and peaked interest in the company, has \nallowed them to forge ahead with their planned expansion.\n  In the past 3 years, Simply Divine Brownies has made a name for \nitself. As a family-owned small business that has flourished and \ncontinues to receive accolades of the highest accord, Simply Divine's \ngrowth certainly has not gone unnoticed. Yet, through it all, the \nBeauliers and the employees at Simply Divine have found the will and \ndesire to make a difference, and they are to be commended for their \ninsatiable appetite to brighten the lives of others. I wish Trina and \nMeggen Beaulier and everyone at Simply Divine Brownies a happy holiday \nseason, and continued success in the years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/18/senate-section/article/S15906-2", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15906]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO FLOYD RED CROW WESTERMAN\n\n Mr. THUNE.

After high school, Floyd went on to graduate from Northern \nState University majoring in art, speech, and theatre.\n  Mr. Westerman was a very intelligent and talented individual. He was \na man of many trades including acting, singing, and songwriting. His \nacting career was especially extensive. He performed in more than 50 \nmovies and television shows. Some of his more popular acting works \nincluded, ``Dances with Wolves,'' ``Hidalgo,'' ``The X-Files,'' and \n``Walker, Texas Ranger.''\n  His music career was also a successful one.

A bill to amend title 18, United States Code, and the \nFederal Rules of Criminal Procedure with respect to bail bond \nforfeitures; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise on behalf myself, Senators Arlen \nSpecter, Lindsey Graham, and Ben Cardin to introduce the Bail Bond \nFairness Act of 2007. This bill will ensure that all defendants, not \njust rich defendants, have access to bail and pre-trial release.\n  The Bail Reform Act was meant to ensure the defendant's appearance in \ncourt. Over the past 2 decades, however, many judges have been \nforfeiting bonds for behavior outside the predictability or control of \na bondsman. If bondsmen are forced to warrant behavior they can't \npredict or control, they will raise their rates, rendering bonds \nunavailable to many indigent defendants. These defendants will the go \nto jail pending trial, swelling our prison population and draining our \nbudget.\n  This bill mandates that a bail bond may be forfeited only if a \ndefendant fails to appear in court as ordered. Professional bail agents \nwould be able to return to the Federal court system to provide bail for \ndefendants because bail would not be forfeited for violations of \nconditions that are completely out of their control such as failure to \nmaintain employment.\n  Let me be clear, this bill does not change a judge's authority to set \nor restrict bail. We're not talking about putting more criminals back \ninto the community. A judge still has to determine a defendant's flight \nrisk and threat to the community and make a\n\n[[Page S15914]]\n\njudgment regarding pretrial release in terms of bail amount and \nconditions. Violent criminals will--and should--be held in custody.\n  Please join us in ensuring that all defendants, regardless of wealth, \nhave access to pretrial release in the Federal system.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN:\n  S. 2496. A bill to amend title II of the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act of 1965 to enhance teaching standards and provide for \nlicense portability; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Enhancing \nTeaching Standards and License Portability Act of 2007. This bill would \nencourage the development and implementation of rigorous 21st century \nteaching standards throughout the U.S.\n  Since the release of the 1983 report, A Nation at Risk, educators and \npolicymakers have sought to strengthen our Nation's weakening grip on \nglobal competitiveness. Despite these efforts, low achievement outcomes \nfor too many students, particularly low income students, remain a \nthreat to our current and future standing in the global economy, and to \nour children's future security. I am concerned about the continuing \nstruggles of many of our schools.\n  In order to graduate from high school ready to succeed in \npostsecondary education and the workforce, students need a world-class \n21st century education. Their success depends on access to high quality \nteachers who have both state-of-the-art content knowledge and excellent \nteaching skills. Teachers deserve access to the most up-to-date \nteaching standards if they are to attain these professional criteria. \nMoreover, assessments of quality teaching must be based on the \ncharacteristics that are known to influence student achievement \noutcomes.\n  The Enhancing Teaching Standards and License Portability Act provides \nthe commitment and resources needed to help teachers attain these 21st \ncentury teaching skills.\n  In the early 1990s, the Interstate New Teacher Assessment and Support \nConsortium, INTASC, developed core teaching standards for beginning \nteachers, standards that have since been used--voluntarily--by \nindividual States to develop teaching and certification requirements. \nProfessional organizations such as the National Council of Teachers of \nMathematics also developed subject-area teaching standards. This bill \nwould build upon these efforts to improve teacher quality by supporting \nthe refinement, development, and testing of K-12 teaching standards \naligned with demands of the 21st century. These demands reflect content \narea advances in subject areas such as science and technology; advances \nin understanding of how students learn; the principle of universal \ndesign for learning that advocates flexible teaching to accommodate \ndifferent learning styles; educators' recognition of the need to foster \ncritical thinking, creativity, and problem-solving skills in addition \nto subject area knowledge; and demographic changes in student diversity \nsuch as the recent dramatic increase in English-language learners and \nthe increased inclusion of students with disabilities in the classroom.\n  Specifically, this bill would provide a funding mechanism to develop \nor refine 21st century teaching standards, and to link those standards \nto performance-based teacher assessments. It would also provide \nsubgrants to states to adopt, pilot, and implement these teaching \nstandards and associated teacher assessments, and align their teacher \nlicensing systems accordingly. In addition, the bill would promote and \nfacilitate reciprocity and portability of teaching licenses across \nstates. I am very pleased that this bill is supported by several \neducation groups devoted to enhancing the quality and coherence of \nteaching standards, including the Council of Chief State School \nOfficers, the American Association of Colleges for Teacher Education, \nthe National Association of Secondary School Principals, the National \nCouncil of Teachers of Mathematics, the International Reading \nAssociation, the National Science Teachers Association, and the \nNational Commission on Teaching and America's Future.\n  I believe it is important to acknowledge that we have made some \nprogress in improving teacher quality. As summarized in the Secretary \nof Education's Fifth Annual Report on Teacher Quality, the percentage \nof teachers who lack a full teaching certificate has declined, from 3.3 \nto 2.5 percent of all classroom teachers. Progress has also been \nreported in aligning States' K-12 student content standards with \nteacher certification standards; and the number of new teachers passing \nrequired State assessment exams remains high at 95 percent. The minimum \nexamination scores required to pass these exams, however, are generally \nlower than the national median scores for these assessments. Such low \ncriteria are in conflict with the NCLB definition of a highly qualified \nteacher as someone with demonstrated competence in content-area subject \nmatter. Current teacher standards fail to demonstrate, much less \nensure, this competency.\n  Researchers have demonstrated the importance of teacher competency \nfor student outcomes, arguing that classroom practices and other \naspects of teaching affect student achievement as much as, if not more \nthan, student characteristics. A recent Education Week report revealed \nthat teachers who score higher vs. lower on state licensing exams tend \nto have students who themselves achieve higher scores, particularly in \nmathematics, even when other factors linked to high achievement are \ntaken into account. Other studies demonstrate that the more content-\nspecific college coursework a math or science teacher pursues prior to \nteaching, the higher that teacher's students will score in math or \nscience. Further, a study appearing in Science showed that higher \nstudent outcomes are also associated with more positive classroom \nexperiences, and that these classroom experiences can be measured by \nstandardized observations of the instructional and social support \nteachers provide. Together, these and other studies illustrate that \nteachers' knowledge and their observable skills in the classroom are \nsignificant influences on student achievement.\n  Although solid grounding in content knowledge is necessary for 21st \ncentury learners, it alone is not sufficient. Students today need to \ndevelop creativity, critical thinking skills, and problem solving \nabilities to compete in our global economy. This means that teachers \nmust teach higher-order thinking skills in addition to content \ninformation, and create opportunities to learn. Research has shown that \nstudents of teachers who can convey higher-order thinking skills and \nsubject knowledge actually outperform students whose teachers teach \nonly subject knowledge.\n  As you know, Mr. President, students in the 21st century represent \ndiversity. For example, the U.S. Department of Education reports that \nthe rate of English-language learners has increased by 169 percent in \nthe last 20 years, in contrast to an increase of only 12 percent in the \noverall student population. Nationwide, 10 percent of all students are \nEnglish-language learners. In my state of New Mexico, the rate is 22 \npercent, second only to California, where over 25 percent of students \nare English-language learners. According to the National Academies \nReport, How People Learn, teachers need to develop an expertise \ngrounded on the theories of learning, including theories that concern \nhow cultural beliefs and personal characteristics of learners influence \ntheir learning process. This teaching knowledge promotes learning for \nall children. In fact, students whose teachers receive professional \ndevelopment in teaching diverse students outperform students of \nteachers who lack this training.\n  These are just a few examples of the research linking student \noutcomes to teacher characteristics. Linking these characteristics to \nrigorous teaching performance standards is an opportunity to provide \nworld class education to our students in the 21st century. It is time \nto improve our teaching standards.\n  Towards this goal, the Enhancing Teaching Standards and License \nPortability Act has four main objectives.\n  First, to improve teacher quality by supporting the development of \nrigorous kindergarten through grade 12 teaching standards that \nincorporate 21st century teaching and learning skills, and to\n\n[[Page S15915]]\n\npromote alignment of these standards with performance-based teacher \nassessments;\n  Second, to create incentives for States to adopt, pilot, and \nimplement such rigorous kindergarten through grade 12 teaching \nstandards and performance-based teacher assessments through a \ncompetitive grants process;\n  Third, to promote efforts for States to align these teaching \nstandards and performance-based teacher assessments to State licensing \nrequirements; and\n  Finally, to create incentives for States to develop policies that \nwould facilitate license reciprocity and portability.\n  Although this bill would not mandate that model teaching standards be \nadopted by the states, the trends demonstrate that widespread adoption \nis likely. For instance, after INTASC developed model teaching \nstandards in 1992, 38 States adopted the standards in developing their \nown statewide standards. Over 20 States are reviewing the NCTM \nCurriculum Focal Points to develop mathematics curriculum standards. \nOver 22 States currently rely on the same standardized teaching \ncredentialing test, and another 10 adopt a second widely available \ntest. The availability of model 21st century teaching standards could \nhave a profound influence on K-12 education nationwide, and this bill \nwould provide incentives for States to adopt and test these standards.\n  An added benefit of available model teaching standards concerns \nreciprocal teacher certification across States, which could address \nteacher shortages and curriculum cohesion across states. Nationally, \nabout 20 percent of teachers seek their initial license in a state \nother than where they completed their teacher training. This bill would \nimprove the capacity of States to collaboratively address teacher \nshortages through increased teacher certification reciprocity, by \npromoting alignment of the teaching standards with State licensing \nsystems.\n  Finally, the availability of widely used model standards would \nsupport a platform for horizontal coherence of teaching and curriculum \nstandards. A State's voluntary use of updated rigorous standards would \npromote core similarities that offer additional benefits for mobile \nstudents who suffer setbacks when faced with inconsistent curriculum.\n  Student mobility, defined as the percentage of students who transfer \nin or out of a school during a given school year, occurs in both inner-\ncity and suburban school districts. Rates in inner city schools range \nfrom 45 to as high as 80 percent. In suburban schools, mobility rates \nmay be as high as 10 to 40 percent. Although overall mobility indices \nin the U.S. are not rising, the percentage of moves that occur across \nstate lines has increased from approximately 16 to 19 percent since \n2000. When children change schools, they often must adapt to a \ndifferent curriculum; and lack of curriculum cohesion is believed to \naccount for several negative consequences. Children who experience \nseveral school changes are more likely to receive below-grade level \nreading and math achievement scores than their peers who have never \nchanged schools; they are also more prone to grade retention, and have \nan increased high school dropout rate.\n  I believe this legislation can go a long way in improving our \nNation's educational achievement rates by improving teacher quality and \nlicensing portability. I also believe that this legislation is critical \nto strengthening our global competitiveness because quality teaching is \na route to helping students meet high standards. I hope that this \nlegislation will be included in the reauthorization of the Elementary \nand Secondary Education Act of 1965, as amended, and I urge my \ncolleagues to support this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \na letter of support be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2496\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Jeff Bingaman,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bingaman: The undersigned organizations would \n     like to thank you for introducing the Enhancing Teaching \n     Standards and License Portability Act of 2007 and express our \n     support for this critical bill. Our education system can only \n     be successful if every child receives instruction from high-\n     quality teachers with the most up-to-date skills and \n     knowledge. The education community has been working \n     diligently to improve teaching in this country, and this act \n     will continue to move these efforts forward. We believe \n     firmly in the goals of this bill:\n       Supporting development of rigorous kindergarten through \n     grade 12 teaching standards that incorporate 21st century \n     learning skills.\n       Creating incentives for states to: adopt, pilot, and, \n     implement rigorous kindergarten through grade 12 teaching \n     standards; align teacher licensing systems to the rigorous \n     kindergarten through grade 12 teaching standards; and, \n     develop policies to facilitate teacher license portability \n     across states in order to improve the capacity of states to \n     collaboratively address teacher shortages.\n       We support rigorous and relevant teaching standards that \n     provide high expectations for what our teachers should know \n     and be able to do. These standards and the aligned licensing \n     systems will further assist teacher preparation programs in \n     how to most effectively prepare teachers for today's \n     classrooms and ensure that our students are taught only by \n     high-quality teachers. Also, as we work to address teacher \n     shortages and as our society grows increasingly mobile, there \n     is great need for teacher license portability across states. \n     States have been working on teacher license portability \n     measures, and this bill will further build on these \n     initiatives. Overall, this act will help elevate the teaching \n     profession in this country so every child has access to a \n     world-class education.\n       Thank you for your leadership on this important issue, and \n     we look forward to continuing to work with you on improving \n     teaching in America.\n           Sincerely,\n       American Association of Colleges for Teacher Education.\n       Council of Chief State School Officers.\n       International Reading Association.\n       National Association of Secondary School Principals.\n       National Commission on Teaching and America's Future.\n       National Council of Teachers of Mathematics.\n       National Science Teachers Association.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself and Mr. Domenici):\n  S. 2498. A bill to authorize the minting of a coin to commemorate the \n400th anniversary of the founding of Santa Fe, New Mexico, to occur in \n2010; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill to \nauthorize the minting of a commemorative coin in recognition of the \n400th anniversary of the Spanish arrival in Santa Fe, NM. This bill has \nthe strong support of the entire New Mexico delegation and is co-\nsponsored by Senator Domenici and a companion bill will be introduced \nin the House by Representative Tom Udall.\n  In 2010, the City of Santa Fe will commemorate the arrival of Spanish \nsettlers and the designation of the City of Santa Fe as the capital \ncity of the Spanish territory now known as New Mexico. On their arrival \nthe Spaniards found a thriving Native American culture. These native \nAmerican and Spanish cultures served to enrich each other and led to a \ncreation of a vibrant social, cultural, and financial center that made \nthe settlement of the western U.S. possible. Although it was not always \na smooth road it is the unique combination of the Spanish, native \nAmerican, and Anglo cultures in Santa Fe that make it an American \ntreasure. Santa Fe has long been heralded for its thriving arts \ncommunity, as a world class travel destination, and for its natural \nbeauty. These treasures and its proud history as a cultural meeting \nplace make Santa Fe worthy of the national recognition of a \ncommemorative coin. I urge all Senators to support this bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2498\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Santa Fe 400th Anniversary \n     Commemorative Coin Act of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Santa Fe, New Mexico, the site of native occupation \n     centuries before European incursions, was officially elevated \n     from a plaza established in 1608 to a villa and capital city \n     in 1610. Santa Fe has been the meeting place and home of many \n     cultures.\n       (2) The Palace of the Governors, built in the early 17th \n     century served as the governor's quarters and the seat of \n     government under 3 flags. It is the oldest continuously used \n     public building in the United States.\n       (3) La Fiesta de Santa Fe, a cultural, religious, and \n     social celebration, commemorating the resettlement of Santa \n     Fe by General Don Diego de Vargas in 1692 continues today as \n     an attraction for tourists and locals alike.\n       (4) At the nexus of 3 historically important trails, Santa \n     Fe brought people and goods together over the Santa Fe Trail \n     to and from Missouri, California, and Mexico City.\n       (5) Commerce on the Santa Fe Trail brought a much needed \n     boost to the economy of the American West during the \n     recession of the early 19th century. Santa Fe was the \n     rendezvous place for traders, mountain men and forty-niners \n     on route to California, and is today home to a multicultural \n     citizenry and world class art market.\n       (6) The Santa Fe area is a center of market activity for \n     arts and culture year round, culminating in the world \n     renowned Indian Market, Spanish Colonial Art Market, and \n     International Folk Art Market.\n       (7) New Mexico is the home to the oldest and continuously \n     inhabited indigenous communities in North America. Native \n     communities now residing in New Mexico include--\n       (A) Acoma Pueblo;\n       (B) Alamo Navajo Chapter;\n       (C) Canoncito Navajo Chapter;\n\n[[Page S15917]]\n\n       (D) Cochiti Pueblo;\n       (E) Isleta Pueblo;\n       (F) Jemez Pueblo;\n       (G) Jicarilla Apache Tribe;\n       (H) Laguna Pueblo;\n       (I) Mescalero Apache Tribe;\n       (J) Nambe Pueblo;\n       (K) Picuris Pueblo;\n       (L) Pojoaque Pueblo;\n       (M) Ramah Navaho Chapter;\n       (N) San Felipe Pueblo;\n       (O) San Ildefonso Pueblo;\n       (P) San Juan Pueblo;\n       (Q) Sandia Pueblo;\n       (R) Santa Ana Pueblo;\n       (S) Santa Clara Pueblo;\n       (T) Santo Domingo Pueblo;\n       (U) Taos Pueblo;\n       (V) Tesuque Pueblo;\n       (W) Zia Pueblo;\n       (X) Zuni Pueblo; and\n       (Y) many others that disappeared or were moved after \n     European contact.\n       (8) The Pueblo Revolt of 1680 is known to be one of the \n     first ``American Revolutions'' when the Pueblo people ousted \n     Spanish colonists from New Mexico.\n       (9) The Santa Fe area has long attracted tourists, artists, \n     and writers. The classic novel Ben Hur was written, in part, \n     by then Governor Lew Wallace, in the Palace of the Governors.\n       (10) A commemorative coin will help to foster an \n     understanding and appreciation of New Mexico, its history and \n     culture and the importance of Santa Fe and New Mexico to the \n     history of the United States and the world.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to provide fair compensation to artists for use of \ntheir sound recordings; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. Presdient, today, Senator Hatch and I are, once again, \nintroducing important intellectual property legislation together. We \nare introducing the Performance Rights Act of 2007 for a very simple \nand clear reason: artists should be compensated fairly for the use of \ntheir work.\n  I am an avid music fan. Music entertains, enlightens, and inspires \nus. Much of the music enjoyed by most Americans, including myself, was \nfirst heard on traditional, over-the-air radio. There is no question \nthat radio play promotes artists and their sound recordings; there is \nalso no doubt that radio stations profit directly from playing the \nartists' recordings.\n  When radio stations broadcast music, listeners are enjoying the \nintellectual property of two creative artists the songwriter and the \nperformer. The success, and the artistic quality, of any recorded song \ndepends on both. Radio stations pay songwriters for a license to \nbroadcast the music they have composed. That is proper, and that is \nfair. The songwriters' work is promoted by the air play, but no one \nseriously questions that the songwriter should be paid for the use of \nhis or her work.\n  But the performing artist is not paid by the radio station. The time \nhas come to end this inequity. Its historical justification has been \novertaken by technological change; the economics of the radio industry \nof years past has been superseded by entirely new business models. \nWebcasters compensate performing artists, satellite radio compensates \nperforming artists, and cable companies compensate performing artists; \nonly terrestrial broadcasters still do not pay for the use of sound \nrecordings. Artists should have the same rights regardless of whether \nit is a terrestrial broadcaster or a webcaster using and profiting from \ntheir work. Radio play may have promotional value to the artist, but \nthere\n\n[[Page S15918]]\n\nis a property right in the sound recording, and those that create the \ncontent should be compensated for its use.\n  In ensuring artists are compensated, two other principles important \nto me are reflected in this legislation. First, noncommercial and small \ncommercial radio stations should be nurtured, and not threatened by a \nchange in the law. Second, songwriters, who now are, as they should be, \npaid for use of their work should not have their rights diminished in \nany way.\n  The legislation we introduce today on a bipartisan basis, along with \ncompanion bipartisan legislation being introduced today in the House of \nRepresentatives, provides that artists will be compensated by \nbroadcasters for the use of their work. Noncommercial stations--from \nVermont Public Radio which broadcasts ``Saturday Afternoon at the \nOpera,'' to the campus radio station at St. Michael's college that \nplays ``Those Monday Blues'' and ``The Odds and Evens Jazz Show''--have \na different mission than commercial stations, and therefore need a \ndifferent status, one that will subject the stations only to a nominal \nflat fee for use of sound recordings. Commercial radio stations that \nhave a revenue under $1.25 million, which comprises roughly three-\nfourths of all music radio stations, will also have a flat fee option.\n  Traditional, over-the-air radio remains vital to the vibrancy of our \nmusic culture, and I want to continue to see it prosper as it \ntransitions to digital. But I also want to ensure that the performing \nartist the one whose sound recordings drive the success of broadcast \nradio is fairly compensated.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2500\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for the \nPerformance Rights Act of 2007, S. 2500, introduced today by Judiciary \nCommittee chairman Patrick Leahy and myself. There is no doubt the \nsubject of performance rights is important and deserves the Senate's \nattention.\n  I recognize that there is no easy solution to the performance rights \nissue because it is a complex area of the law. However, I believe the \ntime has come for Congress to begin the process of balancing the \ninterests of all involved and forging a fair and reasonable compromise.\n  I have had the opportunity to get to know some of the finest and \ntalented individuals this country has to offer. Some are under the \nwrong impression that artists in the music industry are making a \nfortune, but they are not aware that all too often it is a struggle to \nsurvive for the overwhelming majority of them in the cut-throat music \nindustry.\n  By amending sections 106 and 114 of the Copyright Act, the \nPerformance Rights Act of 2007 would apply the performance right in a \nsound recording to all audio transmissions thereby removing the \nexemption on paying performance royalties currently in place for over-\nthe-air broadcasters.\n  The legislation also provides for a blanket license of $5,000 for \nsmall commercial broadcasters whose gross revenues do not exceed $1.25 \nmillion a year. In addition, noncommercial broadcasters as defined by \nsection 118 of the Copyright Act, such as public, educational and \nreligious stations would have a blanket license of $1,000 per year. No \npayment would be due until the Copyright Royalty Board determines the \nrates for large commercial broadcasters. The proposed language provides \nthat sound recordings used only incidentally by a broadcaster and sound \nrecordings used in the transmission of a religious service are exempt.\n  S. 2500 further includes a per program license option for terrestrial \nbroadcast stations that make limited feature uses of sound recordings. \nFinally, the legislation strengthens the provision in section 114 that \npreserves the rights of songwriters and clarifies that nothing in the \nPerformance Rights Act of 2007 shall adversely affect the public \nperformance rights of songwriters or copyright owners of musical works.\n  I believe in the legislative process and hope that concerns raised by \ninterested parties can be resolved in a fair and equitable manner. I do \nnot have an ax to grind, nor do I want to hurt any industry. To my \nfriends in the broadcasting community, let me say that I am acutely \naware of your circumstances and concerns, and I cannot stress enough \nthat my primary goal is to make sure that Congress handles this in the \nmost even-handed way. Let me also stress that I look upon creating a \nperformance right in a sound recording to all audio transmissions as \nthe first step in addressing some of the major issues affecting the \nmusic industry. And I look forward to working closely with Chairman \nLeahy and my\n\n[[Page S15919]]\n\ncolleagues in carefully considering what additional measures are \nneeded.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA (for himself and Mr. Inouye):\n  S. 2502. A bill to provide for the establishment of a memorial within \nKalaupapa National Historical Park located on the island of Molokai, in \nthe States of Hawaii, to honor and perpetuate the memory of those \nindividuals who were forcibly relocated to the Kalaupapa Peninsula from \n1866 to 1969, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to submit legislation that \nprovides for the establishment of a memorial within Kalaupapa National \nHistorical Park, in the State of Hawaii, to honor and perpetuate the \nmemory of those Hansen's disease patients who were forcibly relocated \nto the Kalaupapa Peninsula from 1866 to 1969.\n  This tragedy began in 1865 when the Kingdom of Hawai`i instituted a \ncentury-long policy of forced segregation of those afflicted with \nHansen's disease, also known as leprosy. Land was set aside in order to \nseclude those who were thought to be capable of spreading the disease. \nKalaupapa was chosen due to its' isolated and inaccessible location. To \nthe south, Kalaupapa faces sheer cliffs with over 2,000 feet in height. \nTo the east, north, and west, Kalaupapa is surrounded by an often-\ntemperamental ocean.\n  During this period of time, over 8,000 people were sent there, of \nwhich, only about 1,300 graves have been identified. Most of those who \nwere sent to Kalaupapa before 1900 have no marked graves. Others were \nburied in places marked with a cross or a bare tombstone, but those \nmarkers have seen great deterioration over time. As a result, there are \nmany family members and descendants of these residents who cannot find \nthe graves of their loved ones and are unable to properly honor and pay \ntribute to them.\n  This monument is to provide closure and a sense of belonging to these \nmany family members, who have no knowledge of their ancestors' \nwhereabouts. Through this monument, the more than 8,000 Hansen's \ndisease patients will forever be memorialized as having been a part of \nthe history of Kalaupapa. It also allows the world to recognize and \nlearn from the tragedy that took place on Kalaupapa, where mothers were \ntaken from their children, husbands from their wives, and children from \ntheir parents.\n  There are a few remaining patients of Kalaupapa alive today, and time \nis running short. For them to live to see this monument, and the memory \nof their friends and those that preceded them honored in this manner, \nwould mean so much. It will help to guarantee that the legacy of \nKalaupapa will live on, and continue to be passed from one generation \nto the next.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. CANTWELL:\n  S. 2505. A bill to allow employees of a commercial passenger airline \ncarrier who receive payments in a bankruptcy proceeding to roll over \nsuch payments into an individual retirement plan, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, in the wake of the terrorist attacks of \nSeptember 11, 2001, the air travel industry has suffered tremendous \neconomic hardship. In particular, airline workers have been forced to \ntake cuts in pay and benefits which have dramatically reduced their \nfinancial security now and in their retirement years.\n  Airline pilots and other union airline employees have lost in excess \nof $30 billion in pay and over $7 billion in defined benefit pension \nbenefits. In addition, many airline workers have lost their jobs. For \nexample, on September 11, 2001, there were 10,500 active Delta pilots. \nToday, there are 6,700.\n  Since the attacks, many of our Nation's airlines were forced to file \nfor bankruptcy--and terminate or freeze their defined benefit pension \nplans. The largest of these airline bankruptcies involved United \nAirlines, U.S. Airways, Delta Air Lines and Northwest Airlines. In all \nof these bankruptcies, a huge share of the cost savings was borne by \nthe airline employees, who suffered massive cuts in pay and benefits.\n  In 2001, Congressional relief focused on the airline carriers, \noffering loan packages and other economic relief. In 2004 and 2006, \nCongress provided additional assistance to those airline carriers that \nwere able to avoid termination of their defined benefit plans. However, \npast Congressional actions will never restore the lost retirement \nbenefits for those airline workers whose defined benefit plans were \nterminated or frozen.\n  This is an important point to emphasize. The actions already taken by \nthe Congress to provide economic relief to the airlines and to reduce \ntheir future pension contributions for the continuing plans do not \nrestore benefits to those airline workers who lost pension benefits in \nplans that were terminated or frozen.\n  Therefore, I rise to introduce the Lost Retirement Savings Act of \n2007 to provide for a retirement savings option to those airline \nworkers whose defined benefit plans were terminated or frozen in \nbankruptcy proceedings.\n  Under the bill, these airline workers would benefit to the extent \nthat they would individually choose to rollover specified bankruptcy \npayments into a traditional or Roth individual retirement account. The \nintent is to provide this retirement savings opportunity only to those \nairline employees for whom the bankruptcies imposed an economic burden \nthrough the substantial loss of wages and retirement benefits.\n  In closing, I urge my Senate colleagues to take a close look at this \nbill and join me in passing this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \na bill summary be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2505\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

eligible \n     rollover amount, and\n       (2) the qualified airline employee transfers any portion of \n     such amount to an individual retirement plan (as defined in \n     section 7701(a)(37) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) \n     within 180 days of receipt of such amount (or, if later, \n     within 180 days of the date of the enactment of this Act),\n     then, except as provided in subsection (b), such amount (to \n     the extent so transferred) shall not be includible in gross \n     income for the taxable year in which paid.\n       (b) Transfers to Roth IRAs.--\n       (1) In general.--If a transfer described in subsection (a) \n     is made to a Roth IRA (as defined in section 408A of the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986), then--\n       (A) 50 percent of the portion of any eligible rollover \n     amount so transferred shall be includible in gross income in \n     the first taxable year following the taxable year in which \n     the eligible rollover amount was paid, and\n       (B) 50 percent of such portion shall be includible in gross \n     income in the second taxable year following the taxable year \n     in which the eligible rollover amount was paid.\n       (2) Election to include in income in year of payment.--\n     Notwithstanding paragraph (1), a qualified airline employee \n     may elect to include any portion so transferred in gross \n     income in the taxable year in which the eligible rollover \n     amount was paid.\n       (3) Income limitations not to apply.--The limitations \n     described in section 408A(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code \n     of 1986 shall not apply to a transfer to which paragraph (1) \n     or (2) applies.\n       (c) Treatment of Eligible Rollover Amounts and Transfers.--\n       (1) Treatment of eligible rollover amounts for employment \n     taxes.--For purposes of chapter 21 of the Internal Revenue \n     Code of 1986 and section 209 of the Social Security Act, an \n     eligible rollover amount shall not fail to be treated as a \n     payment of wages by the commercial passenger airline carrier \n     to the qualified airline employee in the taxable year of \n     payment because such amount is not includible in gross income \n     by reason of subsection (a) or is includible in income in a \n     subsequent taxable year by reason of subsection (b).\n       (2) Treatment of rollovers.--A transfer under subsection \n     (a) shall be treated as a rollover contribution described in \n     section 408(d)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, \n     except that in the case of a transfer to which subsection (b) \n     applies, the transfer shall be treated as a qualified \n     rollover contribution described in section 408A(e) of such \n     Code.\n       (d) Definitions and Special Rules.--For purposes of this \n     section--\n       (1) Eligible rollover amount.--\n       (A) In general.--The term ``eligible rollover amount'' \n     means any payment of any money or other property which is \n     payable by a commercial passenger airline carrier to a \n     qualified airline employee--\n       (i) under the approval of an order of a

obligation of the carrier to pay a \n     lump sum amount.\n\n       (B) Exception.--An eligible rollover amount shall not \n     include any amount payable on the basis of the carrier's \n     future earnings or profits.\n       (2) Qualified airline employee.--The term ``qualified \n     airline employee'' means an employee or former employee of a \n     commercial passenger airline carrier who was a participant in \n     a defined benefit plan maintained by the carrier which--\n       (A) is a plan described in section 401(a) of the Internal \n     Revenue Code of 1986 which includes a trust exempt from tax \n     under section 501(a) of such Code, and\n       (B) was terminated or became subject to the restrictions \n     contained in paragraphs (2) and (3) of section 402(b) of the

employees to whom such amounts were paid, and\n       (B) to the Secretary and to such employees, the years and \n     the amounts of the payments.\n     Such reports shall be in such form, and contain such \n     additional information, as the Secretary of the Treasury may \n     prescribe.\n       (e) Effective Date.--This section shall apply to transfers \n     made after the date of the enactment of this Act with respect \n     to eligible rollover amounts paid before, on, or after such \n     date.\n                                  ____\n\n\n           Summary of the Lost Retirement Savings Act of 2007\n\n\n Rollover of Distributions Received by Airline Employees in Respect of \n             Bankruptcy Claims, Notes or Fixed Obligations\n\n       If a qualified airline

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to provide \nrevised standards for quality assurance in screening and evaluation of \ngynecologic cytology preparations, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce today with my \ncolleague, Senator Johnny Isakson, the Cytology Proficiency Improvement \nAct of 2007. This bipartisan legislation enhances women's health by \nestablishing an annual continuing medical education, CME, proficiency \nrequirement for pathologists and laboratory professionals who read Pap \ntests to screen for cervical cancer. The legislation would enhance our \nfight against this disease by giving women confidence in their Pap test \nresults. Women in my State of Louisiana and across the country deserve \nno less.\n  Specifically, our legislation would require individuals who examine \nPap test slides to participate annually in an outcome-based CME program \nto evaluate their interpretative skills. This educational testing \nprogram would keep pace with cutting edge advances in science and \ntechnology. Health professionals would be challenged with complex, \ndifficult cases and would learn through constructive feedback. The bill \nwould also require that laboratory directors utilize the CME testing \nresults to help assess the performance of their laboratory personnel \nand take corrective action as appropriate. Finally, the bill would \nrequire that the CME results be reviewed by accrediting organizations \nas part of federally mandated inspections of laboratories to evaluate \nPap test quality.\n  In 1988, Congress requested that a cytology, Pap test, proficiency \nprogram be established as part of The Clinical Laboratory Improvement \nAmendments, CLIA. However, the program lay dormant until 2005 when the \nCenters for Medicare and Medicaid, CMS, finally implemented a program. \nUnfortunately, the program was implemented using 1992 regulations--now \n15 years old--and no longer relevant to real world practice. The bill \nwe are introducing today would modernize and replace the current \nprogram so we can help raise the bar of quality in diagnosing cervical \ncancer. It would compliment the already extensive Federal quality \ncontrol standards for Pap tests under CLIA.\n  Without a doubt, regular Pap tests save women's lives. We need to \nmake sure that the Federal Government's efforts to combat cervical \ncancer are the most effective they can be. This bill helps to do just \nthat. I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this women's \nhealth issue.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2510\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the grant program for law enforcement armor \nvests top provide for a waiver of or reduction in the matching funds \nrequirements in the case of fiscal hardship; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce a bill that will \nhelp will build upon our efforts to improve the Bulletproof Vest \nPartnership Grant Act, which has had so much success in protecting the \nlives of law enforcement officers across the country. The bill \nintroduced today provides a need-based waiver of matching requirements \nthat will aid State and local law enforcement agencies in financial \nhardship purchase body armor for their officers. I thank Senators \nClinton, Mikulski, Shelby, and Landrieu for joining me to introduce \nthis bill to give our law enforcement officers the protection they \nneed.\n  I was proud to work with Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell to author \nthe Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act of 1998, which responded to \nthe tragic Carl Drega shootout in 1997 on the Vermont-New Hampshire \nborder when two state troopers who did not have bulletproof vests were \nkilled. The Federal officers who responded to the scenes of the \nshooting spree were equipped with life-saving body armor, but the State \nand local law enforcement officers lacked protective vests because of \nthe cost. Since its inception in 1999, I have worked to reauthorize \nthis program three times, most recently in the 2005 Violence Against \nWomen and Department of Justice Reauthorization bill.\n  Since 1999, the BVP program has provided $173 million to purchase an \nestimated 500,000 vests in more than 11,500 jurisdictions nationwide. \nVermont has received more than $600,000 in bulletproof vest funding \nunder this program, which has been used to purchase 2700 vests \nstatewide.\n  I want to thank Senators Mikulski and Shelby for continuing to \nrecognize this program as a priority. As Chair and Ranking Member of \nthe Appropriations Subcommittee that finalizes Justice Department \nspending priorities, they saw fit to include more than $25 million for \nthe Bulletproof Vest Program in the fiscal year 2008 Consolidated \nOmnibus Appropriations bill.\n  Bulletproof vests remain one of the foremost defenses for our \nuniformed officers, but law enforcement agencies nationwide are \nstruggling over how to find the funds necessary to replace either aged \nvests, which have a life expectancy of roughly 5 years, or purchase new \nvests for newly hired officers. We want to ensure that our law \nenforcement officers are outfitted with vests that will actually stop \nbullets and save lives. Vests cost between $500 and $1,000 each, \ndepending on the style. Officers are being forced to dip into their own \npockets to pay for new vests due to local and State agency budget \nshortfalls, and will continue to do so unless the Federal Government \noffers more help.\n  The bill we introduce today will give discretion to the Director of \nthe Bureau of Justice Assistance within the Justice Department to grant \nwaivers or reductions in the match requirements for bulletproof vests \nawards to State and local law enforcement agencies that can demonstrate \nfiscal hardship. Our local law enforcement agencies are constantly \nresponding to new challenges, from fighting a recent rise in violent \ncrime to responding to threats of terrorism, and many localities lack \nthe resources to effectively combat these challenges. Waiving the match \nrequirement for life-saving body armor should be available for police \nagencies like those in New Orleans, on the Gulf Coast, or in other \nareas that experience disasters or other circumstances that create \nfiscal hardships.\n  A tragic event in Tennessee in 2005 highlights the need for this \nlegislation. Wayne ``Cotton'' Morgan, a Tennessee correctional officer \nwas gunned down on August 9, 2005, outside the Kingston Court House by \nthe wife of an inmate being escorted by Officer Morgan. He was killed, \nand the prisoner and his wife escaped. Officer Morgan was not wearing a \nbulletproof vest, although he repeatedly requested one from the warden \nat Brushy Mountain Prison. The Tennessee Department of Corrections \nAdministrative Policies and Procedures memorandum required that fitted \nvests be provided to individuals assigned to transportation duties. \nDespite this requirement and Officer Morgan's repeated requests, he was \nnot issued a vest due to lack of funding. This legislation will help \nensure that no officer is left without a bulletproof vest for lack of \nresources in his or her department.\n  Our law enforcement officers deserve the fundamental protection that \nbulletproof vests can provide. Few things mean more to me than when I \nmeet Vermont police officers and they tell me that the protective vests \nthey wear were made possible because of the Bulletproof Vests \nPartnership Program. This is the least we should do for the officers on \nthe front lines who put themselves in danger for us every day. I want \nto make sure that every police officer who needs a bulletproof vest \ngets one.\n  I look forward to working with the Senate to pass this bipartisan \nbill to better to protect our law enforcement officers.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2511\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Schriever;\n       Whereas the USAF, employing the first large-scale combat \n     use of jet aircraft, helped to establish air superiority over \n     the Korean peninsula, protected ground forces of the United \n     Nations with close air support, and interdicted enemy \n     reinforcements and supplies during the conflict in Korea;\n       Whereas after the development of launch vehicles and \n     orbital satellites, the mission of the USAF expanded into \n     space and today provides exceptional real-time global \n     communications, environmental monitoring, navigation, \n     precision timing, missile warning, nuclear deterrence, and \n     space surveillance;\n       Whereas USAF Airmen have contributed to the manned space \n     program of the United States since the program's inception \n     and throughout the program's development at the National \n     Aeronautics and Space Administration by dedicating themselves \n     wholly to space exploration despite the risks of exploration;\n       Whereas the USAF engaged in a limited campaign of air power \n     to assist the South Vietnamese government in countering the \n     communist Viet Cong guerillas during the Vietnam War and \n     fought to disrupt supply lines, halt enemy ground offensives, \n     and protect United States and Allied forces;\n       Whereas Airmen were imprisoned and tortured during the \n     Vietnam War and, in the valiant tradition of Airmen held \n     captive in previous conflicts, continued serving the United \n     States with honor and dignity under the most inhumane \n     circumstances;\n       Whereas, in recent decades, the USAF and coalition partners \n     of the United States have supported successful actions in \n     Panama, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Kosovo, Iraq, Afghanistan, and \n     many other locations around the globe;\n       Whereas Pacific Air Forces, along with Asia-Pacific \n     partners of the United States, ensure peace and advance \n     freedom from the west coast of the United States to the east \n     coast of Africa and from the Arctic to the Antarctic, \n     covering more than 100 million square miles and the homes of \n     2 billion people in 44 countries;\n       Whereas the United States Air Forces in Europe, along with \n     European partners of the\n\n[[Page S15925]]\n\n     United States, have shaped the history of Europe from World \n     War II, the Cold War, Operation Deliberate Force, and \n     Operation Allied Force to today's operations, and secured \n     stability and ensured freedom's future in the Europe, Africa, \n     and Southwest Asia;\n       Whereas, for 17 consecutive years beginning with 1990, \n     Airmen have been engaged in full-time combat operations \n     ranging from Desert Shield to Iraqi Freedom, and have shown \n     themselves to be an expeditionary air and space force of \n     outstanding capability ready to fight and win wars of the \n     United States when and where Airmen are called upon to do so;\n       Whereas the USAF is steadfast in its commitment to field a \n     world-class, expeditionary air force by recruiting, training, \n     and educating its Total Force of active duty, Air National \n     Guard, Air Force Reserve, and civilian personnel;\n       Whereas the USAF is a steward of resources, developing and \n     applying technology, managing acquisition programs, and \n     maintaining test, evaluation, and sustainment criteria for \n     all USAF weapon systems throughout such weapon systems' life \n     cycles;\n       Whereas, when terrorists attacked the United States on \n     September 11, 2001, USAF fighter and air refueling aircraft \n     took to the skies to fly combat air patrols over major United \n     States cities and protect families, friends, and neighbors of \n     people of the United States from further attack;\n       Whereas, on December 7, 2005, the USAF modified its mission \n     statement to include flying and fighting in cyberspace and \n     prioritized the development, maintenance, and sustainment of \n     war fighting capabilities to deliver unrestricted access to \n     cyberspace and defend the United States and its global \n     interests;\n       Whereas Airmen around the world are committed to fighting \n     and winning the Global War on Terror and have flown more than \n     430,000 sorties to precisely target and engage insurgents who \n     attempt to violently disrupt rebuilding in Iraq and \n     Afghanistan;\n       Whereas talented and dedicated Airmen will meet the future \n     challenges of an ever-changing world with strength and \n     resolve;\n       Whereas the USAF, together with its joint partners, will \n     continue to be the United States' leading edge in the ongoing \n     fight to ensure the safety and security of the United States; \n     and\n       Whereas during the past 60 years, the USAF has repeatedly \n     proved its value to the Nation, fulfilling its critical role \n     in national defense, and protecting peace, liberty, and \n     freedom throughout the world: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate, That the Senate remembers, honors, \n     and commends the achievements of the United States Air Force \n     in serving and defending the United States on the 60th \n     anniversary of the creation of the United States Air Force as \n     an independent military service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/18/senate-section/article/S15925-1", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15925]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 59--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE CONGRESS \nTHAT JOINT CUSTODY LAWS FOR FIT PARENTS SHOULD BE PASSED BY EACH STATE, \n SO THAT MORE CHILDREN ARE RAISED WITH THE BENEFITS OF HAVING A FATHER \n                      AND A MOTHER IN THEIR LIVES\n\n  Mr. AKAKA submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 59\n\n       Whereas, in approximately 84 percent of the cases where a \n     parent is absent, that parent is the father;\n       Whereas, if current trends continue, half of all children \n     born today will live apart from one of their parents, usually \n     their father, at some point before they turn 18 years old;\n       Whereas when families (whether intact or with a parent \n     absent) are living in poverty, a significant factor is often \n     the father's lack of job skills;\n       Whereas committed and responsible fathering during infancy \n     and early childhood contributes to the development of \n     emotional security, curiosity, and math and verbal skills;\n       Whereas an estimated 19,400,000 children (27 percent) live \n     apart from their biological fathers;\n       Whereas 40 percent of the children under age 18 not living \n     with their biological fathers had not seen their fathers even \n     once in the past 12 months, according to national survey \n     data;\n       Whereas single parents are to be commended for the \n     tremendous job that they do with their children;\n       Whereas the United States needs to encourage responsible \n     parenting by both fathers and mothers, whenever possible;\n       Whereas the United States needs to encourage both parents, \n     as well as extended families, to be actively involved in \n     children's lives;\n       Whereas a way to encourage active involvement is to \n     encourage joint custody and shared parenting;\n       Whereas the American Bar Association found in 1997 that 19 \n     States plus the District of Columbia had some form of \n     presumption for joint custody, either legal, physical, or \n     both, and by 2006, 13 additional States had added some form \n     of presumption, bringing the current total to 32 States plus \n     the District of Columbia;\n       Whereas data from the Census Bureau shows a correlation \n     between joint custody and shared parenting and a higher rate \n     of payment of child support;\n       Whereas social science literature shows that a higher \n     proportion of children from intact families with 2 parents in \n     the home are well adjusted, and research also shows that for \n     children of divorced, separated, and never married parents, \n     joint custody is strongly associated with positive outcomes \n     for children on important measures of adjustment and well \n     being; and\n       Whereas research by the Department of Health and Human \n     Services shows that the States with the highest amount of \n     joint custody subsequently had the lowest divorce rate: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of the Congress that joint \n     custody laws for fit parents should be passed by each State, \n     so that more children are raised with the benefits of having \n     a father and a mother in their lives.\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to submit legislation \nexpressing the sense of the Congress that States should enact joint \ncustody laws for fit parents, so that more children are raised with the \nbenefit of having both parents in their lives.\n  One of the most significant problems facing our Nation today is the \nnumber of children being raised without the love and support of both \nparents. Even if it is not possible for the parents to remain in a \ncommitted partnership, it is important that, when possible, each \nparent, as well as their extended families, have every opportunity to \nplay an active role in their children's life. A number of recent \nstudies have suggested that children greatly benefit from joint custody \nor shared parenting arrangements. In my own home State of Hawaii, it is \na way of life to have our keiki, or children, raised and nurtured by \nthe extended family, and we have seen how our children flourish when \nthe responsibility of child rearing is shared.\n  This Nation's children are our most vital resource, and every effort \nshould be made to ensure that they receive the guidance and \nencouragement they need to thrive. I urge States to pass joint custody \nlaws for fit parents so all children can be raised within the extended \nembrace of both parents and their families.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/18/senate-section/article/S15925-2", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15925-S15926]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 60--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF CONGRESS \n   RELATING TO NEGOTIATING A FREE TRADE AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE UNITED \n                           STATES AND TAIWAN\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS (for himself and Mr. Kyl) submitted the following \nconcurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Finance:\n\n                            S.

Res. 416\n\n       Whereas President Harry S Truman signed the National \n     Security Act of 1947 on July 26, 1947, to realign and \n     reorganize the Armed Forces and to create a separate \n     Department of the Air Force from the existing military \n     services;\n       Whereas the National Security Act of 1947 was enacted on \n     September 18, 1947;\n       Whereas the Aeronautical Division of the United States Army \n     Signal Corps, consisting of one officer and two enlisted men, \n     began operation under the command of Captain Charles DeForest \n     Chandler on August 1, 1907, with the responsibility for ``all \n     matters pertaining to military ballooning, air machines, and \n     all kindred subjects'';\n       Whereas in 1908, the Department of War contracted with the \n     Wright brothers to build one heavier-than-air flying machine \n     for the United States Army, and accepted the Wright Military \n     Flyer, the world's first military airplane, in 1909;\n       Whereas United States pilots, flying with both allied air \n     forces and with the Army Air Service, performed admirably in \n     the course of World War I, participating in pursuit, \n     observation, and day and night bombing missions;\n       Whereas pioneering aviators of the United States, including \n     Mason M. Patrick, William ``Billy'' Mitchell, Benjamin D. \n     Foulois, Frank M. Andrews, Henry ``Hap'' Arnold, James \n     ``Jimmy'' H. Doolittle, and Edward ``Eddie'' Rickenbacker, \n     were among the first to recognize the military potential of \n     air power and courageously forged the foundations for the \n     creation of an independent arm for air forces in the United \n     States in the decades following World War I;\n       Whereas on June 20, 1941, the Department of War created the \n     Army Air Forces (AAF) as its aviation element and shortly \n     thereafter the Department of War made the AAF co-equal to the \n     Army Ground Forces;\n       Whereas General Henry H. ``Hap'' Arnold drew upon the \n     industrial prowess and human resources of the United States \n     to transform the Army Air Corps from a force of 22,400 men \n     and 2,402 aircraft in 1939 to a peak wartime strength of 2.4 \n     million personnel and 79,908 aircraft;\n       Whereas the standard for courage, flexibility, and \n     intrepidity in combat was established for all Airmen during \n     the first aerial raid in the Pacific Theater on April 18, \n     1942, when Lieutenant Colonel James ``Jimmy'' H.

Stuart Symington became \n     the first Secretary of the newly formed and independent \n     United States Air Force (USAF), and on September 26, 1947, \n     General Carl A. Spaatz became the first Chief of Staff of the \n     USAF;\n       Whereas the Air National Guard was also created by the \n     National Security Act of 1947 and has played a vital role in \n     guarding the United States and defending freedom in nearly \n     every major conflict and contingency since its inception;\n       Whereas on October 14, 1947, the USAF demonstrated its \n     historic and ongoing commitment to technological innovation \n     when Captain Charles ``Chuck'' Yeager piloted the X-1 \n     developmental rocket plane to a speed of Mach 1.07, becoming \n     the first flyer to break the sound barrier in a powered \n     aircraft in level flight;\n       Whereas the USAF Reserve, created April 14, 1948, is \n     comprised of Citizen Airmen who serve as unrivaled wingmen of \n     the active duty USAF in every deployment, mission, and \n     battlefield around the globe;\n       Whereas the USAF operated the Berlin Airlift in 1948 and \n     1949 to provide humanitarian relief to post-war Germany and \n     has established a tradition of humanitarian assistance in \n     responding to natural disasters and needs across the world;\n       Whereas the USAF announced a policy of racial integration \n     in the ranks of the USAF on April 26, 1948, 3 months prior to \n     a Presidential mandate to integrate all military services;\n       Whereas in the early years of the Cold War, the USAF's \n     arsenal of bombers, such as the long-range Convair B-58 \n     Hustler and B-36 Peacemaker, and the Boeing B-47 Stratojet \n     and B-52 Stratofortress, under the command of General Curtis \n     LeMay served as the United States' preeminent deterrent \n     against Soviet Union forces and were later augmented by the \n     development and deployment of medium range and \n     intercontinental ballistic missiles, such as the Titan and \n     Minuteman developed by General Bernard A. Schriever;\n       Whereas the USAF, employing the first large-scale combat \n     use of jet aircraft, helped to establish air superiority over \n     the Korean peninsula, protected ground forces of the United \n     Nations with close air support, and interdicted enemy \n     reinforcements and supplies during the conflict in Korea;\n       Whereas after the development of launch vehicles and \n     orbital satellites, the mission of the USAF expanded into \n     space and today provides exceptional real-time global \n     communications, environmental monitoring, navigation, \n     precision timing, missile warning, nuclear deterrence, and \n     space surveillance;\n       Whereas USAF Airmen have contributed to the manned space \n     program of the United States since the program's inception \n     and throughout the program's development at the National \n     Aeronautics and Space Administration by dedicating themselves \n     wholly to space exploration despite the risks of exploration;\n       Whereas the USAF engaged in a limited campaign of air power \n     to assist the South Vietnamese government in countering the \n     communist Viet Cong guerillas during the Vietnam War and \n     fought to disrupt supply lines, halt enemy ground offensives, \n     and protect United States and Allied forces;\n       Whereas Airmen were imprisoned and tortured during the \n     Vietnam War and, in the valiant tradition of Airmen held \n     captive in previous conflicts, continued serving the United \n     States with honor and dignity under the most inhumane \n     circumstances;\n       Whereas, in recent decades, the USAF and coalition partners \n     of the United States have supported successful actions in \n     Panama, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Kosovo, Iraq, Afghanistan, and \n     many other locations around the globe;\n       Whereas Pacific Air Forces, along with Asia-Pacific \n     partners of the United States, ensure peace and advance \n     freedom from the west coast of the United States to the east \n     coast of Africa and from the Arctic to the Antarctic, \n     covering more than 100 million square miles and the homes of \n     2 billion people in 44 countries;\n       Whereas the United States Air Forces in Europe, along with \n     European partners of the United States, have shaped the \n     history of Europe from World War II, the Cold War, Operation \n     Deliberate Force, and Operation Allied Force to today's \n     operations, and secured stability and ensured freedom's \n     future in the Europe, Africa, and Southwest Asia;\n       Whereas, for 17 consecutive years beginning with 1990, \n     Airmen have been engaged in full-time combat operations \n     ranging from Desert Shield to Iraqi Freedom, and have shown \n     themselves to be an expeditionary air and space force of \n     outstanding capability ready to fight and win wars of the \n     United States when and where Airmen are called upon to do so;\n       Whereas the USAF is steadfast in its commitment to field a \n     world-class, expeditionary air force by recruiting, training, \n     and educating its Total Force of active duty, Air National \n     Guard, Air Force Reserve, and civilian personnel;\n       Whereas the USAF is a steward of resources, developing and \n     applying technology, managing acquisition programs, and \n     maintaining test, evaluation, and sustainment criteria for \n     all USAF weapon systems throughout such weapon systems' life \n     cycles;\n       Whereas, when terrorists attacked the United States on \n     September 11, 2001, USAF fighter and air refueling aircraft \n     took to the skies to fly combat air patrols over major United \n     States cities and protect families, friends, and neighbors of \n     people of the United States from further attack;\n       Whereas, on December 7, 2005, the USAF modified its mission \n     statement to include flying and fighting in cyberspace and \n     prioritized the development, maintenance, and sustainment of \n     war fighting capabilities to deliver unrestricted access to \n     cyberspace and defend the United States and its global \n     interests;\n       Whereas Airmen around the world are committed to fighting \n     and winning the Global War on Terror and have flown more than \n     430,000 sorties to precisely target and engage insurgents who \n     attempt to violently disrupt rebuilding in Iraq and \n     Afghanistan;\n       Whereas talented and dedicated Airmen will meet the future \n     challenges of an ever-changing world with strength and \n     resolve;\n       Whereas the USAF, together with its joint partners, will \n     continue to be the United States' leading edge in the ongoing \n     fight to ensure the safety and security of the United States; \n     and\n       Whereas during the past 60 years, the USAF has repeatedly \n     proved its value to the Nation, fulfilling its critical role \n     in national defense, and protecting peace, liberty, and \n     freedom throughout the world: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate, That the Senate remembers, honors, \n     and commends the achievements of the United States Air Force \n     in serving and defending the United States on the 60th \n     anniversary of the creation of the United States Air Force as \n     an independent military service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/18/senate-section/article/S15939-1", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15939]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 CORRECTING THE ENROLLMENT OF H.R. 660\n\n  Mr. PRYOR.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 528, S. 2436.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2436) to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 \n     to clarify the term of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am pleased that today the Senate is \nacting on S. 2436, a bill to clarify the term of the IRS Commissioner.\n  The Internal Revenue Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998 provides \nthat the President appoints the IRS Commissioner to a 5-year term. On \nthe face of it, the Commissioner's term of office might seem quite \nclear. But lawyers in the administration and the Senate have disagreed \nover when the 5-year term begins and ends.\n  Specifically, there is dispute over whether the term of the IRS \nCommissioner follows the calendar or the person. Let me explain.\n  If the term follows the calendar, the tenure of the Commissioner \nbegins on the same date every 5 years. For example, if one term ends on \nNovember 12, then the next term begins the next day on November 13--\nwhether or not a new Commissioner has been confirmed.\n  This arrangement provides certainty for the Commissioner's term. It \nallows for planning and continuity of leadership. It minimizes the \nability of an administration to play games with the timing of the term \nby waiting to fill a vacancy.\n  If the term follows the person, then the tenure of each Commissioner \nbegins on the date of that individual's appointment. Under this \nscenario, a President deliberately could wait to appoint a new \nCommissioner until right before the end of the President's term, \nleaving the next President to inherit an appointee whom the new \nPresident did not choose.\n  While the President waited, the IRS could be without a permanent \nCommissioner indefinitely. That would put tax administration at risk.\n  There is another reason why it is important to clarify the term of \nthe Commissioner. Ambiguity in the term could lead taxpayers to \nquestion whether the Commissioner is legitimately in office. And thus \nambiguity could call into question the Commissioner's authority to \nenforce the tax laws.\n  For example, if the term arguably ended in November, but the \nCommissioner signed a tax pronouncement the next month, in December, \nthen a taxpayer might challenge the Commissioner's authority to act. \nTax administration could be compromised. Taxes that are legally owed \nmight not be collected.\n  Staff for the Treasury and the Senate gave this issue much thoughtful \ndiscussion. We received credible legal opinions on both sides. We need \nto resolve the tenure of the term before the Senate confirms another \nCommissioner.\n  To resolve the differences of interpretation, I worked with the \nadministration to develop the language in this bill. The ranking \nRepublican member of the Finance Committee, my friend, Senator Chuck \nGrassley, is the principal cosponsor. I am advised that the President \nand the Treasury Secretary both agree that this legislation is \nnecessary to resolve any concerns over the term of the Commissioner.\n  Upon enactment of this legislation, the Finance Committee and the \nfull Senate will be able to take further necessary steps to confirm a \nnew Commissioner. The IRS needs strong leadership for the upcoming \nfiling season and beyond.\n  I thank my colleagues for their support of this legislation to \nclarify the term of the IRS Commissioner.\n  Mr. President, the legislative history of this provision is \ninextricably tied to the legal opinions of distinguished counsel for \nthe Senate, the Justice Department, and the Congressional Research \nService. The opinion of the Senate Legal Counsel reflects the \nmotivations of this Senator in advancing this legislation. And the \nopinions of the Justice Department and the Congressional Research \nService are essential to understanding the need for this legislation. \nMr. President, I commend to my colleagues the legal opinions prepared \nby the Senate Legal Counsel, the Justice Department's Office of Legal \nCounsel, and the Congressional Research Service's American Law \nDivision.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nread three times, passed, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, and that any statements relating to the measure be printed in \nthe Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the Child \nSoldiers Accountability Act of 2007. This narrowly tailored bipartisan \nlegislation would make it a crime and a violation of immigration law to \nrecruit or use child soldiers. Congress must ensure that perpetrators \nwho use children to wage war are held accountable and do not find safe \nhaven in our country.\n  I would like to thank the other original cosponsors of the Child \nSoldiers Accountability Act, Senator Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, Senator \nRussell Feingold of Wisconsin, and Senator Sam Brownback of Kansas. \nThis bill is a product of the Judiciary Committee's new Subcommittee on \nHuman Rights and the Law, which is the first ever congressional \ncommittee or subcommittee dealing specifically with human rights. I am \nthe chairman of this Subcommittee and Senator Coburn is its ranking \nmember.\n  The use of child soldiers has been reported in 21 ongoing or recent \nconflicts throughout the world since 2001, including conflicts in \nColombia, Uganda, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Sri Lanka. The \nproliferation of small arms, particularly lightweight automatic weapons \nthat can be used by children as easily as by adults, has contributed to \nthe increased use of child soldiers. Child soldiers are often used in \nconflicts where high desertion rates and insufficient volunteers have \ngenerated a shortage of soldiers.\n  For example, Burma is believed to be one of the countries with the \nlargest number of child soldiers in the world. Burmese military \nrecruiters reportedly buy and sell children in a desperate effort to \nmeet recruitment quotas in a setting where low morale, high desertion \nrates and insufficient volunteers have created a military personnel \ncrisis. In a report to the U.N. Security Council on children and armed \nconflict in Burma issued last month, the Secretary General stated that \nthere has been tremendous pressure to accelerate recruitment rates in \nthe Burmese armed forces and that recruitment centers have experienced \ndifficulty meeting their quotas. The U.N. Secretary General's report \nalso found that some children picked up by police in Burma without \nnational identification cards are told they can ``choose'' to be \narrested or enlist in the army. According to another report, children \nconstitute a large percentage of privates in some of the new Burmese \narmy battalions and some have been forced to participate in human \nrights abuses, including burning villages.\n  One Burmese boy was reportedly forcibly recruited twice by the time \nhe was 16 years old. This boy was allegedly sold to a battalion by a \ncorporal for approximately US$15, a sack of rice and a tin of cooking \noil. When this boy's aunt and grandmother sought his release, the \ncaptain of the battalion company apparently said he would let the boy \ngo in exchange for five new recruits. The boy reportedly told his aunt \nthat he didn't want five other people to have to face what he had \nexperienced in the army.\n  There is a clear legal prohibition on recruiting and using child \nsoldiers. Under customary international law, recruitment or use of \nchild soldiers under the age of 15 is a war crime. Over 110 countries, \nincluding the United States, have ratified the Optional Protocol to the \nConvention on the Rights of the Child, which prohibits the recruitment \nand use of child soldiers under 18.\n  Over the last few years, significant progress has been made in the \nprosecution of child soldier recruitment and use by international \ncourts. In 2005, the International Criminal Court issued its first \narrest warrants for five Lord's Resistance Army commanders from Uganda \nfor, among other crimes, enlisting\n\n[[Page S15942]]\n\nchildren as soldiers by two of the commanders. In February 2006, the \nInternational Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for Thomas \nLubanga for the war crime of ``conscripting and enlisting children \nunder the age of 15 years and using them to participate actively in \nhostilities.'' Mr. Lubanga, the first person to be arrested by the \nInternational Criminal Court, allegedly recruited children as young as \nten years old to fight for the Union of Congolese Patriots in the \nnortheastern region of the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n  In June 2007, the Special Court for Sierra Leone became the first \ninternational court to issue convictions for child soldier recruitment, \nfinding three defendants guilty of crimes that included conscripting or \nenlisting children under the age of 15. In August 2007, the Special \nCourt for Sierra Leone found another defendant guilty of using child \nsoldiers.\n  Despite these positive developments, the ability of international \ntribunals or hybrid courts to try these cases is limited. The average \nperpetrator still runs very little risk of being prosecuted. National \ncourts can and should play a greater role in prosecuting perpetrators.\n  Unfortunately, recruiting and using child soldiers does not violate \nU.S. criminal or immigration law. As a result, the U.S. government is \nunable to punish individuals found in our country who have recruited or \nused child soldiers. In contrast, other grave human rights violations, \nincluding genocide and torture, are punishable under U.S. criminal and \nimmigration law.\n  This loophole in the law was identified during ``Casualties of War: \nChild Soldiers and the Law,'' a hearing held by the Senate Subcommittee \non Human Rights and the Law. Ishmael Beah, a former child soldier and \nauthor of the bestselling book A Long Way Gone: Memoirs of a Boy \nSoldier, testified at this hearing. Mr. Beah said this gap in the law \n``saddens me tremendously'' and that closing this loophole ``would set \na clear example that there is no safe haven anywhere for those who \nrecruit and use children in war.''\n  The Child Soldiers Accountability Act will help to ensure that the \nwar criminals who recruit or use children as soldiers will not find \nsafe haven in our country and will allow the U.S. Government to hold \nthese individuals accountable for their actions.\n  First, this bill will make it a crime to recruit or use persons under \nthe age of 15 as soldiers. Second, it will enable the government to \ndeport or deny admission to an individual who recruited or used child \nsoldiers under the age of 15.\n  This legislation will send a clear message to those adults who \ndeliberately and actively recruit or use children to wage war that \nthere are real consequences to their actions. By holding such \nindividuals criminally responsible, our country will help to deter the \nrecruitment and use of child soldiers.\n  Recognizing that adults often use drugs, threats, or other means to \npressure child soldiers into committing serious human rights \nviolations, including the recruitment of other children, this \nlegislation seeks to hold adults accountable for their actions and is \nnot intended to make inadmissible or deportable former child soldiers \nwho participated in the recruitment of other children.\n  Former child soldiers require extensive care and support from family \nand others in order to be rehabilitated and reintegrated into society. \nAs Mr. Beah testified, ``[h]ealing from the war was a long-term process \nthat was difficult but very possible . . . Effective rehabilitation of \nchildren is in itself a preventive measure, and this should be the \nfocus, not punitive measures against children that have no beneficial \noutcome for the child and society.'' This legislation should not be \ninterpreted as placing new restrictions on or altering the legal status \nof former child soldiers who are seeking admission or are already \npresent in the United States.\n  I urge my colleagues to ask themselves the question Ishmael Beah \nposed: Would we want our children or grandchildren to endure the pain \nand suffering that Mr. Beah and other child soldiers face? As Mr. Beah \nreminded us, the lives of child soldiers are just as important as those \nof our children and grandchildren. We have a moral obligation to take \naction to help these young people and to stop the abhorrent practice of \nrecruiting and using child soldiers.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. \n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate today will \npass S. 2135, the Child Soldiers Accountability Act of 2007. I commend \nSenator Durbin and Senator Coburn for their leadership on this \nimportant legislation to combat the unconscionable practice of using \nchildren as soldiers in violent conflicts, and I was proud to join as a \ncosponsor of this bill. I am glad that Senators Durbin and Coburn \nworked with me and others on the Senate Judiciary Committee to produce \na consensus bill and to move it through Committee and the Senate. The \nUnited States should do all it can to prevent and punish this conduct \nwhich is so contrary to our values.\n  This bill creates a tough new criminal provision aimed at those who \nrecruit or conscript children under the age of 15 into armed conflict. \nIt extends U.S. jurisdiction to perpetrators of this crime who are \npresent in the United States, regardless of their nationality and where \nthe crime takes place, so that those who commit human rights violations \ncannot come to this country as a sanctuary from prosecution. The bill \nalso amends immigration law to allow those who have used children as \nsoldiers to be barred or removed from the United States.\n  This bill is another example of the good work of the Judiciary \nCommittee's new Subcommittee on Human Rights and the Law. I am glad \nthat the efforts Subcommittee Chairman Durbin and I have made to make \nthis subcommittee a force for change and to bring focus on these \nimportant issues is resulting in legislative action, as well as \nproviding a forum to put a spotlight on important issues. This is an \narea in which I have worked for many years as the chair and ranking \nmember of the Foreign Operations Subcommittee of the Appropriations \nCommittee.\n  During the last 5 years, America's reputation has suffered \ntremendously. Some of our ability to lead on human rights issues has \nbeen needlessly and carelessly squandered. Abu Ghraib, Guantanamo and \ntorture have tarnished that role and that tradition. The secret prisons \nthat the President confirmed last year, this Administration's role in \nsending people to other countries where they would be tortured, and \nrecent revelations of the destruction of videotapes showing cruel \ninterrogations by the CIA have led to condemnation by our allies, to \nlegal challenges, and to possible criminal investigations.\n  I was proud to work with Senator Durbin to create the Human Rights \nand the Law Subcommittee. This subcommittee will continue to closely \nexamine some of the important and difficult legal issues that are now a \nfocus of the Judiciary Committee and will work to reverse and correct \nthe damaging policies established by this administration over the last \n6 years. The subcommittee has already spearheaded the Genocide \nAccountability Act, which will soon provide a powerful new tool in \nAmerica's efforts to prevent and punish genocide, and has made further \nprogress with hearings and legislation dealing with human trafficking \nand other vital issues.\n  The conduct prohibited by the Child Soldiers Accountability Act is \nappalling but happens all too often throughout the world. We should do \neverything we can to stop this offense to human rights and human \ndignity, which exacts such great costs from too many of the world's \nchildren. I commend the Senate for passing this important legislation \ntoday.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. PRYOR. I ask unanimous consent that a Feingold amendment, which \nis at the desk, be agreed to; the committee amendment be agreed to; the \nbill, as amended, be read three times and passed; the motions to \nreconsider be laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate, \nand any statements relating to the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
