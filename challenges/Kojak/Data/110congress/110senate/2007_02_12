Mr. President, today I wish to talk about the economic \nfuture of our country.\n  The economic future of our country is bleak. During the last 3 years \nof the Clinton administration, this Federal Government was spending \nless money than it was taking in. We actually retired the national debt \nby half a trillion dollars. Since President Clinton left office, we \nhave had the highest deficits in the history of our country. The Bush \nbudgets have been recordbreakers but in the wrong way. We are $3 \ntrillion in new debt in the last 6 years. We have doubled the amount of \nmoney we owe China and Japan, and we owe money--to Saudi Arabia, \nSingapore, on and on--to other countries. We even had to borrow money \nfrom Mexico in recent years.\n  Senator Conrad has indicated--and I have spent hours with him. I have \nspent hours with him and Judd Gregg talking about what we can do for \nthe long-term economic future of this country. I had hopes and \nanticipation, but then these hopes were washed away. As Vice President \nCheney says, we are doing nothing to change revenues in any way. It is \na one-way street, this administration--all for the rich, nothing for \nthe poor, and in between the poor and the rich, the middle class is \nbeing squeezed. The rich are getting richer, far richer, and the poor \nare getting poorer.\n  I am disappointed--and that is an understatement--in the budget we \nreceived recently from the President. It is like Iraq: He refuses to \nreverse course. The budget is the same, more of the same.\n  Let's see why we should be concerned about this budget. It wasn't \nlong ago that Vice President Cheney insisted that deficits don't \nmatter. I was speaking today to a publisher of a large newspaper--owns \nnewspapers all over the country--and he and I lamented that we always \nthought Republicans were for fiscal conservatism, fiscal integrity. \nThat is gone. No one believes anymore that they care--red ink as far as \nyou can see. And, as Vice President Cheney insisted, deficits don't \nmatter. But he is wrong. I know he and many on the other side of the \naisle obviously believe deficits don't matter. The Republicans \nobviously believe this. Senate Republicans and House Republicans may \nbelieve that but a lot fewer now than before November 6 because \nRepublicans all over the country believe deficits do matter. They do \nbelieve in fiscal integrity, that you pay your bills, you don't spend \nmoney you don't have.\n  We Democrats agree with mainstream Republicans across the country.\n\n[[Page S1814]]\n\nWe believe in fiscal responsibility because history proves that it \nworks, and we are convinced that massive deficits allowed to continue \nwill undermine growth and weaken America's future. It is no different \nfrom your own personal bank accounts, how you take care of your home, \nyour family. Sure, there may come times when you have to borrow money, \nbut you need to pay it back. You can't have deficit-spending as far as \nthe eye can see. How has the Republican Party gotten off on allowing \nthese huge deficits to keep building?\n  The administration's budget it just gave us shows they are still \ntrapped in an outdated and discredited ideology. Rather than accepting \nthe need for discipline, President Bush's budget continues to reject \nthe strong pay-as-you-go rules. What does this mean, pay-as-you-go? \nThis is the rule we had in the Clinton years. What it means is that if \nyou are going to lower taxes, you have to figure out a way to pay for \nit. If you are going to have a new spending program, you have to have a \nway to pay for it. You just can't borrow money, which is what has \nhappened under President Bush. Pay-as-you-go rules during the Clinton \nyears promoted fiscal responsibility.\n\n  Rather than reducing our debt, as the Democrats did under President \nClinton, the Bush budget calls for an additional $2.5 trillion in new \nborrowing, causing our debt to balloon to almost $12 trillion. I am not \nmaking up these numbers. They come directly from the President's \nbudget. The real numbers are even worse than those you find in the \nPresident's budget, which leads me to my second major concern about the \nPresident's budget--its refusal to be honest with the American people.\n  Let's begin with the cost of the Iraq war. While the President \ncontinues to resist bipartisan efforts to reverse the political and \nmilitary course in Iraq, his own budget takes a very different \napproach. In fact, the budget contains $50 billion only for the war in \n2009 and nothing thereafter. Does that mean the administration really \nwants to pull the troops out? Of course not. They want to have it both \nways--they want the war, but they don't want to pay for it. And their \ndeceptive budget isn't playing it straight. It is not being honest.\n  The war costs, unfortunately, are only one example of the budgets \ndeception. Their budget also uses rosy assumptions about expected \nrevenues. In 2012 alone, the President assumes that revenue will be \n$155 billion more than projected by the nonpartisan Congressional \nBudget Office. So instead of a rosy surplus, Bush's budget would run a \nhuge deficit.\n  Beyond rosy assumptions, the budget also claims to reach balance by \nassuming deep future cuts in domestic priorities such as education. But \nhow? Few details. Exactly which programs will be cut? No details. By \nhow much? Not for sure. Few details. And who will be affected? The \nbudget doesn't say. We know some.\n  Perhaps even more important than its debt and deception, the Bush \nbudget is simply disconnected from the needs of middle-class America. \nToo many families today are struggling with stagnating wages and rising \nprices for everything from health care to the groceries we buy. That is \ncertainly true in Nevada. But instead of developing new ways to meet \nthese needs, the budget offers few, if any, new ideas that would help. \nIn fact, many of its cuts would make matters worse. For example, the \nbudget underfunds the State Children's Health Insurance Program which \nwould jeopardize existing health coverage and leave millions of \nchildren uninsured. Its ill-conceived health proposal would threaten \nexisting private health coverage and actually drive up premiums, the \nexperts say. The budget cuts $300 billion from Medicare and Medicaid \nand thus increases health care costs for many seniors. The budget cuts \neducation by $2 billion, and it even cuts programs that are important \nto veterans and police officers.\n  These cuts would have a major impact on many of my constituents and \nmany of the Presiding Officer's constituents. Every State in the Union \nwould feel the impact. There are already over 100,000 children in \nNevada without health insurance. The Bush budget would increase that \nnumber. At the same time, its deep cuts to Medicare and Medicaid \nthreaten about 300,000 Nevadans who rely on Medicare and 170,000 \nNevadans who depend on Medicaid.\n  Unfortunately, at the same time the administration is cutting \nprograms important to the middle class and the poor, they are insisting \non spending hundreds of billions of dollars for handouts for \nmultimillionaires. I know the administration generally believes that \nthe very wealthy are the engine of economic growth. Democrats disagree. \nWe believe the real engine of growth is a strong middle class, and we \nthink it is wrong to burden middle-class taxpayers with the cost of \nmassive spending for those at the top of the economic pyramid.\n  Consider the President's tax breaks for people with incomes over $1 \nmillion. They are huge--more than $150,000 a year if you make more than \n$1 million. In 2008 alone, that cost will be $50 billion. Who gets the \n$50 billion? The millionaires, Mr. President, the millionaires. Think \nabout that--$50 billion. Where does it go? To the millionaires. At the \nsame time he wants to cut education by $2 billion, the President wants \nto spend $50 billion on tax breaks for those with incomes over $1 \nmillion. That is not just fiscally irresponsible and it is not just bad \neconomic policy, it is wrong. It is just plain wrong.\n  Unfortunately, tax breaks for multimillionaires are only one example \nof the many special interest handouts in this budget we just got.\n  It contains wasteful royalties and tax breaks for oil and gas \ncompanies. This industry is making more money this year than ever \nbefore, last year it was more money than ever before, and the year \nbefore it was more money than ever before.\n  It continues Medicare overpayments to HMOs and other managed care \nplans.\n  This budget grants drilling rights to Alaskan wilderness.\n  It continues tax breaks for multinational corporations that outsource \njobs overseas, and remarkably it continues to call for the \nprivatization of Social Security with the deep benefit cuts and massive \ndebt.\n  These discredited and outdated policies will not promote economic \ngrowth, they will not strengthen the middle class or make our country a \nbetter place. On the contrary, they will weaken our Nation and make \nmiddle-class life harder.\n  We must do better. In coming weeks, led by our remarkable Budget \nchairman, Senator Conrad, we will work together with our colleagues to \nproduce a better budget; a fiscally responsible budget based on the \nphilosophy that, yes, deficits do matter; a budget that returns the \ntough pay-as-you-go discipline of the 1990s and balances the budget \nusing real numbers, not pretend numbers; a budget that puts the middle \nclass first and starts to address the real problems facing working \nfamilies, such as exploding health care costs and rising tuition; a \nbudget that reflects the best of our core values, American values, and \nlays the groundwork for a strong and prosperous future.\n  Achieving such a budget won't be easy. Members on both sides of the \naisle would have to work together and make some tough choices and \ncompromises, and the President must be willing to rethink obsolete \napproaches and help move his party and our Nation in another direction.\n  But speaking for Democrats, while we know the challenge is great, we \nare going to try. It is my hope that in the end we can finally move \ntoward a new fiscal policy that combines old-fashioned values of fiscal \ndiscipline with the new and forward-looking approach that puts the \nmiddle class first.\n  I ask my time not interfere with the time that has been set aside. \nWould the Presiding Officer remind me, do we have a certain period of \ntime for morning business today?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, there \nwill be a transaction for morning business with Senators permitted to \nspeak for up to 10 minutes each.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, lately we have heard a lot about the \nalternative minimum tax and the difficulties involved in fixing it. \nRight now is tax time so a lot of people are going through the process \nof determining whether they owe the alternative minimum tax. I will \nvisit with taxpayers about that. At another time I will go into greater \ndetail regarding some of these problems and what we need to do to fix \nthe alternative minimum tax.\n  Right now I want to explain how we got into this situation. Of \ncourse, as with anything, it would be foolish to go forward on this \nissue without looking back to see how we got to where we are now, after \n40 years of the alternative minimum tax. The alternative minimum tax, \nthen, obviously has been with us for that long a period of time.\n  The individual minimum tax was the original name of the alternative \nminimum tax and was enacted first in 1969. This chart I am displaying \nhighlights a few of the important and most recent milestones in the \nevolution of the AMT. I will not go into each of those milestones in \ndetail, but by looking at the chart you can see the AMT has not been a \nconstant. There has been an alternative minimum tax, but it has had \nsome changes in the last 38 years.\n  First, the history of the AMT. In the 1960s, Congress discovered only \n155 taxpayers--all people with incomes greater than $200,000 a year--\nwere not paying any taxes whatever. These taxpayers were able to use \nlegitimate deductions and exemptions to eliminate their entire tax \nliabilities--all legally. To emphasize, what they were doing was not \nillegal, but Congress could not justify this at that time and it \ndetermined at that time that wealthy Americans ought to pay ``some'' \namount of tax to the Federal Government regardless of the amount of \nlegal ways of not paying tax.\n  When Congress decided to do this, it was calculated only 1 in 500,000 \ntaxpayers would ever be hit by the alternative minimum tax. According \nto the Bureau of Census, we had at that time about 203 million people \ncompared to 300 million today. Making the assumption that every single \nAmerican was a taxpayer, the individual minimum tax was originally \ncalculated to affect only 406 people. We get that by dividing 203 \nmillion by 500,000. In 1969 Congress was motivated by the situations of \nthe 155 taxpayers to enact a tax calculated to impact about 406 people.\n  Clearly, the situation has changed dramatically in the last 30 years \nbecause this year the AMT is going to hit several million taxpayers. \nAlthough not its only flaw, the most significant defect of the \nalternative minimum tax is that it was not indexed for inflation. If it \nhad been indexed for inflation, we would not be dealing with this tax \nproblem and millions of people this year would not have to figure out \nif they owed the alternative minimum tax.\n  The failure to index the exemptions and the rate brackets, the \nparameters of the AMT, is a bipartisan problem. Perhaps a most notable \nopportunity to index the AMT for inflation was the passage of the Tax \nReform Act in 1986. That law was passed by a Democratic House, a \nRepublican Senate, and signed by a Republican President. It is worth \npointing out at that time, because of the bipartisan cooperation, \nindexing was a relatively new concept, and even though they had a \nbipartisan opportunity, they did not take advantage of it. One can \nargue that indexing of the AMT should have received more attention, but \nthe fact is it did not then or any time since then, so we have the \nproblems I am discussing today.\n\n  Today it is impossible for anyone to use the excuse that indexing is \na new concept. Maybe it could be used in 1986. In a regular tax system, \nthe personal exemptions, the standard deduction, the rate brackets are \nindexed for inflation. Government payments such as Social Security \nbenefits are indexed for inflation and people would be hard pressed to \ngo into most schools and find a student who does not at least know that \ninflation was something to be avoided or at least to be compensated for \nthrough indexing.\n  Despite what must be a nearly universal awareness of inflation, \nthough, the alternative minimum tax, the Internal Revenue Code \nequivalent of a time capsule, remains the same year after year as the \nworld changes around it. It must be obvious to everyone that the value \nof a buck has changed a lot in the last 38 years, and all here are \nexperienced enough to have witnessed that change.\n  More than anything else, the problem posed by the alternative minimum \ntax exists because of a failure to index that portion of the Tax Code \nfor inflation. Although $200,000 was an incredible amount of money in \n1969, the situation is different today. I am not saying that $200,000 \nis not a lot of money--because it is, obviously, to most middle-income \npeople a lot of money--but $200,000 is certainly going to buy less \ntoday than it did in 1969.\n  I also emphasize that I am not the only one saying the failure to \nindex the alternative minimum tax for inflation is what is causing it \nto consume more and more of the middle-income taxpayers. On May 23, \n2005, the Subcommittee on Taxation and IRS Oversight, the Committee on \nFinance, held a hearing entitled ``Blowing the Cover on the Stealth \nTax: Exposing the Individual AMT.'' At that hearing, the national \ntaxpayers advocate Nina Olson said:\n\n     [t]he absence of an AMT indexing provision is largely \n     responsible for increasing the numbers of middle-class \n     taxpayers who are subject to the AMT regime.\n\n  Robert Carroll, who is now Deputy Assistant Treasury Secretary for \ntax analysis and then was in the acting position, same title, \ntestified:\n\n     [t]he major reason the AMT has become such a growing problem \n     is that, unlike the regular tax, the parallel tax system is \n     not indexed for inflation.\n  We also had at that hearing Douglas Holtz-Eakin, who at that time was \ndirector of the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office:\n\n       If the 2005 [increased AMT] exemptions were made permanent \n     and, along with other AMT parameters, indexed for inflation \n     after 2006, most of the increase over the coming decade in \n     the number of taxpayers with AMT liability would disappear.\n\n  Clearly, there is a consensus among knowledgeable people that the \nfailure to index the AMT for inflation has been and continues to be a \nserious problem and, in fact, for the most part, would be a solution to \nthe problem if you want to maintain the AMT. If you want to argue for \ndoing away with the AMT, that is another ball game.\n  What makes the failure to index the AMT in 1986 and other years more \ndisastrous is repeated failure to deal with the problem in additional \nlegislation that has actually compounded the problem posed by the \nalternative minimum tax.\n  Before I continue, I will catalog the evolution of the alternative \nminimum tax rate for a moment. The 1969 bill gave birth to the \nalternative minimum tax which established a minimum income tax rate of \n10 percent in excess of the exemption of $30,000. In 1976, the rate was \nincreased to 15 percent. In 1978, graduated rates of 10, 20, and 25 \nwere introduced. In 1982, the alternative minimum tax rate was set at a \nflat rate of 20 percent and was increased to 21 percent in 1986. This \nis not a complete list of legislative changes and fixes, and I am sure \nno one wants me to recite a full list but, very importantly, I want to \nmake sure that everyone realizes Congress has a long history of trying \nto fiddle with the AMT in various ways but without doing anything \npermanent to it. Hence, we are here again this year considering what to \ndo.\n  Now, a great detail on recent bills impacting the AMT. In 1990, the \nOmnibus Budget Reconciliation Act is a result of the famous Andrews Air \nForce summit between President Bush and Democratic leaders on Capitol \nHill. Probably Republicans were involved, as well. That legislation \nraised the alternative minimum tax rate from 21 percent to 24 percent \nand did not adjust\n\n[[Page S1816]]\n\nthe exemption levels. That means every person who had been hit by the \nAMT would continue to be hit by the AMT but be hit harder.\n  Then we had the same title, but in 1993 we had the Omnibus Budget \nReconciliation Act. The exemption level was increased to $33,750 for \nindividuals and $45,000 for joint returns, but that was accompanied by \nyet an additional rate increase. In 1993, the tax increase passed this \nSenate with just Democratic votes for it. No Republican voted for it.\n\n  Once again, graduated rates were introduced, except this time they \nwere 26 percent and 28 percent. By tinkering with the rate and \nexemption levels of the alternative minimum tax, these bills were only \ndoing what Congress has been doing on a bipartisan basis for almost 40 \nyears, which is to undertake a wholly inadequate approach to a problem \nthat keeps getting bigger and bigger and bigger.\n  Aside from this futile tinkering that has been done every few years, \nCongress has, in other circumstances, completely ignored the impact of \nthe tax legislation on taxpayers caught by the alternative minimum tax. \nIn the 1990s, a series of tax credits, such as the child tax credit and \nlifetime learning credit, were adopted without any regard to the \nalternative minimum tax. The alternative minimum tax limited the use of \nnonrefundable credits, and that did not change. In other words, because \nof the AMT, we did not accomplish the good we wanted to with those \ncredits for lower middle-income and lower income people. Congress \nquickly realized the ridiculousness of this situation and waived the \nalternative minimum tax disallowance of nonrefundable personal credits, \nbut it only did it through the year 1998.\n  In 1999, the issue again had to be dealt with. The Congress passed \nthe Taxpayer Refund and Relief Act of 1999. In the Senate, only \nRepublicans voted for that bill. That bill included a provision to do \nwhat I would advocate we ought to do right now: repeal the alternative \nminimum tax. If President Clinton had not vetoed that bill, we would \nnot be here today. But we are here today with a worse problem.\n  Later, in 1999, an extenders bill, including the fix, to fix it good \nthrough 2001, was enacted to hold the AMT back for a little longer; in \nother words, not hitting more middle-income people.\n  In 2001, we departed from these temporary piecemeal solutions a \nlittle bit--at least a little bit--for 4 years with the Economic Growth \nand Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001. That 2001 bill permanently \nallows the child tax credit, the adoption tax credit, and the \nindividual retirement account contribution credit to be claimed against \na taxpayer's alternative minimum tax. While this certainly was not a \ncomplete solution, it was a step in the right direction.\n  More importantly, the 2001 bill was a bipartisan effort to stop the \nfurther intrusion of the alternative minimum tax into the middle class. \nThe package Senator Baucus and I put together that year effectively \nprevented inflation from pulling anybody else into the alternative \nminimum tax through the end of 2005.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 3 more minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Our friends in the House originally wanted to enact a \nhold harmless only through the end of 2001, while Senator Baucus and I \nwere trying to do it through 2005. We got the final bill the way \nSenator Baucus and I wanted it. So it was not a problem then until the \nyear 2005.\n  Since the 2001 tax relief bill, the Finance Committee has produced \nbipartisan packages to continue to increase exemption amounts to keep \ntaxpayers ahead of inflation, with the most recent being the Tax \nIncrease Prevention and Reconciliation Act of 2005, which increased the \nAMT exemption to $62,550 for joint returns and $42,500 for individuals \nthrough the end of 2006.\n  These packages put together since 2001 are unique in that they are \nthe first sustained attempt undertaken by Congress to stem the spread \nof the AMT through inflation and hitting more middle-income taxpayers. \nAdmittedly, these are all short-term fixes, but they illustrate a \ncomprehension of the AMT inflation problem and what needs to be done to \nsolve it.\n  So this leads us to the present day and the situation we currently \nface. In 2004, the most recent year for which the IRS has complete tax \ndata, more than 3 million families and individuals were hit by the AMT. \nAnd those figures for each State are shown on this chart behind me. You \ncan see a breakdown by State of families and individuals who paid the \nalternative minimum tax, even with our hold-harmless provisions in \nplace.\n  This does not even begin to hint at what will happen if we do not \ncontinue to protect taxpayers from the alternative minimum tax. Barring \nan extension in the hold harmless contained in the 2006 tax bill, AMT \nexemptions will return to their pre-2001 levels. At the end of 2006, \nprovisions allowing nonrefundable personal tax credits to offset AMT \ntax liability expired. If further action is not taken, it is estimated \nthat the AMT could claim 35 million families and individuals by the end \nof this decade. That is just 3 years away. Think of it: a tax \noriginally conceived to counter the actions of 155 taxpayers in 1969 \ncould hit 35 million filers by the year 2010--a well-intentioned idea \n40 years later with unintended consequences. Some analyses show that in \nthe next decade, it may be less costly to repeal the regular income tax \nthan the alternative minimum tax.\n\n  Aside from considering the increased financial burden the AMT puts on \nfamilies, we also should consider the opportunity cost. Because the \naverage taxpayer spends about 63 hours annually complying with the \nrequirements of the alternative minimum tax, that is an awful lot of \ntime that could be more productively used elsewhere.\n  As I have illustrated, the AMT is a problem that has been developing \nfor a while. Thirty-eight years down the road are we now. On numerous \noccasions, Congress has made adjustments to the exemptions and rates, \nthough not as part of a sustained effort to keep the alternative \nminimum tax from further absorbing our Nation's middle class.\n  Despite these temporary measures, the AMT is still a very real threat \nto millions of middle-income taxpayers who were never supposed to be \nsubjected to a minimum tax. That the alternative minimum tax has grown \ngrossly beyond its original purpose--which was to ensure the wealthy \nwere not exempt from an income tax--is indisputable and that the AMT is \ninherently flawed would seem to be common sense.\n  Despite a widespread sense that something needs to be done, there is \nstill disagreement on what needs to be done. Over the course of a few \nmore remarks on this floor, in days to come, I will address some of \nthose things we ought to do. But this is a case where well-intended \nlegislation not being paid attention to has turned out to be a major \ntax problem in this country.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise to talk about two issues today. \nFirst, I will talk about the continuing resolution that will be on the \nfloor of the Senate that we will likely finish this week.\n  I know there is some consternation about the fact that a continuing \nresolution is being done, but there was no choice. We were left with an \nawful mess. This Congress was left with a mess where 10 appropriations \nbills were completed by the Senate Appropriations Committee but never \nbrought to the floor of the Senate. They should have been done by \nOctober 1, signed by the President. We are now months into the new \nfiscal year, and those appropriations bills, done by the previous \nmajority here in Congress, were not completed, and so we are left with \na mess.\n  We have put together, as best we can, a continuing resolution. We \nhave made some adjustments to that continuing resolution. Earmarks are \ngone. These are adjustments to avoid some catastrophic things that \nwould have happened without adjustments.\n  I wish to mention with respect to the energy and water chapter of \nthat resolution that we have done a number of\n\n[[Page S1817]]\n\nthings to try to preserve some funding for renewable energy. We have an \nenergy issue that is very compelling in this country. We need to \nstimulate more renewable energy, so we are trying to keep the accounts \nwhich do that intact. We have tried to find the funding to preserve the \nOffice of Science, which is the cutting-edge science that keeps us \ncompetitive in the world. That office would have had to lay off people \nhad we not made some adjustments there. In the energy supply and \nconservation account, which is ongoing and very important, we have made \nsome adjustments.\n  The fact is, we have tried to find a way to address the mess we were \nleft. We are doing it the best way we can. I believe the best approach \nis to pass this continuing resolution. It is true there are no so-\ncalled earmarks or what is, in effect, legislative-directed spending. \nBut it is also the case that adjustments have been made in a number of \nareas, including the energy and water accounts, that will try to remedy \nsome of the otherwise very significant changes, in some cases \ncatastrophic changes to the issues we care a lot about--energy \nindependence, energy conservation, renewable energy, science, and so \nmany other areas.\n  I am pleased to support this continuing resolution. I wish we were \nnot doing it this way. If I had my druthers, we would have passed the \nappropriations bills last year on time. That did not happen. So we are \nnow faced with this mess of fixing a mess that was created by last \nyear's majority. We do not have a choice. We have to do that. The \nGovernment would shut down if the funding were not available for the \nagencies, so we have a responsibility, and we will meet that \nresponsibility.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/12/senate-section/article/S1817-1", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1817-S1819]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                ACCOUNTABILITY IN GOVERNMENT CONTRACTING\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I also rise to talk about a piece of \nlegislation dealing with contracting. The Federal Government is the \nlargest contractor in the world. The U.S. Federal Government contracts \nfor a lot of things. I am going to be introducing a piece of \nlegislation that is entitled the Honest Leadership and Accountability \nin Contracting Act. There are some 23 Senators who have joined me as \ncosponsors on that bill, and I will return to the floor to speak about \nthis later in the week. But I wish to talk a little today about what \nthis means and why we are introducing it.\n  I held 10 oversight hearings in the Democratic policy committee, as \nchairman of that committee, on the issue of contracting abuses in Iraq. \nI held two oversight hearings on the issue of contracting abuses with \nrespect to the response to Hurricane Katrina. We have put together, as \na result of the abuses we have seen with this contracting, a piece of \nlegislation which will do the following: It will punish those who are \nwar profiteers. And there are some. It will crack down on contract \ncheaters. No more of this slap on the wrist, pat on the back, have \nanother contract. It will force real contract competition for those who \nwant to do contract work for the Federal Government. And it will end \ncronyism in key Government positions--having unqualified political \nappointees put in positions that require people who know what they are \ndoing.\n  Let me talk about some of the things we have found. I do this \nknowing, last week, there were some oversight hearings on the House \nside chaired by Congressman Waxman. I commend him. There has been a \ndearth of oversight hearings, almost none in the last couple of years--\nI guess the last 5 or 6 years, actually--because a majority of the same \nparty as the President do not want to hold hearings that embarrass \nanyone. So there have been very few oversight hearings. But the hearing \nheld this past week in the House that caught my eye is one that \nfollowed a hearing I held in the Senate with the policy committee. They \ntalked about the fact that $12 billion in cash--most of it in stacks of \none-hundred-dollar bills--had been sent to Iraq; 363 tons of U.S. cash \ncurrency flown in on wooden pallets on C-130 airplanes. That would be, \nby the way, 19 planeloads of one-hundred-dollar bills; 363 tons.\n  Nearly half of that cash was sent in the final 6 weeks before control \nof the Iraqi funds were turned over to the Iraqi Government. These were \nIraqi oil funds, funds with frozen Iraqi assets here in the United \nStates. The last shipment of $2.4 billion was the largest shipment. It \nwas the largest shipment ever in the Federal Reserve Board's history. \nAnd that was 1 week before the government was turned over to the \nGovernment of Iraq.\n  Cash payments were made from the back of a pickup truck. One official \nwas given $6.75 million in cash and told to spend it in 1 week, before \nthe interim Iraqi Government took control of the funds.\n  I had a person testify at my hearing who said it was similar to the \nWild West. Our refrain was bring a bag because we pay in cash. That is \nthe way we do business.\n  In fact, I have a photograph of a fellow who testified at the hearing \nI held. These are one-hundred-dollar bills wrapped in Saran Wrap in \nbrick form. This was in a building in Iraq. This is the fellow who \ntestified. He said people used to play catch with them like football. \nHe said it was the Wild West. Bring a bag, we pay in cash.\n  We know a substantial amount of cash disappeared--some American \ntaxpayer money, some belonging to the people of Iraq--with almost no \naccountability.\n  I wish to talk about accountability. If there was a lack of \naccountability--and there certainly was, with respect to what happened \nin Iraq and also here at home with Katrina--what will be the \naccountability going forward? How do we ensure accountability? How do \nwe ensure that someone is in charge going forward?\n  Let me talk about Halliburton and Kellogg, Brown and Root, its \nsubsidiary. I know the minute you mention Halliburton, someone says you \nare criticizing the Vice President. No. He used to be president of that \ncompany. He has been gone a long while. This has been Halliburton that \ngets big contracts from the Defense Department and then doesn't \nperform.\n  Bunnatine Greenhouse is a woman who rose to become the highest \nranking civilian official in the Corps of Engineers in charge of all \nthe contracting, the highest ranking civilian official who always got \ngreat reviews on her performance evaluations, until the point when the \nPentagon decided to award a massive no-bid, sole-source contract to \nHalliburton's subsidiary called RIO, Restore Iraqi Oil. She protested \nthat this was done in violation of proper contracting procedures. She \nwas appalled when Halliburton was found by auditors to have overcharged \nnearly double for fuel purchases. And then the Defense Department, the \nfolks in charge of that, instead of being concerned about it, rushed to \nprovide the company with a waiver. This waiver was provided without the \napproval of the contracting officer who was responsible, Ms. \nGreenhouse. She was kept in the dark about that decision. She learned \nabout the waiver when she read it in the newspaper.\n  When she did speak up, she was bypassed, ignored, and ultimately \nforced to resign or face demotion. Here is what she has said publicly, \nthe highest ranking civilian official in the Corps of Engineers who \nblew the whistle on the good old boys network for contracts awarded, \nshe felt, improperly:\n\n       I can unequivocally state that the abuse related to \n     contracts awarded to KBR represents the most blatant and \n     improper contract abuse I have witnessed during the course of \n     my professional career.\n\n  For saying this, this woman was demoted. She lost the job she had for \nbeing honest. And she, by all accounts, was a top-notch contracting \nofficial. So this 20-year contracting official, responsible for all \nthis, was ignored and then demoted when she was critical of people whom \nshe felt were violating the rules. What happened then to fill her job? \nThe Corps of Engineers decided to replace her with a Pentagon official \nwho had 40 years of Government experience but none of it in Government \ncontracting. At a hearing of the Senate Energy Committee, General \nStrock admitted the person who replaced Ms. Greenhouse was not \ncertified as an acquisition professional. He stated that Ms. Riley \nrequired a waiver in order to apply for her new position. Ms. Riley has \nnow ``gone to school'' and has been brought up to speed about what she \nneeds to know as a contract official. Sound familiar? It does to me. It \nis happening all too often.\n  Let's take a look at what I found in some of the hearings. Yes, it is \nabout\n\n[[Page S1818]]\n\nHalliburton because they are the biggest contractor, but it is about \nother companies as well. An $85,000 brand new truck abandoned beside \nthe road because they had a flat tire in an area where there were no \nhostilities at all, but they didn't have the right wrench to fix it; \n$85,000 brand new truck abandoned because they had a plugged fuel pump. \nIt didn't matter. With a cost-plus contract, the American taxpayers \npick up the tab. A case of Coca-Cola, $45. Gasoline was delivered by \nHalliburton for twice the cost that the internal part of the Defense \nDepartment said they could have provided it for. Halliburton charged \n42,000 meals a day, when they were delivering 14,000 meals, \novercharging by 28,000 soldiers a day. They leased SUVs for $7,500 a \nmonth.\n  Halliburton supplied troops with hand towels and the person who \nordered the hand towels was in Kuwait. He came to a hearing I held. He \nsaid he was ordered to purchase towels that were nearly three times \nmore expensive than regular towels. Why? Because the company, KBR, \nwanted their name embroidered on the towels used by the troops. Their \nattitude was, the American taxpayer pays for it; it doesn't matter, \nit's cost plus, don't worry about cost.\n  It is unbelievable when you see what has happened with some of this \ncontracting. We heard from Rory Mayberry, former food production \nmanager. He also was at KBR. He said:\n\n       Food items were being brought into the base that were \n     stamped expired or outdated by as much as a year. We were \n     told by KBR food service managers, use the items anyway. The \n     food was fed to the troops. For trucks that were hit by \n     convoy fire and bombings, we were told to go into the trucks, \n     remove the food items, and use them after removing the \n     bullets and any shrapnel from the bad food that was hit. We \n     were told, by the way, to turn the removed bullets over \n     to the managers for souvenirs.\n\n  How about water? Contaminated water, more contaminated than raw water \ntaken from the Euphrates River, delivered as non-potable water to our \ntroops to shower, shave, and so on, more contaminated than raw water \nfrom the Euphrates River. Halliburton says it never happened. I have an \ninternal Halliburton report that says it did happen, and they nearly \nmissed having a catastrophe of mass sickness or death. I also have an \ne-mail sent to my by a captain, a young physician serving in Iraq. She \nsaid: I read in the newspaper about your hearing. What you alleged is \nexactly what is happening at our base.\n  Let me describe a couple of those. This is an internal Halliburton \nreport written by the top water quality manager Wil Granger, May 13, \n2005:\n\n       No disinfection of non-potable water was occurring [at camp \n     Ar Ramadi] for water designated for showering purposes. This \n     caused an unknown population to be exposed to potentially \n     harmful water for an undetermined amount of time.\n\n  It didn't just happen at Ar Ramadi. It happened at every base in \nIraq.\n\n       The deficiencies of the camp where the event occurred is \n     not exclusive to that camp; meaning that countrywide all \n     camps suffered to some extent for all or some of the same \n     deficiencies noted.\n\n  This is from an internal Halliburton report written by the top water \nquality person at Halliburton. These are contracts we pay for. We pay a \ncompany to provide water to the military installations that now exist \nin Iraq. Who is accountable for having water sent to our troops, non-\npotable water that is more contaminated than water in the Euphrates \nRiver?\n  CPT Michelle Callahan, who is currently serving in Iraq--at least she \nwas when she sent me an e-mail--found exactly the same cases of \nbacterial infections among the troops, traced the problem back to \ncontaminated water that KBR was not treating properly. She had one of \nher officers follow the lines to find out where that water came from \nand why. So water to the troops, that is a health issue. Food to the \ntroops, that is a health issue.\n  Two guys show up in Iraq--one's name is Custer, and the other is \nBattles--with not much experience and no money. But they understand you \ncan make a lot of money in Iraq, American money. So they started a \ncompany. Within 2\\1/2\\ years, my understanding is, they have had \ncontracts of over $100 million. They got into trouble. It has been in \nthe courts. Among other things alleged, they took forklift trucks from \nthe Baghdad airport, moved them to a warehouse, repainted them blue and \nsold them back to the Coalition Provisional Authority, which was us. \nThis company got a contract for security at the Baghdad airport. Let me \nshow you what the director of security at the airport said about Custer \nBattles:\n\n       Custer Battles have shown themselves to be unresponsive, \n     uncooperative, incompetent, deceitful, manipulative and war \n     profiteers. Other than that, they are swell fellows.\n\n  Once again, who is accountable for the amount of money we are \nspending for these kind of contractors?\n  How about the Iraqi physician, a doctor from Iraq who came to testify \nat my policy committee hearing. We spent a couple hundred million \ndollars on the Parsons Corporation to rehabilitate 142 health clinics \nin Iraq. This Iraqi doctor went to the Iraqi Health Minister and said: \nI want to see these rehabilitated health clinics. Because he knew the \nmoney had all been spent. An American contractor got the money to do \nit, and it was gone.\n  He said: I want to see these 142 rehabilitated health clinics for the \npeople of Iraq. The Iraqi Health Minister said: You don't understand. \nMost of these are imaginary clinics. The money is gone, but apparently \nthe clinics don't exist.\n  Does that bother anybody? Is there any accountability for that? Seems \nto me there ought to be accountability for something like that.\n  I held hearings not just on contracting in Iraq, which I found to be \na cesspool of unbelievable problems, but hearings with respect to \ncontracting to deal with the problems of Hurricane Katrina. I wish to \nshow you a picture of a man named Paul Mullinax. I sat in a grocery \nstore parking lot one Sunday morning talking to Paul on the phone, \nasking if he would come to testify at a hearing. He wasn't anxious to \ndo it, but he finally did. This is Paul Mullinax. This is his truck, an \n18-wheel truck. Let me tell you the story Paul told.\n  Hurricane Katrina hit. And one of the things that was necessary to be \nprovided to the victims of the hurricane was ice. So Paul was \ncontracted by FEMA to pick up ice. He drove his truck from Florida to \nNew York to pick up a load of ice. Then he was told he should take that \nice to Carthage, MO. He went to Carthage with his truck and his \nrefrigerated container full of ice. When he got to Carthage, he was \ntold he should proceed to Maxwell Air Force Base in Montgomery, AL. \nWhen he got to Montgomery, he discovered there were over 100 trucks \nsitting there, refrigerated trucks there with ice. So for the next 12 \ndays, this was Paul's life. There were victims of the hurricane waiting \nfor relief, waiting for the cargo in his truck. For 12 days, he sat in \nfront of this truck waiting. He finally said to them: If you are not \ngoing to tell me where to go or let me do this, I am going to go on my \nown and drop off the ice to some people who need it. They said: You \ncan't do that. He said: I had no idea when I parked the truck I would \nbe there for the next 12 days, my refrigerator unit running the entire \ntime. Each truck cost the American taxpayer $6 to $900 a day.\n  You can see him sitting here with a cooler and a little girl for \nnearly 2 weeks waiting. Finally, he was told: You should take your ice \nto Massachusetts. So this man from Florida, who to New York to pick up \nice, went to Missouri and then went to Alabama and then waited, then \nwas told to take the truck to Massachusetts. Unbelievable. What was the \nAmerican taxpayers' role in this, $15,000. It cost $15,000 for this \nincompetence.\n  Why does all of this happen? It happens because in this case with \nFEMA, a bunch of cronies were put in place to run the place. Were they \nqualified people? No. Most of them had political connections. They \ndidn't have any emergency or disaster preparedness experience. That is \nwhat happens.\n  Who is accountable for that? Who ultimately is going to be \naccountable? How can we restore accountability? I have described a few \nof the problems. I have described a very few of the problems. The \nproblems are unbelievable. I think it is the most significant waste, \nfraud, and abuse, perhaps, in the history of this country, billions and \nbillions of dollars with no one accountable. At the hearings last week, \nthe answer was: It is wartime. So we distribute cash from the back of a \npickup truck. We say it is the Wild West, bring a bag. We pay in cash.\n\n[[Page S1819]]\n\n  And it is wartime. I don't understand that. I have tried to find out \nwho was responsible for having a Florida trucker pick up ice from New \nYork to take to the victims of Katrina in the Gulf of Mexico and have \nthe ice dropped off in Massachusetts, and we get stuck with $15,000, \nand the victims of the hurricane get nothing. But there is no \naccountability for anything.\n  So we will be introducing legislation, with 23 cosponsors later, this \nweek. It is going to punish war profiteers--and, yes, there has been \nrampant profiteering going on. There will be substantial punishments \nfor war profiteers. This antiprofiteering provision is based on a piece \nof legislation that Senator Leahy introduced, and that was included in \nour contract and reform bill.\n  Our bill will also restore a Clinton administration rule on \nsuspension and disbarment, which prohibits awarding Federal contracts \nto companies that exhibited a pattern of failing to comply with the \nlaw. That provision, by the way, was done away with by the current \nadministration.\n  It seems to me it is time to say that you only get one chance, and if \nyou cheat us, no more contracts. This notion of a slap on the wrist and \na pat on the back is over. There was a time when exactly the same \ncompany had been in Federal court in Alexandria, VA, with allegations \nof fraud against the American taxpayer against that company; and on the \nsame day, they were signing a new acquisition contract with the \nDepartment of Defense. That ought to never happen again.\n  We ought to crack down on contract cheaters. We ought to force real \ncontract competition. When somebody such as Bunnatine Greenhouse speaks \nup and says ``this is the most blatant abuse in contracting I have seen \nin my career,'' that ought not to be a cause for penalty. This woman \nrisked her career and we are still trying to get to the bottom of who \nis accountable for her demotion. She was given a choice of being fired \nor demoted because she spoke out against contract fraud and abuse.\n  We think we need to strengthen whistleblower protection. We think it \nis important to have full disclosure of contract abuses and to restore \nthe provision that says if there is a pattern of abuse, you don't get \nto engage in contracting anymore with the Federal Government.\n  This is very simple. I come from a small town, a town of slightly \nless than 300 people. There is a very simple code in towns such as \nthat. If you are a business man or woman on Main Street and someone \ncheats you, you don't do business with them again. That is simple. That \nis a lesson apparently lost on a behemoth Federal Government.\n  The contracting provisions we will introduce are common sense, and \nthis Congress ought to adopt them quickly. There will be a substantial \nnumber of cosponsors in support of the legislation that is filled with \ncommon sense, at the very time that we have witnessed the most \nsignificant waste, fraud, and abuse in this country's history. \nAccountability? What about accountability for what happened? What about \naccountability for what is about to happen? We are still spending a lot \nof money. We will have $100 billion requested of us and another $150 \nbillion to replenish accounts, much of it through contracts. We say \nwith this piece of legislation that it is long past the time for this \nGovernment to be accountable to the taxpayer and accountable to the \ncitizens of the United States.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Pryor).

Mr. President, later this afternoon, several of us \nwill be introducing legislation to reauthorize Head Start. Senator \nKennedy, Senator Enzi, Senator Dodd, and myself will be the cosponsors \nof the legislation. We have been working on it for a long time, all \nthrough the last Congress. We have heard from lots of parents, \nchildren, and Head Start operators. I wish to talk about that.\n  The Head Start program is an enormously popular and successful \nFederal initiative. It began in the 1960s when Lyndon Johnson was \nPresident of the United States. In fact, I have always thought it was a \npart of the story of the American dream that President Johnson went \nback to Cotulla, TX, near the Mexican border, where he taught first \ngrade, to announce the Head Start program. It exemplifies one of the \ngreat principles of what it means to be an American--that we believe in \nequal opportunity. For that President of the United States to go back \nto where he was a first grade teacher reminds us that other children \ncould succeed, as he did, in becoming President.\n  Today, Head Start has grown to a nearly $7 billion Federal program. \nThat amount was spent last year. It served 900,000 children. In my \nState of Tennessee, 20,000 students or so were served. The funding was \n$118 million for Tennessee. This is a program that touches a lot of \npeople. It deserves the Senate's attention, and it has had the Senate's \nattention.\n  During the last Congress, I made clear, as did several other \nSenators, that we want to see Head Start serve more children. But \nfirst, we wanted to make sure the program is accountable, financially \nsolvent, and meeting the purpose for which it was formed. President \nBush, in his message to Congress, said much the same thing 2 years ago. \n``Great program,'' he said. ``But let's make it more accountable. Let's \nrecognize that now we expect children to learn more and be able to do \nmore before they arrive at school.'' The President said we want to get \nthe States more involved, which was a good suggestion because when Head \nStart was founded, it was almost the only program to help \npreschool children. Today, while it is a large $7 billion program, \nthere are $21 billion more in Federal dollars being spent to help \npreschool children in one way or the other, and there are a great many \nState and local programs that are Head Start or preschool programs.\n\n  The President's objective, as was ours, was to find a way to make all \nof these programs work well together. We listened carefully and I \nbelieve, as Senators Kennedy, Enzi, and Dodd believe, we have made \nsignificant improvements to the bill.\n  For example, the bill will establish 200 new Centers of Excellence \nthat will serve as model Head Start programs across the country. The \nGovernors will be involved in this. Hopefully, we can learn over the \nnext 5 years from the States how, from these models, we can put \ntogether State efforts, local efforts, Federal efforts, and Federal \nHead Start efforts in a more efficient way to help children who are of \npreschool age.\n  Second, our legislation requires grant recipients to recompete for \nnew grants every 5 years to help ensure a constant high level of \nquality.\n  Third, we clearly define what we mean by deficiency. We don't aim to \ncatch people doing things wrong; we would rather catch them doing \nthings right. When there are things that are wrong, the Head Start \nproviders deserve to know what the standards are so they can make sure \nthey meet them.\n  Fourth, this legislation provides clear authority to the governing \nboards to administer, and be held accountable for, local Head Start \nprograms while ensuring that policy councils on which parents sit \ncontinue to play a crucial and important role.\n  Finally, as I mentioned earlier, this legislation continues to \nencourage State standards especially that cause there to be more \ncognitive learning, more emphasis on what children should be able to \nknow and be able to do before they get to first grade--make sure they \nare ready to learn.\n  Americans uniquely believe that each of us has the right to begin at \nthe same starting line and that, if we do, anything is possible for any \none of us. We also understand that some of us need help getting to that \nstarting line. Most Federal funding for social programs is based upon \nan understanding of equal opportunity in that way.\n  Again, Head Start began in 1965 to make it more likely that \ndisadvantaged children would successfully arrive at one of the most \nimportant of our starting lines--the beginning of school. Head Start, \nover the years, has served hundreds of thousands of our most at-risk \nchildren. The program has grown and changed, been subjected to debate; \nbut it has stood the test of\n\n[[Page S1820]]\n\ntime because it is very important. We have made a lot of progress. Only \na few professionals had studied early childhood education when it \nbegan. Even fewer had designed programs specifically for children in \npoverty with the many challenges.\n  The origins of Head Start come from an understanding that success for \nthese children wasn't only about their education. The program was \ndesigned to be certain that these children were healthy, got their \nimmunizations, were fed hot meals and of crucial importance--that their \nparents were deeply involved in the program.\n  From the beginning, comprehensive services, including medical, \ndental, and nutritional services--and parent and community involvement \nwere a part of Head Start programs, and that is still true today. In \nthe early days, teacher training and curriculum were seen as less \nimportant. Now we know a lot more about brain development and how \nchildren learn from birth, and we understand that even for these very \nyoung children, teacher training and curriculum are very important.\n  Today, young children are expected to learn more and be able to do \nmore in order to succeed in school. Many public schools now offer \nkindergarten. When this program started, Tennessee didn't have a public \nschool kindergarten program. Now 40 States offer early childhood \nprograms.\n  As Congress prepares to reauthorize Head Start, it is important that \nwe recognize the program's importance and work to make it stronger. But \nwe need to recognize also that today it is not fulfilling its promise \nas well as we would like. It is not meeting the purpose of serving our \nchildren who are most at risk as well as we would hope. I am not \nsatisfied with the current practices, which fall short of the standards \nthe taxpayers should expect, and that is why there are some changes in \nthe bill.\n  We address this issue, first, by holding up successful local programs \nas models so others may follow their example, and by clarifying lines \nof accountability so any corrupt practices may be rooted out. The bill \ncreates ways for States to help strengthen and coordinate Head Start, \nbut would continue to send Federal funds directly to the nearly 1,700 \ngrantees that provide services in over 29,000 Head Start centers that \nserve just over 900,000 disadvantaged children.\n  Let me talk about the Centers of Excellence first, because this is \none of the most hotly debated parts of the bill--or it was. I think it \nis pretty well accepted now. The bill authorizes the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services to create a nationwide network of 200 Centers \nof Excellence in early childhood built around exemplary Head Start \nprograms. These Centers of Excellence would be nominated by the \nGovernors. Each Center of Excellence would receive a Federal bonus \ngrant of at least $200,000 in each of 5 years, in addition to base \nfunding.\n  The Centers' bonus grants could be used for some of the following:\n  One, to work in their community to demonstrate the best of what Head \nStart can do for at-risk children and families, including getting the \nchildren ready for school and ready for academic success.\n  Two, it can coordinate all early childhood services in the community. \nAs I mentioned earlier, we are spending $21 billion in Federal dollars \nfor these children. Many States and local governments are spending \nmoney. We need to spend it together.\n  Three, we can offer training and support to all professionals working \nwith at-risk children.\n  Next, we can track Head Start families and ensure that their services \nare provided seamlessly to children, from prenatal to age 8.\n  Next, they can be models of excellence held accountable for helping \nour most disadvantaged children.\n  Finally, to have the flexibility to serve additional Head Start, or \nearly Head Start children, or provide more full-day services to better \nmeet the needs of working parents.\n  Head Start centers are uneven in performance, but usually they excel \nin two areas critical to success for caring and educating children: No. \n1, developing community support and, No. 2, encouraging parental \ninvolvement. Alex Haley, one of my closest friends, and the author of \n``Roots,'' lived by these words:\n\n       Find the good and praise it.\n\n  For me, that was an invaluable lesson. My hope is these Centers of \nExcellence will find the good and praise what is best about Head Start \nand show it to the rest of us.\n  It also helps to get the Governors involved. The President had \nsuggested that we turn more of the funding over directly to the States. \nI and others are not willing to do that, at least at this stage.\n  One of the beauties of Head Start is that it is very decentralized \nand for a long time it has worked well that way. So our compromise was \nthat the Centers of Excellence, which will get the Governors involved, \nwill help coordinate the programs more effectively and maybe we can \nlearn something over the next 5 years that we can put then in the next \nreauthorization of Head Start.\n  Also, this bill goes a long way to help make the spending of that $7 \nbillion of taxpayers' money more accountable. First, it requires \nrecipients to recompete for grants every 5 years. This ensures that \nafter 5 years, each program is still meeting its standards.\n  I recognize there are concerns about this recompete requirement. Some \npeople say we need continuity and it will create anxiety among \nchildren, among teachers if they are afraid they may lose their right \nto continue serving after 5 years.\n  Many Head Start grant recipients are doing a very good job, and \nrather than causing a disruption every 5 years, I hope this recompete \nprocess will highlight their success. To help streamline the process \nfor successful programs, grant recipients that are neither deficient \nnor have been found to have an area of noncompliance left unresolved \nfor more than 120 days will receive a priority designation during the \nrecompetition process.\n  Second, the bill defines what makes a local program deficient. Right \nnow, the deficiency standard is very general and inconsistent across \nthe Nation. But if an action threatens the health, safety, or civil \nrights of children and staff, denies the parents the exercise of their \nfull roles and responsibilities, misuses funds, loses its legal status \nor financial viability, or violates other standards specified in the \nbill, those are the more specific standards that are now a part of the \nbill. It will help make it possible for grantees to have a clearer idea \nof what they are expected to do.\n  Finally, the bill makes clear that the governing board shall be the \nbody that is charged with running local programs and which will be held \naccountable for those programs. This may seem like a little bit of \ninside baseball, but it is actually not. It goes straight to the heart \nof several of the problems we have had in some Head Start grantees \naround the country.\n  Perhaps the most effective witness I heard in any of our hearings was \nthe mayor of Shelby County, TN--that is around Memphis--A.C. Wharton. \nA.C. Wharton testified, as did other witnesses, that the dual \ngovernance structure between the governing board and the policy council \nwas inadequate and neither body had adequate decisionmaking authority. \nHere is what he told the committee:\n\n       What we're faced with is not merely a benign situation in \n     which an errant agency through no bad intent runs afoul of \n     the guidelines. In many instances the wrongdoings and \n     shortfalls are calculated to bring about the political \n     empowerment or financial enrichment of those who profit from \n     the wrongdoing.\n\n  I believe we fix that problem based on the advice we received from \nMayor Wharton and other witnesses. This bill gives governing boards \ndirect authority and holds them accountable. That is an important \nelement of the bill, and I think it is a necessary step. But Mayor \nWharton and others reminded us that we need to be careful about how we \nhandle this issue. Mayor Wharton said the governing body should not \n``be allowed to ride roughshod over the dignity that should be accorded \nall participants in Head Start programs whether they are grantees, \npolicy councils, policy committees, or certainly children and \nparents.''\n  I appreciate the mayor's concern, and I appreciate that note of \ncaution. I thank him for his straightforward testimony. Perhaps he will \nknow that long trip from Memphis to Washington was not in vain because \nhis concerns are right in the middle of the bill that we will introduce \nlater today.\n\n[[Page S1821]]\n\n  We all understand the importance of parental involvement and parental \nresponsibility over the operation of the Head Start Program. We want to \npreserve that parental responsibility, but we also want to make sure we \npreserve fiscal accountability of the program at the same time, and we \nbelieve we have done that. We have crafted a careful balance. We give \nthe governing board fiscal and legal responsibility, while ensuring \npolicy councils on which parents sit continue to play an important role \nin the running and operation of local Head Start Programs within the \nframework the governing board sets. It is a fair compromise and one \nthat will strengthen the program.\n  I learned about the importance of preschool education in a very \npersonal way. When I was growing up in Maryville, TN, at the edge of \nthe Great Smokey Mountains, my mother operated the only preschool \neducation program in our town--well, there may have been one other. I \nthink Mrs. Pesterfield also had one. But she operated this program in a \nconverted garage in our backyard. She had 25 3- and 4-year-olds in the \nmorning and 25 5-year-olds in the afternoon. I think she charged $25 a \nmonth for this care for these children.\n  This was before Head Start. This was before we understood very much \nabout preschool education and the early development of the brain. But \nparents instinctively knew that was a good place for their children. \nWhen Alcoa moved executives to our little town, they usually would find \na way to get their children into Mrs. Alexander's nursery school and \nkindergarten before they looked for a home because those parents knew \nthen that preschool education was important to their children's \nsuccess.\n  We all understand that for all of our children. We understand that \nthe earlier this starts--at home first--and then with all the extra \nhelp we can give that home, these children will be ready to get to the \nstarting point.\n\n  I am the only U.S. Secretary of Education, I think, Mr. President, \nwho spent 5 years in kindergarten. The reason I did was that my mother \nhad no other place to put me than the kindergarten she operated in our \nbackyard. Looking back, there probably wasn't a better place for me to \nhave been than that 5 years of intensive preschool education. It is \nsomething we should hope for virtually every child growing up in this \ncountry. We believe anything is possible. We believe in free \nenterprise, we believe in competition, and we believe in the starting \nline. But there is no Federal program that exists that does a better \njob of helping disadvantaged children get to the starting line than \nHead Start.\n  I congratulate Senator Kennedy, Senator Enzi, and Senator Dodd, and \nthe other Senators who have worked on this legislation. We look forward \nto introducing the legislation this afternoon. I thank all those who \nhave taken time to come to the hearings, and I especially thank the \nmayor of Shelby County, Mayor Wharton, for his testimony because it has \nmade its way directly into the legislation to help make sure Head Start \nnot only helps children but that there is accountability to the \ntaxpayers.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I will talk about something very important \nwhich will soon be pending before the Senate; that is, the nomination \nof Carl Joseph Artman as Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs.\n  The Indian program in this country is very important. As part of the \nGovernment, we have part of the Interior Department working on it. I \nrise to offer my strong support for the nomination of Carl Artman for \nAssistant Secretary for Indian Affairs in the Department of the \nInterior. Mr. Artman is an excellent candidate with diversity and \nexperience in both the public and private sectors and has the \nleadership and the academic credentials needed for this extraordinarily \ndemanding position.\n  This position is unique in that many of the issues with respect to \nIndian affairs are unique. Yet it has to be someone who has background \nin government and operations. The Assistant Secretary implements \nFederal Indian policy set forth by the Congress and facilitates the \ngovernment-to-government relationships with 561 Indian tribal \ngovernments. That is a large challenge.\n  The Assistant Secretary is responsible for a variety of activities \nand programs in Indian communities, including economic development, law \nenforcement, trust assessment management, social services, and \neducation. In discharging these duties, the Assistant Secretary must \nbalance many competing interests and needs in working with the States, \nin working with the tribes, and in working with the Federal Government. \nMr. Artman has pledged to facilitate more vibrant communication among \nthe Indian tribes and their neighbors. I believe that is helpful in \nterms of furthering Federal policies of interaction with the Indian \ntribes on a government-to-government basis and encouraging Indian self-\ndetermination and self-government. That is our challenge and the \nchallenge the tribes take, to become more independent economically and \nfrom a government standpoint so they can operate as they choose with \nself-government.\n  The job of Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs has been made \nexponentially more difficult by the methamphetamine plague that has \nravaged the Indian tribes and the Indian communities. I am encouraged \nby Mr. Artman's commitment to fighting and defeating this epidemic, \nwhich may require aggressive efforts by the agency he will lead as well \nas other Federal and tribal partners to achieve measurable results.\n  Mr. Artman is also committed to assisting tribal governments develop \nthe socioeconomic infrastructure and fight the obstacles in many of our \nIndian reservations that foster hopelessness and despair. One of the \nissues is to provide opportunities for the tribal members to have jobs, \nto be somewhat sufficient and self-supporting in terms of their \neconomy.\n  Although many Indian tribes have made tremendous gains through tribal \nself-governance and some have managed to flourish materially in recent \nyears through economic development, it is a common misperception that \nmost tribes have experienced economic prosperity as a result of \nsuccessful gaming facilities. In fact, poverty and unemployment are \nsill prevalent in far too many communities in Indian Country. A robust \nand diversified economy is essential to improving the quality of life \nof these communities and to providing the people living in them with \nalternatives to such heartbreaking problems of suicide and substance \nabuse, of which there is an abundance.\n  I am confident that Mr. Artman will provide outstanding leadership in \nthis daunting challenge. I urge my friends in the Senate to approve his \nconfirmation, which I hope will come before the Senate in the very near \nfuture.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tester). The Senator from Oregon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/12/senate-section/article/S1821-3", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1821-S1822]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. SMITH.

Mr. President, I came here today knowing we were in \nmorning business but looking to find a time to make a case of my State \nbefore the United States on an issue of great emergency. The clock is \nrunning out. I am speaking of the Secure Rural Schools and Community \nSelf-Determination Act of 2000.\n  I am pleased to state that in my conversation with my friend, the \nmajority leader, he did indicate that he has become aware of this issue \nwith some intensity through his conversations with Senator Wyden and \nnow with me, and that Senator Wyden and I have little choice but to use \nall of our rights and privileges as Senators to focus the attention of \nthe United States on this dire issue. I know many of my colleagues want \nto speak. I do not mean to disrupt their schedules, but as long as I \ncan be allowed to speak today and at future opportunities, I intend to \nspeak and to take a lot of time. I came prepared to speak for 5 hours \ntoday. I have a long speech, a lot of phonebooks in the cloakroom. I \nhave a tale to tell that I believe America needs to hear about the \nPacific Northwest and the people I am privileged to represent.\n\n  I want Members to understand my position in the Senate, how a rural \nbusinessman from eastern Oregon was elected to the Senate, the first \ntime someone with my profile has been elected in my State in over 70 \nyears. It is because my political base was heard and through my \ncandidacy has tried to be heard. It is a political base the cornerstone \nof which consists of farmers, fishermen, and foresters.\n  The rural people I live with in rural Oregon, my hometown of \nPendleton, OR, are counting on me to do everything I can to bring to \nthe attention of this Senate and to the Congress in general the dire \nsituation in which our State finds itself.\n  I talked about the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-\nDetermination Act of 2000. That program actually expired last December. \nDespite many efforts in this Senate and from my colleagues in the \nHouse, efforts to extend the safety net have simply failed. Senator \nWyden is working the way I did with my leadership before when we were \nin the majority. I hope he finds something different from what I found. \nWhat I found was people willing to listen, your cause is just, but we \ncan't do anything for you unless and until everyone is in agreement.\n  The problem for this particular bill is that it isn't Republican and \nDemocratic; it is the United States against the Pacific Northwest. It \nis State versus State. It is Idaho complaining about Oregon's formula \nallocation or Washington about Oregon or Montana or California or \nMississippi or all the States in the Southeast that look for county \nfunding from this act. It is really more parochial. It is more local. \nIt is more about individual constituencies.\n  The formula complained about was a formula derived from this bill \nthat Senator Craig, Senator Wyden, and myself, as the original \nsponsors, authored. It is a formula based on historic harvest off of \npublic lands. By that historical formula, Oregon got about half of the \nmoney allocated under this program. There is disgruntlement now with \nthat formula. The problem is no one can agree on another formula \nwithout doing great damage to the historical position in which Oregon \nfinds itself.\n  As I speak today, thousands of layoff notices are being prepared by \nrural counties in my State. These include law enforcement officers, \ncounty road crews, surveyors, assessors, clerks, public health workers, \ndistrict attorneys, among others. These are the basic units of our \nextended democracy. These services are required by the Oregon State \nConstitution to be provided by our counties. Now those units of \ngovernment are in jeopardy.\n  My amendment cannot be called up because the amendment tree has been \nfilled by the majority, as is their right--a practice that is coming, \nthough, under increased scrutiny. I will briefly describe the \namendment. It provides a 1-year extension of the safety net. Literally, \nwhat we are talking in the totality of this budget is a .09 percent \nacross-the-board cut to other programs funded in this bill. I realize \nthe majority would prefer to have this Chamber acquiesce to the \npreexisting contents of the bill. The fact that we are only now \nconsidering it, just hours before the Federal Government shuts down, \nillustrates this point.\n  Some have said to me: How can you try to look for opportunities to \nfilibuster the continuing resolution? How can you do that, Senator, and \nshut down the Government? I believe this Senate should know my heart \nand feeling is the United States will shut down Oregon in many respects \nif the continuing resolution is allowed to go forward without, \nliterally, $360 million. That is what we are talking about--in a $1.7 \ntrillion budget, $365 million. That is a lot of money to you and me \nindividually; it is a rounding error in a $1.7 trillion continuing \nresolution. When that is translated to what it means to Oregon \ncounties, it means shutdown.\n  This is not a pure continuing resolution, though. The Committee on \nAppropriations of both the House and the Senate have shifted billions \nof dollars between accounts in support of their priorities. Many of \nthose adjustments are laudable and reflect the Nation's priorities. But \nthe fact that the county payments safety net was not addressed in this \nbill requires me to come to this floor and do what I can to change it. \nIt may also reflect that many of my colleagues do not understand what \nthis program means--not only to my State but to 8.5 million \nschoolchildren, 557,000 teachers, and 18,000 schools nationwide.\n\n  But to fully understand the safety net and this Government's moral \nobligation to rural counties, a history lesson is in order. My \ncolleagues need to understand why Federal forest management decisions \nmake or break my State and why the consequences of these decisions have \nmoral implications for this Chamber to consider and to act upon.\n  The Oregon story is a history of trees and timber, of boom and bust. \nThe Federal Government plays a central role in this account, both as \nprotagonist and antagonist.\n  Alexis de Tocqueville, writing about democracy in America in the \n1830s, believed that any history--of men and nations alike--must begin \nat infancy. He wrote:\n\n       A man has come into the world; his early years are spent \n     without notice in the pleasures and activities of childhood. \n     As he grows up, the world receives him when his manhood \n     begins, and he enters into contact with his fellows. He is \n     then studied for the first time, and it is imagined that the \n     germ of the vices and the virtues of his maturer years is \n     then formed.\n       This, if I am not mistaken, is a great error. We must begin \n     higher up; we must watch the infant in his mother's arms; we \n     must see the first images which the external world casts upon \n     the dark mirror of his mind, the first occurrences that he \n     witnesses, we must hear the first words which awaken the \n     sleeping powers of thought, and stand by his earliest efforts \n     if we would understand the prejudices, the habits, and the \n     passions which will rule his life. The entire man is, so to \n     speak, to be seen in the cradle of the child.\n\n  Like Alexis de Tocqueville's America, the Oregon story must be told \nfrom the beginning.\n  Many of my colleagues are familiar with the slogan ``54-40 or \nfight!'' This referred to the territorial dispute between Great Britain \nand the United States over the Northwest Territory, lying south of the \nparallel 54 degrees, 40 minutes.\n  In 1846, Great Britain conceded absolute jurisdiction to the United \nStates, and in 1848, Congress formally declared this land ``the Oregon \nTerritory,'' albeit below the 49th parallel.\n  Joseph Lane, of Roseburg, OR, became the first territorial Governor \nof Oregon Territory. Soon thereafter, the Columbia River divided it \ninto two territories, with Washington Territory demarcated north of the \nriver.\n  Two days from now will mark the 148th anniversary of a great act of \nthis body. By the way, Oregon's birthday is Valentines Day every year.\n\n[[Page S1823]]\n\n  Let me read from the Congressional Record--then called the Journal of \nthe Senate--from February 14, 1859:\n\n       Mr. President: The House of Representatives has passed the \n     bill of the Senate (S. 239) for the admission of Oregon into \n     the Union.\n       Mr. Jones reported from the committee that they had \n     examined and found duly enrolled the bill (S. 239) for the \n     admission of Oregon into the Union.\n       A message from the President of the United States by Mr. \n     Henry, his secretary:\n       Mr. President: The President of the United States this day \n     approved and signed an act (S. 239) for the admission of \n     Oregon into the Union.\n       Mr. Pugh presented the credentials of the honorable Joseph \n     Lane, elected a senator by the legislature of the State of \n     Oregon.\n       The credentials were read; and the oath prescribed by law \n     was administered to Mr. Lane and he took his seat in the \n     Senate.\n       Mr. Gwin presented the credentials of the honorable Delazon \n     Smith, elected a senator by the legislature of the State of \n     Oregon.\n       The credentials were read; and the oath prescribed by law \n     was administered to Mr. Smith and he took his seat in the \n     Senate.\n\n  I note that my colleague, Senator Wyden, is on the floor. As a matter \nof interest to him and me, I sit in the seat of, I suppose \nappropriately, Delazon Smith. Senator Wyden sits in the seat of Joseph \nLane.\n  Mr. President, as an aside, I have always thought the best movie I \nhad ever seen as a little boy was ``Mr. Smith Goes to Washington.'' \nApparently, I am going to be denied that opportunity today, but I do \nwant to begin this 5-hour speech which the Senate will hear in its \nentirety eventually and on other pieces of legislation inevitably.\n\n       Mr. Gwin submitted the following resolutions; which were \n     considered, by unanimous consent, and agreed to:\n       Resolved, That the Senate proceed to ascertain the classes \n     in which the senators from the State of Oregon shall be \n     inserted, in conformity with the resolution of the 14th of \n     May, 1879, and as the Constitution requires.\n       Resolved, That the Secretary put into the ballot box two \n     papers of equal size, one of which shall be numbered one, and \n     the other shall be numbered two, and each senator shall draw \n     out one paper; that the senator who shall draw the paper \n     numbered one shall be inserted in the class of senators whose \n     term of service will expire the 3d day of March, 1859, and \n     the senator who shall draw the paper numbered two shall be \n     inserted in the class of senators whose term of service will \n     expire the 3d day of March, 1861.\n       Whereupon--The papers above mentioned, being put by the \n     Secretary into the ballot box, the honorable Joseph Lane drew \n     the paper numbered two, and is accordingly in the class of \n     senators whose term of service will expire the third day of \n     March, 1861. The honorable Delazon Smith drew the paper \n     numbered one, and is accordingly in the class of senators \n     whose term of service will expire the third of March, 1859.\n\n  That is the end of the citation.\n  This is how Oregon entered the Union and its first two U.S. Senators \nwere welcomed into this great deliberative body--148 years ago this \nWednesday.\n  On February 14, 1859, Oregon had a population of 52,465 people. \nCongress passed and President Lincoln signed into law the Homestead Act \nin 1862. That law offered 160 acres to any citizen who would live on \nfrontier land for 5 years. By 1866, Oregon's population was nearly \ndoubled by those answering the Federal Government's call into the \nfertile valleys and along the fish-filled rivers of Oregon. Even when \nthe land in the valleys and along the rivers was all taken, there was \nanother wave of pioneers ready to head into the mountains.\n  One such story is recounted by Jessie Wright in her book ``How High \nthe Bounty.'' Jessie and Perry Wright were granted the first of five \nhomesteads in the Umpqua National Forest. This story--as were thousands \nof others--was a call to the Manifest Destiny, embodied in our State \nsong, ``Oregon, My Oregon.'' By the way, if I get a chance to get back \nat this, eventually I will read the whole book, ``How High the \nBounty,'' here in the Senate. But our State song embodies this Manifest \nDestiny. It sings like this. I will not sing it to you, Mr. President.\n\n     Land of the Empire Builders,\n     Land of the Golden West;\n     Conquered and held by free men,\n     Fairest and the best.\n     Onward and upward ever,\n     Forward and on, and on;\n     Hail to thee, Land of Heroes,\n     My Oregon.\n\n     Land of the rose and sunshine,\n     Land of the summer's breeze;\n     Laden with health and vigor,\n     Fresh from the Western seas.\n     Blest by the blood of martyrs,\n     Land of the setting sun;\n     Hail to thee, Land of Promise,\n     My Oregon.\n\n  When Oregon entered the Union in 1859, the State itself was given \nroughly 3.5 million acres of the 62 million acres lying within its \nboundaries. The remaining 95 percent of the land base was retained by \nthe Federal Government as national public domain lands. Think of that, \nMr. President. Just like your State, I suspect, the Federal Government \nowns most of it.\n  Over a period of 75 years, following Oregon's statehood, the U.S. \nGeneral Land Office sold, exchanged, donated, or otherwise disposed of \n23 million acres of Oregon's land--reducing Federal ownership from 91 \npercent to 52 percent.\n  The Federal Government continues to hold ownership to 33 million \nacres of Oregon land, wielding autocratic control over a majority of my \nState--a practice exercised only against Western States, holding them \nin what can only be described as a form of economic bondage. Neither \nthe State of Oregon nor its counties can tax federally controlled land \nor exercise any control whatsoever over them. But since 1908, with the \npassage of the 25 Percent Act, the Federal Government has paid counties \n25 percent of the income generated from timber, mining rights, grazing \nleases, and other benefits from the land it owns in Oregon. Twenty-five \npercent; that is what we are talking about. That is what has gone away \nthrough timber law changes and court decisions and administrative \nExecutive orders.\n  Since 1937, the Bureau of Land Management has shared 75 percent--and \nmore recently 50 percent--of its timber receipts with affected \ncounties.\n  It was out of the 33 million acres of Federal land that were created, \nfirst, the forest reserves and then the national forests. The General \nRevision Act in 1891 allowed Presidential withdrawal of forest \nreserves. The Organic Act and the Forest Reserve Act followed, \nexpanding the National Forest System and Federal assertion over the \nmanagement of these forests.\n  In creating these Federal forests, President Teddy Roosevelt had a \nclear policy. This is what Teddy Roosevelt said:\n\n       And now, first and foremost, you can never afford to forget \n     for one moment what is the object of our forest policy. That \n     object is not to preserve the forests because they are \n     beautiful, though that is good in itself; nor because they \n     are refuges for wild creatures of the wilderness, though \n     that, too, is good in itself; but the primary object of our \n     forest policy in the United States, is the making of \n     prosperous homes. Every other consideration comes as \n     secondary.\n\n  Unlike other Western States with national forests, Oregon has a \nunique tract of Federal forestland. Its official name is the Revested \nOregon and California Land Grant and the Reconveyed Coos Bay Wagon Road \ngrant lands, or O for short. These forests have a fascinating history \nof their own. To capture this history, I will borrow from the book \n``Saving Oregon's Golden Goose,'' interviews with Joe Miller. It reads \nas follows:\n\n       Think of railroads as the internet of America's Gilded Age. \n     . . .\n\n  Am I done, Mr. President? I am just getting to the good part. You \nwould really enjoy this.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used his 20 minutes. It has \nbeen good.\n  Mr. SMITH. I thank the Presiding Officer for the time and the \nmajority leader for his courtesy. I was informed by the majority leader \nthat after Senator Wyden and other Senators who have reserved time \nspeak, I could again ask for time, and would indicate that being my \nintention because I do not want you to miss this. This is really \ngetting good, Mr. President. There is about 4\\1/2\\ hours to go of it.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I believe the distinguished Senator from \nVirginia has time reserved at about 3:45. I ask unanimous consent to be \nable to speak up until 3:45, when the distinguished Senator from \nVirginia has his time allotted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, before he leaves the floor, let me tell my \ncolleague from Oregon that I very much appreciate his comments with \nrespect to the county payments legislation. The top priority--the top \npriority--for Oregon's congressional delegation in\n\n[[Page S1824]]\n\nthis session is getting this program reauthorized.\n  I wrote this law in 2000 with Senator Craig because it was my view in \n2000 that without this program, Oregon's rural communities would not \nsurvive. I am here today to tell the Senate that if this program is not \nreauthorized, there is a serious question today whether these rural \ncommunities will be able to survive. Now, I want to bring the Senate up \nto date on three developments with respect to the reauthorization of \nthis critically needed program.\n  The distinguished Senator from Nevada, the majority leader, Mr. Reid, \nhas been the majority leader for just over 1 month.\n  I have had many conversations with the majority leader about this \nprogram. He vacationed in our beautiful State this summer. He saw the \nimportance of our bountiful forests. I explained to him that the \nFederal Government owns more than half of our State. He has told me \nthat he is determined to work with me until our State gets a fair shake \nwith respect to this critically important program.\n  Second--and this is something that the distinguished Senator from \nMontana knows something about--we have a good bipartisan group of \nSenators on the legislation I have authored to reauthorize the program. \nBoth Senators from Oregon, both Senators from Washington, and both \nSenators from California, the distinguished Senator from Montana, and \nthe distinguished Senator from Alaska have all joined us in the effort \nto reauthorize this program.\n  Third, as the chairman of the Forestry Subcommittee, I would like to \nannounce that the first hearing we are going to have in the Forestry \nSubcommittee is to reauthorize this program. Because it is so \nimportant, because it is a lifeline to rural communities across our \nState, we are making this the subject of the first hearing. We have \npink slips going out now, county commissions trying to make decisions \nabout schools and law enforcement. These programs involved are not \nextras. They are not the kind of thing that you consider something you \nwould like to have. These are programs that involve law enforcement, \nthat raise the question of whether we are going to have school in our \nState other than three times a week in some of these rural communities. \nI am committed to making sure that doesn't happen. Senator Smith is \ncommitted to it. The whole Oregon congressional delegation is committed \nto it.\n  In Curry County, for example, on the Oregon coast, they are looking \nat the prospect of laying off all nonessential workers, including \npatrol officers, some of whom would be left to perform only their \nmandated correction duties. In a few months, they will have laid off 20 \npercent of their county workforce. My judgment is--and this comes \ndirectly from those folks in Curry County--there is a real question \nabout whether they are going to be able to continue as a county without \nthis essential program.\n  We have seen similar cuts put on the table all through the rural part \nof our State. A lot of Senators--I know the Senator from Montana knows \na little bit about it--can't identify with something like this. In most \nof the East, they don't have half of their land in public ownership. \nThey essentially have private property. A piece of private property is \nsold, revenue is generated, taxes are paid. That is how they pay for \nservices. We have not been able to do that in our State because the \nFederal Government owns more than half of our land.\n  People ask: How is it--and Senator Smith has touched on this this \nafternoon--that Oregon depends on these revenues for essential \nservices? Well, God made a judgment that what we ought to do in Oregon \nis grow these beautiful trees. And, by God, we delivered. That is what \nwe do. And we do it better than anybody else. So we didn't come up with \nsome arbitrary figure back in 2000 and say, well, let's just give the \nState of Oregon a whole bunch of money because we decided to exercise \nraw political muscle. It was essentially based on a formula that is \ndecades old, built around the proposition that where the Federal \nGovernment owns most of the land, we ought to make it possible for \nthose communities to get help, at least at that time, through timber \nreceipts. But when the environmental laws changed, suddenly those \ncounties were high and dry.\n  So I went to the Clinton administration. Frankly, I was pretty blunt. \nI have been blunt with the Bush administration, but I was even more \nblunt with the Clinton administration.\n  I said: You don't pass this program, you might as well not come to \nour State because you are not going to be able to make a case for \ncutting off this program when those communities are getting hammered \nthrough no fault of their own. They did nothing wrong.\n  What happened in this country is that values changed. Environmental \npriorities changed. All of a sudden those counties had nowhere to turn. \nSo you are seeing that in Montana, in Oregon, throughout these small \ncommunities.\n  Senator Smith has seen this as well. You can't go to a small \ncommunity in rural Oregon, such as John Day, and tell them they ought \nto set up a biotechnology company in the next few months. They are \nmaking a big push right now to diversify and get into other industries. \nBut these resource-dependent communities, communities that are looking \nat the axe falling on them, not in 6 months, not in a year, but coming \nup in a matter of weeks, they have nowhere to turn. So we consider \nourselves the last line of defense.\n  What we are asking for is what I and Senator Reid, the majority \nleader, have been talking about. And that is a fair shake for our \nState, not a death warrant for rural communities in our State, not a \nprogram that, in effect, has them shrivel up and disappear. We want a \nfair shake.\n  This is an extraordinarily important issue. I just had a big round of \ntownhall meetings across my State. We are all going home for the \nrecess. I will start another round of those townhall meetings in rural \nOregon this weekend. What happens at these meetings is you have law \nenforcement people. I had Sheriff Mike Winter from southern Oregon--I \nam sure Senator Smith knows Mike Winter--talking to us about what the \ncuts would mean in law enforcement in rural areas. We are talking about \nlaw enforcement, the fight against methamphetamines, which I know the \nSenator from Montana knows something about. It is a scourge that is \nclobbering the whole West. We can't leave our communities defenseless. \nWe can't leave our communities without the resources they need to fight \nmeth and these other critical problems.\n  I have open meetings, one in every county every year. I am sure the \nSenator from Montana will be starting something like that. Folks in \nthese rural school districts used to come up and say: Ron, we are not \ngoing to have school but for 3 days a week if we don't have this \nprogram. So what we are talking about is any serious semblance of \npublic instruction in rural communities in our State. We don't see how \nwe are going to be able to achieve it without this particular program.\n  The consequences here are very real. The consequences are tragic. \nThis is not a question of the Oregon congressional delegation, Senator \nSmith and myself, crying wolf and coming out and just being alarmists \non the floor of the Senate. This is what we hear from our constituents. \nI heard it at town meetings a little bit ago, just a little over a \nweek. I am going to hear it again this weekend. Suffice it to say, over \n700 counties in 39 States are involved. Many of them are in parts of \nthe country where the Federal Government owns most of the land. That is \ncertainly the case in Oregon where we have many rural communities where \nsignificantly over half of the land is owned by the Federal Government.\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I wonder if my colleague will yield for a \nquestion.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. SMITH. My colleague is the author of this legislation. As he has \nworked in the 109th Congress from the minority side, and I worked the \nmajority side, I suppose he found, as I did, that many people said: \nWell, the cause is just, but just work it out. There weren't a lot of \nfolks who wanted to work it out. Now, as we come to the final business \nof the last Congress in this Congress, in a congressional resolution, \nis it not true that we only have this piece of legislation and the \nemergency supplemental that we have to attach this to? And if we don't, \nthe pink slips are for real?\n\n[[Page S1825]]\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. The Senator is right with respect to how critical this \nquestion is. As he knows, because he and I have made this a top \npriority now for quite some time, we didn't get a fair shake in the \nlast session of Congress. I put a hold on several appointments from the \nBush administration because I wanted to make sure that they got the \nwake-up call. I lifted that hold and, frankly, I wish I hadn't because \nI think they have never put the effort into trying to get this \nwarranted program reauthorized. So Senator Smith is correct in terms of \nsaying that this program should have been reauthorized some time ago. \nHe and I have put it at the top of our priority list.\n  This is not an abstract question. Decisions are being made by rural \nschool officials, by county commissions at this time. They are looking \nat cuts that are going to affect our ability to protect the communities \nfrom serious matters as it relates to criminal justice, to adequate \npublic education. And we are not talking about extras. We are talking \nabout basics, as Sheriff Mike Winter from southwestern Oregon has \nnoted, and local school officials as well. We want to make it clear \njust what the consequences are going to be.\n  I mentioned Curry County on the Oregon coast, for example. A number \nof our other communities--Douglas County, Lane County, in particular--\nare going to see direct and painful consequences as a result of this \nprogram and the failure of this program to be reauthorized. County \npayments legislation is supported by a diverse coalition. We are \npleased to see that this is a top priority of the National Association \nof Counties. A number of labor organizations have also said that they \nbelieve this is critically important.\n  I will just wrap it up by saying that I believe these cuts in \npayments to rural counties are going to hit the rural part of my State \nand rural America like a wrecking ball. They are going to pound these \ncommunities. And it doesn't have to happen. Senator Smith has made that \npoint. I have made that point. The whole Oregon congressional \ndelegation, every member of our House delegation, we don't have 50 \nMembers representing us in the House of Representatives like \nCalifornia, but we are going to be heard.\n  I have been gratified that Senator Reid, our majority leader, has \nbeen willing to spend so much time with me. He is a westerner. He knows \nwhat the impact is in a public lands State. He was in our State. He saw \nwhat the forests mean to us. He is an honorable man and a man of his \nword. He said he would work with me to make sure that our State gets a \nfair shake. We are going to make sure that message is heard loudly and \nclearly when we have the hearing in the Forestry Subcommittee. We will \nmake sure the legislation that the Senator from Montana has joined me \non will get a thorough hearing at that particular discussion.\n  I thank the distinguished Presiding Officer for being a cosponsor of \nthis bill. We are glad to have him in our bipartisan coalition.\n  I wanted to wrap up by saying I appreciate Senator Smith's remarks \nhere on the floor. He is going to hear from the Oregon congressional \ndelegation and Oregon Senators again and again and again, until this \ncritical program is reauthorized.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to calling off the quorum?\n  Mr. WARNER. No. Before the Senator begins to speak, I want to make \nthis clear. I ask the Presiding Officer, am I not to be recognized for \nthe time between 3:45 and 4:30?\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from Virginia, I \nthink, will be pleased with my request.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Warner be recognized at this \ntime for up to 60 minutes and, following that, Senator Murray be \nrecognized for 15 minutes, a Republican Senator be recognized next for \n10 minutes, then Senator McCaskill be recognized for 10 minutes, and \nthen Senator Smith be recognized for up to 75 minutes. I will be \njoining Senator Smith during his 75 minutes. That is my request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/12/senate-section/article/S1825-1", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1825-S1831]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            IRAQ RESOLUTION\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I shall be joined by a number of \ncolleagues and the purpose of our taking this time is as follows: We \nhave decided to put in an amendment to H.J. Res. 20, amendment number \n259 which will be printed in today's record. This amendment mirrors S. \nCon. Res. 7, a resolution prepared by myself and others sometime last \nweek, which expresses certain concerns we have with regard to the \nPresident's plan as announced on January 10 of this year.\n  This amendment, to H.J. Res. 20 is cosponsored by Mr. Levin, Ms. \nCollins, Ben Nelson of Nebraska, Mr. Hagel, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Smith, Mr. \nBiden, and as other Senators return to town, we may have further \ncosponsors.\n  We are concerned that the fighting rages on throughout Iraq, and \nparticularly in Baghdad. It is very important that the Senate should, \nas the greatest deliberative body--certainly in matters of war and \npeace--in a prompt way address the issues regarding Iraq.\n  Our men and women in the Armed Forces are fighting bravely in that \nconflict, as they are in conflicts elsewhere worldwide. Our concerns \nare heartfelt, not driven by political motivation. As we gathered as a \ngroup in the past 2 weeks to work on this, we took note of the fact \nthat the President, on January 10, in his message to the Nation \nexplicitly said that others could come forward with their ideas. I will \nparaphrase it--the exact quote is in the amendment we are putting in \ntoday--that he would take into consideration the views of others. So in \na very constructive and a respectful way, our group said we disagreed \nwith the President and we gave a series of points urging him to \nconsider those points as he begins to implement such plan as finally \ndevised throughout Iraq but most specifically in Baghdad.\n  We are very respectful of the fact that the plan put in by the \nPresident was in three parts: a diplomatic part, an economic part, and \na military part. We explicitly stated in the resolution our support for \nthe diplomatic and economic parts, and we are hopeful it can be put \ntogether in a timely fashion. There is some concern as to whether the \nthree main parts can progress together, unified, in this operation, \ngiven the short timetable to implement it. So two parts of the program \nwe wholeheartedly support and so state in this amendment.\n  The concern is about the military section. We state the explicit \nnature of our concerns. Some Senators have suggested the resolution \nexpresses matters which I can find no source whatsoever in the \nresolution for those complaints. Nevertheless, I will address in the \ncourse of this time each and every one of those concerns.\n  Indeed, on the weekend talk shows, one Senator said: My problem with \nthe Warner proposal and others that criticize the surge is, what is \nyour plan? All right. That is a legitimate question. I say that our \namendment states a clear strategy. It says as follows:\n\n       The Senate believes the United States should continue \n     vigorous operations in Anbar Province specifically for the \n     purpose of combating an insurgency including elements \n     associated with the al-Qaida movement and denying terrorists \n     a safe haven.\n\n  Secondly, the primary objective of the overall strategy in Iraq \nshould be to encourage Iraqi leaders to make political compromises that \nwill foster reconciliation and strengthen the unity government, \nultimately leading to improvements in the security situation.\n  Next, the military part of the strategy should focus on maintaining \nthe territorial integrity of Iraq, denying international terrorists a \nsafe haven, conducting counterterrorism operations, promoting regional \nstability, supporting the Iraqi efforts to bring\n\n[[Page S1826]]\n\ngreater security to Baghdad, and training and equipping Iraqi forces to \ntake full responsibility for their own security.\n  Likewise, another part of our amendment states:\n\n       The United States military operations should, as much as \n     possible, be confined to these goals and should charge the \n     Iraqi military with the primary mission of combating \n     sectarian violence.\n       The United States Government should engage selected nations \n     in the Middle East to develop a regional, internationally \n     sponsored peace and reconciliation process. Overall, \n     military, diplomatic, and economic strategies should not be \n     regarded as an open-ended or unconditional commitment, but \n     rather, as a new strategy, hereafter should be conditioned \n     upon the Iraqi government meeting benchmarks that must be \n     delivered in writing and agreed to by the Prime Minister.\n\n  Then we spell out a series of benchmarks. Such benchmarks should \ninclude, but not be limited to, the deployment of that number of \nadditional Iraqi security forces as specified in the plan in Baghdad, \nensuring equitable distribution of resources of the Government of Iraq \nwithout regard to the sect or ethnicity of recipients, enacting and \nimplementing legislation to ensure that the oil resources of Iraq \nbenefit Sunni Arabs, Shia Arabs, Kurds and other Iraqi citizens in an \nequitable manner, and the authority of the Iraqi commanders to make \ntactical and operational decisions without political intervention.\n  Further, some Senators have indicated, again incorrectly, that our \nresolution either fails to recognize, or disagrees with all aspects of \nthe President's plan, namely the political and economic aspects, in \naddition to the military part of his plan.\n  In fact, our resolution acknowledges directly that the President's \nplan is multi-faceted. Our resolution states, whereas, on January 10, \n2007, following consultations with the Iraqi Prime Minister, the \nPresident announced a new strategy, which consists of three basic \nelements: diplomatic, economic, and military.\n  As such, our resolution disagrees only with the military aspect of \nthe President's plan, and actually supports the diplomatic and economic \naspects of his plan.\n  Finally, some Senators have suggested that our resolution either \nfails to support the troops, or threatens a cut-off in funding. \nActually, our resolution does neither. It states forcefully our support \nfor the troops: whereas, over 137,000 American military personnel are \ncurrently serving in Iraq, like thousands of others since March 2003, \nwith the bravery and professionalism consistent with the finest \ntraditions of the United States Armed Forces, and are deserving of our \nsupport of all Americans, which they have strongly; whereas, many \nAmerican service personnel have lost their lives, and many more have \nbeen wounded, in Iraq, and the American people will always honor their \nsacrifices and honor their families.\n  And our resolution, specifically protects funding for our troops in \nthe field and states: the Congress should not take any action that will \nendanger United States military forces in the field, including the \nelimination or reduction of funds for troops in the field, as such an \naction with respect to funding would undermine their safety or harm \ntheir effectiveness in pursuing their assigned missions.\n  In sum, our resolution aims not to contravene the Constitutional \nauthorities as Commander-in-Chief, but, rather, to accept the offer to \nCongress made by the President on January 10, 2007 that, ``if members \nhave improvements that can be made, we will make them. If circumstances \nchange, we will adjust.''\n  It is clear that the United States' strategy and operations in Iraq \ncan only be sustained and achieved with support from the American \npeople and with a level of bipartisanship in Congress.\n  The purpose of this resolution is not to cut our forces or to set a \ntimetable for withdrawal, but, rather, to express the genuine concerns \nof a number of Senators from both parties about the President's plan.\n  It is not meant to be confrontational, but instead to provide a sense \nof bipartisanship resolve on our new strategy in Iraq. It follows many \nof the conclusions of the Baker-Hamilton report by focusing on what is \ntruly in our national interest in Iraq, and spells those goals out in \ndetail.\n  I want to divide our time between colleagues. I will ask at this time \nthat the distinguished Senator from Nebraska, Mr. Hagel, be recognized \nand that, following his comments, I shall be recognized again to give \nthe remainder of my remarks. I say on a personal note to the Senator \nhow much I valued our conversation over the weekend, together with our \ndistinguished colleague from Maine, after which we decided today to put \nthe language of S. Con. Res. 7 in as an amendment to the pending matter \nbefore the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is recognized.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise to join my colleagues, Senators \nWarner, Collins, and others, in offering this amendment to the \ncontinuing resolution.\n  Last week, Senators Collins, Snowe, Smith, Voinovich, Coleman, and \nmyself sent a letter to the Senate leadership urging our distinguished \nmajority and minority leaders to reach an agreement so the Senate could \ndebate the war in Iraq.\n  We said, and I quote from that letter:\n\n       The current stalemate is unacceptable to us and to the \n     people of this country.\n\n  In the letter, we pledged to--again quoting the letter--``explore all \nof our options under the Senate procedures and practices to ensure a \nfull and open debate on the Senate floor.'' That, of course, is why we \nare here today.\n  I, similar to my colleagues, am deeply disappointed that a full and \nopen debate on Iraq remains stymied in the Senate. All Members--Members \nof both parties--have the right and responsibility to present their \nviews and, if they choose, submit other resolutions regarding the war \nin Iraq.\n  I am also deeply disappointed that both sides have used procedural \ntactics in this process. My colleagues and I were assured that the \nleaders were committed to reaching an agreement on this debate. That \nhas not yet happened, and I, similar to my colleagues, intend to do \neverything in my power as a Senator to ensure a full and open debate of \nthe Iraq war on the Senate floor in front of the American people. We \nowe it to our soldiers and their families, and we owe it to the \nAmerican people.\n  I wish to focus on one particular aspect of this debate and that has \nto do with the resolution itself--the relevancy and importance of \nSenate resolutions. In the last 15 years, there is ample, strong, and \nsignificant precedent in the Senate debating a President's military \npolicies while troops are deployed overseas--Bosnia, Somalia, Haiti, \nKosovo. In each of those situations, I and many of my colleagues here \ntoday in the Senate debated and most of us voted binding and nonbinding \nresolutions regarding U.S. military operations abroad. Many of these \nmeasures expressed opposition to the military operations, criticizing, \nfor example, one, the open-ended nature of the deployment; two, the \ndanger of mission creep or escalation of military involvement; three, \nthe danger of deploying U.S. forces into sectarian conflict; and four, \nthe failure of the President to consult with Congress.\n  It might be instructive to review some of the Senate's history on \nthese recent debates regarding these recent resolutions. Let me begin \nwith Bosnia.\n  In June of 1992, U.S. forces began to deploy to Bosnia. In December \n1995, the United States was preparing to deploy substantial ground \nforces into Bosnia, roughly 20,000 American ground force combat troops, \nvery similar to the number we are now looking at in the President's \nescalation of more American troops into Iraq today.\n  As a result of President Clinton's decision in 1995, the Senate \nconsidered Senate Concurrent Resolution 35, a resolution submitted by \nour colleague from Texas, the senior Senator, Mrs. Hutchison. This \nresolution was a nonbinding resolution. Again, this was a nonbinding \nresolution. This resolution said:\n\n       The Congress opposes President Clinton's decision to deploy \n     United States military ground forces into the Republic of \n     Bosnia and Herzegovina to implement the General Framework \n     Agreement for peace \n     in Bosnia. . . .\n\n  This resolution also said:\n\n       Congress strongly supports the United States military \n     personnel who may be ordered by the President to implement \n     the general framework for the peace in Bosnia.\n\n\n[[Page S1827]]\n\n\n  So, therefore, it is saying we support our troops, but we disapprove \nof the President's policy to send more troops. This resolution also \nsaid it was a continuation of the previous debate on support of the \ntroops already deployed.\n  As Senator Hutchison said on the Senate floor on December 13:\n\n       There are many of us who do not think that this is the \n     right mission, but who are going to go full force to support \n     our troops. In fact, we believe we are supporting our troops \n     in the most effective way by opposing this mission because we \n     think it is the wrong one. . . .\n\n  A month earlier in November 1995, Senator Hutchison framed the \ncomplexities of our military intervention in Bosnia in terms that are \neerily relevant to today. She said:\n\n       I am very concerned that we are also setting a precedent \n     for our troops to be deployed on the ground in border \n     conflicts, in ethnic conflicts, in civil wars. . . .\n\n  Opposition to the President's policy but strong support for the U.S. \nmilitary--this is similar to the debate we are having today on Iraq.\n  Senator Hutchison's resolution had 28 cosponsors, including our \nfriends and colleagues, Senators Inhofe, Craig, Kyl, Lott, Bennett, \nHatch, Shelby, and Stevens.\n  On December 13, 1995, 47 Senators voted in favor of Senator \nHutchison's nonbinding resolution. That day, 47 Senators believed you \ncould oppose the President's policy but still support our troops.\n  The next day, December 14, 1995, the Senate considered Senate Joint \nResolution 44, a binding resolution introduced by Senator Dole. This \nresolution supported U.S. troops in Bosnia. This resolution had six \ncosponsors, including our colleagues, Senators McCain and Lieberman.\n  On December 14, 1995, the Senate adopted this resolution by a vote of \n69 to 30. That was Bosnia in 1995.\n  Somalia: In December 1992, U.S. troops began to deploy to Somalia. \nNearly a year later, in September 1993, the Senate debated the \nobjectives, the mission, and strategy of our military deployment in \nSomalia. Speaking on the Senate floor on September 23, 1993, Senator \nMcCain framed the debate when he said:\n\n       Somalia is a prime example of lofty ambitions gone awry. \n     Our service men and women have become . . . part of a mission \n     to build Somalia into a stable democracy--something, \n     incidentally, it has never been, and shows no sign of ever \n     becoming this decade.\n       The manner in which military force is to be used to further \n     this grandiose objective has been left unclear. Without a \n     clear military objective, our forces in Somalia have found \n     themselves involved in a situation where they cannot \n     distinguish between friend and foe. They have often been \n     presented with situations where they cannot even distinguish \n     between civilians and combatants.\n\n  On September 9, the Senate voted 90 to 7 to adopt a nonbinding--a \nnonbinding--sense-of-Congress resolution submitted by Senator Byrd. \nThis resolution called on the President to outline the goals, \nobjectives, and duration of the U.S. deployment in Somalia and said \nCongress believes the President ``should seek and receive congressional \nauthorization in order for the deployment of U.S. forces to Somalia to \ncontinue.''\n  There are 11 cosponsors of the Byrd measure, including our \ncolleagues, Senators McCain, Cochran, Bond, and Warner.\n  One month later, after the horrible death of 18 U.S. troops in early \nOctober, the Senate considered two binding measures to cut off funds, \none introduced by Senator McCain and one by Senator Byrd.\n  On October 15, 1993, the McCain measure, which would have terminated \nfurther U.S. military operations in Somalia, was tabled 61 to 38. That \nsame day, the Senate voted 76 to 23 to adopt the Byrd measure to cut \noff all funding in March 1994 for U.S. forces in Somalia.\n  There are two more very clear examples, such as the examples I have \ngiven on Somalia and Bosnia, that I could discuss--Haiti and Kosovo--in \nsome detail, and I may do that later. But the point is, the facts are \nclear. There is clear precedent--clear precedent--for both binding and \nnonbinding resolutions, as well as legislation to redirect, condition \nor cut off funds for military operations, and this is at the same time \nwe have and we had military forces in those countries.\n  So to argue, to state, to imply this is somehow not only irrelevant \nbut unprecedented is not the case. The Congress has always had a \nresponsibility, not just constitutionally but morally, to inject itself \nin the great debate of war.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, will the Senator yield on that very point?\n  Mr. HAGEL. Yes, I yield to Senator Warner.\n  Mr. WARNER. We had in our discussions, and Senator Collins joined in \nthis discussion--that we could not conceive--and that I, this Senator \nfrom Virginia, could ever participate in a cutoff-of-funding in regards \nto this situation in Iraq.\n  But back to historical precedents. I have this volume, the \n``Encyclopedia of the United States Congress,'' compiled by 20 eminent \nhistorians in 1995. And on this subject that the Senator addressed, \nthey said the following:\n\n       Another informal power of the Congress in the foreign \n     policy field is the passage of resolutions by the House or \n     the Senate, often called a sense-of-the-House or sense-of-\n     the-Senate resolution. Although not legally enforceable, such \n     resolutions are often taken seriously by the President and \n     his foreign policy advisers because they are useful \n     indicators of underlying public concern about important \n     foreign policy questions. Moreover, as a general rule, the \n     White House wants to maintain cooperative relations with the \n     Congress and to give legislators the impression that their \n     views have been heard and have been taken into account in \n     policy formulation.\n\n  Clear documentation of the Senator's points in this very erudite \nresource of the history of the Congress. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Virginia.\n  In conclusion, I add that the American people have had enough of the \nmisrepresentations, the politics, and the procedural intrigue in the \nSenate. I say again to our distinguished leaders of both our parties: \nIt is your responsibility, as leaders of this body, to resolve this \nprocedural dispute so that the Senate can have a full, fair, open \ndebate on the war in Iraq. And I will continue to join my colleagues--\nSenators Warner, Collins, Snowe, and others--in making every effort to \nbring up our resolution at every available opportunity until that \ndebate occurs.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Durbin). The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, before the Senator leaves the floor, I \nhave another point of history. I find this fascinating. I hope, \nhereafter, colleagues, pundits, and writers will at least recognize \nthat, and I repeat it. Senate Historian documents confirm the Senate \nhas been posing sense-of-the-Senate resolutions since 1789. Thus, our \nFramers of the Constitution and those who served in the early \nCongresses recognized the value of this type of resolution.\n  I yield the floor. I thank my distinguished colleague from Maine, \nagain, for her steadfast support and advice throughout this entire \nprocess today, tomorrow, and well into the future.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am very pleased to join with the \ndistinguished senior Senator from Virginia--a former chairman of the \nSenate Armed Services Committee, an individual who has devoted his life \nto the support of our military--in offering, along with a number of our \ncolleagues, this very important resolution as an amendment to the \ncontinuing resolution. There are many differing views in this body on \nthe road ahead in Iraq, and those views are legitimate but they deserve \nto be debated. There is no more pressing issue facing this country than \nIraq. The public is disappointed to see the Senate avoid the debate on \nthe most important issue of our day. The current stalemate is \nunacceptable. It is unacceptable to the American people. Regardless of \nour views on the appropriate strategy for Iraq, we have an obligation, \nwe have a duty as Senators to fully debate this issue and to go on \nrecord on what we believe to be the appropriate strategy, the road \nahead in Iraq.\n  I am very disappointed that the procedural wrangling on both sides of \nthe aisle prevented that kind of full and fair debate last week. I \nbelieved strongly that we should go ahead with that debate, and I am \nsorry that did not occur. I hope our leaders on both sides of the aisle \nwill work together to come up with a fair approach to debate this most \nimportant issue.\n\n[[Page S1828]]\n\n  Just this last weekend, the State of Maine lost another soldier in \ncombat in Iraq. The American people deserve to know where each and \nevery one of us stands on the President's strategy, on whether to cut \noff funding, on the important issues related to this very pressing \nissue. There are legitimate arguments on both sides. There are those \nwho agree with my position that a surge of 21,500 troops would be a \nmistake. There are those who believe that the surge is the right course \nto follow. I respect the views of Senators on both sides of the aisle \nand, indeed, this is not a partisan issue. But surely--surely this is \nan issue that deserves our full debate in the best traditions of this \nhistoric body. Surely--surely our constituents deserve to know where we \nstand.\n  I think this is so important that nothing should prevent us from \ngoing to this debate prior to our recessing. I think we should make \nthis so important that if it is not done, perhaps we should reconsider \nour plans for next week. I think we should proceed with this most \nimportant debate without further delay. There are a number of \nworthwhile resolutions that have been brought forward. Let the debate \nbegin.\n  Finally, I want to add just a couple of comments to those made by the \ndistinguished Senator from Virginia and the distinguished Senator from \nNebraska, and that is about the importance of these resolutions. They \nare by no means unprecedented, as both of my colleagues have so \narticulately pointed out. They offer guidance to the administration. It \nremains my hope that if the Senate passes the resolution that I have \nhelped to coauthor that the President will accept our invitation to \ntake a second look at his plan. We urge him to explore all alternatives \nand to work with us on a bipartisan strategy to chart a new road ahead \nin Iraq.\n  As a result of my trip to Iraq in December, I concluded that we face \na number of different challenges in Iraq and the strategy depends on \nwhere you are in Iraq. In Baghdad, the capital is engulfed in sectarian \nviolence. Yes, Baghdad is in the midst of a civil war between the \nShiites and the Sunnis. To insert more American soldiers in the midst \nof this sectarian struggle would, in my judgment, be a major mistake. \nOnly the Iraqis can devise a solution to the sectarian strife that is \ngripping Baghdad, and I think if the Iraqis had taken the long overdue \npolitical steps, if they more fully integrated the Sunni minority into \nthe power structures, if they had passed an oil revenue bill that more \nequitably distributed oil revenues, if they had held the long overdue \nprovincial elections, we would not be in the crisis in which we are \ntoday.\n  Indeed, that is not just my opinion, that was the opinion of General \nPetraeus when I asked him that question during his nomination hearing \nbefore the Armed Services Committee.\n  By contrast to the sectarian strife that is plaguing Baghdad, the \nbattle is very different in Anbar Province to the west. There the fight \nis with al-Qaida and with foreign jihadists, and there and only there \ndid I hear an American commander ask for more troops--only in Anbar \nProvince--and he did so in order to capitalize on a recent positive \ndevelopment in which some of the local Sunni tribal leaders are now \nbacking the coalition forces against al-Qaida.\n  My conclusion is that we do need more troops in Anbar, but we should \nreallocate from troops already in the country. I personally would \nchoose to take troops out of Baghdad and send them west, to Anbar \nProvince, and put the Iraqis in charge, fully in charge of security in \nBaghdad. I fear that by inserting thousands of additional troops into \nthe midst of the sectarian strife in Baghdad, ironically we will ease \nthe pressure on the Iraqi leaders to take the long-overdue steps to \nquell the sectarian violence, for I am convinced that the sectarian \nviolence in Baghdad requires a political, not a military, solution.\n\n  In Basra, the third stop on our trip, I heard a British commander, a \nBritish colonel, give an excellent presentation to us. He said that \ninitially the British and American troops were welcomed in Iraq, but as \ntime has gone on, what he called the consent line has declined and \ntheir presence has been less and less tolerated and more and more \nresented.\n  I think perhaps the only issue on which all Members of this body can \nagree is that our troops have served nobly and well in Iraq, and that \nwe need a new strategy. We disagree on the road ahead, but that is what \ndemocracy and the traditions of the Senate are all about. We should not \nbe afraid of this debate. We should debate this issue fully and openly \nand let our constituents and the administration know exactly where the \nSenate stands.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank our colleague. I wonder if I could \nask our colleague a question before she departs? She made reference to \nher trip and the discussions that she had with the senior commanders. I \nwould like to bring to her attention testimony that came before our \ncommittee, of which the distinguished Senator from Maine is a member, \nat which time we heard from the Commander of the United States Central \nCommand, General Abizaid.\n  In the course of his testimony to Congress on November 15, 2006--\nright in the timeframe the Senator made her trip--I will quote him, \nGeneral Abizaid. The general said:\n\n       I met with every divisional commander, General Casey, Corps \n     Commander, and General Dempsey--we all talked together. And I \n     said, ``In your professional opinion, if we were to bring in \n     more American troops now, does it add considerably to our \n     ability to achieve success in Iraq?'' And they all said no. \n     And the reason is because we want the Iraqis to do more. It's \n     easy for the Iraqis to rely upon us to do this work. I \n     believe that more American forces prevent the Iraqis from \n     doing more, from taking more responsibility for their own \n     future.\n\n  I say to my colleague, that quote captured my own visit, which was \njust barely a month before that, when I came back and I described in my \npublic comments that the situation in Iraq was drifting sideways.\n  That was a very serious summary. But I said it because I felt \nobligated to our troops who were fighting bravely and courageously and \nwith a level of professionalism that equals the finest hour in the 200-\nplus-year history of our military--and the support their families give \nthem. I felt ever so strongly that we were obligated as a country to \nreexamine our strategy and I called for that reexamination of strategy \nand it has been done.\n  But I say to my colleague, General Abizaid's summary about the need \nfor more forces, does that not summarize what you learned on your trip?\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, if I may respond to the Senator from \nVirginia, I remember very well General Abizaid's testimony before the \nArmed Services Committee in mid-November. And as the Senator has \npointed out--and he presided over that hearing--it could not have been \nclearer General Abizaid said that he consulted with all the American \ncommanders and that the effect of bringing in more American troops \nwould be to relieve the pressure on the Iraqis to step up and take \ncontrol of the security themselves.\n  Indeed, and ironically, General Petraeus, the new commander in Iraq, \nhad written an article for the Military Review in January of 2006 in \nwhich he said that one of the lessons from his tours of duty in Iraq \nwas that you should not do too much, that you should call upon the \nIraqis to take responsibility for themselves. Indeed, my experience was \njust as the Senator's was. About a month after General Abizaid's \ntestimony, I was in Iraq. I talked with the commanders on the ground, \nand I would like to share with the senior Senator what one American \ncommander told me.\n  He said that a jobs program for Iraqis would do more good to quell \nthe sectarian violence than the addition of more American troops. He \ntold me that some Iraqi men are so desperate for money because they \nhave been unemployed for so long that they are joining the Shiite \nmilitias. They are planting roadside bombs simply for the money because \nthey are desperate.\n  I thought that was such a telling comment, I say to my distinguished \ncolleague, because this was from a very experienced commander who had \nbeen in Iraq for a long time. At that moment he was not calling for \nmore troops. None of the American commanders with whom I talked in \nBaghdad called for more troops. The only place where we heard a request \nfor more troops was in Anbar Province, and as I have explained, the \nsituation\n\n[[Page S1829]]\n\nin Anbar is totally different. It is not sectarian violence. The \nviolence is with al-Qaida, the foreign jihadists, mainly Sunni versus \nSunni, and it requires a different strategy.\n\n  So my experience, when added to the distinguished Senator's, shows a \nconsistent pattern. Whether it was the distinguished Senator's trip in \nOctober or the testimony of General Abizaid in November or my journey \nin December, we heard exactly the same themes, exactly the same answers \nto the questions of whether we needed more troops.\n  Finally, let me say I went to Iraq with a completely open mind on \nthis issue, and I came back convinced that sending more troops to \nBaghdad would be a colossal error.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank our colleague. I wonder if at this \npoint in the colloquy--and then I will yield the floor because I know \nother Senators are anxious to speak--but we, the United States, the \nmilitary, and the taxpayers have trained and equipped over 300,000 \nIraqi security forces composed of the professional Army, police, border \nsecurity, and a group of others. The thrust of our resolution \noriginally, and this one that is here, the amendment which is \nidentical, was to give the Iraqis this opportunity, which the Prime \nMinister himself called for. He said: Give us the opportunity to show \nthat we can do this operation.\n  That is the basis on which we drew up the resolution. And in our \nresolution we said two things: The responsibility for Iraq's internal \nsecurity and halting sectarian violence must rest primarily with the \nGovernment of Iraq and Iraqi security forces. Then, specifically we \nsaid in the conclusion: The United States military operations should, \nas much as possible, be confined to the goals that are enumerated in \nthe previous paragraph and should charge--I repeat--charge the Iraqi \nmilitary with the primary mission of combating sectarian violence, and \nthat is in the Baghdad operation.\n  So I think those facts, our resolution, now referred to as an \namendment, absolutely parallels what we learned firsthand on our trips \ninto that region.\n  Mr. President, I see other Senators are waiting. I see the \ndistinguished senior Senator from Maine, Ms. Snowe.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, first, I want to commend the senior Senator \nfrom Virginia, Senator Warner, for his unparalleled leadership, because \nit is borne of a tremendous credibility based on his military and \nprofessional experience on these vital issues, and that precise \ncredibility lends the kind of expertise to the Senate, to the Congress, \nand to our Nation that is so vital at this point in time. But I think \nin the final analysis, it is something we have to honor as we consider \nthe most consequential issue of our time.\n  I am very pleased the Senator has offered an amendment that reflects \nhis resolution that was modified and that was supported by both sides \nof the political aisle. I am pleased to join my colleague from \nNebraska, Senator Hagel, and my colleague from Maine, Senator Collins, \nbecause this is a critical issue. It is one of the issues that is the \nmost significant of our time.\n  As we begin this week, it is regrettable we don't have the Iraq \ndebate before the floor of the Senate in the form of considering a \nresolution. Tomorrow, the House of Representatives is going to proceed. \nThey are going to proceed to debate a resolution in opposition to the \ntroop surge proposed by the President of the United States. They will \nhave that debate this week. The question is when and if the Senate is \ngoing to have that debate on a specific resolution, on specific issues, \nwith specific votes.\n  Unfortunately, what we are witnessing today is the shrinking role of \nthe Senate when it comes to the war in Iraq, a war that has been \nongoing for 4 years. I am dismayed because I don't see any evidence. I \ndon't see any evidence of working on a bipartisan basis to coalesce \naround an issue and on a position where it has been demonstrated there \nis a majority of support in the Senate to have negotiations, to have \nconsultation, to work it out. I don't see any evidence of that. Have we \ncome to the point in the Senate where we haven't been able to determine \nprocedurally how to move forward on a nonbinding resolution? It is hard \nto believe the Senate would be marginalized on that point.\n  Now I am speaking from experience. This is my 13th year in the \nSenate--my 13th year. I served in the House of Representatives for 16 \nyears. I served for more than 20 years--I think about 24 years--on \nForeign Affairs, Foreign Relations, Armed Services, and currently the \nIntelligence Committee. So I speak from experience. You have to work \nacross the political aisle. And there wasn't a time when we didn't \ndiscuss these issues: Lebanon, Persian Gulf, Panama before the Persian \nGulf. We had Bosnia and Kosovo. We were able to work it out. The fact \nis I well recall a statement I had drafted back in 2000 illustrating \nexamples of bipartisanship here on the floor of the Senate, one of \nwhich I said about the Senator from Virginia, Senator Warner, in \nworking across the aisle with the Senator from West Virginia, Mr. Byrd, \non the issue of Kosovo.\n  That has been the hallmark of the Senate. Does it mean that we \ndisagree on a major issue of our time? No. There are differences of \nopinion, but what is the Senate afraid of? What are we afraid of? To \ndebate and to vote on various positions, whether it is on our position \non the troop surge, whether it is on the position of cutting out \nfunding, the troop gaps, a new authorization? Some of those issues and \npositions I would disagree with. But does that mean to say the Senate \ncannot withstand the conflicting views of various Members of the \nSenate? It is not unheard of, that both sides of the political aisle \nwill have differing views.\n\n  I came to this debate a few weeks ago when we were getting prepared \nostensibly to work on this issue, to debate, which is consistent with \nthe traditions and principles of this institution, which has been its \nhallmark. That is why it has been considered the greatest deliberative \nbody in the world. Unfortunately, it is not living up to that \nexpectation or characterization, regrettably. But I joined with the \nSenator from Nebraska in his effort across the aisle with the chairman \nof the Foreign Relations Committee and the chairman of the Senate Armed \nServices Committee because I wanted to send a message that here and \nnow, there will be those of us on this side of the aisle who disagree \nwith the President on the troop surge. So I wanted to send that \nmessage. I read the resolution. I know there are some on this side of \nthe aisle who didn't accept that language. But I thought it was \nimportant to do that. I cosponsored that resolution.\n  We had many meetings, as the Senator from Nebraska would note, with \nChairman Biden and Chairman Levin, to work through this issue: how we \ncould work with the Senator from Virginia, because we knew we had a \nmajority on both sides of the aisle that could work it out, who were \nopposed to the troop surge. So how is it we couldn't get from here to \nthere? And we met in good faith to negotiate, working out even the \nprocedures. We agreed: Let's have an open, unfettered, unrestricted \ndebate, which is consistent with this institution that is predicated on \nour Founding Fathers' vision of an institution based on accommodation \nand consensus. You have to get 60 votes. So we said: Let's work it out, \nand the good Senator from Virginia worked it out. He incorporated our \nconcerns in his modified resolution so we could enjoin our efforts.\n  Now, it is not surprising on this side of the aisle that there are \nstrong views that support the President, that don't believe we should \nhave a vote. But does that mean to say we can't move forward and the \nHouse of Representatives can? So the House of Representatives is going \nto be debating this issue this week, and the Senate is going to be \ndithering. While our troops are on the front lines, the Senate is \nsitting on the sidelines.\n  I am amazed we have reached this point in the Senate. We should be \nembracing this moment. We are the voice of the American people. \nConstitutional democracy is predicated on majority rule, but a respect \nfor minority rights. I don't see any ongoing negotiations and \ndiscussions. Maybe I missed something. I don't see that happening \nacross the political aisle. If historically we took the position: You \nmissed your chance, that you missed your chance with a vote--2 weeks \nago--you mean that is it in the Senate? How did we pass major pieces of \nlegislation, major\n\n[[Page S1830]]\n\ninitiatives without saying: That is it; there is no room for \ndiscussion, there is no room for negotiation, there is no room for \ncompromise.\n  Oftentimes I am challenged on this side because I work so much across \nthe political aisle. Senator Hagel did the same thing, as did Senator \nWarner. We worked across the political aisle to make it work. But I do \nnot see that mutual trust to say: Let's see how we can move forward on \nthe most profound issue of our time. It is unimaginable that we cannot \ndevelop a strategy for deliberating on this most consequential issue.\n  We are expecting to adjourn next week for a recess. I thought to \nmyself: Why? Why, so we will get back to Iraq before we know it? That \nis what we have heard: Just wait. The troop surge isn't going to wait. \nThe Iraqi war doesn't take a recess. Our men and women aren't taking a \nrecess. Why can't we debate now and vote on these issues? Are we saying \nwe are simply not capable of talking?\n  That is what the Senate is all about. It is based on consensus. It is \nbased on compromise. It is based on conciliation. It is based on the \nfact that you have to develop cooperation in order to get anything \ndone. It is not unusual. If historically we took the position: You \nmissed your chance because there are disparate views, so that there \nwould be no opportunity to further discuss or negotiate--we missed our \nchance? Are we talking about scoring political points? Are we talking \nabout what is the best policy for this country with respect to Iraq at \na time when men and women are on the front lines; at a time when the \nPresident is proposing a troop surge which I and others joined with \nSenator Warner because we oppose that; at a time in which we are almost \na year to the anniversary of the bombing of the Golden Mosque in \nSamarra?\n  In fact, Senator Warner and I paid a visit just days after that, the \nfirst congressional delegation, and we saw all the manifestations of \nwhat exists today in the most pronounced way. And we are saying we \ncan't get it done in the Senate. Is this about scoring political \npoints? I read every day: Who is winning politically? Because that is \nwhat it is about. It is about winning politically on a policy with \nrespect to Iraq where we have been mired for 4 years with a strategy \nthat hasn't been working. And we are saying, who is winning \npolitically? Isn't it about Iraq? Isn't it about our men and women? \nIsn't it about what is in the best interests for this country?\n\n  We have given so much. Our men and women have sacrificed \nimmeasurably. As Senator Collins indicated, we lost another from Maine \nthis weekend, SGT Eric Ross, 26. These men and women have put \nthemselves on the frontlines. Yet we sit and hesitate to talk about \nwhat is in their best interests. Some say it is a nonbinding resolution \nthat has no impact. I daresay, if it doesn't have any impact, then why \nis it we are not voting? What has a greater resonance in America? Is it \nsilence or is it taking action on the most consequential issue of our \ntime? I can only imagine, if we had an overwhelming bipartisan vote on \nSenator Warner's resolution--that is bipartisan, I might add--because \nthose Members strove to make it bipartisan in the Senate, many strive \nto do that, so we can send a message that would be profound, that would \nresonate. To have a strong vote in the Senate or silence, which would \nhave greater resonance? I think we know the answer to this question.\n  I am concerned we are taking a political U-turn away from the message \nin the last election. I was in that last election. I heard loudly and \nclearly. I don't blame the people of Maine or across this country for \ntheir deep-seated frustration. They are right. There was too much \npartisanship and too much polarization.\n  What we need now is leadership. We need leadership for this country. \nThey are thirsting for a strong leadership, an honorable leadership \nthat leads us to a common goal. No one expected unanimity in the Senate \nbut we would give integrity to this process to allow it to work and not \ncynically say who is winning and who is losing today politically, so we \nhave 30-second ads that will be run by outside groups or we are seeing \nthem now. We are not shedding the political past. We have made a \npolitical U-turn. We are returning to it.\n  This isn't about party labels. This isn't whether it is good for \nRepublicans or good for Democrats. It is what is good for America. It \nis not about red States and blue States. It is about the red, white, \nand blue.\n  I am dismayed we are the second month into a new Congress, after the \nAmerican people resoundingly repudiated the politics of the past, the \npartisanship and polarization, creating a poisonous environment. They \nrepudiated all of that. Here we are, back to the same old approach. \nInstead of giving confidence to the American people that we will speak, \nwe are their voice, we give voice to their fears and to their hopes, to \ntheir concerns that they rightfully have because we are not making the \nkind of progress, we are moving in a different direction on Iraq that \nobviously has been exemplified by the continuing and ongoing sectarian \nwarfare.\n  Fifteen months ago when Senator Warner came to the Senate and offered \na resolution, 2006 was going to be the year of transition to Iraqi \nsovereignty. It was 2006 when we would turn over all the security to \nthe Iraqi security forces. But 2006 has come and gone. We haven't made \nany measurable progress.\n  As I said, when I was there a year ago, we saw the manifestations of \nthe sectarian warfare, a vacuum had been created politically because no \nnew central government had been created. That took months. We allowed \nthat vacuum to continue. We got a new government. Yet they have been \nhesitant--indeed, they have been an impediment--to quelling the \nsectarian violence and confronting and demobilizing the militias.\n  I heard a year ago about the graft and corruption that was running \nrampant in the ministries, as we saw recently with the Deputy Minister \nof Health funneling money to support the sectarian violence and the \nmilitias. We have seen and we have known all of that.\n  So Senator Warner got that resolution passed. We united around him. \nIn June of 2006, we passed a resolution as well that called for a \nregional conference so we would begin the diplomatic offensive the Iraq \nStudy Group spoke to. But that has been ignored as well. I know the \nadministration has had a number of strategies in Iraq. They had the \nnational strategy for victory that was also 15 months old, that \nrepresented all the issues Senator Warner has embraced in his \nresolution, to which they only paid lip service, regrettably.\n  So we are here today. We want to give voice to the concerns of the \nAmerican people who want us to move in a different direction, not to \ncommit additional troops at a time in which we have a government in \nIraq that hasn't demonstrated a measurable commitment to controlling \nthe sectarian violence and make the political changes within its \nGovernment that demonstrate a good-faith effort--whether it is the oil \nrevenue-sharing distribution money, the provincial elections and, as I \nsaid, the demobilization of the militias; in fact, impeding our efforts \nto capture people who were responsible for some of the genocide and the \nwarfare. But here we are.\n  I hope we can find a way. What could be of higher priority than to be \nable to debate and to vote on our respective positions, to give a vote \non the Warner resolution that is so important that a majority of \nSenators support? I know we can build the threshold for the 60. It is \nimperative we do it. It is inexcusable, frankly, that on the process \nfor debating, we cannot reach an agreement. We are failing the American \npeople on a colossal scale. We are held up by arcane procedural \nmeasures that could be worked out, if only we reached across the \npolitical aisle.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank our distinguished colleague from \nMaine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 60 minutes has been expired.\n  Mr. WARNER. I ask for 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Senator from Maine. The Senator mentioned the \nbipartisan spirit. I am very pleased to state that Senator Levin, whom \nI spoke with this afternoon, Senator Ben Nelson, who has been with us \nsteadily on this, and Senator Biden allowed with very extensive \nenthusiasm to\n\n[[Page S1831]]\n\nhave their names attached as cosponsors.\n  I thank my colleagues who have come over and participated in this \ndebate and others who have listened. I thank the distinguished Senator, \nmy good friend from Nebraska, for working so hard on this amendment. We \nwill fight on.\n  We may be idealists, but we will fight on for what we believe in and \nthe integrity of this institution because we firmly believe, to the \nextent we can, forging a bipartisan consensus is the extent to which we \ncan hopefully regain the full confidence of the American people on what \nwe are doing in Iraq.\n  I agree with the President, we should not let it slip into a chaotic \nsituation, but we do have some different constructive thoughts as to \nour strategy ahead.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/12/senate-section/article/S1831-1", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1831-S1833]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         CONTINUING RESOLUTION\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I come to the Senate to talk about my \nstrong support of the House Joint Resolution 20 that is the joint \nfunding resolution for the current fiscal year we are considering this \nweek.\n  I am very concerned because we are fast approaching the wire on \ngetting this important resolution passed. If we don't pass this \nbipartisan bill, the safety of American citizens could be put in \ndanger. If this bill is not passed this week, our air traffic \ncontrollers will be furloughed. Our air safety inspectors will be \nfurloughed. It we don't pass this bipartisan bill in the next several \ndays, we are going to see a decline in our ability to provide railroad \ninspections, pipeline safety inspections, and truck safety inspections.\n  As chair of the Subcommittee on Transportation and Housing on \nAppropriations, I am very concerned. I am here to talk about some of \nthe consequences if we don't get our work done on the CR this week. We \nare going to be feeling the consequences in the area of housing. If we \ndon't pass this bill, hundreds of thousands of Americans are going to \nface a housing crisis.\n  Mr. President, 157,000 low-income people could lose their housing if \nwe don't get this bill passed in the next several days; 70,000 could \nlose their housing vouchers; 11,500 units that are housing the homeless \ncould be lost. Those are some of the consequences Americans will face \nunder my jurisdiction if this Congress fails to pass the joint funding \nresolution in the next few days.\n  But don't take my word for it. Last Thursday, I held a hearing with \nPresident Bush's very able Secretary of Transportation, Mary Peters. \nSecretary Peters is not a newcomer to transportation. She has spent her \nentire career working to ensure safety and execute infrastructure \nprojects, largely in her home State of Arizona, but she also served as \nthe Federal Highway Administrator.\n  Secretary Peters told us last week, in very clear terms, how safety \nwould be affected if we failed to pass this joint funding resolution. I \nshare her exact words from a few days ago. Secretary Peters told the \nSenate:\n\n       [I]f we were funded at the '06 levels . . . it would have \n     drastic consequences, not only at the FAA, but as you \n     mentioned with our other safety programs, such as our rail \n     safety programs, our truck inspection programs and of course \n     the air traffic controllers and inspectors at maintenance \n     facilities for the aviation community.\n\n  The Bush administration's Transportation Secretary is warning of \ndrastic consequences if we fail to pass this continuing resolution. I \nam here tonight to talk about some of those consequences. I asked \nSecretary Peters what it would mean for safety and what it would mean \nfor hiring if Congress doesn't pass this joint funding resolution. \nPresident Bush's Secretary of Transportation said:\n\n       [W]e will see a serious decline in the number of safety \n     inspectors: Truck safety inspectors, rail safety inspectors, \n     aviation inspectors across the broad range in our program.\n\n  That is directly from the President's Transportation Secretary.\n  I don't think any Senator wants to be responsible for voting for a \nserious decline in the number of truck safety inspectors, rail safety \ninspectors or aviation space. I don't think Members want to explain to \nour constituents we voted to undermine their safety as they travel by \ncar, train or plane. Let me be clear: No one can say Members didn't \nknow how your vote would hurt a State because we have very clear \nwarnings from the Transportation Secretary herself.\n  The first reason we need to pass this joint funding resolution is to \nkeep our critical safety inspectors on the job, protecting the American \npeople, as they are doing today. We also need to pass a joint funding \nresolution because, without it, States will not be able to address \ntheir most pressing highway, bridge, and road problems. In fact, \nSecretary Peters also warned us that some States could miss an entire \nconstruction season if Congress does not enact this bill.\n  She said that State transportation commissioners need to know how \nmoney will be available to them this year. So she said to us last week \nat the hearing:\n\n       It is especially important to those states who have a \n     construction season that will be upon us very, very shortly \n     and if they are not able to know that this funding is coming \n     and be able to let contracts, accordingly, we could easily \n     miss an entire construction season.\n\n  That is what this joint funding resolution is about. Let me be very \nclear. Your constituents, my constituents, all of our constituents will \nfeel the impact of our vote on roads that are not fixed or roads that \nremain clogged or congested or unsafe.\n  Those are a few of the safety consequences if we fail to pass the \nbipartisan joint funding resolution in the next several days. The \nfailure to pass H.J. Res. 20 will also have a painful impact on housing \nfor hundreds of thousands of Americans. In this bipartisan bill, we \nworked very hard to make sure vulnerable families would not be thrown \non the streets or face out-of-reach rent increases.\n  We provided some critical support for section 8, homeless assistance \ngrants, housing equity conversion loans, HOPE VI, and the Public \nHousing Operating Fund.\n  For Section 8 project-based assistance, this spending resolution we \nwill be considering this week provides an increase of $939 million over \nlast year's fiscal year 2006 level. It provides $300 million over the \nPresident's 2007 budget request. This is essential, I want my \ncolleagues to know, to preserve affordable housing for 157,000 low-\nincome households. Without this increase, without us acting in the next \nseveral days, many of these low-income residents are going to become \nhomeless or be displaced or face unaffordable rent increases.\n  For section 8 tenant-based assistance, this spending resolution \nprovides an increase of $502 million, equal to the President's 2007 \nbudget request, to continue to renew expiring vouchers. Without this \nincrease, without us acting in the next several days, more than 70,000 \nhousing vouchers are going to be lost. That means residents may become \nhomeless or displaced or forced into overcrowded housing.\n  For homeless assistance grants, this funding resolution we are \nconsidering provides an increase of $115 million to meet expiring \ncontracts for homeless individuals and their families. Without this \nincrease, without us acting in the next several days, as many as 11,500 \nunits will not be renewed--not be renewed--forcing these homeless \nindividuals and families back onto the street.\n  The joint resolution also helps thousands of seniors to stay in their \nhomes because it supports the housing equity conversion loans. \nCurrently, 90 percent of all reverse mortgages for the elderly fall \nunder this guarantee program. Without this language, this popular \nprogram will shut down, and it will hurt the ability of thousands of \nelderly individuals and couples to remain in their homes and pay for \ncritical living expenses.\n  The joint resolution we are considering this week also extends the \nauthorization for the HOPE VI Program, which is helping us across the \ncountry knock down the most deteriorated public housing units and \nreplace them with new, safe housing units for families. If this funding \nresolution is not adopted this week, not a single dollar will go out \nfor this popular program for the rest of this year.\n  Finally, this resolution will help housing authorities meet their \nsoaring expenses. This resolution supports the\n\n[[Page S1832]]\n\nPublic Housing Operating Fund. It provides an increase of $300 million \nover the 2006 level to meet the tremendous shortfalls being faced by \nour public housing authorities when it comes to meeting things such as \nincreased energy costs and providing necessary security to help them \nprevent crime. Recently, more than 700 public housing authorities have \nannounced layoffs. According to HUD, without this increase--without \nthis resolution--public housing authorities will receive only 76 \npercent of their true operating needs in this fiscal year. So the \nconsequences will be severe for very vulnerable families if this \nCongress fails to pass the joint funding resolution by this Thursday.\n  Mr. President, I want to step back for a minute and share how we \ndeveloped this bipartisan bill we are considering and how we worked to \nmake sure those critical needs are met.\n  Today, every agency in the Federal Government, with the exception of \nthe Departments of Defense and Homeland Security, are operating under \nwhat is called a continuing resolution. That freezes almost every \nFederal program at last year's level. If a program is not frozen at \nlast year's level, it is operating at a level consistent with the cuts \nthat were adopted by the House of Representatives last year. So at \npresent, almost all of our Federal agencies are operating under a \nfunding formula that makes no accommodations for the true needs of our \nagencies or the true needs of the American people. What that means is \nwe are not addressing critical education needs, health care needs, the \nneeds of our veterans, the needs of law enforcement, transportation, \nhousing--you name it.\n  The current continuing resolution expires this Thursday, February 15. \nThe time has now come for us in this Congress to finally stand up to \nour responsibility and implement a spending bill that will meet the \nneeds of the American people. And that bill will be in front of us this \nweek. It is H.J. Res. 20. That bill passed the House of Representatives \nby more than a 2-to-1 margin. The time has now come for us in the \nSenate to finally fulfill our responsibility.\n  H.J. Res. 20 was developed by both the House and the Senate \nAppropriations Committees on a bipartisan basis. The joint funding \nresolution, for the most part, freezes programs across the Government \nat their 2006 funding level. Importantly, however, the bill also makes \nnecessary funding adjustments to deal with critical programs that \ncannot and should not endure a funding freeze.\n  In the case of the Transportation Department, we were not about to \nignore our responsibility to ensure safety in our skies or on our \nhighways or on our railways. This bill provides funding increases \ntotaling more than a quarter billion dollars to ensure there are \nadequate numbers of personnel to control air traffic--control air \ntraffic, critical to all of the American flying public. It also \nprovides funds to make sure we inspect and enforce safety rules \ngoverning our commercial airliners, trucks, railroads, and pipelines. \nWithout this additional funding--if we do not pass the CR this week--\nthe FAA Administrator told us that she would be required to put every \nair traffic controller and every aviation inspector on the street for 2 \nweeks without pay between now and the end of September.\n  The joint funding resolution before us this week also boosts funding \nfor Amtrak to $1.3 billion. Operating under the current continuing \nresolution, Amtrak's funding would remain $200 million lower than it \nwas last year. If we do not pass this funding resolution which is \nbefore us, we will endanger our passenger rail service across the \ncountry, as well as the annual maintenance expenses that must be made \nto ensure safe operations in the Northeast corridor.\n  Finally, the bill pending before the Senate provides an additional \n$3.75 billion in formula funding for our Nation's highway and transit \nsystems. That funding will serve to create almost 160,000 new jobs \nwhile alleviating congestion. It is an important infusion of cash to \nour States to help them address their most pressing bridge \nreplacements, highway widenings, and safety enhancements. When you look \nat all the highway needs across just my home State of Washington, that \nadditional $71 million our State will receive is urgently needed and \nwill be put to work right away.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a table provided to me by \nthe Federal Highway Administration that displays the highway funding \nincreases that will be enjoyed by each and every State be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                        U.S. DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION FEDERAL HIGHWAY

I understand some of our colleagues have apparently \nsuggested we should not adopt this new joint funding resolution. \nInstead, they have advocated we simply just extend the current existing \nCR for the remainder of this year. Well, they are saying we should \nforgo these desperately needed funds for our highways and transit. They \nare saying we should allow the FAA to furlough all its safety personnel \nfor 2 weeks. They are saying we should allow our aviation, truck, \nrailroad, and pipeline inspection workforce to dwindle.\n  If we want to keep our air traffic controllers on the job, we have to \npass this bill. If we want to keep our air safety inspectors on the \njob, we need to pass this bill. If we want to keep highway, pipeline, \nand truck inspections on track, we need to pass this bill. If we want \nto help our States address their most urgent bridge, road, and highway \nproblems, we have to pass this bill. And if we want to keep our \nvulnerable families from losing their housing, we have to pass this \nbill.\n  The consequences are very high. That is why I came to the floor this \nevening, to outline to my colleagues, under just my jurisdiction, on \nthe transportation and housing bill, how important this joint funding \nresolution is and to urge my colleagues to help us move it through this \nweek by the Thursday deadline.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Stabenow).

Under the previous order, a \nRepublican Senator, the Senator from New Mexico, is now recognized for \n10 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I want to ask, does the Senator want \nto speak for a short time?\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Go ahead.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The Senator does not mind listening. I thank her so \nmuch.

Madam President, I rise to speak about the great \nsuccess of the Energy Policy Act of 2005. I recall when we passed the \nbill, you, Madam President, and everyone else were, in the well, very \nhappy and joyous that we passed--after 15 or 20 years without one--a \nmajor energy bill. And then, right away, the next year, people wanted \nanother energy bill. Now, this year, they want another one.\n  I would like to tell the Senate why the bill we have is doing so much \ngood and how and why there is still room to try to implement it and, in \ndoing that, to do it a lot more without a new bill. We need a bill to \ncover some things we did not cover, but I would like to end this, with \npeople understanding this bill provides many things we have not done \nand many things that have been very successful.\n  First, I urge policy makers in the administration and Congress to \ncommit themselves to investing time, energy, and economic resources to \nfully implement this important act. We must achieve all we envisioned \nin passing this comprehensive energy policy.\n  This past week marked the 18-month anniversary of the enactment of \nthe Energy Policy Act. I rise today to speak about the gains we have \nmade in strengthening our Nation's energy security and the even greater \npromise that lies ahead.\n  On August 8, 2005, the President of the United States signed the \nEnergy Policy Act of 2005 in my home State of New Mexico. This \nlegislation is the catalyst of our Nation's nuclear renaissance and the \ndriving force behind new investments in clean coal technology. Passage \nof the Energy bill also marks the genesis of a secure American \nelectricity grid and the transformation of an agricultural enterprise \ninto an energy industry.\n  This act has helped strengthen our energy security, stimulate our \neconomy, create American jobs, and diversify our Nation's fuel supply. \nSimply put, since the passage of the Energy bill, America is on the \nmove. We are starting up a renewable fuels industry in America through \nthe first ever renewable fuels standard and a production tax credit. \nThese policies have helped create approximately 160,000 American jobs \nacross almost all sectors of our Nation's economy.\n  In the last 18 months, 73 new ethanol plants have broken ground, \nspurring us to exceed the biofuel mandate for 2006 by at least 800 \nmillion gallons. As a result of the Energy bill, 759 E85 ethanol pumps \nhave been installed around the country. Today, there are over 6 million \nalternative-fuel vehicles on the road.\n  I stand here today to tell you that even more can be done. I am \npleased President Bush and my colleagues on both sides of the aisle \nhave committed to an even stronger, more robust biofuels policy. The \nPresident spoke of it. We are all interested in enforcing it and seeing \nit is done in the biomass area. We will work together on this important \nenergy issue. Chairman Bingaman of the Energy Committee and I, as \nranking member, will build on our Energy bill success.\n  Because of the Energy Policy Act, we are making significant \nbreakthroughs in coal--America's most abundant and affordable energy \nresource. Because of the clean coal provisions in the legislation, \nthere are 159 new coal-based facilities in various planning stages.\n  Over the next 5 years, the United States will add an estimated 60,000 \ncoal miners to the American workforce. The Energy bill will accelerate \nthe development of a new generation of clean coal technologies. Because \nof title XIII of the Energy bill, the administration has appropriately \nand recently announced that it would award $1 billion in tax credits \nfor clean coal projects such as IGCC projects for electricity \ngeneration, gasification projects, and other projects using innovative \ntechnologies. With $650 million in tax credits to\n\n[[Page S1834]]\n\ncome next year, we are providing incentives for the American people to \nmake better choices about the kind of energy we will use. And because \nof the Energy bill, those choices will be clean energy choices.\n  Today, 50 percent of our Nation's electricity comes from coal, and \nthe EIA estimates that by 2025, 54 percent of electricity consumed will \nbe generated from coal. In China, they are building a coal-fired \npowerplant every 10 days. Let it be our mission to invest both the \nhuman and capital resources to the goal of zero-emission, coal-based \npower generation.\n  Having made the statement about China, let me hope that we will find \na way to negotiate with China so that they, too, will begin to be \nconcerned about what they are generating and begin some mutual programs \nof restraint. Wouldn't that be good news for the world? Let us dedicate \nourselves to choosing a free-market, incentive approach rather than a \npunitive, regulatory approach to solving this global problem.\n  On nuclear energy, what did we do? In advancing nuclear power, \nCongress affirmed sound science and technology and rejected irrational \nfear. By doing this, we strengthened the nuclear renaissance in \nAmerica. We provided Federal risk insurance for the first six nuclear \nreactors, production tax credits, and loan guarantees, and we renewed \nthe Price-Anderson Act. All these initiatives and more provided \nevidence of our renewed support for clean nuclear power.\n  Until the passage of the Energy bill 18 months ago, the world was \npassing us by on nuclear power. The renaissance was fading. Then \nCongress acted. Since that time, as many as 32 new nuclear reactors are \nin the planning stages. These nuclear plants would provide enough \nelectricity to power 29 million homes. If these plants come into \nfruition, they will displace 270 million metric tons of carbon dioxide \neach year.\n  Consider this: When all of those plants are operating for 5 years, it \nis estimated that they will have displaced the same amount of carbon \nemissions that the 230 million cars on the road in America today \nproduce each year.\n  This is what is at stake as we implement the various provisions of \nthe Energy Policy Act of 2005. We must do more to solve our growing \nnuclear waste problem, and we must do more to show Americans what the \nrest of the world already knows: nuclear power is the largest source of \nclean, carbon-free energy in the world. Advancing nuclear power is \nessential for our economic strength and environmental well-being. While \nwe do it, we will not be able to stop using other kinds of energy. So \nthe coal people need not worry. They will be used, too, because this \ngreat land needs both and more.\n  With the passage of the Energy Policy Act, we helped to stabilize \nlong-term prices of natural gas by providing the Federal Energy \nRegulatory Commission with the tools necessary to ensure the safe \noperation and reliability of our Nation's liquid natural gas assets. \nSince the passage of the Energy bill in August of 2005, FERC has \napproved seven new LNG terminals or terminal expansions. Working with \nprivate sector operators, FERC has brought on line the capacity \nequivalent of 1.34 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas, with the \npotential to increase that to 13.3 billion cubic feet per day. We must \ncontinue to look for ways domestically to find additional supplies of \nnatural gas, as we did last year with the passage of the Gulf of Mexico \nEnergy Security Act of 2006.\n  In passing the Energy Policy Act, we substantially advanced renewable \nsources of energy in America. By the end of 2007, 2 million American \nhomes will be powered by wind as we bring on line 6,000 megawatts of \nnew wind power this year, part of the $4.5 billion in wind power \ninvestments spurred by the Energy bill. As a result of the wind power \nbrought on line, we will displace 11 billion pounds of carbon dioxide \nannually.\n  And there is so much more that we did. We promoted a modernized \nelectricity grid, invested in solar energy, tax provisions that helped \nadd almost 340,000 hybrid vehicles, and the list goes on. I continue to \nlook for more to be done. In this Congress, we all will focus our \nefforts on convincing colleagues and the American people that the \nsolutions to our energy and environmental challenges lie in the genius \nof the American people. I will not support energy policies that burden \nthe people with higher energy costs and undue regulations. I oppose the \ncreation of additional unmanageable bureaucracy with its potential for \npunitive and burdensome regulations that harm the American worker. We \nwill meet the challenge of providing clean, affordable, and abundant \nenergy supplies in this Nation by facilitating and unlocking the \ningenuity of the American people with more capital investment, more \nloans guaranteed for people with new ideas to build new things. That is \nwhat we did in the Energy Policy Act of 2005, and that is what we will \ncontinue to do, hopefully.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/12/senate-section/article/S1834-1", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1834-S1835]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               THE BUDGET\n\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Madam President, over the past week, I have taken a \ngood look at the President's budget submission. I am new around here, \nand I will admit that the Federal budget is very complex. But as \nsomebody who has spent the last years of my life as an auditor, I have \ncome to one inescapable conclusion about the budget that has been \npresented to this Congress for consideration. First, it is not honest; \nsecond, it has the wrong priorities.\n  This budget reflects part of the problem we have; that is, our \ncountry is facing incredible problems that are very difficult, and we \nwant the American people to support us and believe in us. We cannot \nexpect them to join us in a fight against these complex problems if we \naren't going to begin the process by being honest with them. We cannot \nexpect them to support what we do if we are not willing to tell them \nthe complete and unvarnished truth about the situation we face in \nAmerica today in terms of our budget.\n  The President claims with a straight face that this budget will \neliminate the deficit by 2012. In fact, the President claims it will \ncreate a surplus in 2012. That sounds great. The problem is, it is not \ntrue. The numbers do not add up. First, he fails to include the full \ncost of the war in Iraq. In this budget, it says the war will only cost \n$50 billion in 2009. Keep in mind that in this budget cycle, we will \nspend over $240 billion on the war in Iraq. The confusing part to me \nabout the $50 billion is that it is a mystery. Why is this $50 billion \na mystery? It is a mystery because no one seems to know where the \nfigure came from.\n  As a member of the Armed Services Committee, I had the opportunity to \nlisten, as the Secretary of Defense and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff, and even the Comptroller for the Department of Defense were \nasked the question: Where did the $50 billion figure come from? They \ndid not know. If the leadership of our military and the highest ranking \nfinancial official in the Department of Defense do not know where a \nfigure in the budget came from for our war effort, what does that tell \nyou about the integrity of the document? If that figure came from \nsomewhere other than the leaders of the military, we have a problem.\n  The President also conveniently left out the long-term cost of \nalternative minimum tax relief for the middle class, which the \nadministration knows we all support. The AMT was never designed to \nreach down into the middle class, as it does and will continue to do in \nan ever-increasing way, to cause even more stress and pressure on a \nmiddle class that believes it is under attack from all sides. \nFurthermore, this budget assumes deep cuts in education and health \ncare, cuts that the administration knows are not realistic.\n  Finally, it hides the long-term cost of the President's ill-advised \nprogram to privatize Social Security. This budget is a gimmick. It is \nthe kind of gimmick that the American people have grown very tired of. \nIf proper budgeting procedures were followed, the Federal Government \nwould still be hundreds of billions of dollars in the red by 2012.\n  If it is not bad enough that this budget is not honest with the \nAmerican people as to what its implications are, it is even worse when \nyou look at the priorities. First, let's talk about the tax cuts in the \nPresident's budget. It preserves billions of dollars in oil subsidies, \ndespite the fact that, once again, we just heard that one of the big\n\n[[Page S1835]]\n\noil companies had a record profitmaking quarter. Second, there is $73 \nbillion in this budget to extend tax cuts for millionaires through \n2012. I am not talking about tax cuts for people who make $200,000 a \nyear or $300,000 a year. I am talking about for millionaires, $73 \nbillion. Maybe you think that is not so bad, $73 billion for \nmillionaires, until you realize the rest of the story that is contained \nin this budget.\n  In this budget, the President wants our veterans to spend as much as \n$15 billion more for the health care they have been promised. According \nto McClatchy newspapers, this figure could be as high as $15 billion. \nIt is at least $5 billion for additional enrollment fees in health care \nand additional pharmaceutical costs. Our veterans are being given a tax \nincrease. They say it is not a tax increase; it is a revenue \nenhancement. This budget is filled with revenue enhancements, also \nknown as user fees, also known as tax increases. So we have a tax cut \nin this budget for the millionaires, and we have taxes being raised on \nour veterans. We also have $37.8 billion over 10 years for seniors to \nincrease their Medicare premiums. Tax cuts for the millionaires; tax \nincreases for our veterans and seniors.\n  Besides the seniors and veterans, who else will pay? Our children \nwill pay through cuts in the health insurance program for children. \nThere may be a little more money in this budget, but there is not \nenough money to cover the children who currently are covered under this \nprogram in the United States. Missouri is one of those States that has \na shortfall in funding. If we do not fix the President's budget, we \nwill be taking care of the millionaires, and tens of thousands of \nchildren will be removed from health care rolls in the State of \nMissouri.\n  The COPS Program is cut, law enforcement. College loan programs are \ncut.\n  I have heard in the last couple of years in my life the phrase \n``support our troops'' as often as I have heard almost the words ``good \nmorning.'' I have heard it in this room dozens of times in the last few \ndays, as people have argued about the war in Iraq and said, ``You are \nnot supporting our troops. You have to show that you support our \ntroops.''\n  This budget is the way we show whether we support our troops. \nSupporting our troops is not a phrase for a political campaign. It is \nnot something to be bandied about to get political advantage, over \nwhich resolution we are voting on, or who looks better, the Republicans \nor the Democrats. It should be embodied in what we do as we decide the \npriorities for the money we spend on behalf of the American people.\n  In this budget, we have said to veterans coming home--and that we are \ntalking about veterans under the age of 65--that they will have to pay \nmore. That is being proposed at the same time we are walking around \nhere righteously indignant that we are not doing enough to support our \ntroops. In reality, the veterans of this Nation have been losing \nbenefits throughout the Iraq war conflict. They have been fighting for \ntheir health care, fighting to see a doctor, and waiting in long lines. \nThis budget is an opportunity to quit talking the talk and begin to \nwalk the walk when it comes to the men and women who have put their \nlives on the line for our flag and for the country we love.\n  There are not very many veterans coming home from Iraq who are having \nsleepless nights, worrying about the estate tax on their $10 million \nestates. There are not very many veterans coming home from Iraq who are \nworried about their capital gains tax on a multimillion dollar piece of \nproperty or their stock portfolio. But there are veterans coming home \nfrom Iraq who are having sleepless nights about their health care, \nabout their children's health care, about their children's education, \nand about their retirement security.\n  This budget does not reflect that we care about those veterans and \ntheir sleepless nights. Let's make the phrase ``support the troops'' \nmean something other than trying to jockey for position in a political \ngame of hardball. Let's get our priorities straight. Let's fix this \ndeeply flawed budget for the American people, and let's begin by being \nhonest about the budget.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I rise to wholeheartedly endorse an \namendment filed today prior to the 2:30 deadline, authored by Senator \nChambliss and coauthored by myself. The amendment relates to SCHIP, \nState Children's Health Insurance Program, and a crisis that exists \nright now, this minute, in 17 States in the United States of America.\n  As the occupant of the chair knows, SCHIP is a program where our most \nneedy children are able to get health insurance. It is a 71-percent \nFederal Medicaid match. But unlike Medicaid, it is not an entitlement; \nit is an appropriated amount annually that is derived by a formula as \nthe States get their benefit. What has happened this year is that a \nnumber of States, with a number of children eligible for the program, \nhave run out of their Federal match and it is capitated.\n  Also, a number of States have a significant surplus. What Senator \nChambliss has proposed, and what I am advocating, is an amendment we \nwant to propose to the CR which would take that amount of surplus SCHIP \nmoney in States with more than 200 percent of their estimated need--\ntake that amount above 200 percent and put it into a pool and \nreallocate it to those States that are falling short, so that through \nthis fiscal year every child in America who has been promised \nchildren's health insurance can in fact get it.\n  It doesn't penalize any State that has a surplus because that is \nmoney they have not and will not use. It doesn't benefit any State who \nhas abused the system. It is just that we have a number of States that \nhave grown rapidly in their numbers. In Georgia alone, in the aftermath \nof Hurricane Katrina, we added 43,000 children immediately into our \nState's population, most all of whom remain today.\n  I know the CR amendment tree has been filled as of now. The \ndistinguished majority leader has filled the tree, so there will be no \nroom for amendments to the continuing resolution. I intend to vote \ntomorrow for cloture to allow us to complete this resolution and \ncontinue appropriations for this year. I hope the distinguished \nmajority leader will think about the value of saving the SCHIP program \nthis year.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter that \nwas distributed by the majority leader and the Speaker, written to the \nPresident of the United States, on February 2.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                Congress of the United States,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, February 2, 2007.\n     The President\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: We understand you plan to submit a \n     request for emergency supplemental appropriations soon, which \n     news reports indicate could exceed $100 billion. As you \n     consider the emergency needs of our nation, we respectfully \n     request that you not forget the millions of low-income \n     Americans who are insured under the State Children's Health \n     Insurance Program (SCHIP). We ask that you submit a separate \n     spending proposal to cover shortfalls in SCHIP for Fiscal \n     Year 2007 which have been estimated to be $745 million. \n     Unless we act quickly to provide additional funds to this \n     important program, we are putting the health coverage of \n     thousands of Americans in jeopardy.\n       As you know, over 46 million Americans are without health \n     insurance. We can ill afford to increase the rolls of the \n     uninsured for failure to adequately fund a successful and \n     efficient insurance program such as SCHIP. Yet we know that \n     at least fourteen states will face a shortfall of SCHIP funds \n     within months. The Governor of Georgia has written to us \n     stating that ``It is vitally important to our most needy \n     citizens that Congress act expeditiously.''\n       At the end of the last Congress, we were successful in \n     including a provision to avert a\n\n[[Page S1836]]\n\n     similar crisis, but unfortunately, we are again in need of \n     another short-term solution. While we plan to work in \n     Congress later this year to reauthorize SCHIP and address \n     longer-term issues, it is essential that you work with us to \n     again provide a short-term fix. The cost of filling the \n     funding shortfall is minor in comparison to your other \n     emergency requests.\n       SCHIP has become a vital part our safety net, providing \n     health care coverage to millions of Americans who otherwise \n     would be uninsured. Including funds to address fully the \n     looming SCHIP shortfall would assure that states can continue \n     to provide this important coverage while we work to address \n     the longer-term success of the program.\n           Sincerely\n     Harry Reid,\n       Senate Majority\n         Leader.\n     Nancy Pelosi,\n       Speaker.\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Madam President, they made my case better than I make it \nin this letter. Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Majority Leader Harry Reid say \nwe must fix the SCHIP program and suggested that the President add that \nto the emergency supplemental on Iraq, which we are going to take up in \nApril.\n  The problem with that is, my State of Georgia runs out of SCHIP money \nat the end of this month--maybe, at the latest, at the end of March. We \nare having to cut off new enrollees now and will soon send out the \nnotices to 273,000 children. There will be no money for the remainder \nof the year after March to meet the obligations of SCHIP. That will \ntake place in States around the country, North, South, East and West.\n  Think about it. If you have enough money here and everybody who had \nthat money allocated has used all they need, and you don't have enough \nmoney over here, it is a simple accounting measurement to fix that in \nthis interim time. Senator Grassley and Senator Baucus have already \ncommitted, and Senators Rockefeller and Reid--all of us on both sides \nhave all said we have to fix the formula; we will get to it toward the \nend of the year. But we can fix it in the interim to see to it that no \nchild with health care under SCHIP loses that before we make the \npermanent fix.\n  I commend Senator Chambliss, who is on the floor, on his leadership \nand this amendment. I ask the majority leader to give close thought to \nthis issue that was referenced in his own letter of February 2. If \nthere was one amendment that could go on the continuing resolution and \nwould receive unanimous support in the Congress and in the Senate, it \nis the amendment authored by Senator Chambliss and cosponsored by \nmyself. I ask the leadership to seriously consider allowing an opening \non the amendment tree so that amendment can be passed and adopted, and \nchildren in Georgia and around the country will end up having the \nhealth care that they have been promised and that they deserve.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Madam President, first, I thank my dear friend from \nOregon for letting us have some time here to talk about this issue that \nis so critical to 17 States, which my colleague so eloquently stated. I \nappreciate that.\n  I say to my colleague from Georgia, he and I have worked on this \nissue so closely together, and the authorship is a combination between \nthe two of us. He has been very generous with his time on this issue \nand, most importantly, very generous with the thought process he always \nputs into the most difficult issues we face up here. Without Senator \nIsakson, we would not be where we are today on this amendment.\n  Today I wish to speak to a critical piece of legislation. It is my \nhope that this legislation will remedy a situation currently facing \nhundreds of thousands of hard-working families in Georgia who depend on \nthe State Children's Health Insurance Program--or what we know as \nSCHIP.\n  In Georgia, some 273,000 previously uninsured children are now \nreceiving health insurance provided by our State's Peachcare Program. \nGeorgia is one of several States facing a projected funding shortfall \nfor fiscal year 2007.\n  Last week, the Georgia Department of Community Health that runs \nPeachcare announced that it will stop enrolling new children into the \nprogram effective March 11, 2007.\n  Senator Isakson, Congressman Nathan Deal, and I have been working \nrelentlessly with our Governor, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid \nServices, Senator Grassley, and the Finance and Budget Committees to \nfind a short-term solution for the children of Georgia who are \ndependent upon this program. Unfortunately, to this point there has \nbeen no resolution.\n  Senator Isakson would like to introduce an amendment today to the \ncontinuing resolution that would redistribute fiscal year 2005 and 2006 \nfunds from States that have an excess of more than 200 percent in \nFederal SCHIP funds to cover the shortfall for States in need for the \nremainder of fiscal year 2007.\n  Congress has already passed legislation in an attempt to continue to \ncover children in States that are running out of funding for SCHIP. \nH.R. 6164, which became public law on January 15, 2007, required a \nredistribution of SCHIP funds in an attempt to delay State shortfalls \nuntil May of 2007. The estimated remaining shortfall is approximately \n$750 million for 14 States. According to recent estimates there is \nabout $4 billion in unspent funds which have accumulated in other \nStates.\n  Hard-working Georgians who qualify for this program don't need to \nwonder how they are going to pay for their children's health care. We \nmust bridge the gap so that these children can continue to be insured, \nand I hope the Democratic leadership will allow this amendment to be \nconsidered.\n  Time is running out on this funding issue for Georgia's children and \nchildren in other States. The continuing resolution is an important \nfunding vehicle that will allow us to solve this problem for the \nremainder of the year until Congress can reauthorize this program.\n  Georgia's Peachcare Program is providing health insurance to the \nchildren of hardworking Americans. They are the kids of the mechanic \nwho works on your car at the local service station, the woman who \nchecks you out every week at the grocery store, or the teacher who is \nproviding your children with the basic knowledge they will use \nthroughout their life. SCHIP programs are for the men and women who \nmake too much money to receive Medicaid yet cannot afford to provide \npremium insurance for their children at the level of care that they \nneed.\n  I read in the Atlanta Journal-Constitution recently about Sylvia \nBanks, a mother of 3 from Ringgold, GA, who is a parent that is \nconcerned the Peachcare Program will soon run out of money. Her 13-\nyear-old son, Benjamin, wears a $7,000 insulin pump, and supplies for \nhim are around $300 a month, paid for by Peachcare. In a recent news \narticle, Ms. Banks, whose husband is a minister, states, ``We can't do \nwithout the insurance. We are taxpayers trying our best to earn an \nhonest living. We are not trying to suck up the government's money. We \nsee this as a benefit and blessing.''\n  Peachcare, and other programs funded through SCHIP throughout the \ncountry, allow families to bridge the gap between Medicaid and high \npriced premium insurance that many families cannot afford.\n  The importance of this program is too vital to our country's working \nclass not to find a solution to this problem, and find a solution soon.\n  Mr. President, let me just briefly read some excerpts from a letter \nwritten to President Bush from Majority Leader Reid and Speaker Nancy \nPelosi, who have echoed our sentiments about this critical funding \nissue:\n\n       As you consider the emergency needs of our Nation, we \n     respectfully request that you not forget the millions of low-\n     income Americans who are insured under the State Children's \n     Health Insurance Program (SCHIP). We ask that you submit a \n     separate spending proposal to cover shortfalls in SCHIP for \n     fiscal year 2007 which have been estimated to be $745 \n     million. Unless we act quickly to provide additional funds to \n     this important program, we are putting the health coverage of \n     thousands of Americans in jeopardy.\n       As you know, over 46 million Americans are without health \n     insurance. We can ill afford to increase the rolls of the \n     uninsured for failure to adequately fund a successful and \n     efficient insurance program such as SCHIP. Yet we know that \n     at least fourteen States will face a shortfall of SCHIP funds \n     within months. The Governor of Georgia has written to us \n     stating that ``it is vitally important to our most needy \n     citizens that Congress act expeditiously.''\n\n  The letter goes on to say:\n\n       SCHIP has become a vital part of our safety net, providing \n     health care coverage to millions of Americans who otherwise \n     would\n\n[[Page S1837]]\n\n     be uninsured. Including funds to address fully the looming \n     SCHIP shortfall would assure that States can continue to \n     provide this important coverage while we work to address the \n     longer-term success of the program.\n\n  So again, we have introduced our amendment today because Georgia's \nchildren are waiting. This is about them--our children. They are our \nNation's future--and their health care needs must be met. The people in \nGeorgia want a solution to this problem. Hard working Georgians and \nAmericans across the U.S. don't need to wonder how they are going to \npay for their children's health care. These are our middle class \ncitizens who work to find a solution and that is what we have been \ndoing and what we will continue to do.\n  I urge the Democratic leadership to allow consideration of this \namendment, and I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/12/senate-section/article/S1837-1", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1837-S1845]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         CONTINUING RESOLUTION\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Madam President, the role of the Federal Government is \nboth a protagonist and an antagonist of Oregon, and what a desperate \nsituation we are in. I say this because some have said to me that you \ncannot filibuster a continuing resolution, you will shut down the \nGovernment. My point back is that whatever it takes, maybe in getting \nthe Federal Government to look over the abyss with me, it will \nunderstand how many Oregon counties are feeling at this critical hour.\n  Senator Wyden and I are one on this issue. He is working the majority \nnow, and I worked the majority in the 109th Congress. He will find it \nfrustrating trying to get a focus on this issue that affects not just \nour State but so many others, but ours is affected disproportionately.\n  The Federal Government owns 53 percent of Oregon and 57 percent of \nour timberlands. As you know, local communities cannot tax the Federal \nGovernment. So the deal that was cut back at the turn of the last \ncentury was that, in lieu of taxes, local communities would get 25 \npercent of timber receipts and, with that, kids could go to school, \nneighborhoods could be safer, streets would be paved, and civilizations \nwould be built in these timber-dependent, isolated areas, and you are \ntalking about most of Oregon.\n  So my call tonight is to lay out before the American people the \nplight, the history, and the reason for my arguing now on this bill and \nthe next bill but, frankly, if the 110th Congress doesn't solve this on \nthe continuing resolution, or on the emergency supplemental, the pink \nslips that have already gone out will turn red, and there will be \ntremendous damage done to rural Oregon, which is most of Oregon.\n  So I pick up now, Madam President, where I was interrupted before by \nthe needs of others and at the request of the majority leader:\n\n       Think of railroads as the internet of America's Gilded Age \n     . . . a totally transforming technology . . . that allowed \n     people in the late 1800s to communicate and travel great \n     distances faster, cheaper, and more efficiently than ever \n     before. Nowhere was this transformation more profound than in \n     the Pacific Northwest.\n       Prior to the completion of the transcontinental railroad in \n     1869, there were less than 130,000 American settlers residing \n     in all of the Oregon country, including the Washington and \n     Idaho territories. Communications were typically hand \n     delivered documents. To transport them across the country, \n     they first had to be carried to Missouri, probably by \n     riverboat or wagon, and then carted cross country to the \n     Pacific Coast.\n       Alternatively, they could be delivered by boat from the \n     Atlantic Coast, sailing around the southern tip of South \n     America, then up the Pacific Coast; or, as a third option, \n     sailing from the Atlantic coast to Central America, crossing \n     over the mountains to the Pacific Ocean, loaded back on board \n     ship, and sailing up the Coast.\n       However it was done, the trip was lengthy, dangerous and \n     expensive. Having the ability to ride a railroad from the \n     Atlantic to the Pacific changed America dramatically and \n     helped to stitch together a nation nearly torn asunder by a \n     horrific Civil War.\n       Eastern railroads connected to Omaha, where the route to \n     the West began. The Union Pacific route more or less followed \n     the Oregon Trail west to Utah where it connected with the \n     Central Pacific, ultimately reaching San Francisco.\n       Building the railroad, itself, transformed the West. \n     Congress enacted various ``land grant'' programs, selling off \n     vast amounts of land in the West, to both bring settlers and \n     raise money, to help finance construction. Many of these new \n     ``sodbusters'' were attracted west by the promise of cheap \n     farmland. They fenced and plowed the prairie to start their \n     farms. The railroads, in turn, hauled their crops to far away \n     cities, in so doing also transforming what Americans ate.\n       As rail construction moved westward, crews and supplies \n     were constantly moved out to the end of the line, settling \n     there until the next section of road was completed. These new \n     towns were soon filled with a ``Wild West'' brood of \n     gunslingers, cardsharps, prostitutes, saloons and bordellos, \n     gathered to separate the construction crews from their wages.\n       As the line moved further along, the railroad also moved \n     its supply stop. Some of the older towns left behind \n     survived, and a few even thrived, but most were abandoned. \n     Residents wanting to move to the next stop were loaded onto \n     railroad cars, along with their buildings, including the \n     saloons and bordellos, and hauled to the new end of the line, \n     giving birth to the expression ``Hell on wheels.''\n       Even with completion of the transcontinental railroad, the \n     Pacific Northwest remained largely isolated. Supplies and \n     communications still needed to be packed in by wagon from the \n     nearest rail line in Utah, or brought by land or ship north \n     from San Francisco.\n       Rivers were the highways of the Northwest, and Portland, \n     located near the confluence of the Columbia and Willamette \n     Rivers, became the gateway. Millions of dollars worth of gold \n     and silver poured through Portland on its way to San \n     Francisco from mines as far away as Montana and Idaho.\n       Settlers quickly learned that the thick forests of the \n     Northwest could be logged, and much of the lumber, when \n     shipped south to California, created gold of its own.\n       In 1859, when Oregon became the first Northwest state \n     admitted to the Union, Portland's population was less than \n     800 residents. Ten years later it had grown to nearly 10,000. \n     It all happened so fast that Portland became known as \n     ``Stumptown.'' Early residents logged the riverfront to \n     create the new town, not bothering to remove the stumps. \n     Instead, they simply painted them white, hoping they could be \n     seen in the dark.\n       It didn't take long for Oregonians, and East Coast \n     financiers, to figure out that a railroad from Portland to \n     San Francisco could transform the Northwest economy, making a \n     lot of money along the way, for its builders.\n       By 1866, two rail lines had started south from Portland, \n     one on the west side of the Willamette River, and the other \n     on the east side. Construction was very expensive. Neither \n     line had the financial wherewithal to make much progress. \n     Oregonians needed the deep pockets of Uncle Sam to help build \n     their railroad.\n       The Union victory in the Civil War created a spending spree \n     in Congress. Taking advantage of this postwar exuberance, \n     Oregon Senator George H. Williams persuaded Congress to \n     authorize construction of a rail line from Portland to the \n     California border.\n       ``The Oregon and California Land Grant Act of 1866'' \n     provided that railroad construction would be subsidized by a \n     grant of 5 million acres of public land in alternating 640 \n     acre sections extending like a checkerboard for 10 miles on \n     each side of the proposed rail line.\n       While the Act left it up to the Oregon Legislature to \n     decide who would build the railroad, it provided that the \n     United States Department of the Interior, through its General \n     Land Office, would sell the land to ``actual settlers'' in \n     plots no bigger than 160 acres, at a price no more than $2.50 \n     per acre. The land turned out to be some of the richest \n     timberland in the world.\n       That kind of government largesse naturally brought out less \n     than the best in business and political interests. It wasn't \n     long before the railroads were dominating the state \n     legislature. Since, at that time, legislatures still selected \n     U.S. Senators, Sen. Williams was soon replaced.\n       Previously proving his worth to the railroads as President \n     of the Oregon State Senate, [Senator John Mitchell] would \n     represent Oregon as U.S. Senator, off and on, for the next 20 \n     years. During his entire time in public office, Mitchell was \n     also on the payroll, as legal counsel, to both the Northern \n     Pacific and the O Railroads. He was known to boast that \n     what the railroads wanted, he wanted.\n       Williams, suddenly retired as Oregon's Senator, did not \n     return directly to Oregon. Instead, he was appointed Attorney \n     General by recently elected President Ulysses Grant.\n       He served in that capacity for six years until an opening \n     occurred as Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, and \n     Grant nominated his Oregon friend for the job.\n       Unfortunately for Williams, the national railroad scandals \n     then rocking Congress, combined with increasing rumors of \n     things not being quite what they should in Oregon, convinced \n     the Senate not to confirm Williams. He returned to Portland \n     to practice law, and ultimately was elected Mayor of the \n     growing city.\n       Even with the O land grants, railroad promoters went \n     broke several times before construction was finally completed \n     20 years later. By this time, the O Railroad was a part of \n     the Southern Pacific line. The driving of the mandatory \n     ``golden spike'' near Ashland, Oregon in 1887 linked Portland \n     to San Francisco at last.\n       To help pay for the lengthy construction, the federal \n     government, through the Interior\n\n[[Page S1838]]\n\n     Department's General Land Office, had been selling off 160 \n     acre parcels of the O lands to all comers, regardless of \n     whether they were ``actual settlers'', as the law required.\n       ``Doing a land office business'' took on a rather dubious \n     meaning in Oregon, as land speculators hauled drunks out of \n     saloons and sailors off ships, delivering them to the \n     Government Land Office to claim a piece of federal land. The \n     new ``owners'' then transferred their deed to the \n     speculators, sometimes for as little as a bottle of whiskey, \n     all with the Land Office approval.\n       In the process more than 3 million acres were fraudulently \n     looted from Oregon's public domain.\n       Rumors of the O land fraud soon began circulating in the \n     nation's capitol, but it wasn't until Teddy Roosevelt entered \n     the White House in 1901 that the federal government \n     responded.\n       Special investigators were sent by the President to Oregon \n     in 1903, where they were met with intense hostility from \n     Oregon's political and business community. The railroad and \n     logging interests attempted to stonewall the investigators, \n     but a series of damning articles, published by crusading \n     editor Harvey Scott of the Portland Oregonian, finally \n     exposed the fraud.\n       The federal investigators soon returned 1,032 indictments, \n     including Senator Mitchell, several Oregon Congressmen, U.S. \n     Attorney's, GLO officials, judges, mayors, lawyers and \n     businessmen. When the cases went to trial in 1905, they were \n     pared down to 35 of the chief culprits, of whom 34 were \n     convicted, including Senator Mitchel1. He died at age 70 \n     before being sent to prison.\n       Just as completion of the railroad transformed the \n     Northwest economy, the land scandal transformed its politics, \n     creating a populist foundation which can still be felt.\n       Led by political reform groups such as the farm-based \n     Grange, the ``Oregon System'' was enacted by the Oregon \n     Legislature, calling for the direct election of U.S. \n     Senators, and public oversight of Legislative Acts. Voters \n     could decide public issues at the ballot box, with measures \n     to initiate laws (initiative), repeal legislative acts \n     (referendum), or even remove officeholders (recall).\n       Within a decade the 17th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution \n     was adopted nationwide, requiring the direct election of all \n     U.S. Senators, and the initiative, referendum and recall \n     became the state standard for political reform.\n       After the spectacular trials of 1905, the federal \n     government acted to take back the valuable O timberlands, \n     now owned by the Southern Pacific, but the Railroad fought \n     back in court. The battle raged in the courts until 1915 when \n     the Supreme Court ruled for the government.\n       The following year, Congress set up an ``O'' account, \n     funded by timber sales off the lands, to reimburse the \n     Southern Pacific for the lands the federal government had \n     taken back, and to provide funds to the O Counties where \n     the lands were located.\n       It wasn't until the depression years that Oregon's Senator \n     Charles McNary turned the O lands golden. Senator McNary \n     had become the Republican Minority Leader of the Senate in \n     1933, at the beginning of President Franklin Roosevelt's \n     second term.\n       Over martini's at the White House, the Republican Senator \n     and the Democrat President sorted out their differences and \n     agreed on significant legislation beneficial to the \n     Northwest, including federal help for farmers, the creation \n     of the Bonneville Power Administration, the International \n     Pacific Salmon Fisheries Act, and the O Lands Sustained-\n     Yield Act, all enacted by 1937.\n       The new O Act transformed federal funding for the 18 \n     Oregon counties home to the O lands, and Oregon's golden \n     goose was born. The Act created the Bureau of Land Management \n     in the Department of the Interior, out of the ashes of the \n     old General Land Office, and directed the BLM to harvest \n     timber off the O Lands, on a sustained yield basis, with an \n     unprecedented 75 percent of the receipts from the timber \n     sales being returned to the O counties.\n       At one of those White House visits, Roosevelt, in \n     anticipation of his run for a third term in 1940, suggested \n     McNary should be his Vice-Presidential running mate on a \n     ``Unity Party'' platform. McNary declined and was later \n     nominated by the Republicans to run as their Vice \n     Presidential candidate with corporate attorney Wendell \n     Willkie at the head of the GOP ticket.\n       With the post war building boom in the 1950s, the O \n     revenues were pumping hundreds of millions of dollars into \n     Oregon's cash starved rural counties, funding schools and \n     other local projects. The golden goose had become the \n     touchstone of Oregon politics.\n       Oregon's Mark Hatfield championed the O lands as \n     governor, and used the issue to help get elected to the \n     Senate in 1966. As he gained power on the Senate \n     Appropriations Committee, Hatfield became the guardian of \n     Oregon's unique golden goose.\n\n  Madam President, that is a brief history of the O lands--one that \nwill become more consequential later in my statement, when I \nspecifically discuss county payments safety net.\n  The fundamental point I am trying to make is that between the \nnational forests and the O lands, the Federal Government holds 57 \npercent of Oregon's standing timber. Yet the Federal Government \ncontributes less than 7 percent to the State's total timber harvest. \nThis was not always the case.\n  The history of my State, as well as its current predicament, is \nclosely tied to the harvest of timber, of ``green gold.'' Atop our \nState capitol in Salem stands a 23-foot gold-gilded pioneer, an ax \nproudly in his hand.\n  In 1909, the Oregon State Board of Forestry described my State's \ntimber wealth as follows:\n\n       Beyond question, the greatest national endowment of Oregon \n     is the unsurpassed wealth stored up in the forests of the \n     State.\n       Oregon has approximately 300 billion feet of standing \n     merchantable timber. This is not an idle guess, but it is the \n     average of the estimate of government officials, cruisers, \n     and timber experts who have traversed the entire State and \n     made the matter a thorough study. This is a much greater \n     amount than is possessed by any other State in the Union and \n     is nearly one-sixth of the total amount of standing \n     merchantable timber in the United States. It is noteworthy \n     that this immense amount of timber is found on an area which \n     is only 57 percent of the area of the State. The value of \n     this body of timber is twofold; first, as a source of lumber \n     supply; second, as a factor in the maintenance of a perpetual \n     flow of water in the streams and rivers of the State, by \n     retarding the melting of the snow and holding a continuous \n     supply of moisture in the ground during the summer months.\n       Commercially, the value of the standing timber of Oregon, \n     when manufactured into lumber and sold at the rate of $12 per \n     thousand, would be $3.6 billion, a sum in excess of the total \n     amount of currency in the United States at the present time.\n\n  Amazing. At current lumber prices, the value of this standing timber \nwould be $150 billion in stumpage value alone. But in the early years \nof Oregon country, timber was not a primary commodity, it was \nconsidered a nuisance and a detriment to agriculture. Trading companies \nsuch as the Hudson's Bay Company harvested Oregon's wealth from its \nfur-bearing animals, such as the beaver--the State animal of Oregon and \nthe mascot of our land grant college, Oregon State University. Go \nBeavs! But as time rolled on, the settlers of Oregon country sought a \nnew source of wealth in the lush virgin forest all around them. \nOregonians made great strides into turning trees into 2 by 4s. The \nfirst power-driven sawmill was built in 1836, 23 years before our \nstatehood. The first commercial production of Douglas fir plywood was \ninvented in St. John's, OR, by the Autzen family. That name is now \nfamiliarly associated with the University of Oregon football stadium. \nGo Ducks!\n  The single most important invention affecting logging was the \nchainsaw of 1935. It was not invented in Oregon, but it was perfected \nin Oregon. In 1947, a lumberjack named ``Joseph Cox'' invented chainsaw \nteeth. Joe was chopping firewood one chilly autumn day in 1946, when he \npaused for a moment to examine the curious activity in a tree stump. A \ntimber beetle larva the size of a man's forefinger was easily chewing \nits way through sound timber, going both across and through the wood \ngrain at will.\n  Joe was an experienced operator of the gas-powered saws used in those \ndays, but the cutting chain was the problem. It required a lot of \nfiling and maintenance time. He said: I spent several months looking \nfor nature's answer to the problem. I found it in the larva of the \ntimber beetle.\n  Joe knew if he could duplicate the larva's alternating C-shaped jaws \nin steel, it might catch on. He went to work in the basement shop of \nhis Portland, OR, home and came up with a revolutionary new chain. The \nfirst Cox Chipper Chain was produced and sold in November 1947. The \nbasic design of Joe's original chain is still widely used today and \nrepresents one of the biggest influences in the history of timber \nharvesting.\n  In 1907, there were 173 sawmills in Oregon, but with new and improved \nchainsaws in the woods, came equally impressive sawmills. C.A. Smith \nLumber and Manufacturing Company built the Nation's largest sawmill in \nCoos Bay. Coos Bay also became the largest lumber-exporting port in the \nworld. The world's largest pine lumber factory was built by \nWeyerhaeuser in Klamath Falls, south of the Winema National Forest.\n  By 1929, there were 608 lumber mills, 5 paper mills, 64 planing \nmills, and 47 furniture factories in Oregon. By 1947, Oregon had 1,573 \nlumber mills turning out more than 7 million board feet.\n  Timber also served as a national strategic interest. The Federal \nGovernment built its own sawmill in Toledo,\n\n[[Page S1839]]\n\nOR, to harvest spruce trees for airplane manufacturing during World War \nI.\n  During World War II, Oregon had the unfortunate distinction of \nreceiving the first mainland aerial bombing. On September 9, 1942, a \nJapanese pilot flew over the Oregon coast, with the intention of \ndropping a firebomb on the thick forest and causing a massive fire, \nshocking Americans and diverting resources from fighting the war to \nfighting fire. Once over forested land, the pilot released the bomb, \nwhich struck leaving a crater about 3 feet in diameter and 1 foot deep.\n  In 1944, Japan launched over 9,000 firebomb balloons over the Pacific \nOcean. Once again, the goal was to start forest fires in Oregon and \nwreak havoc. The most tragic incident involving balloon bombs also \nfound a place in history as yielding the only deaths due to enemy \naction on mainland America during World War II.\n  The events unfolded on May 5, 1945, as a pastor and his wife took \nfive children for a picnic on a beautiful spring day east of Bly, OR. I \nshould note that a few years ago, Mr. President, the Federal \nauthorities thwarted al-Qaida plans to build a jihadist training camp \nin Bly, OR. But back in 1944, Rev. Archie Mitchell parked his car near \nBly, and he heard his pregnant wife call out: Look what I found, dear.\n  One of the children tried to remove the balloon from a tree and \ntriggered the bomb. The force of the blast immediately filled the air \nwith dust, pine needles, twigs, branches, and dead logs. The entire \nfamily was killed.\n  During World War II, private timberlands, not Federal, fueled the war \neffort. This was necessary because they had roads and quick access to \ntimber that was needed to help win the war. Lumber producers also had \nimplicit assurances from the Federal Government that Federal forests \nwould open up after the war. As Associate Forest Service Chief Sally \nCollins recently stated:\n\n       Post-World War II, the Forest Service entered a new period \n     characterized, in large part, by timber production. From the \n     1960s to the 1980s, every administration, with strong \n     congressional support, called for more timber harvest from \n     the national forests, with the goal of replacing the depleted \n     stocks of private and State timber as a result of the war \n     effort. At its peak in 1987, the national forests provided \n     close to 30 percent of the Nation's timber supply.\n\n  The bulk of the wood came from Federal lands in Oregon. Postwar \ntimber harvest on Federal land alone in my State oscillated between 4 \nand 5 billion feet per year--enough wood to build nearly 300,000 homes. \nThe revenues from these harvests energized rural Oregon, not to mention \nthe Federal Treasury, since 75 percent of the proceeds came right here \nand were deposited in Washington, DC.\n  It was a win-win and in the spirit of the Federal Government acting \nin the aide, not the ailment, of the States united under its banner. It \nwas the same spirit in which Franklin Delano Roosevelt dedicated the \nBonneville Dam on the mighty Columbia River. Said he at the time:\n\n       The responsibility of the Federal Government for the \n     welfare of its citizens will not come from the top in the \n     form of unplanned hit or miss appropriations of money, but \n     will progress to the national capital from the ground up, \n     from the communities and counties and States which lie within \n     each of the logical geographical areas.\n\n  The timber industry built itself literally from the ground up and is \na living legacy in Oregon to this day. Back cuts and board feet, \nbuckers and fellers, chokers and cruisers, skidders and slashers, \nspringboards and spring poles and widow-makers, these are terms still \nheard in the woods, in smokey bars, and in Forest Service rigs all \nacross Oregon.\n  The great Johnny Cash once wrote a song about Roseburg, OR, the \ntimber capital of the world. In spoken word, on his ``Ride this Train'' \nalbum, the ``man in black'' said this:\n\n       Ride this train to Roseburg, Oregon, now there's a town for \n     you; and you talk about rough, you know a lot of places in \n     the country claim Paul Bunyon lived there; but you should \n     have seen Roseburg when me and my daddy'd come there; every \n     one of them loggers looked like Paul Bunyon to me; as I was a \n     skinny kid about 16 and I was scared to death when we walked \n     into that camp; none of the lumberjacks paid any attention to \n     me at first; but when my pa told the boss that me and him \n     wanted a job; a lot of 'em stopped their work to see what was \n     gonna happen; that big boss walked around me, looked me up \n     and down, and said, Mister, I believe that boy is made out of \n     second growth timber, and I guess I was. Everybody but me and \n     my pa had a big laugh over it. Pa got kinda mad and the boss \n     finally said he might start me out as a high climber--I \n     didn't know what a high climber was. Boy, I sure learned \n     fast. That steel corded rope cut my back, and that ax, I \n     thought it was gonna break my arms off, but I stuck with it. \n     It wasn't long till I learned a man's got to be a lot tougher \n     than the timber he's cuttin'. Finally I could swing that \n     crosscut saw with the best of them.\n\n  Country singers were not the only artists to embrace Oregon's logging \nheritage. Ken Kesey might be known to some of my colleagues as the \nauthor of ``One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest.'' Oregonians know Ken \nKesey as one of their own--a countercultural figure, bridging the gap \nbetween the beatniks of the 1950s and the hippies of the 1960s.\n  Kesey's second novel, ``Sometimes a Great Notion,'' tells of a \nhardheaded Oregon logging family hacking a family wage out of the \nwoods. I would read some of that work, but in the interest of getting \nthrough this 5-hour speech in an hour, I will save that for another \nday. His work does personify the pride, passion, and perseverance of \nthe Oregon logger and the Oregon spirit itself.\n  Kesey's words vividly describe the back-breaking work of logging, \nseen through the eyes of a long-lost brother from the east coast. In \nthe nonfiction world, another east coast brother--``Big Brother,'' if \nyou will--would break the back of Oregon's logging industry.\n  (Mr. SANDERS assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SMITH. I will yield.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Through the Chair, I would like to pose a couple of \nquestions to my colleague making an important speech.\n  I have been attending a lot of town meetings across the State, and I \nknow my colleague is attending some as well. What is your sense of how \ndire the situation is at home? When I talk to people, you get the sense \nthis is a real lifeline, and I think it would be helpful if you could \nlay out exactly that sense of urgency you are picking up at home.\n  Mr. SMITH. My response is the same as the Senator's. It is a sense of \nabandonment, a sense of betrayal, a sense that the Federal Government \nmade a deal, changed the terms, and now is welching on the deal.\n  That is why I am here giving the history of this State, trying to \nshare with my colleagues some of the feeling, the history, the blood, \nsweat, and tears that went into building Oregon and why the Federal \nGovernment needs to be the protagonist for Oregon again, not the \nantagonist.\n  So that would be my answer. They feel like the Federal Government \ngave its word and needs to keep it.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Again, through the Chair, Mr. President, would it be my \ncolleague's sense that at home the kinds of services that are on the \nline are not exactly what the people call the extras? We are talking \nabout law enforcement. We are talking about schools.\n  I know the Senator shares a long friendship with Sheriff Mike \nWinters, for example, of southern Oregon, and he has told me the kinds \nof cutbacks we have seen in law enforcement are extraordinary, such as \ninvolving the effort to fight methamphetamines.\n  What is your sense of the kinds of services we would see go by the \nboards if this program is not sustained?\n  Mr. SMITH. Well, Senator, I have spoken to it at the beginning, in \nthe middle, and at the end of this, the kinds of things you are asking, \nthe kinds of services that will be jeopardized or the kinds of services \nevery American citizen expects local communities to provide. Most \ncommunities provide them through property taxes, local levies of some \nkind that keep our teachers, our policemen, our roads paved, health \nservices, and more. These are the kinds of things which are the \ncornerstone of what we would call ``civilization'' in rural places.\n  It is that and more. We could go looking at program after program \nthat, if the Federal Government welches on its bargain, are the kinds \nof services that will be lost to Oregon because Oregon is over half \nowned by the Federal Government. It is real simple. Time is up, and the \ndeal needs to be kept.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Continuing through the Chair, Mr. President, isn't it \ncorrect, I\n\n[[Page S1840]]\n\nask my colleague, that members of our delegation, of both political \nparties, have suggested alternatives for funding this program? For \nexample, our whole delegation to a person was very troubled about this \nidea of selling off our treasures because not only was that not morally \nright, clearly it would have no prospect whatever of passing in the \nSenate. So I know our colleague in the other body who represents the \neastern part of our State had some good ideas, and our colleague in the \nother body from southwestern Oregon had some good ideas. It seems to \nme--and I think it would be helpful if you could bring the Senate up to \ndate--that both Democrats and Republicans have been trying to work in \ngood faith for ideas that would responsibly fund this program. I think \nit would be helpful to have my colleague's reaction on that.\n  Mr. SMITH. The Senator is exactly right. There has been virtually \nnothing taken off the table. The administration made a proposal for \nfunding this that had difficulties with our delegation, in selling off \npublic lands or other forest land. To me, the offset ought to be the \nword of the United States, and ultimately the funding source is really \nthe American Treasury because the American Treasury gains so much from \nOregon, owns over half of Oregon, and contributes 7 percent to its \nlocal governments. So you are absolutely right. There have been many \nsuggestions made. I have supported virtually all of them to try to \nbreak through this logjam that we find in Congress. It has been a labor \nof the greatest frustration for this Senator, and I know for you.\n  Now we have traded sides as to who is in the majority and who is in \nthe minority. My recourse in the minority is to do what I am doing, and \nthat is to look for every opportunity I can to speak for Oregon, to \nslow down the Federal Government if necessary to get the Federal \nGovernment to understand its obligation.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, one last question, if I might, for my \ncolleague. I appreciate his point with respect to the alternatives \nbecause the administration offered a proposal, a selloff of national \ntreasures. I and others thought that was wrong. We went to work. Our \ncolleagues came up with alternatives. Senator Baucus and I found an \nexample in an area where Government contractors were not paying taxes \nin a prompt way. There were questions about whether it made sense, at \nleast in the administration. Then they went off and took the revenues.\n  I think your point about how Democrats and Republicans have brought \nalternatives with respect to how to pay for this program in the \nCongress is an important one.\n  The last one I would like to have you lay out for the Senate is that \nI want Senators to know that this is not some exercise on our part, in \nterms of just plucking an arbitrary figure out of the air and saying: \nBy God, this is the money that we want for our State. As I understand \nthe presentation of the Senator, you are trying to lay out the history.\n  Mr. SMITH. I am.\n  Mr. WYDEN. The history goes back to the beginning of the last \ncentury, essentially. Because the Federal Government owns more than \nhalf of our land, we historically received payments for essential \nservices--schools, police and the like--that were based on timber \nreceipts. Now that the environmental laws have changed, those funds are \nnot there.\n  So, as I understand it, the presentation that my colleague is making \ntoday is based on the idea that this is not about Oregon's seeking some \nkind of arbitrary figure that we basically would like to offer up as \nkind of a wish list or to try to get through because we will try to \nbull it through, but that it is really based on history. It is based on \na historical formula that stems from the fact that the Federal \nGovernment owns most of the land. Is that essentially the kind of \nhistorical viewpoint that my colleague is trying to bring to the \nSenate?\n  Mr. SMITH. Absolutely. I will be making it several more times in this \npresentation--5 hours condensed into an hour and a half, I suppose. But \nwhen you and Senator Craig first cut the deal--and I was an original \ncosponsor with you--you had to have a basis for the money, the formula \nfor distributing it. You all wisely came up with what is the historical \ntimber harvest on Federal lands. That made sense. It makes logical \nsense. It is defensible. Now some of our neighboring Senators don't \nlike that deal anymore. They want to change that. They would like to \nignore that history, but that is the basis of the formula for these \nsecure county schools payments. It is literally replacing the money \nlost from the way Oregon historically operated in collaboration with \nthe Federal Government. The terms were changed. The terms were changed \nin the 1990s.\n  There is a cost to not harvesting timber. The rest of the country \nwants us not to harvest timber, but there is a cost to not doing that, \nand the cost is borne by humans, by local governments. I think it is a \ndastardly thing on the Federal Government's part to walk away from this \nnow, for it to change the terms and not care for the people impacted by \nthat.\n  Mr. WYDEN. One last question, if I might, Mr. President. Also, let me \nalso tell the Senate we are very pleased that the Senator from Vermont \nhas joined the Energy and Natural Resources Committee. He is going to \nhear us talking an awful lot in the committee about the county payments \nlegislation, but I just want to say tonight in the Senate I am very \npleased the Senator from Vermont has come to the Senate, and we are \nglad to have him on the committee.\n  The last question I would pose to my colleague deals, again, with the \nurgency of all of this, so the Senate is clear on this. I think there \nis always a sense that sometimes you come to the floor and there is a \nlittle bit of an alarmist kind of approach.\n  My understanding is in our home State, from county officials, there \nare pink slips going out now. There are budgets that are being made now \nthat are going to be very hard to alter. I appreciate my colleague's \npresentation over the last bit, and I enjoyed the earlier one as well, \nand I felt it was an important presentation.\n  What exactly is taking place? So the Senate is up on this in terms of \ncounty budgets, layoff notices, and the kind of pain--that is what this \nis really all about, the pain we are seeing working families and \ncitizens going through--what exactly is taking place as these budget \nchoices are being made?\n  Mr. SMITH. The Senator is exactly right in his description of the \nlocal pain and the bewilderment of many public employees who work in \nthe counties and need to make mortgage payments, want their kids \neducated, and would like their neighborhoods kept safe. They are \ngetting pink slips as we speak.\n  This act expired in September of last year. The money runs out in \nJune. The last two vehicles you and I have to fix this is the CR or the \nemergency supplemental. My good friend, my senior colleague, is doing \nexactly what I was doing when I was in the majority, and that is \nmeeting with chairmen, meeting with the leader, describing the \nintensity of the problem and the moral importance of this for the \nFederal Government to keep its word. It was an experience in great \nfrustration.\n  Now I am in the minority, and I am left to stall, throw wrenches in \nthe works, make the moral case. I will continue to do that. You and I, \nas we have done since our earliest days in the Senate, will work in \ntandem because, when it comes to Oregon's interests, between Senator \nWyden and myself, politics stop at the State border. This is a perfect \nexample of it. We have two shots.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I thank my colleague for his presentation. I hope the \nentire Senate followed this discussion--that our whole country does.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SMITH. In 1976, shortly after the Endangered Species Act became \nlaw, an Oregon State graduate student named Eric Forsman published a \nmaster's thesis.\n  It surmised that the spotted owls of Oregon were ``declining as a \nresult of habitat loss.'' The study caused a sensation among the \nenvironmental community, which was looking for an Endangered Species \ntest case.\n  By 1988, the environmental activists had defined their battle--to \npreserve, ``old growth forests.'' In their own words, these activists \nneeded a ``surrogate'' species--one that lived in and needed old growth \nfor its habitat. At a law clinic in 1988, one activist stated:\n\n       Thanks to the work of Walt Disney, and Bambi and his \n     friends . . . wildlife enjoys substantive statutory \n     protection. While the northern spotted owl is the wildlife \n     species\n\n[[Page S1841]]\n\n     of choice to act as the surrogate for old growth protection, \n     and I've often thought ``thank goodness the spotted owl \n     evolved in the Northwest, for if it hadn't we'd have to \n     genetically engineer it.'' It's a perfect species for use as \n     a surrogate. First of all, it is unique to old growth \n     forests. And there's no credible scientific dispute on that \n     fact. Second of all, it uses a lot of old growth. That's \n     convenient because we can use it to protect a lot of old \n     growth.\n\n  And ``convenient'' it was to those seeking to end timber harvest in \nOregon. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service was forced to \nreview the status of the spotted owl in 1982 and again in 1987.\n  In both instances it found that a listing under the Endangered \nSpecies Act was not warranted. In 1986, an Audubon Society report \nstated that the spotted owl population was teetering toward the \ndoomsday number of 1500 pairs.\n  Further reviews by the Fish and Wildlife Service in 1989 and 1990 \nproposed that it should be listed as threatened throughout its range--\nnorthern California, Oregon and Washington.\n  By 1989, environmental litigants had secured a court injunction on \nBLM timber sales near spotted owl sites. My predecessor, Senator Mark \nHatfield, and Senator Brock Adams of Washington intervened that same \nyear.\n  They passed what was called the ``Northwest Compromise''--also known \nas the ``section 318 rider.'' This rider required the BLM and Forest \nService to map out ecologically significant old growth stands for \ninterim protection, while insulating federal timber sales outside those \nareas from litigation challenges.\n  I would like to read from a floor statement Senator Hatfield gave \nthat year:\n\n       For those who like to isolate themselves in a little cocoon \n     and talk about theoretical and esoteric subjects, let us not \n     forget we are talking about human problems. That leads back \n     to a common denominator which is the adequacy or inadequacy \n     to house human beings. There may come a time when we will \n     have to opt for a choice between an owl and a human being, \n     but let me tell you in this proposal today we do not have to \n     make that choice.\n       We have opted to continue studying the owl as a threatened \n     species, and there is nothing in this report that in any way \n     impinges upon the Endangered Species Act. But at the same \n     time we are sensitive to human need. In my 30 years as a \n     governor and Senator, I have often found myself in the eye of \n     the storm when I have been accused by some of trying to \n     preserve too much of our natural resources for posterity, \n     including seashores, including the Columbia River Gorge, \n     including wild and scenic rivers and including wilderness.\n       On the other hand, I often find myself in the eye of the \n     storm from those representing the environmental community who \n     think somehow we have sacrificed the spotted owl for timber \n     production.\n       Mr. President, the facts will not bear that out. I think \n     sometimes that striking the balance is the most impossible \n     political stance to take. It is far easier to line up with \n     one side or the other. To try to strike a balance in anyone \n     of these controversial areas, particularly as it represents \n     economic and human need on one side and they need to preserve \n     unique areas of our God-created Earth on the other, is very \n     difficult. I fear that too often we are adopting the single-\n     issue mentality that bubbles up to the top in many of these \n     groups today.\n       When you subscribe to that single-issue mentality, it is \n     not what you have done in the past or what you are trying to \n     do for the future; it is how you cross the t's and dot the \n     i's today, and it is a dogmatic mind that is very difficult \n     to try to find any kind of accommodation. Thank goodness, I \n     think that the minds of balance and the minds of many of \n     these people in both groups prevailed and made this \n     compromise possible.\n       So I want to say, Mr. President, we have made great \n     movement in trying to accommodate those from the \n     environmental community who have raised legitimate issues and \n     concerns.\n       Unfortunately, according to many of the statements coming \n     out of that community, it is not enough. On the other hand, \n     when I face in my State 70 communities that are totally \n     dependent on a 1- or 2-mill economy, I can say this: I look \n     forward not with anything but anxiety and concern that we are \n     going to see some of those communities so deeply impacted \n     that I may have to repeat an experience I had in Valsetz, OR.\n       On that occasion I gave the last high school commencement. \n     Instead of the usual smiles and laughter at such an event, \n     there were tears and sadness in the faces of the members of \n     that small timber-dependent community whose mill had recently \n     closed. In 2 weeks the bulldozers came in, and today there is \n     not a sign left of community life because we are now finding \n     the underbrush taking over.\n       We face that reality in our State. It is awfully easy for \n     people from other States to say, oh, well we have to do this \n     and that. But I have to concern myself with representing the \n     people who have to put bread on the table of their children, \n     and to cut it off abruptly, without any consideration for the \n     human needs, to me, is cruelty.\n       If we want to reduce our timber sales level by half, all \n     right. But let us have a prospective goal, and give time to \n     re-train those employees, give time to readjust those \n     communities, give time to those human needs, but to do it as \n     proposed by various members of the environmental community is \n     to do it without human concern.\n\n  Following Senator Hatfield's action in the Senate, the House \nAgriculture Committee ordered the creation of a team of scientists--\nforest experts--to analyze and report on the management of old growth \nforests within the range of the spotted owl.\n  This group came to be known as the ``Gang of Four.'' Their report \nfound that the amount and distribution of old growth forests in the \nPacific Northwest was insufficient to support both current timber \nharvest level and the viability of the spotted owl.\n  The Gang of Four presented 14 management alternatives, from the \nstatus quo to massive set asides of old growth reserves.\n  Congress considered many of these alternatives, but acted on none of \nthem.\n  In 1990, the hammer finally fell. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service \nformally listed the northern spotted owl as ``threatened'' under the \nEndangered Species Act.\n  A federal court soon ordered the agency to declare critical habitat \nfor the spotted owl in western Oregon and Washington and northern \nCalifornia. A spotted owl recovery team was appointed in 1992.\n  The year that the spotted owl was listed, 1990, Time Magazine ran \nthis cover story.\n  It read:\n\n                           Who Gives a Hoot?\n\n       The timber industry says that saving this spotted owl will \n     cost 30,000 jobs. It isn't that simple.\n  When this story ran, the Senator from Tennessee, Mr. Gore, came to \nthis floor to with the magazine in hand.\n  The distinguished Senator stated:\n\n       Why would Time magazine do a cover story on the spotted \n     owl, to say it is not that simple? Because the issue has been \n     misunderstood, and it is not that simple.\n\n  Well, Senator Gore and Time Magazine were right. The battle between \nloggers and owls wasn't that simple. The economic fallout under the \nforthcoming Clinton-Gore administration would be far worse. And despite \ndraconian federal actions, the owl would not be saved.\n  Following the ESA listing of the spotted owl, biologists and \nforesters within the federal government began their own war with each \nother. With critical habitat in place, the Fish and Wildlife Service \nwarned the BLM that its planned timber sales would jeopardize the \nsurvival of the spotted owl.\n  In October 1991, Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan convened the \nEndangered Species Committee--also known as the ``God Squad.'' The God \nSquad consisted of three cabinet-level appointees and one \nrepresentative from the State of Oregon. They convened a month of \nevidentiary hearings in Portland, OR with 97 witnesses.\n  The God Squad decided to exempt several of the BLM's timber sales \nfrom ESA guidelines, while also requiring the agency to implement the \ndraft spotted owl recovery plan in other areas.\n  Without a final recovery plan, however, litigants seized the \nopportunity to shut down the remaining timber sales. Blanket \ninjunctions were issued by Federal courts in 1991 and 1992, finally \nbringing western Oregon's Federal timber program to a complete \ndeadfall.\n  This chart shows timber harvest on each of Oregon's thirteen National \nForests. The Willamette National Forest alone was producing nearly a \nbillion board feet of timber a year. By 1992, it was in a free-fall to \nnear zero, where it remains today.\n  Think of the economy. think of the human consequences. But maybe we \nsaved the owl. We will get to that.\n  Enter the presidential campaign between George Herbert Walker Bush \nand the Governor of Arkansas, Bill Clinton. Both candidates made \nnumerous visits to the Pacific Northwest. Bush lamented to loggers the \nsituation that had unfurled on his watch. Clinton promised labor unions \nthat he would convene a ``forest summit'' to resolve the problem and \nend the gridlock.\n  In April 1993, President Bill Clinton did just that--at least insofar \nas the ``summit.'' In Portland, OR the president convened his Vice-\nPresident, Al\n\n[[Page S1842]]\n\nGore, along with the Secretaries of Agriculture, Interior, Labor, and \nCommerce, plus the EPA Administrator, the Deputy Director of the Office \nof Management and Budget, and his Science and Technology Advisor.\n  At the conclusion of the eight-hour, televised summit, President \nClinton announced a 60-day deadline by which his Cabinet would craft a \nplan to break the Pacific Northwest's forest impasse.\n  He said that his goal was to develop a policy based on principles \nthat would\n\n       Produce a predictable and sustainable level of timber sales \n     that will not degrade or destroy our forest environment.\n\n  That plan would come to be known as the ``Northwest Forest Plan.'' It \ncalled for the set aside of 88 percent of federal forests within the \nrange of the spotted owl. The ``predictable and sustainable'' level of \ntimber would come from the remaining 12 percent of the landscape. This \namounted to 1.1 billion board feet a year--a 78 percent reduction from \nhistoric levels. But it was more than zero, which is what we had. So we \nwere happy. We would get 1.1, even though there used to be 8 billion.\n  In all honesty, both trenches in the timber war shirked at the \nNorthwest Forest Plan. The timber industry did not want to codify such \na dramatic drop in federal timber sales.\n  Environmentalists objected to the fact that the Plan explicitly \nrelied on some old growth harvest to meet its volume prediction.\n  Nonetheless, the Northwest Forest Plan--and its equivalent in eastern \nOregon, the Interior Columbia Basin Ecosystem Management Project--\nbecame the law of the land, without a single vote in Congress. The Plan \nwas implemented through administrative rulemaking and blessed by \nfederal judges.\n  Nonetheless, federal timber sales remained gridlocked in court. \nHarvest levels were still dropping. Mills were still closing. \nUnemployment lines were still growing. Oregon was no better off.\n  The year Oregon cast its electoral ballots for Bill Clinton a second \ntime, in 1996, it also elected to send me to the United States Senate.\n  Holding the Clinton Administration to its own promise to Oregon was a \nprimary directive from my constituents. And I did what I could.\n  I pleaded with Clinton Administration officials to fully fund its own \nNorthwest Forest Plan. It never did.\n  I fought off efforts in this chamber to slash funding from the \nfederal timber sale program. And the Senate never did.\n  The time between 1996 and 2000 was a grueling and frustrating fight. \nWhile the president lamented the poverty in Appalachia, his \nadministration was creating it in Oregon.\n  It became obvious very quickly that the promise of the Clinton \nNorthwest Forest Plan was a ruse--sabotaged by its own architects at \nevery political turn.\n  When George W. Bush took office in 2001, he agreed to make good on \nBill Clinton's 1993 commitment. His administration has tried to fix the \nNorthwest Forest Plan, to fund it and to implement it.\n  Unfortunately, the current president's efforts have been stifled by \nfederal courts.\n  Northwest Forest Plan timber harvest under President Bush has been \nconsistently lower than under President Clinton. And it has never risen \nabove 30 percent of what Bill Clinton promised Oregon 13 years ago.\n  These are the legal and political facts of the case. Let me take a \nmoment to describe the human, social and economic casualties of the \ntimber war.\n  Between 1989 and 2003, 213 lumber mills in Oregon were closed, some \npermanently.

These mill closures manifest themselves in the most horrific \nhuman ways. It is more than just loss of logging and truck driving jobs \nand destroyed communities in places I have mentioned. Thirty-five \nthousand Oregonians in the forest products industry lost their jobs in \nthe 1990s--35,000. I remember those dark days. The year the Federal \ncourts shut down the woods, I was elected as State Senator from \nPendleton, OR. At the time there was talk that Oregon had to move on \nfrom the boom-and-bust cycle of Federal timber sales. There was talk \nthat we could swap out jobs in the Douglas fir forests for ones in the \nsilicon forest.\n\n  Such talk seems so hollow now. But of the 35,000 Oregonians who lost \ntheir jobs in the woods and in the lumber mills, nearly half of them \nnever found work again in our State. They either moved to another \nState, retired or remained chronically unemployed. Those who did find \nother work ended up with lower wages than they earned a decade before. \nMr. President, 450 workers out of 35,000, just 1 percent, joined the \nhigh-tech industry.\n  Not surprisingly, high unemployment in Oregon led to higher hunger \nrates. Between 1999 and 2001 Oregon had the Nation's highest incidence \nof hunger. Now my State faces a new epidemic, that of methamphetamine.\n  But we might ask, how is the owl doing? The answer may surprise you. \nIt infuriates me.\n  The spotted owl has become one of the most intensely studied species \non earth. Ten years of research and more than 1,000 published studies \ndetail the threats to its survival, but none is conclusive.\n  Most recently, in 2004, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service reviewed \nthe status of the northern spotted owl. It did so at the request not of \nenvironmentalists, but the timber industry--who wanted to know if the \nshut-down of the forests had actually worked.\n  The status review introduced a new antagonist to the saga. Not the \nlogger, but another owl. The barred owl is not native to the Pacific \nNorthwest. It is larger, more aggressive, more successful in predation \nand reproduces faster than the spotted owl.\n  No one knows for sure how the barred owl made its way to the \nNorthwest from the east coast. Some biologists believe that, \nironically, the growth and planting of trees across the Great Plains \ncreated a ``tree bridge'' for the barred owl to traverse the nation and \ninto spotted owl habitat.\n  The Fish and Wildlife Service report found, quote:\n\n       Barred owls react more aggressively towards northern \n     spotted owls than the reverse. There are also a few instances \n     of barred owl aggression and predation on northern spotted \n     owls. The information collected to date indicates that \n     encounters between these two species tend to be agonistic in \n     nature, and that the outcome is unlikely to favor the \n     northern spotted owl. Given this relationship, barred owls \n     may be able to displace or preempt northern spotted owls from \n     territories. Further, use of more diverse habitat types and \n     prey, may confer some competitive advantage to barred owls \n     over northern spotted owls with respect to reproductive \n     output.\n\n  The report cited empirical evidence that barred owls were killing the \nspotted owl. Here is a biologist's account of one such incident:\n\n       On 11 May 1997 at approximately 14:30 Leskiw found a \n     freshly (blood fresh and wet) killed Spotted Owl along a \n     trail in Redwood National Park, Humboldt County, California. \n     Two sets of feathers were found within 60 meters of the body. \n     The owl was decapitated, but the head could not be located. \n     Additionally, what appeared to be several Spotted Owl \n     feathers were seen in a tree 4 meters above the ground. \n     Finally, the ground litter was disturbed in a 2 meter radius \n     around the carcass, suggesting a struggle had occurred. \n     Leskiw left the area and returned at approximately 15:30. \n     When he returned to the kill site at 15:45, a Barred Owl \n     spontaneously hooted nearby. . . . Gutierrez necropsied the \n     Spotted Owl. The bird's head had been removed by \n     disarticulation of the cervical vertebrae. The muscle from \n     the left side of the bird's breast, side, and wing were \n     eaten. These lines of circumstantial evidence combine to \n     suggest that a Barred Owl indeed killed and partially \n     consumed this Spotted Owl.\n\n  One writer put the relationship between barred and spotted owl more \neloquently. She wrote:\n\n       A new twist emerges in the turf war over Pacific Northwest \n     forests as a new adversary invades the remaining haunts of \n     the threatened spotted owl.\n       Just before dawn, a chill fog drifts through the old-growth \n     redwoods of northwestern California. A group of birders \n     breathe out puffs of steam as they listen to the growing \n     chorus of morning birdsong. Then the gentle sounds of \n     kinglets and thrushes are buried under a torrent of avian \n     rock 'n' roll as the wild, intense hoots of a barred owl ring \n     out.\n       It is one of the first recorded sightings of this species \n     in this part of California. A couple of months later an \n     agitated barred owl will be found perched near the body of a \n     freshly killed spotted owl in Redwood National Park, near the \n     Oregon border, feathers of his presumed victim stuck in his \n     talons. The latest turf war in the Pacific Northwest has \n     reached redwood country.\n       Dark-eyed woodland species, the barred owl and spotted owl \n     are cousins that look so similar that novice birders have \n     trouble telling them apart. Until recently, the two birds \n     never met. The barred owl haunted forests east of the Great \n     Plains, while the spotted owl lived only in old conifer \n     forests of the Pacific Northwest. Now the barred owl is on \n     the move--and it is moving in on the threatened spotted owl.\n\n  Eric Forsman, the Oregon State University masters student who wrote \nthe first major opus on the decline of the spotted owl in 1976, is now \na biologist for the Forest Service and a leading researcher of the \nbarred owl. He recently commented:\n\n       For the last thirty years we've been trying to come up with \n     ways of protecting the spotted owl, and now all of a sudden, \n     this huge monkey wrench gets thrown into the works. In the \n     past, we could assume that what we were seeing in terms of \n     habitat would help us to understand what was happening with \n     the spotted owl. Now we don't know if spotted owls aren't \n     there because there is no habitat for them or because of the \n     barred owls.\n\n  A spokesperson for the Audubon Society, which led the charge to set \naside spotted owl habitat in the 1980s and 90s, reacted to news of the \nbarred owl by simply stating: ``We are ambivalent.''\n  Biologists, too, are perplexed over another question: why more old \ngrowth forest has resulted in fewer spotted owls.\n  A ten year review of the Clinton Northwest Forest Plan found that \nthere are 600,000 more acres of old\n\n[[Page S1845]]\n\ngrowth in western Oregon and Washington than there was a decade ago.\n  However, the sharpest decline in spotted owl populations actually \noccurred where the least amount of federal timber harvest took place \nnamely the Olympic Peninsula of Washington State. This is also the \nlocation of the greatest number of barred owls.\n  The spotted owl actually increased its population in southern \nOregon--where the most federal harvest activity took place, and had the \nsmallest incidence of barred owl invasion.\n  One thing is for certain--the future of the spotted owl is not only \naffected by the teeth of chainsaws, but in the bloody talon of the \nbarred owl.\n  And there is a third twist. Forest fires are decimating spotted owl \nhabitat. Over 100,000 acres of spotted owl habitat was severely burned \nover the last 10 years. Now, we don't clear-cut for human use, we just \nburn it all in wildfires.\n  This is the Biscuit Fire, the largest fire in Oregon's history, the \nmost expensive to fight in Forest Service history, costing in excess of \n$150 million. Shoot, folks, with $150 million we could take care of all \nthe problems I am talking about with Oregon counties. The Biscuit Fire \nincinerated 65,000 acres of the spotted owl habitat as seen in this \npicture. This is more than four times the amount affected by timber \nsales in the 50 years preceding the fire. One notable difference is \nthat areas harvested were replanted.\n  So after 15 years of not logging old growth, growing new growth, and \nburning ``protected'' old growth, the Federal Government doesn't know \nwhat to do for the spotted owl. After 15 years since its listing under \nthe ESA, the Federal Government does not even have a recovery plan for \nthe spotted owl. And now we are hearing from the Federal Government it \ndoesn't have much of a plan for the people whose lives were ruined.\n  As I stand here today, it is also clear that the Federal Government \ndoesn't know what to do with these communities in the wake of its \nfailed management decisions.\n  Let me also mention a fourth impact. This should be of particular \ninterest to those Members concerned about the outsourcing of U.S. jobs \nand industries to other countries. As wood production fell on the \nFederal timberlands, it was replaced--board foot by board foot--by the \nCanadian Government in its ``Crown Lands.'' Does anyone think the \nspotted owl knows the difference between the United States and Canadian \nborders? I don't think they know. But what we are doing now is not \nharvesting our land. What we are doing now is burning our land, and the \nCanadians are overcutting their lands.\n  This trend is mirrored in reverse by the blue line on this chart, \nshowing Canadian lumber imports into this country.\n  The green and blue lines diverge in 1990--the years the spotted owl \nwas listed as threatened. The flood of Canadian imports met the ever-\ngrowing U.S. demand for lumber.\n  So instead of milling our lumber, harvested from our own forests, \nwith our own environmental laws, we are exporting the impact and the \njobs to other countries--other countries with fewer environmental \nprotections and where forests regenerate more slowly.\n  For a further example of the outsourcing of our lumber industry, go \nto Hurricane Katrina in 2005. With western timber locked up in court, \nsouthern timber blown down in the storm, the administration actually \nfloated the idea of lowering tariffs on foreign imported lumber for the \nKatrina rebuilding effort.\n  Needless to say, that concept did not move far. Plenty of lumber was \nreproduced for the reconstruction. Much of it was salvaged, probably \nfrom Mississippi and Louisiana.\n  The point here is that actions have consequences. If the United \nStates wants to consume wood, and it should, then it needs to recognize \nwhere wood comes from. But if Americans don't want wood to come from \nAmerican forests, harvested under the strictest environmental \nguidelines in the world, then let's face that reality. But the reality \nhas consequences.\n  I wonder if I can ask for an additional 15 minutes and that will be \nall I will require.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SMITH. I thank the Senator from Vermont for listening to me. I \nhave detailed for you the dramatic story of the Federal timber in \nOregon that serves as the backdrop for the issue at hand.\n  Beginning in the late 1980s, timber sales received the primary \nfunding source for the 25 Percent Fund and began a precipitous decline \nfor the reasons I have explained earlier. This plunge in receipts \nintensified and then bottomed out at a much lower level in the 1990s. \nThe decline in receipts impacted rural communities in the West, \nparticularly communities in Washington, Oregon, northern California, \nand Idaho.\n  For example, in fiscal year 1995, national forest revenues were $557 \nmillion, only 36 percent of fiscal year 1989 peak revenues of $1.531 \nbillion. In fiscal year 2004 national forest revenues were $281 \nmillion. That is from ``billions'' to ``millions.''\n  Payments to many States under the 25 Percent Fund Act declined by an \naverage of 70 percent from 1986 through 1998. These are national \nfigures. Those in Oregon were far more severe, reflecting the drastic \nfall in the timber sales program.\n  The problem was compounded because 18 Oregon counties have different \nrevenue-sharing agreements with the Bureau of Land Management.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I ask the Senator to yield so I can do some \nhousekeeping.\n  Mr. SMITH. If I don't lose my place.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/12/senate-section/article/S1845-1", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1845]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      HONORING JOE AND DEE SPORTS\n\n Mr. ISAKSON.

These outstanding students, through \ntheir knowledge of the U.S. Constitution, won their statewide \ncompetition and earned the chance to come to our Nation's Capital and \ncompete at the national level.\n  While in Washington, the students will participate in a 3-day \nacademic\n\n[[Page S1846]]\n\ncompetition that simulates a congressional hearing in which they \n``testify'' before a panel of judges. Students demonstrate their \nknowledge and understanding of constitutional principles as they \nevaluate and defend positions on relevant historical and contemporary \nissues. Independent studies show that students in the We the People \nprogram display a greater political tolerance and commitment to the \nprinciples and values of the Constitution and Bill of Rights than do \nstudents using traditional textbooks and approaches. With many reports \nand surveys indicating the lack of civic knowledge and civic \nparticipation, I am pleased to support such a valuable program that is \nproducing an enlightened and engaged citizenry.\n  The names of these outstanding students from Highland High School \nare:\n  Aaron A, Adams, Allison J.

McCARTHY\n\n Mrs. Boxer. Mr. President, today I ask my colleagues to honor \nthe memory of one of California's great lawmakers and dedicated public \nservants, former California Lieutenant Governor and State Assembly \nSpeaker Leo T. McCarthy. Leo passed away in San Francisco on February \n5, 2007 at the age of 76. He leaves behind a legacy of commitment to \nCalifornia.\n  Leo was born in Auckland, New Zealand in 1930. When he was 3, his \nfamily moved to San Francisco's Mission District. Leo served in the \nKorean war, in the intelligence unit of the Strategic Air Command. He \nstudied history at the University of San Francisco, USF, before \nentering USF law school. Leo began his political career through work on \nvarious political campaigns during law school.\n  Leo was first elected to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors in \n1963, when at the age of 33, he became the youngest supervisor in San \nFrancisco history. One of his enduring legacies is the creation of the \nSan Francisco Human Rights Commission. He also protected San \nFrancisco's precious open spaces. During this time, he was appointed by \nthen Governor Edmund ``Pat'' Brown to the Commission on Aging, where he \ndemonstrated his devotion to aging issues which continued throughout \nhis career.\n  He was elected to the California State Assembly in 1968 and became \nthe powerful Speaker of the Assembly in 1974. He helped bring more \nopenness and efficiency to the legislature. He also promoted gay rights \nand coastal protection.\n  Leo served three terms as lieutenant governor from 1983-1995. As \nlieutenant Governor, he was active with the State Lands Commission and \npublic education through the University of California. Lieutenant \nGovernor McCarthy helped coordinate California's disaster relief \nefforts following the Loma Prieta earthquake. As a member of Congress, \nI was proud to work with Leo on this disaster relief effort. I am so \npleased that our paths crossed many times over the years on so many \nimportant issues.\n  Leo retired from politics in 1994. He helped establish the Leo T. \nMcCarthy Center for Public Service and the Common Good at USF in 2002. \nThe Center ``seeks to inspire and equip students for lives and careers \nof ethical public service and serving others.'' The Center speaks \nvolumes about Leo's lifelong commitment to open government and public \nservice.\n  Leo McCarthy was a highly respected and beloved political leader in \nCalifornia. My heart goes out to Leo's family and friends. He will be \nmissed by all who knew him.

January was the 41st month of uninterrupted job growth produced \nby this economy, in an expansion that has thus far added more than 7.4, \nmillion new jobs. Unemployment is low, inflation is moderate, and real \nwages are rising. Our economy is on the move and we can keep it that \nway continuing to pursue sound economic policy based on free-market \nprinciples.\n  Sound economic policy begins with low taxes. We should work together \nto spend the taxpayers' money wisely and to tackle unfunded liabilities \ninherent in entitlement programs such as Social Security, Medicare, and \nMedicaid. I have laid out a detailed plan in my budget to restrain \nspending, cut earmarks in half by the end of this session, and balance \nthe budget by 2012 without raising taxes. The tax relief of\n\n[[Page S1847]]\n\nthe past few years has been a ingredient in growing our economy, and it \nshould be made permanent.\n  Our growing economy is dynamic. The rise of new technologies, new \ncompetition, and new markets abroad is changing how we do business. We \nneed to take action in four key areas to keep America's economy \nflexible and dynamic.\n  First, we must break down barriers to trade so our workers can sell \nmore goods and services to the 95 percent of the world's customers who \nlive outside of our borders. Global trade talks like the Doha Round at \nthe World Trade Organization have the potential to level the playing \nfield so we can compete on fair terms in foreign markets, while helping \nlift millions of people out of poverty around the world.\n  The only way we can complete the Doha Round and make headway on other \ntrade agreements is to extend Trade Promotion Authority, which is set \nto expire on July 1st. This authority is essential to completing good \ntrade agreements. The Congress must renew it if we are to improve our \ncompetitiveness in the global economy.\n  Second, we must work to make private health insurance more affordable \nand to give patients more choices and control over their health care. \nOne of the most promising ways to do this is by reforming the tax code. \nWe must end the unfair bias against individuals who buy insurance on \ntheir own. I propose creating a standard deduction for every American \nwho buys health insurance, whether they get it through their jobs or on \ntheir own. In a changing economy, we need a health care system that is \nflexible and consumer-oriented. With this reform, more than 100 million \nAmericans who are now covered by employer-provided insurance will \nbenefit from lower tax bills. Those who now purchase health inurance on \ntheir own would save money on their taxes. Millions of others who now \nhave no health insurance at all would find basic private coverage \nwithin their reach. My proposal also taps the innovation of States in \nmaking basic, affordable insurance available to all by creating \nAffordable Choices grants to help ensure the poor and the sick have \naccess to private health insurance.\n  Third, we must continue to diversify our energy supply to benefit our \neconomy, national security, and environment. In my State of the Union \nMessage, I set an ambitious goal of reducing gasoline usage in the \nUnited States by 20 percent over the next 10 years. Meeting this goal \nwill require significant changes in supply and demand, but we should \nlet the market decide the best mix of technologies and fuels to most \nefficiently attain it. On the supply side, I propose a higher and \nreformed fuel standard that would include renewable and other \nalternative fuels. We should also allow environmentally friendly \nexploration of oil and natural gas. On the demand side, I propose \nenhancing Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards for cars and \nextending the current rule for light trucks, so that we can reduce the \namount of gasoline that our passenger vehicles consume, and do so in a \nmore efficient way.\n  Fourth, a strong and vibrant education system is vital to maintaining \nour Nation's competitive edge in the world and extending economic \nopportunity to every citizen here at home. Five years ago, we rose \nabove partisan differences to enact the No Child Left Behind Act, \npreserving local control, raising standards, holding schools \naccountable for results, and providing more choice. This year, we must \nreauthorize and strengthen this good law preserving its core \nprinciples.\n  Strong productivity growth underlies much of the good economic news \nfrom the past few years and the policies discussed above. Productivity \ngrowth helps to increase our standards of living and improve our \ninternational competitiveness. To maintain this progress, we must \npursue a variety pro-growth policies, including those contained in the \nAmerican Competitiveness Initiative and comprehensive immigration \nreform.\n  These and other issues are discussed in the 2007 Annual Report of the \nCouncil of Economic Advisers. The Council has prepared this Report to \nput into broader context the economic issues that underlie my \nAdministration's policy decisions. I commend it to you.\n                                                      George W.

A bill to improve Medicare beneficiary access by extending \nthe 60 percent compliance threshold used to determine whether a \nhospital or unit of a hospital is an inpatient rehabilitation facility \nunder the Medicare program; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, today I am introducing the \nPreserving Patient Access to Inpatient Rehabilitation Hospitals Act of \n2007 to make changes to a rule issued by the Centers for Medicare and \nMedicaid Services, CMS, which has restricted the ability of \nrehabilitation hospitals to provide critical care.\n  In my home State of Nebraska, Madonna Rehabilitation Hospital in \nLincoln is a nationally recognized premier rehabilitation facility \noffering specialized programs and services for those who have suffered \nbrain injuries, strokes, spinal cord injuries, and the latest care for \ncardiac, pulmonary, cancer, pain, and joint replacement patients. If \nthe CMS rule is not updated, Madonna and other facilities will not be \nable to continue to offer critical care to patients eager to restore \ntheir past health and physical function.\n  When CMS first looked at whether facilities would qualify as \ninpatient rehabilitation facilities, IRFs, a list of criteria were \ncreated to determine eligibility. The narrow criteria, generally \nreferred to as the ``75-percent rule,'' were first established in 1984, \nbut were never strictly enforced and ultimately suspended in 2002 due \nto inconsistencies in accurately determining medical necessity.\n  Since establishing strict enforcement of the 75-percent rule in 2004, \nfield data estimates that as many as 88,000 Medicare patients have been \ndenied critical IRF services. The rule will, by CMS's own estimate, \nshift thousands of patients both Medicare and non-Medicare into \nalternative care settings which may be inappropriate and inadequate. \nBipartisan Congressional efforts have repeatedly petitioned both the \nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services and CMS for cooperation in \naverting an escalation of the 75-percent threshold, which currently \nstands at 60 percent.\n  For cost-reporting periods beginning July 1, 2007, the compliance \nthreshold is scheduled to jump to 65 percent, with full 75-percent \nimplementation scheduled for July 2008. If legislative action is not \ntaken, IRFs will be forced to turn away more and more patients in order \nto operate as rehabilitation hospitals or units. By freezing the \ncompliance threshold at 60 percent and ending the inconsistent and \nunpredictable use of fiscal intermediaries' local coverage \ndeterminations, our efforts will ensure that patients across America \nwill continue to have access to the rehabilitative care they need.\n  I am pleased a bipartisan group of Senate Finance Committee; Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pension Committee; and Special Committee on Aging \nmembers have joined me in supporting this legislation. In addition, the \nAmerican Association of People with Disabilities, the American Academy \nof Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, the American Hospital \nAssociation, the American Medical Rehabilitation Providers Association, \nthe Federation of American Hospitals, and numerous other associations \nand advocacy groups have endorsed our bill. Just as I have heard from \npatients and medical providers who have experienced problems with the \n75-percent Rule, my colleagues and the members of these associations \nhave witnessed the devastating effect this rule is having on those who \nneed this type of critical care.\n  I urge my colleagues to join Senators Jim Bunning, Debbie Stabenow, \nOlympia Snowe, John Kerry, Susan Collins, Jack Reed, Hillary Clinton, \nRobert Menendez and me in supporting this important bill. My colleagues \nand I are determined to resolve this lingering problem and return \nmedical necessity decisions back into the hands of medical providers, \nwhile ensuring access to improved inpatient rehabilitation care. The \nPreserving Patient Access to Inpatient Rehabilitation Hospitals Act of \n2007 is a top priority, and I look forward to its passage this year.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. VOINOVICH (for himself, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Levin, and Mrs. \n        McCaskill):\n  S. 547. A bill to establish a Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security \nfor Management, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nwith my good friend and partner on the Oversight of Government \nManagement Subcommittee, Senator Akaka, to address the critical \nmanagement challenges facing the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). \nI am pleased to have Senators Levin and McCaskill as original \ncosponsors of this measure.\n  The legislation would elevate the role and responsibilities of the \ncurrent Under Secretary for Management of the Department to a Deputy \nSecretary of Homeland Security for Management. The language preserves \nthe authority of the Secretary and Deputy Secretary of DHS as the \nfirst-and second-highest ranking Department officials, respectively. \nThe individual appointed as the Deputy Secretary for Management would \nserve a five year term and be the third highest ranking official at the \nDepartment. A term would provide management continuity at the \nDepartment during times of leadership transition, such as following a \npresidential election.\n  The role and responsibilities of the Deputy Secretary for Management \nwould include serving as the Chief Management Officer and principal \nadvisor to the Secretary on the management of the Department. The \nDeputy Secretary for Management would also be responsible for strategic \nand annual performance planning, identification and tracking of \nperformance measures, as well as the integration and transformation \nprocess in support of homeland security operations and programs.\n  The division of labor between the Deputy Secretary and the new Deputy \nSecretary for Management will be similar to the leadership structure at \nthe Office of Management and Budget. The Deputy Secretary will continue \nto be the Secretary's first assistant on all policy matters, while the \nnewly created Deputy Secretary for Management will be the Secretary's \nprincipal advisor on the development of sustained, long-term management \nstrategies.\n  I offer this legislation today because of my belief that the existing \nUnder Secretary position lacks sufficient authority to direct the type \nof sustained leadership and overarching management integration and \ntransformation strategy that is needed department-wide.\n  There continue to be significant management challenges associated \nwith integrating the Department of Homeland Security, whose creation \nrepresented the single largest restructuring of the Federal Government \nsince the creation of the Department of Defense in 1947. In addition to \nits complex mission of securing the Nation from terrorism and natural \nhazards through protection, prevention, response, and recovery \nleadership of the Department of Homeland Security has the enormous task \nof unifying 180,000 employees from 22 disparate Federal agencies.\n  Since 2003, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) has included \nimplementing and transforming the Department of Homeland Security on \nits high-risk list of programs susceptible to waste, fraud, abuse, and \nmismanagement. In announcing its 2007 high-risk list, Comptroller \nGeneral Walker said that, ``The array of management and programmatic \nchallenges continues to limit DHS's ability to carry out its roles \nunder the National Homeland Security Strategy in an effective risk-\nbased way.''\n  Similarly, in December 2005, the DHS Inspector General issued a \nreport warning of major management challenges facing the Department of \nHomeland\n\n[[Page S1851]]\n\nSecurity. The report noted that although progress has been made since \nthe Department's inception, ``Integrating its many separate components \nin a single, effective, efficient, and economical Department remains \none of DHS' biggest challenges.''\n  The Department's own Performance and Accountability Report, released \nin November 2006, states that it did not meet its strategic goal of \n``providing comprehensive leadership and management to improve the \nefficiency and effectiveness of the Department,'' further underscoring \nthe need for good management.\n  The Homeland Security Advisory Council Culture Task Force Report, \npublished in January 2007, detailed persisting organizational \nchallenges within DHS, and prescribed leadership and management models \ndesigned to empower employees, foster collaboration, and encourage \ninnovation. The third recommendation of the report is that the \nDepartment establish an operational leadership position. The report \nnoted, ``Alignment and integration of the DHS component organizations \nis vital to the success of the DHS mission. The CTF believes there is a \ncompelling need for the creation of a Deputy Secretary for Operations \n(DSO) who would report to the Secretary and be responsible for the high \nlevel Department-wide measures aimed at generating and sustaining \nseamless operational integration and alignment of the component \norganizations.''\n  The creation of the Deputy Secretary for Management will help address \nthe concerns outlined by GAO, the DHS Inspector General, the Homeland \nSecurity Advisory Council, and the Department itself.\n  As former Chairman and now Ranking Member of the Oversight of \nGovernment Management Subcommittee, improving the management structure \nat the Department has been one of my top priorities. The Subcommittee's \nChairman, Senator Akaka, and I have been committed to ensuring that DHS \nhas the proper tools to make continual improvements in its operations. \nIt has become clear that the Department needs a stronger management \nfocus to enable programmatic and operational success. Congress must act \nto strengthen the management function at DHS.\n  During my long career in public service, including as a Mayor and \nGovernor, I have repeatedly observed that the path to organizational \nsuccess lies in adopting best practices in management, including \nstrategic planning, performance and accountability measures, and \neffectively leveraging human capital. When instituting reforms as Mayor \nand Governor, individuals tasked with implementation would tell me, \n``We don't have time for Total Quality Management; we are too busy \nputting out fires.'' I appreciate that DHS is also busy putting out \nfires. But the connection between good management practices and \noperational success should not be lost.\n  With the four year anniversary of the Department only weeks away, we \nmust be honest about the remaining management challenges it faces. The \nlegislation I offer today provides the focused, high-level attention \nthat will result in effective management reform. I believe this \nlegislation is vital to the Department's success. I urge my colleagues \nto join me in supporting this legislation.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I am extremely pleased to join with my good \nfriend, the senior Senator from Ohio, in reintroducing legislation \ntoday to establish a Deputy Secretary for Management who would be the \nchief management officer at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). \nI am especially pleased that we are joined by two of our colleagues on \nthe Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, Senator \nLevin, who is also the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, and \nSenator McCaskill.\n  The Department of Homeland Security continues to face serious \nchallenges, some of which stem from integrating 22 separate entities \nwith existing management problems into one agency. Such a broad, large-\nscale merger is why the Government Accountability Office (GAO) \ncontinues to place DHS on the GAO High-Risk List. Our bill would assign \noverall management responsibilities to one individual who would be \naccountable for leading and instituting change. A Deputy Secretary for \nManagement would provide the leadership necessary to move forward and \nsustain these needed changes. This presidentially appointed and Senate-\nconfirmed individual, who will have a term of office of five years, \nwould serve as a bridge between political appointees and career \nemployees. Changing agency culture is difficult and takes time. As \nComptroller General David Walker notes, successful transformation \ninitiatives in large private and public sector organizations can take \nat least five to seven years.\n  In addition to serving as chairman of Oversight of Government \nManagement Subcommittee, I am also the chairman of the Armed Services \nReadiness and Management Support Subcommittee, and I have witnessed \nfirsthand how the Department of Defense (DoD) continues to struggle \nwith business modernization despite clear congressional directives to \ndo so. We cannot afford to allow the Department of Homeland Security, \nwhich has an extremely complex and critical mission, to be affected by \nthe same management problems facing DoD. Our bill is born out of our \nconcern and frustration that DHS is not doing better. We believe \nelevating the Under Secretary for Management to the Deputy Secretary \nlevel will provide DHS the necessary tools needed to avoid making the \nsame mistakes as DoD. Having a single focus for key management \nfunctions, such as human capital, financial management, information \ntechnology, acquisition management, and performance management are \nessential if DHS is to avoid the stovepipe style of management at DoD.\n  A Deputy Secretary for Management would bring needed attention to \nmanagement issues and transformational change; would integrate various \nkey operational and transformation efforts; and would institutionalize \naccountability for addressing management issues and leading change. Our \nbill enhances, not diminishes, the ability of the Secretary and Deputy \nSecretary of DHS to focus on policy decisions while leaving the \nmanagement efforts to the Deputy Secretary for Management. It is good \nbusiness practice to have one individual responsible for integrating \nstrategic plans and overseeing change.\n  I would like to note that the Homeland Security Advisory Council, \nestablished to advise and make recommendations to the Secretary of the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, created a Culture Task Force (CTF) at \nthe request of Secretary Chertoff in June 2006. The CTF issued its \nrecommendations to the Secretary last month. The January 2007 Report of \nthe Homeland Security Culture Task Force recommends establishing an \noperational leadership position, ``who would report to the Secretary \nand be responsible for the high level Department-wide measures aimed at \ngenerating and sustaining operational integration and alignment of the \ncomponent organizations.''\n  Congress has a responsibility to ensure that agencies are instituting \nsound management practices that will empower agencies to spend taxpayer \ndollars more wisely while carrying out critical missions. A fully \naccountable chief management officer at DHS will make the difference by \nensuring strong leadership over essential government programs.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself, Mr. Bennett, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. Cardin, \n        Mr. Cochran, Mr. Coleman, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Domenici, \n        Mr. Durbin, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Kerry, Mr. \n        Lieberman, Mr. Sanders, Mr. Schumer, and Mr. Stevens):\n  S. 548, A bill amend the Internal Revenue code of 1986 to provide \nthat a deduction equal to fair market value shall be allowed for \ncharitable contributions of literary, musical, artistic, or scholarly \ncompositions created by the donor, to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today we reintroduce the ``Artist-Museum \nPartnership Act,'' and once again, I am pleased to be joined in this \neffort by Senator Bennett. This bipartisan legislation would enable our \ncountry to keep cherished art works in the United States and to \npreserve them in our public institutions. At the same time, this \nlegislation will erase an inequity in our tax code that currently \nserves as a disincentive for artists to donate their works to museums \nand libraries.\n\n[[Page S1852]]\n\nWe have introduced this same bill in each of the past four Congresses. \nIt was also included in the Senate-passed version of the 2001 tax \nreconciliation bill, the Senate-passed version of the 2003 Charity Aid, \nRecovery, and Empowerment (CARE) Act, and the Senate-passed version of \nthe 2005 tax reconciliation bill. I would like to thank Senators \nCantwell, Cardin, Cochran, Coleman, Conrad, Dodd, Domenici, Durbin, \nFeinstein, Kennedy, Kerry, Lieberman, Sanders, Schumer, and Stevens for \ncosponsoring this tri-partisan bill.\n  Our bill is sensible and straightforward. It would allow artists, \nwriters, and composers to take a tax deduction equal to the fair market \nvalue of the works they donate to museums and libraries. This is \nsomething that collectors who make similar donations are already able \nto do. Under current law, artists who donate self-created works are \nonly able to deduct the cost of supplies such as canvas, pen, paper and \nink, which does not even come close to their true value. This is unfair \nto artists, and it hurts museums and libraries--large and small--that \nare dedicated to preserving works for posterity. If we as a Nation want \nto ensure that works of art created by living artists are available to \nthe public in the future--for study and for pleasure--this is something \nthat artists should be allowed to do.\n  In my State of Vermont, we are incredibly proud of the great works \nproduced by hundreds of local artists who choose to live and work in \nthe Green Mountain State. Displaying their creations in museums and \nlibraries helps develop a sense of pride among Vermonters, and \nstrengthens a bond with Vermont, its landscape, its beauty, and its \ncultural heritage. Anyone who has contemplated a painting in a museum \nor examined an original manuscript or composition, and has gained a \ngreater understanding of both the artist and the subject as a result, \nknows the tremendous value of these works. I would like to see more of \nthem, not fewer, preserved in Vermont and across the country.\n  Prior to 1969, artists and collectors alike were able to take a \ndeduction equivalent to the fair market value of a work, but Congress \nchanged the law with respect to artists in the Tax Reform Act of 1969. \nSince then, fewer and fewer artists have donated their works to museums \nand cultural institutions. For example, prior to the enactment of the \n1969 law, Igor Stravinsky planned to donate his papers to the Music \nDivision of the Library of Congress. But after the law passed, his \npapers were sold instead to a private foundation in Switzerland. We can \nno longer afford this massive loss to our cultural heritage. Losses to \nthe public like this are an unintended consequence of the 1969 tax bill \nthat should be corrected.\n  Congress changed the law for artists more than 30 years ago in \nresponse to the perception that some taxpayers were taking advantage of \nthe law by inflating the market value of self-created works. Since that \ntime, however, the government has cut down significantly on the abuse \nof fair market value determinations.\n  Under our legislation, artists who donate their own paintings, \nmanuscripts, compositions, or scholarly compositions would be subject \nto the same new rules that all taxpayer/collectors who donate such \nworks must now follow. This includes providing relevant information as \nto the value of the gift, providing appraisals by qualified appraisers, \nand, in some cases, subjecting them to review by the Internal Revenue \nService's Art Advisory Panel.\n  In addition, donated works must be accepted by museums and libraries, \nwhich often have strict criteria in place for works they intend to \ndisplay. The institution must certify that it intends to put the work \nto a use that is related to the institution's tax exempt status. For \nexample, a painting contributed to an educational institution must be \nused by that organization for educational purposes and could not be \nsold by the institution for profit. Similarly, a work could not be \ndonated to a hospital or other charitable institution that did not \nintend to use the work in a manner related to the function constituting \nthe recipient's exemption under Section 501 of the tax code. Finally, \nthe fair market value of the work could only be deducted from the \nportion of the artist's income that has come from the sale of similar \nworks or related activities.\n  This bill would also correct another disparity in the tax treatment \nof self-created works--how the same work is treated before and after an \nartist's death. While living artists may only deduct the material costs \nof donations, donations of those same works after death are deductible \nfrom estate taxes at the fair market value of the work. In addition, \nwhen an artist dies, works that are part of his or her estate are taxed \non the fair market value.\n  I want to thank my colleagues again for cosponsoring this bipartisan \nlegislation. The time has come for us to correct an unintended \nconsequence of the 1969 law and encourage rather than discourage the \ndonations of art works by their creators. This bill will make a crucial \ndifference in an artist's decision to donate his or her work, rather \nthan sell it to a private party where it may become lost to the public \nforever.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 548\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to \npreserve the effectiveness of medically important antibiotics used in \nthe treatment of human and animal diseases; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to join Senator Snowe \nin introducing ``The Preservation of Antibiotics for Medical Treatment \nAct of 2007.'' I am also pleased that this year we are joined by \nSenator Sherrod Brown, who championed this legislation so ably as a \nmember of the House of Representatives.\n  Our goal in this important initiative is to take needed action to \npreserve the effectiveness of antibiotics in treating diseases. These \ndrugs are truly modern medical miracles. During World War II, the newly \ndeveloped ``wonder drug'' penicillin revolutionized care for our \nsoldiers wounded in battle. Since then, such drugs have become \nindispensable in modern medicine, protecting all of us from deadly \ninfections. They are even more valuable today, safeguarding the Nation \nfrom the threat of bioterrorism.\n  Unfortunately, in recent years, we have done too little to prevent \nthe emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria and other \ngerms, and many of our most powerful drugs are no longer effective.\n  Partly, the resistance is the result of over-prescribing such drugs \nin routine medical care. Mounting evidence shows that indiscriminate \nuse of such drugs in animal feed is also a major factor in the \ndevelopment of antibiotic resistant germs.\n  Obviously, if animals are sick, whether as pets or livestock, they \nshould be treated with the best veterinary medications available. That \nis not the problem. The problem is the widespread use of antibiotics to \npromote growth and fatten healthy livestock. Such nontherapeutic use \nclearly undermines the effectiveness of these important drugs, because \nit leads to greater development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria that \ncan make infections in humans difficult or impossible to treat.\n  In 1998--nine years ago--a report prepared at the request of the \nDepartment of Agriculture and the Food and Drug Administration by the \nNational Academy of Sciences, concluded: ``There is a link between the \nuse of antibiotics in food animals, the development of bacterial \nresistance to these drugs, and human disease.'' The World Health \nOrganization has specifically recommended that antibiotics used to \ntreat humans should not be used to promote animal growth, although they \ncould still be used to treat sick animals.\n  In 2001, a Federal interagency task force on antibiotic resistance \nconcluded that ``drug-resistant pathogens are a growing menace to all \npeople, regardless of age, gender, or socio-economic background. If we \ndo not act to address the problem . . . [d]rug choices for the \ntreatment of common infections will become increasingly limited and \nexpensive--and, in some cases, nonexistent.''\n  The Union of Concerned Scientists estimates that 70 percent of all \nU.S. antibiotics are used nontherapeutically in animal agriculture--8 \ntimes more than are used in all of human medicine. This indiscriminate \nuse clearly reduces their potency.\n  Major medical associations have been increasingly concerned, and have \ntaken strong stands against antibiotic use in animal agriculture. In \nJune 2001, the American Medical Association adopted a resolution \nopposing nontherapeutic use of antibiotics in animals. Other \nprofessional medical organizations that have taken similar stands \ninclude the American College of Preventive Medicine, the American \nPublic Health Association, and the Council of State and Territorial \nEpidemiologists. The legislation we are offering has been strongly \nendorsed by the American Public Health Association and numerous other \ngroups and independent experts in the field.\n  Ending the current detrimental practice is feasible and cost-\neffective. Last month an economic study by researchers at Johns Hopkins \nUniversity examined data from the poultry producer Perdue. In this \nstudy of 7 million chickens, the slight benefit from the nontherapeutic \nuse of antibiotics was more than offset by the cost of purchasing \nantibiotics.\n  In fact, most of the developed countries in the world, except for the \nUnited States and Canada, already restrict the use of antibiotics to \npromote growth in raising livestock. In 1999, the European Union banned \nsuch use, and funds saved on drugs have been invested in improving \nhygiene and animal husbandry practices. Researchers in Denmark found a \ndramatic decline in the number of drug-resistant organisms in animals--\nand no significant increase in animal diseases or consumer prices.\n  These results have encouraged clinicians and researchers to call for \na similar ban in the United States. The title of an editorial in the \nNew England Journal of Medicine 6 years ago said it all: \n``Antimicrobial Use in Animal Feed--Time to Stop.''\n  In the last Congress, over 350 organizations representing scientific \nand medical associations, consumer and environmental groups as well as \nanimal rights and religious groups endorsed this legislation and called \nfor an end to the reckless and irresponsible use of these critically \nimportant medicines.\n  The Nation is clearly at risk of an epidemic outbreak of food \npoisoning caused by drug-resistant bacteria or other germs. In recent \nyears, many nations, including the United States, have been plagued by \noutbreaks of food-borne illnesses. Imagine the consequences of an \noutbreak caused by a strain of bacteria immune to any drugs we have. It \nis time to put public safety first and stop this promiscuous use of \ndrugs essential for protecting human health.\n  The bill we are introducing will phase out the non-therapeutic use in \nlivestock of medically important antibiotics, unless manufacturers can \ndemonstrate that such use is no danger to public health. The Act \napplies this same strict standard to applications for approval of new \nanimal antibiotics. Such use is not restricted if the animals are sick, \nor if they are pets or are animals not used for food. In addition, FDA \nis also given authority to restrict the use of important drugs to treat \nsuch animals, if risk to humans is in question.\n  According to the National Academy of Sciences, eliminating the use of \nantibiotics as feed additives in agriculture will cost each American \nconsumer not more than five to ten dollars a year. The legislation \nrecognizes, however, that economic costs to farmers in making the \ntransition to antibiotic-free practices may be substantial. In such \ncases, the Act provides for Federal payments to defray the cost of \nshifting to antibiotic-free practices, with special preference for \nfamily farms.\n  Antibiotics are one of the great miracles of modem medicine. Yet \ntoday, we are destroying them faster than the pharmaceutical industry \ncan replace them with new discoveries. If doctors lose these vital \nmedications, the most vulnerable Americans will suffer the most--\nchildren, the elderly, persons with HIV/AIDS, and others who are most \nin danger of drug resistant infections. I urge my colleagues to support \nthis clearly needed legislation to protect the health of all Americans \nfrom the reckless and unjustified use of antibiotics.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today we face concerns about infectious \ndisease which few could have anticipated. Over a half century ago, \nfollowing the development of modem antibiotics, Nobel Laureate Sir \nMcFarland Burnet\n\n[[Page S1854]]\n\nsummed up what many experts believed when he stated, ``One can think of \nthe middle of the twentieth century as the end of one of the most \nimportant social revolutions in history, the virtual elimination of \ninfectious diseases as a significant factor in social life.''\n  How things have changed! Today we face grave concern about pandemic \ninfluenza, and in fact every day many of the most serious health \nthreats come from infectious diseases. When we consider the greatest \nkillers--HIV, tuberculosis, malaria--it is clear that infectious \ndiseases have not abated. At the same time we have seen an alarming \ntrend as existing antibiotics are becoming less effective in treating \ninfections. We know that resistance to drugs can be developed, and that \nthe more we expose bacteria to antibiotics, the more resistance we will \nsee. So it is critical to address preserving lifesaving antibiotic \ndrugs for use in treating disease.\n  Today over nine out of ten Americans understand that resistance to \nantibiotics is a problem. Most Americans have learned that that colds \nand flu are caused by viruses, and recognize that treating a cold with \nan antibiotic is inappropriate. Our health care providers are more \ncareful to discriminate when to use antibiotics, because they know that \nwhen a patient who has been inappropriately prescribed an antibiotic \nactually develops a bacterial infection, it is more likely to be \nresistant to treatment.\n  When we overuse antibiotics, we risk eliminating the very cures which \nscientists fought so hard to develop. The threat of bioterrorism \namplifies the danger. I have supported increased NIH research funding, \nas well as Bioshield legislation, in order to promote development of \nessential drugs, both to address natural and man-made threats. It is so \ncounterproductive to develop antimicrobial drugs and see their misuse \nrender them ineffective.\n  Yet every day in America antibiotics continue to be used in huge \nquantities for no treatment purpose whatsoever. I am speaking of the \nnon-therapeutic use of antibiotics in agriculture. Simply put, the \npractice of feeding antibiotics to healthy animals jeopardizes the \neffectiveness of these medicines in treating ill people and animals.\n  Recognizing the public health threat caused by antibiotic resistance, \nCongress in 2000 amended the Public Health Threats and Emergencies Act \nto curb antibiotic overuse in human medicine. Yet today, it is \nestimated that 70 percent of the antimicrobials used in the United \nStates are fed to farm animals for non-therapeutic purposes including \ngrowth promotion, poor management practices and crowded, unsanitary \nconditions.\n  In March 2003, the National Academies of Sciences stated that a \ndecrease in antimicrobial use in human medicine alone will not solve \nthe problem of drug resistance.\n  Substantial efforts must be made to decrease inappropriate overuse of \nantibiotics in animals and agriculture.\n  Two years ago five major medical and environmental groups--the \nAmerican Academy of Pediatrics, the American Public Health Association, \nEnvironmental Defense, the Food Animal Concerns Trust and the Union of \nConcerned Scientists--jointly filed a formal regulatory petition with \nthe U.S. Food and Drug Administration urging the agency to withdraw \napprovals for seven classes of antibiotics which are used as \nagricultural feed additives. They pointed out what we have known for \nyears--that antibiotics which are crucial to treating human disease \nshould never be used except for their intended purpose--to treat \ndisease.\n  In a study reported in the New England Journal of Medicine, \nresearchers at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found 17 \npercent of drug-resistant staph infections had no apparent links to \nhealth-care settings. Nearly one in five of these resistant infections \narose in the community--not in the health care setting. We must do more \nto address inappropriate antibiotic use in medicine, the use of these \ndrugs in our environment cannot be ignored.\n  This is why I have joined with Senator Kennedy in again introducing \nthe ``Preservation of Antibiotics for Medical Treatment Act''. This \nbill phases out the nontherapeutic uses of critical medically important \nantibiotics in livestock and poultry production, unless their \nmanufacturers can show that they pose no danger to public health.\n  Our legislation requires the Food and Drug Administration to withdraw \nthe approval for nontherapeutic agricultural use of antibiotics in \nfood-producing animals if the antibiotic is used for treating human \ndisease, unless the application is proven harmless within two years. \nThe same tough standard of safety will apply to new applications for \napproval of animal antibiotics.\n  This legislation places no unreasonable burden on producers. It does \nnot restrict the use of antibiotics to treat sick animals, or for that \nmatter to treat pets and other animals not used for food. The Act \nauthorizes Federal payments to small family farms to defray their \ncosts, and it also establishes research and demonstration programs that \nreduce the use of antibiotics in raising food-producing animals. The \nAct also requires data collection from manufacturers so that the types \nand amounts of antibiotics used in animals can be monitored.\n  As we are constantly reminded, the discovery and development of a new \ndrug can require great time and expense. It is simply common sense that \nwe preserve the use of the drugs which we already have, and use them \nappropriately. I call on my colleagues to support us in this effort.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA (for himself, Mr. Voinovich, and Mr. Lieberman):\n  S. 550. A bill to preserve existing judgeships on the Superior Court \nof the District of Columbia; to the Committee on Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce legislation that \nwould preserve existing seats on the District of Columbia Superior \nCourt. I am pleased that Senators Voinovich and Lieberman are joining \nme in this effort.\n  As my colleagues know, the Superior Court is the trial court of \ngeneral jurisdiction over local matters in the District of Columbia. \nWhen a vacancy on the court occurs, the District of Columbia Judicial \nNominations Commission solicits applicants to fill the vacancy and \nsends three names to the President. The President then selects one \ncandidate and sends the individual's nomination to the Senate for \nconfirmation. Existing law caps the total number of judges on the \nSuperior Court at 59.\n  However, the District of Columbia Family Court Act of 2001 created \nthree new seats for the Family Court, which is a division of the \nSuperior Court, but failed to increase the overall cap on the number of \njudges seated on the court. As a result, three existing seats in the \nother divisions of the court--including the criminal, civil, probate, \nand tax divisions--were effectively eliminated. Therefore, when \nvacancies in those divisions occur, new judges cannot be seated.\n  Ever since the Family Court Act became law, the Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs Committee and the Senate has been in the untenable \nposition of delaying the confirmation of judicial nominees when the cap \nhas been reached. The end result is that residents of DC will face \ndelay of justice due to a lack of judicial personnel.\n  The bill we introduce today would address this problem by amending \nthe DC Code to increase the cap on the number of associate judges on \nthe Superior Court. Similar legislation introduced by my good friend \nSenator Collins in both the 108th and 109th Sessions of Congress was \nfavorably reported by the Committee on Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs and passed by the Senate. I urge my colleagues to \nonce again support this important legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 550\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. COMPOSITION OF SUPERIOR COURT.\n\n       Section 903 of title 11 of the District of Columbia Code is \n     amended by striking ``fifty-eight'' and inserting ``61''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. MURKOWSKI (for herself and Mr. Stevens):\n\n[[Page S1855]]\n\n  S. 552. A bill to provide for the tax treatment of income received in \nconnection with the litigation concerning the Exxon Valdez oil spill \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a bill that will \nhelp the commercial fishermen and others whose livelihoods were \nnegatively impacted by the Exxon Valdez oil spill. I am pleased to have \nMr. Stevens join me in introducing this important legislation.\n  The Exxon Valdez ran aground on Bligh Reef on March 24, 1989, \nspilling 11 million gallons of oil into Prince William Sound in Alaska. \nA class action jury trial was held in Federal court in Anchorage, AK, \nin 1994. The plaintiffs included 32,000 fishermen among others whose \nlivelihoods were gravely affected by this disaster. The jury awarded $5 \nbillion in punitive damages to plaintiffs. The punitive damage award \nhas been on repeated appeal by the Exxon Corporation since 1994. Many \nof the original plaintiffs, possibly more than 1,000 people, have \nalready died.\n  Once the punitive damage award of the Exxon Valdez litigation is \nsettled, many fishermen will receive payments to reimburse them for \nfishing income lost due to the environmental consequences of the Exxon \nValdez oil spill. The eventual settlement could be as much as several \nbillion dollars.\n  My bill gives the affected fishermen, as well as other plaintiffs in \nthis case, a fair shake when it comes to contributions to retirement \nplans and averaging of income for tax purposes.\n  With respect to retirement plan contributions, my bill increases the \ncaps on both deductions and income for traditional IRAs to the extent \nof the income a plaintiff receives from the settlement or judgment. \nAlso, it allows the plaintiffs to make contributions to Roth IRAs and \nother retirement plans to the extent of the income received from the \nsettlement or judgment.\n  Fishermen are currently allowed to average their income over three \nyears due to the often inconsistent nature of the fishing business. The \nlitigation stemming from the Exxon Valdez oil spill poses an even more \nunique situation since fishermen and other plaintiffs have been waiting \nto receive lost income--in the form of a settlement or judgment--since \n1994. My bill allows plaintiffs to average their income for the period \nof time between December 31 of the year they receive the settlement or \njudgment payment and January 1, 1994--the year of the original jury \naward in Federal court.\n  It is imperative that we address this important issue to help those \naffected by the Exxon Valdez oil spill plan for their retirement.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 552\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Tax \n     Treatment Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. TAX TREATMENT OF INCOME RECEIVED IN CONNECTION WITH \n                   THE EXXON VALDEZ LITIGATION.\n\n       (a) Income Averaging of Amounts Received From the Exxon \n     Valdez Litigation.--\n       (1) In general.--At the election of a qualified taxpayer \n     who receives qualified settlement income during a taxable \n     year, the tax imposed by chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue \n     Code of 1986 for such taxable year shall be equal to the sum \n     of--\n       (A) the tax which would be imposed under such chapter if--\n       (i) no amount of elected qualified settlement income were \n     included in gross income for such year, and\n       (ii) no deduction were allowed for such year for expenses \n     (otherwise allowable as a deduction to the taxpayer for such \n     year) attributable to such elected qualified settlement \n     income, plus\n       (B) the increase in tax under such chapter which would \n     result if taxable income for each of the years in the \n     applicable period were increased by an amount equal to the \n     applicable fraction of the elected qualified settlement \n     income reduced by any expenses (otherwise allowable as a \n     deduction to the taxpayer) attributable to such elected \n     qualified settlement income.\n     Any adjustment under this section for any taxable year shall \n     be taken into account in applying this section for any \n     subsequent taxable year.\n       (2) Coordination with farm income averaging.--If a \n     qualified taxpayer makes an election with respect to any \n     qualified settlement income under paragraph (1) for any \n     taxable year, such taxpayer may not elect to treat such \n     amount as elected farm income under section 1301 of the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986.\n       (3) Definitions.--For purposes of this subsection--\n       (A) Applicable period.--The term ``applicable period'' \n     means the period beginning on January 1, 1994, and ending on \n     December 31 of the year in which the elected qualified \n     settlement income is received.\n       (B) Applicable fraction.--The term ``applicable fraction'' \n     means the fraction the numerator of which is one and the \n     denominator of which is the number of years in the applicable \n     period.\n       (C) Elected qualified settlement income.--The term \n     ``elected qualified settlement income'' means so much of the \n     taxable income for the taxable year which is--\n       (i) qualified settlement income, and\n       (ii) specified under the election under paragraph (1).\n       (b) Contributions of Amounts Received to Retirement \n     Accounts.--\n       (1) In general.--Any qualified taxpayer who receives \n     qualified settlement income during the taxable year may, at \n     any time before the end of the taxable year in which such \n     income was received, make one or more contributions to an \n     eligible retirement plan of which such qualified taxpayer is \n     a beneficiary in an aggregate amount not to exceed the amount \n     of qualified settlement income received during such year.\n       (2) Time when contributions deemed made.--For purposes of \n     paragraph (1), a qualified taxpayer shall be deemed to have \n     made a contribution to an eligible retirement plan on the \n     last day of the taxable year in which such income is received \n     if the contribution is made on account of such taxable year \n     and is made not later than the time prescribed by law for \n     filing the return for such taxable year (not including \n     extensions thereof).\n       (3) Treatment of contributions to eligible retirement \n     plans.--For purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, if \n     a contribution is made pursuant to paragraph (1) with respect \n     to qualified settlement income, then--\n       (A) except as provided in paragraph (4)--\n       (i) to the extent of such contribution, the qualified \n     settlement income shall not be included in taxable income, \n     and\n       (ii) for purposes of section 72 of such Code, such \n     contribution shall not be considered to be investment in the \n     contract, and\n       (B) the qualified taxpayer shall, to the extent of the \n     amount of the contribution, be treated--\n       (i) as having received the qualified settlement income--\n\n       (I) in the case of a contribution to an individual \n     retirement plan (as defined under section 7701(a)(37) of such \n     Code), in a distribution described in section 408(d)(3) of \n     such Code, and\n       (II) in the case of any other eligible retirement plan, in \n     an eligible rollover distribution (as defined under section \n     402(f)(2) of such Code), and\n\n       (ii) as having transferred the amount to the eligible \n     retirement plan in a direct trustee to trustee transfer \n     within 60 days of the distribution.\n       (4) Special rule for roth iras and roth 401(k)s.--For \n     purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, if a \n     contribution is made pursuant to paragraph (1) with respect \n     to qualified settlement income to a Roth IRA (as defined \n     under section 408A(b) of such Code) or as a designated Roth \n     contribution to an applicable retirement plan (within the \n     meaning of section 402A of such Code), then--\n       (A) the qualified settlement income shall be includible in \n     taxable income, and\n       (B) for purposes of section 72 of such Code, such \n     contribution shall be considered to be investment in the \n     contract.\n       (5) Eligible retirement plan.--For purpose of this \n     subsection, the term ``eligible retirement plan'' has the \n     meaning given such term under section 402(c)(8)(B) of the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986.\n       (c) Qualified Settlement Income Not Included in SECA.--For \n     purposes of chapter 2 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 \n     and section 211 of the Social Security Act, no portion of \n     qualified settlement income received by a qualified taxpayer \n     shall be treated as self-employment income.\n       (d) Qualified Taxpayer.--For purposes of this section, the \n     term ``qualified taxpayer'' means--\n       (1) any plaintiff in the civil action In re Exxon Valdez, \n     No. 89-095-CV (HRH) (Consolidated) (D. Alaska); or\n       (2) any beneficiary of the estate of such a plaintiff who--\n       (A) acquired the right to receive qualified settlement \n     income from that plaintiff; and\n       (B) was the spouse or an immediate relative of that \n     plaintiff.\n       (e) Qualified Settlement Income.--For purposes of this \n     section, the term ``qualified settlement income'' means \n     income received (whether as lump sums or periodic payments) \n     in connection with the civil action In re Exxon Valdez, No. \n     89-095-CV (HRH) (Consolidated) (D. Alaska), including \n     interest (whether pre- or post judgment and whether related \n     to a settlement or judgment).\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DORGAN:\n\n[[Page S1856]]\n\n  S. 554. A bill to reduce the Federal budget deficit, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this Nation was founded on the principle \nthat the future matters more than the past. It was the first Nation in \nthe world so conceived. The Founders took great pains to ensure that \neach generation would get a fresh start, free of the encumbrances of \nthe past. They abolished primogeniture, entail, and hereditary titles. \nJefferson for one believed that every twenty years or so, the books of \nthe Federal Government should be wiped clean, so that prior generations \nwould not be able to fob their debts off upon later ones who would have \nno say in the matter.\n  Over the last half dozen years, we have done exactly what the \nFounders of this Nation did not intend. We have heaped debt upon debt \non the backs of our children and theirs--the very people the Founders \nthought should be free of such debts. In just about every corner of \ngovernment and policy, the story has been the same--let's have a party \ntoday, and let our kids and grandkids clean up the mess. We've done it \nwith energy, the environment, and, perhaps most of all, we have done it \nwith the Federal budget.\n  Just six years ago, we had our fiscal house in order. The government \nhad $5.6 trillion in projected surpluses between 2002 and 2011. We were \npaying down the debt. But now it's changed. We racked up the second \nlargest deficit in our history in 2003, our largest deficit ever in \n2004, the third highest deficit in 2005 and the seventh largest deficit \nlast year.\n  The administration can claim to be making progress only by leaving \nout of its budget plans the full cost of the ongoing war against \nterrorism, long term relief from the alternative minimum tax, using \nSocial Security surplus revenues for unrelated spending and by \ngenerally setting expectations so low that even failure looks good by \ncomparison. But the reality, of course, is unless the Nation's fiscal \npolicies are dramatically changed, we are going to see large deficits \nfor many years in the future. At the current rate the accumulated debt \nof this government will grow from $8.6 trillion today to over $12 \ntrillion by 2012.\n  That projected debt is bigger than the economies of Japan, Germany, \nFrance, the United Kingdom and Canada combined. It's almost $39,000 for \nevery man, woman and child in this country. Meanwhile, the \nAdministration has provided big tax cuts for people who use them to buy \nthird homes, pricey wines and three-hundred-dollar dungarees. This is \nMe-Generation economics. It is economics that says, ``Let others make \nthe sacrifices while we have a bash.'' It is the total opposite of the \neconomics envisioned by the founders of this country, who said that we \nshould meet our own obligations, clean up our own messes and pay our \nown way, so that those who come after us can have a future that is \nclear and bright.\n  To this end, I rise today to introduce legislation called the Act For \nOur Kids that I hope will help spark a serious discussion in the U.S. \nCongress, and across our country, about putting the Federal \nGovernment's balance sheet back in order. This legislation provides for \na package of Federal spending cuts and more revenue that would raise \nnearly $76 billion the first full year and some $205 billion over five \nyears and every penny would be used to reduce the Federal deficit! It \nis a real first step in acting like we are serious about fixing our \nfiscal policies and paying our bills.\n  Last year on the Senate floor I spoke about an agenda that Congress \ncould be pursuing that would benefit all Americans. Among other things, \nI said that two of our top priorities ought to be paying our bills and \ntaking care of our kids. Regrettably, however, the administration and \nthe majority in Congress at that time adopted a card credit mentality \nto fiscal policy that would make even the most aggressive credit card \ncompanies blush. If a part of the American dream is ensuring that one's \nkids and grandkids get at least the same opportunities that we had to \nclimb the economic ladder to success, then the Federal Government's \nrecent approach to fiscal policy has been a full-blown nightmare.\n  Unless we change the direction of our fiscal policy, the Federal \nGovernment will ``borrow'' trillions of dollars of Social Security \nsurplus revenues over the next decade to pay for tax cuts and other \nspending. Social Security faces significant financial challenges as the \nbaby boomers retire in the years ahead. Loading up the country with \nmore debt and diverting needed revenues away from the Social Security \nprogram will only make the program's fiscal problems worse, not better.\n  The real question is how are we going to dig ourselves out of this \nfiscal quagmire? The solution offered by the White House and the \nRepublicans in Congress was simple: They said let's run up our Federal \ncredit card balances even more, while at the same time giving more \nlarge tax cuts to the richest Americans.\n  And if President Bush is successful in permanently extending the bulk \nof his previous tax cuts that mostly benefit the wealthiest Americans, \nas he proposed in his Fiscal Year 2008 budget submission just this \nweek, another $2 trillion in revenues will be lost over the next \ndecade.\n  Frankly, I am not aware of any instance in the history of this great \ncountry where those in charge of the Federal purse decided to cut \nrevenues on such a large scale while in the midst of war. Today we ask \nour young men and women in uniform to sacrifice so much, yet the \nwealthiest among us are not asked to contribute even a portion of their \ntax cuts to what we are told every day is a noble cause.\n  In one of his famous fireside chats, President Franklin D. Roosevelt \ndescribed our obligation as citizens to support our troops during times \nof war. He said:\n\n     Not all of us can have the privilege of fighting our enemies \n     in distant parts of the world. Not all of us can have the \n     privilege of working in a munitions factory or a ship yard, \n     or on the farms or in oil fields or mines, producing the \n     weapons or the raw materials that are needed by our armed \n     forces. But there is one front and one battle where everyone \n     in the United States--every man, woman and child--is in \n     action. . . . That front is right here at home, in our daily \n     lives, in our daily tasks. Here at home everyone will have \n     the privilege of making whatever self-denial is necessary, \n     not only to supply our fighting men, but to keep the economic \n     structure of our country fortified and secure during the war \n     and after the war.\n\n  The sentiments of President Roosevelt's remarks are truly lost on an \nAdministration that has borrowed every dollar it has used to pay for \nthe war in Iraq and the global fight against terrorism.\n  I think the American public understands that one of our obligations \nas U.S. citizens is helping to defend this country in whatever way is \nbest. But what we have been missing is leadership and at least some \nmeasure of fiscal discipline in paying our war debt and getting other \nparts of our fiscal house in order.\n  It is unfair to pile up this massive debt and heave it onto the \nshoulders of working families and their children. The Federal \nGovernment is expected to pay $3.3 trillion in interest payments on the \ndebt alone during the 10-year period ending in 2017.\n  The legislation I am introducing today includes a number of proposals \nthat, taken together, would reduce the Federal deficit by my estimate \n$205 billion over the next five years.\n  First and foremost, this bill requires Federal agencies to tighten \ntheir belts by cutting their administrative overhead expenses. Before \nwe ask others to make sacrifices needed to reduce the Nation's debt \nload, Federal agencies must do their part.\n  My legislation includes other targeted cuts in Federal spending and \nwill make changes to the tax code to ensure that the wealthiest \nAmericans and most profitable multinational companies that do business \nin this country pay their fair share of taxes--revenues that are needed \nto defend this Nation and keep our economy strong and growing.\n  Among other things, the Act For Our Kids would do the following: Cut \nFederal agency administrative overhead by 5 percent for fiscal years \n2008 through 2012 and save taxpayers an estimated $30 billion. This \nproposal would reduce ``nuts and bolts'' expenditures, including those \nrelating to agency travel and transportation, advertising, office \nsupplies, conferences and equipment. These savings must come from the \nbureaucracy, not programs. It is generally understood that \nadministrative expenses do not include personnel compensation and \nbenefits.\n\n[[Page S1857]]\n\n  Eliminate $3.5 billion that remains in a giveaway fund in the \nMedicare drug plan. The 2003 Medicare drug bill included a $10 billion \n``slush'' fund that the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and \nHuman Services could tap to entice regional preferred provider \norganizations (PPOs) to participate in Medicare. This fund has been \nroundly criticized by policy experts as an inappropriate use of Federal \nresources. The Senate has previously supported eliminating this fund \naltogether and legislation enacted by Congress late last year used $6.5 \nbillion of the $10 billion in the fund for the physician payment fix.\n  Make drug importation legal and safe. This will not only help \nconsumers by reducing the cost they pay for prescription drugs, but \nwill save the Federal Government and therefore taxpayers an estimated \n$1.6 billion in Federal health program costs in the five years after \nits enactment.\n  Stop providing Federal funding for TV Marti broadcasts into Cuba that \nare jammed and therefore are not watched by their intended recipients. \nThis provision would save U.S. taxpayers an estimated $100 million in \nthe next half decade.\n  Restore honesty and accountability in Federal contracting by, among \nother things, reinstating a Federal rule that would deny Federal \ncontracts to companies with a pattern of overcharging the government or \nviolating other Federal laws, including tax, labor and consumer \nprotections. Other provisions in the bill would crack down on corporate \ncheaters and require full disclosure of contracting abuses. It requires \nreal contract competition, bans corporate cronyism and takes other \nsignificant steps to ensure that Federal contractors. large or small, \nare not gouging American taxpayers. Based on information derived from \nsimilar experiences in the past, and more recently, one could easily \nexpect these reforms would save the Federal Government some $6 billion \nover a five-year period.\n  Abolish the U.S. Court of Federal Claims. The docket of the Court of \nFederal Claims includes a hodgepodge of cases, including patent cases, \nclaims involving Indian property, vaccine injury cases, claims arising \nfrom the interment of Japanese Americans, and cases arising under the \nFifth Amendment's takings clause. The light caseload of this court \ncould be handled more efficiently by Federal district courts. This \nelimination of the Claims Court would result in additional taxpayer \nsavings of tens of millions of dollars over five years.\n  Impose a temporary 2 percent emergency tariff on all imports for two \nyears to help correct our country's $800-billion-plus trade deficit. \nArticle XII of the GATT, which has been incorporated into the World \nTrade Organization, specifically allows member countries to impose \ntariffs to correct a balance of payment crisis. Temporary emergency \ntariffs over two years would help address this crisis, while raising an \nestimated $66 billion for deficit reduction.\n  Prevent tax avoidance for U.S. multinational companies that move \nprofits to offshore tax havens by generally treating their controlled \n``paper or shell'' subsidiaries set up in foreign tax-haven countries \nas domestic companies for U.S. tax purposes. This proposal would save \ntaxpayers another $5.8 billion over five years.\n  Repeal the perverse Federal tax subsidy called tax deferral for U.S. \ncompanies that shut down manufacturing plants in the U.S. and move jobs \nabroad, only to ship their now foreign-made products back into our \ncountry. Killing this ill-advised tax break for runaway manufacturing \nplants would help level the financial playing field for domestic \nmanufacturers while saving taxpayers some $4.2 billion over a five-year \nperiod.\n  Clarify and enhance the application of the economic substance \ndoctrine that courts apply to deny tax benefits from business tax \nshelter transactions that do not result in a meaningful change to the \ntaxpayer's economic position other than a reduction in their Federal \nincome tax. This proposal would save taxpayers an estimated $5.8 \nbillion over the next five years.\n  Rescind on a prospective basis a portion of the major tax cuts passed \nby Congress since 2001 for individuals who are earning more than $1 \nmillion annually. Providing some $90 billion in additional large tax \ncuts over the next five years for millionaires when the Nation is still \naccruing massive debt and paying ongoing war costs is irresponsible in \nmy judgment.\n  Disallow the tax deduction for punitive damages that are paid or \nincurred by taxpayers as a result of a judgment or in settlement of a \nclaim. Allowing a tax deduction for punitive damages undermines the use \nof punitive damages to discourage and penalize the activities or \nactions for which punitive damages are imposed. Making this change \nwould save taxpayers about $130 million over a 5-year period.\n  Lift the U.S. ban on travel to Cuba by U.S. citizens. Repealing this \nobsolete and ineffective restriction on travel to Cuba would raise an \nestimated $1 billion in U.S. tax revenues over five years from \nincreased U.S. business activity.\n  Extend permanently the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC's) \nauthority to auction licenses to those using the radio spectrum. This \nFCC authority was recently extended by Congress through 2011. A \npermanent extension of this authority would raise $1 billion between \n2012 to 2016, about $200 million annually starting in 2012.\n  The provisions I have highlighted above and others in the bill would \nhelp reduce the Federal debt by what I roughly calculate is $205 \nbillion over the next half decade. I understand that this package does \nnot fully cover our outstanding debt obligations. But I think it is a \nreasonable and balanced package of spending cuts and revenue \nenhancements that offer a first installment that will help us begin a \nthoughtful process of curbing our addiction to deficit spending and \nhopefully head us once again toward truly a balanced budget not \ncounting Social Security surplus revenue that should be set aside for \nfuture beneficiaries, and not used for unrelated spending.\n  Garrison Keillor once said, ``Nothing you do for children is ever \nwasted. They seem not to notice us, hovering, averting our eyes, and \nthey seldom offer thanks, but what we do for them is never wasted.'' I \nbelieve that one of the greatest gifts we can give for our kids is a \nfuture without a mountain of debt from under which they may never dig \nout. To make this happen, however, we need to set aside our differences \nand come together, Republicans and Democrats, conservatives and \nliberals alike, and begin to confront our recent obsession with debt \nfinancing. When we decide to do so, our Nation will be better for it, \nand so will the future of our children.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself, Mr. Bond, and Mr. Bingaman):\n  S. 555. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow \nsmall businesses to set up simple cafeteria plans to provide nontaxable \nemployee benefits to their employees, to make changes in the \nrequirements for cafeteria plans, flexible spending accounts, and \nbenefits provided under such plans or accounts, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the ``SIMPLE \nCafeteria Plan Act of 2007,'' which will increase the access to \nquality, affordable health care for millions of small business owners \nand their employees. I am pleased that my good friend Senator Bond from \nMissouri, as well as my good friend from New Mexico, Senator Bingaman, \nhave agreed to co-sponsor this critical piece of legislation.\n  Regrettably, our Nation's healthcare system is in the midst of a \ncrisis. Each year, more and more Americans are unable to purchase \nhealth insurance, and there are no signs that things are improving. As \nevidence, the United States Census Bureau estimates that nearly 47 \nmillion people did not have health insurance coverage in 2005. Sadly, \nthis number rose from 41.2 million uninsured persons in 2001--a 13 \npercent increase.\n  The lack of health insurance is even more troubling when we look \nspecifically at the small business sector of our economy. In 2005, \naccording to the Employee Benefit Research Institute, a non-partisan \nhealth policy group, nearly 63 percent of all uninsured workers were \neither self-employed or working for private-sector firms with fewer \nthan 100 employees. In comparison, only 13.4 percent of workers in \nfirms with more than 1,000 employees do not have health insurance. \nThese numbers\n\n[[Page S1858]]\n\ndemonstrate that the majority of uninsured Americans work for small \nenterprises.\n  So why are our Nation's small businesses, which are our country's job \ncreators and the true engine of our economic growth, so disadvantaged \nwhen it comes to purchasing health insurance?\n  The main reason that small business owners do not offer their \nemployees health insurance is because many of them cannot afford to \nprovide any health insurance, or other benefits to their employees. \nMany other small companies can only afford to pay a portion of their \nemployees' health insurance premiums. As a result, many small business \nemployees must acquire health insurance from the private sector rather \nthan through their work place. This more expensive alternative is not \npractical or possible for the majority of the uninsured.\n  Clearly, we have a problem on our hands. While we can debate among \nourselves why this crisis exists, and how we ended up here, what is not \nopen for debate is that we need to start identifying ways to fix the \nsystem. It is simply unconscionable to do nothing while more and more \nAmericans find themselves without health insurance and health care.\n  Currently, many large companies, and even the Federal Government, \nallow their employees to purchase health insurance, and other qualified \nbenefits, with tax-free dollars. Larger companies are able to offer \nthese accounts because they meet the specific qualifications outlined \nin the tax code.\n  Cafeteria plans is one means for employers to offer health benefits \nwith pretax dollars. As the name suggests, cafeteria plans are programs \nwhere employees can purchase a range of qualified benefits. \nSpecifically, cafeteria plans offer employees great flexibility in \nselecting their desired benefits while allowing them to disregard those \nbenefits that do not fit their particular needs. Moreover, the \nemployees are usually purchasing benefits at a lower cost because their \nemployers are often able to obtain a reduced group rate price for their \nbenefits.\n  Typically, in cafeteria plans, a combination of employer \ncontributions and employee contributions are used to fund the accounts \nthat employees used to buy specific benefits. Under current law, \nqualified benefits include health insurance, dependent-care \nreimbursement, life and disability insurance. Unfortunately, long term \ncare insurance is NOT currently a qualified benefit available for \npurchase in cafeteria plans. I will come back to long term care \ninsurance in a moment.\n  Clearly, cafeteria plans play a critical role in our Nation's health \ncare system. The problem though, is that in order for companies to \nqualify for cafeteria plans they must satisfy the tax code's strict \nnon-discrimination rules. These rules exist to ensure that companies \noffer the same benefits to their non-highly compensated employees that \nthey offer to their highly compensated employees. These rules strive to \nensure that non-highly compensated employees in fact receive a \nsubstantial portion of the employee benefits companies provide.\n  Now, I want to be clear. I believe that these non-discrimination \nrules serve a legitimate purpose and are necessary employee \nprotections. Indeed, we need to ensure that employers are not able to \ngame the tax system so that the cafeteria plans that qualify for \npreferential tax treatment are used by a majority of a companies' \nemployees. At the same time these benefits must be made available to \nsmall companies and not just large companies.\n  Unfortunately, we often hear that small businesses lose skilled \nemployees to larger companies simply because the bigger firm is able to \noffer a more generous employee benefit package. Many small firms have \nrelatively few employees and a high proportion of owners or highly \ncompensated individuals. Right now, if these small companies opened \ncafeteria plans they will likely violate the nondiscrimination rules, \nand subject their workers and organizations to taxable penalties.\n  Consequently, many small companies simply forgo opening cafeteria \nplans and offering more comprehensive employee benefits because they \nfear they will violate the non-discrimination rules. According to the \nEmployers' Council on Flexible Compensation, though roughly 38 million \nU.S. workers had access to cafeteria plans, only 19 percent of those \nworkers were employees of small businesses.\n  Allowing small business to offer cafeteria plans would provide them \nwith much needed employee recruiting and retention tools. If more small \nbusiness owners are able to offer their employees the chance to enjoy a \nvariety of employee benefits these firms will be more likely to \nattract, recruit, and retain talented workers. This will ultimately \nincrease their business output.\n  In order to help small companies increase their employees access to \nhealth insurance and other benefits, and help them compete for talented \nprofessionals, I am introducing the SIMPLE Cafeteria Plan Act. This \nbill will enable small business employees to purchase health insurance \nwith tax-free dollars in the same way that many employees of large \ncompanies already do in their cafeteria plans. My bill accomplishes \nthis by creating a SIMPLE Cafeteria Plan, which is modeled after the \nSavings Incentive Match Plan for Employees, SIMPLE, pension plan.\n  As with the SIMPLE pension plan, a small business employer that is \nwilling to make a minimum contribution for all employees, or who is \nwilling to match contributions, will be permitted to waive the non-\ndiscrimination rules that currently prevent them from otherwise \noffering these benefits. This structure has worked extraordinarily well \nin the pension area with little risk of abuse. I am confident that it \nwill be just as successful when it comes to broad-based benefits \noffered through cafeteria plans.\n  In addition my bill will expand the types of qualified benefits that \ncan be offered in SIMPLE cafeteria plans and existing cafeteria plans. \nThese modifications will increase the benefits provided for all \nemployees and the likelihood that employees will utilize their \ncafeteria plans to purchase these benefits.\n  This legislation modifies rules that pertain to employer-provided \ndependent-care assistance plans. First, it would increase the current \n$5,000 annual contribution limitation of these plans to $10,000 for \nemployees that claim two or more dependents on their tax return. This \nincrease is significant because it will allow taxpayers to use their \ncafeteria accounts to pay for the care of their children and their \nelderly dependent family members. As the current baby-boomer generation \ncontinues to age, this scenario will become increasingly more common.\n  The bill also works to address our aging populations' need for long-\nterm care insurance. Here in the United States, nearly half of all \nseniors age 65 or older will need long-term care at some point in their \nlife. Unfortunately, most seniors have not adequately prepared for this \npossibility, just as many working age individuals have not given much \nthought to their eventual long-term care needs. With the cost of a \nprivate room in a nursing home averaging more than $72,000 annually, \nmany Americans risk losing their life savings--and jeopardizing their \nchildren's inheritance--by failing to properly plan for the long-term \ncare services they will need as they grow older.\n  To address this problem, this bill would allow employees to purchase \nlong-term care insurance coverage through their cafeteria plans and \nflexible spending arrangements. Allowing employers to offer long-term \ncare benefits through these accounts would make long-term care \ninsurance more affordable and help Americans prepare for their future \nlong-term care needs.\n  Additionally, by including long-term care insurance as a qualified \nbenefit available for purchase in cafeteria plans employers will be \nable to include information about long-term care options in their \nemployee benefit packages. This will help increase employee \nunderstanding of the need to plan for their care while also increasing \ntheir access to long-term care insurance.\n  Small businesses are the backbone of the American economy. According \nto the Small Business Administration, small businesses represent 99 \npercent of all employers, pay more than 45 percent of the private-\nsector's payroll, and generated 60 to 80 percent of net new jobs \nannually over the last decade. It is critical that small businesses are \nable to offer their employees cafeteria plans so that they may purchase \nthe health care and other benefits that will provide security for their \nfamilies.\n\n[[Page S1859]]\n\n  The ``SIMPLE Cafeteria Plan Act of 2007'' achieves these objectives, \nin a manner that employers and employees can afford. Although the use \nof pre-tax dollars to acquire these benefits reduces current Federal \nrevenues, the opportunity to provide small business employees these \nsame benefits currently enjoyed by the employees of the Federal \nGovernment, and larger companies, more than justifies this minimal \ninvestment. Therefore, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting \nthis important legislation as we work with you to enact this bill into \nlaw.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 555\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Alexander):\n  S. 556. A bill to reauthorize the Head Start Act, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to join Senators Enzi, \nDodd, and Alexander in introducing the Head Start for School Readiness \nAct. Our goal is to reauthorize Head Start and continue our bipartisan \nsupport for this very successful program to prepare low-income children \nfor school.\n  For over forty years, Head Start has given disadvantaged children the \nassistance they need to arrive at school ready to learn. It's \ncomprehensive services guarantee balanced meals for children, and a \nwell-defined curriculum to see that children develop early skills in \nreading, writing, and math, and positive social skills as well. It \nprovides visits to doctors and dentists, and outreach to parents to \nencourage them to participate actively in their child's early \ndevelopment.\n  It is clear that Head Start works. A federal evaluation found that \nHead Start children make gains during the program itself, and the gains \ncontinue when the children enter kindergarten. Once Head Start children \ncomplete their kindergarten year, they are near the national average of \n100 in key areas, with scores of 93 in vocabulary, 96 in early writing, \nand 92 in early math.\n  We've made tremendous, bipartisan progress this year in our effort to \nreauthorize Head Start and build upon a program that serves as a \nlifeline for the neediest families and children across the Nation.\n  In this legislation, we build on Head Start's proven track record and \nexpand it to include thousands of low-income children who are not yet \nserved by the program. We provide for better coordination of Head Start \nwith state programs for low-income children. We strengthen Head Start's \nfocus on school readiness and early literacy. We enhance the \neducational goals for Head Start teachers. And we provide greater \naccountability for the program, including new policies to ensure \nimproved monitoring visits and new policies to address programs with \nserious deficiencies.\n  To strengthen Head Start, we have to begin by providing more \nresources for it. The need for Head Start is greater than ever. Child \npoverty is on the rise again. Today, less than 50 percent of children \neligible for Head Start participate in the program. Hundreds of \nthousands of three- and four-year-olds are left out because of the \ninadequate funding level of the program. Early Head Start serves only 3 \npercent of eligible infants and toddlers. It is shameful that 97 \npercent of the children eligible for Early Head Start have no access to \nit. It's long past time for Congress to expand access to Head Start to \nserve as many infants, toddlers, and preschool children as possible.\n  The bill that we introduce today will set a goal to expand Head Start \nover the next several years. We call for increases in funding, from \n$6.9 billion in the current fiscal year, to $7.3 billion in FY 2008, \n$7.5 billion in FY 2009, and $7.9 billion in 2010. These funding levels \nare critical to advance the essential reforms in this legislation, and \nto serve thousands of additional children in the Head Start program.\n  Early Head Start is an especially important program for needy infants \nand toddlers. Research clearly shows its benefit to infants and \ntoddlers and their families. Early Head Start children have larger \nvocabularies, lower levels of aggressive behavior, and higher levels of \nsustained attention than children not enrolled in the program. Parents \nare more likely to play with their children and read to them.\n  This bill will double the size of Early Head Start over the course of \nthis authorization, and deliver services to over 56,000 additional \nchildren over the course of this authorization.\n  Our bill establishes a Head Start Collaboration Office in every state \nto maximize services to Head Start children, align Head Start with \nkindergarten classrooms, and strengthen its local partnerships with \nother agencies. These offices will work hand in hand with the Head \nStart network of training and technical assistance to support Head \nStart grantees in better meeting the goals of preparing children for \nschool.\n\n  States will also have an active role in coordinating their system of \nearly childhood programs, and increasing the quality of those programs. \nOur bill designates an Early Care and Education Council in each State \nto conduct an inventory of children's needs, develop plans for data \ncollection and for supporting early childhood educators, review and \nupgrade early learning standards, and make recommendations on technical \nassistance and training. For those States ready to move forward and \nimplement their statewide plan, our bill will offer a one-time \nincentive grant to implement these important efforts.\n  Over the past four decades, Head Start has built up quality and \nperformance standards to guarantee a full range of services, so that \nchildren are educated in the basics about letters and numbers and \nbooks, and are also healthy, well-fed, and supported in stable and \nnurturing relationships. Head Start is a model program, and we can \nenhance its quality even more.\n\n[[Page S1862]]\n\n  One way to do that is to strengthen Head Start's current literacy \ninitiative. We know the key to later reading success is to get young \nchildren excited about letters and books and numbers. Our bill \nemphasizes language and literacy, by enhancing the literacy training \nrequired of Head Start teachers, by continuing to promote parent \nliteracy, and by working to put more books into Head Start classrooms \nand into children's homes.\n  We also make a commitment in this bill to upgrade all of the \neducational components of Head Start, and ensure that services are \naligned with expectations for children's kindergarten year and continue \nto be driven by the effective Head Start Child Outcomes Framework.\n  At the heart of Head Start's success are its teachers and staff. They \nare caring, committed persons who know the children they serve and are \ndedicated to improving their lives. They help children learn to \nidentify letters of the alphabet and arrange the pieces of puzzles. \nThey teach them to brush their teeth, wash their hands, make friends \nand follow rules. Yet their salary is still half the salary of \nkindergarten teachers, and turnover is high--11 percent a year.\n  Because a teacher's quality is directly related to a child's outcome, \nour bill establishes a goal to ensue that every Head Start teacher have \ntheir A.A. degree and 50 percent earn their B.A. degree over the course \nof this authorization. Head Start teachers and staff are the greatest \nresource to children and families in the program, and we must match \nthese ambitious reforms and improvements with the funding needed to see \nthat Head Start programs can meet these goals.\n  We have also granted additional flexibility in this bill for Head \nStart programs to serve families and children that need services at the \nlocal level. We've lifted the eligibility requirements so that families \nliving below 130 percent of the federal poverty rate can qualify and \nparticipate in Head Start. Often, these are the neighbors of Head Start \nchildren with similar needs, but currently remain barred from \nparticipating in the program.\n  Under this bill, Head Start programs will be empowered with greater \nauthority to determine the needs of families in their local communities \nand define services to meet those needs. If programs determine that \nthere is a greater share infants and toddlers in need of services, our \nbill allows them to apply to the Secretary to convert and expand Head \nStart to serve those youngest children, consistent with Early Head \nStart standards. If programs identify a need to provide full-day or \nfull-year care for children and families, they can take steps to do so.\n  Accountability is a cornerstone of excellence in education and should \nstart early. Head Start should be accountable for its promise to \nprovide safe and healthy learning environments, to support each child's \nindividual pattern of development and learning, to cement community \npartnerships in services for children, and to involve parents in their \nchild's growth.\n  Head Start reviews are already among the most extensive in the field. \nEvery 3 years, a federal and local team spends a week thoroughly \nexamining every aspect of every Head Start program. They check \neverything from batteries in flashlights to how parents feel about the \nprogram. Our bill takes a further step to improve the monitoring of \nHead Start programs, ensures that programs receive useful and timely \nfeedback and information, and strengthens annual reviews and plans for \nimprovement.\n  Our bill also takes an important step to suspend the Head Start \nNational Reporting System. Four years ago, I insisted that instead of \nrushing forward with a national assessment for every four- and five-\nyear-old in Head Start, this Administration should instead move more \ndeliberately to develop and implement an assessment tool that would \nhelp guide and improve Head Start programs. Unfortunately, they \nrejected that call and proceeded with an assessment--absent sufficient \nauthorization or oversight from Congress--that was later proven by a \nGAO study to be flawed and inconsistent with professional standards for \ntesting and measurement.\n  Any assessment used in Head Start must be held to the highest \nstandard. It must be valid and reliable, fair to children from all \nbackgrounds, balanced in what it measures, and address the development \nof the whole child. Our bill calls on the National Academy of Sciences \nto continue their work in surveying assessments and outcomes \nappropriate for early childhood programs, and to make recommendations \nto the Secretary and to Congress on the use of assessments and outcomes \nin Head Start programs. I hope the National Academy's work will be \nhelpful as we consider future improvements in the Head Start program.\n  Finally, this bill appropriately rejects earlier calls to block grant \nHead Start services, preserving the community-based structure of the \nprogram. It makes no sense to turn Head Start into a block grant to the \nstates. To do so would have dismantled the program and undermined Head \nStart's guarantees that children can see doctors and dentists, eat \nnutritious meals, and learn early academic and social skills. The \ncurrent Federal-to-local structure of Head Start enables it to tailor \nits services to meet local community needs. Performance standards \nguarantee a high level of quality across all programs. Yet each program \nis unique and specifically adapted to the local community. Head Start \nis successful in serving Inuit children in Alaska, migrant-workers' \nchildren in Tennessee, and inner-city children in Boston. It is \nessential to maintain the ability of local Head Start programs to \ntailor their services to meet the needs of local neighborhoods and \ntheir children.\n  The Head Start for School Readiness Act we are introducing today will \nkeep Head Start on its successful path, and enable this vital program \nto continue to thrive and improve. I urge our colleagues on both sides \nof the aisle to join us in advancing and strengthening this program, \nand give children the head start they need and deserve to prepare for \nschool and for life.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise to join my colleagues in introducing \nthe Head Start for School Readiness Act.\n  Head Start programs are critical to ensuring that all children, \nregardless of their background, enter school ready to learn and \nsucceed. I want to thank Senator Kennedy and his staff for his ongoing \ncommitment to our bipartisan approach, which has resulted in a bill \nthat meets the needs of children and families who participate in the \nHead Start program throughout our Nation. I would also like to thank \nour colleagues Senators Alexander and Dodd and their staff for their \nfine work as well.\n  This legislation would reauthorize the Head Start program and help \nensure that children in this important program will be better prepared \nto enter school with the skills to succeed. Success in life depends a \ngreat deal on the preparation for that success, which comes early in \nlife. It is well documented in early childhood education research that \nstudents who are not reading well by the third grade will struggle with \nreading most of their lives. Head Start provides early education for \nover 900,000 children each year, most of whom would not have the \nopportunity to attend preschool programs elsewhere. It is because of \nthese 900,000 children we have all worked so hard to improve and \nstrengthen this Act.\n  I am particularly pleased with the accountability provisions we put \nforth in this legislation. The legislation we introduce today limits \nthe timeframe for Head Start grantees to appeal decisions made by the \nSecretary to terminate grants. In some instances, Head Start grantees \nhave been found to be operating programs that are unsafe or misusing \nFederal funds--and are often continuing those bad practices for months, \nas long as 600 days in some cases--during the termination process. This \nequates to children not receiving quality services, and instead of \nbeing prepared for success, they fall further behind.\n  Additional steps have been taken in this legislation to increase the \nquality of the Head Start program including providing the Secretary the \nauthority to terminate a grantee that has multiple and recurring \ndeficiencies that has not made significant and substantial progress \ntoward correcting those deficiencies.\n  We recognize that a vast majority of the Head Start agencies provide \nhigh quality, comprehensive services for\n\n[[Page S1863]]\n\nchildren in the Head Start programs. However, the provisions in this \nbill will create an important incentive for programs to operate at \ntheir best, and in the best interest of the children they serve.\n  Senator Dodd has provided valuable leadership as we worked to develop \na clear policy on the roles and responsibilities of the governing body \nand policy councils. We have worked together to clarify and strengthen \nthe roles of the governing body and policy councils. After careful \nreview, the Committee found that many of the important fiscal and legal \nresponsibilities of Head Start grantees were not explicitly assigned. \nThe bill clarifies those responsibilities leading to more consistent, \nhigh quality fiscal and legal management, which will ensure these \nprograms are serving children in the best possible way.\n  I want to particularly note emphasis we have placed on the role of \nparents in Head Start programs. It is vital to remember that this \nprogram provides services to children and their families. Parents \nprovide valuable insight and experience as to what a Head Start program \nshould do for children.\n  Senators Alexander, Kennedy, and Dodd have worked tirelessly on this \nlegislation and championed increasing coordination, collaboration, and \nexcellence in early childhood education and care programs. I wish to \nthank my colleagues on the Committee, particularly Senators Kennedy, \nAlexander, and Dodd, for their work in drafting this bipartisan \nlegislation to reauthorize the Head Start Act. I believe the \nlegislation we are introducing today will improve the quality and \neffectiveness of the Head Start program for generations of children to \ncome. It is my hope that our bipartisan efforts will continue to \nproduce results as we move the bill through the Senate and into \nConference.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues, Senator \nKennedy, Senator Enzi, and Senator Alexander in introducing the Head \nStart for School Readiness Act. I am pleased that we are beginning the \nprocess of reauthorizing this important legislation early in the 110th \nCongress.\n  Since 1965, Head Start has provided comprehensive early childhood \ndevelopment services to low-income children. The evidence is clear: \nHead Start works for the more than 900,000 children enrolled in centers \nthroughout the country. As we reauthorize this bill, we have the \nopportunity to refine and improve the program to make it work even \nbetter.\n  This reauthorization bill maintains the important characteristics of \nHead Start that have made it such an important program, aiding in the \nsocial, emotional, physical and cognitive development of low-income \npreschool children. The program is successful because each center \naddresses the needs of the local community. It is more than just a \nschool readiness program; it addresses the comprehensive needs of \nchildren and their families by providing health and other services to \nthe enrolled children. Families play the most important role in \nensuring the success of their children, and our bill maintains an \nintegral role for parents in the decision-making and day to day \noperations of the program. Parent involvement is a centerpiece of Head \nStart and I believe this bill strengthens that component.\n  This reauthorization bill expands eligibility, improves \naccountability by clarifying program governance, strengthens school \nreadiness for children and enhances teacher quality. In addition, \ncollaboration and coordination with other early childhood development \nprograms and outreach to underserved populations is greatly improved.\n  The bill we're introducing enables more low-income children to get a \nhead start by allowing programs to serve families with incomes up to \n130 percent of the poverty level, while ensuring that the most \nvulnerable families below the poverty level are served first. This is \nimportant for Connecticut and other States where the cost of living is \nespecially high and many working poor families aren't able to access \nservices because they earn just above the poverty level. In addition, \nthe bill expands access to services for infants and toddlers in Early \nHead Start by increasing the set-aside from 10 percent to 20 percent \nover the next 5 years. Programs are also provided more discretion to \nserve eligible individuals based on the needs of the each community.\n  Although we do not go as far as I would personally like to see in \nfunding for Head Start, we do authorize additional resources in this \nbill. Despite the tight budget situation, we authorize an increase of \nsix percent from $6.9 billion to $7.35 billion in Fiscal Year 2008, to \n$7.65 billion in Fiscal Year 2009 and to $7.995 billion in Fiscal Year \n2009. I continue to be gravely concerned about the lack of resources \nfor Head Start--funding levels have been essentially flat since 2002. \nCurrently, only half of eligible children are served in Head Start and \nfewer than 5 percent are served in Early Head Start.\n  Across the country, Head Start providers are reporting rising costs \nin transportation, some more than 15 percent due to fuel prices. Other \nbudget concerns include higher unemployment and health care premiums, \nfacilities maintenance and training for staff. Rising operating costs \nare coinciding with State, local and private funding partners cutting \nback their contributions to local Head Start programs. This terrible \nbudget crunch has caused providers to make deep cuts in already tight \nbudgets, as they try desperately to not remove children from their \nenrollments. I understand the challenges facing the Federal budget and \nlook forward to continuing to work with my colleagues on the budget and \nappropriations committees to increase vital resources for Head Start.\n  Research shows that child outcomes are directly related to the \nquality of the teachers and professionals who work with them on a daily \nbasis. I am pleased that we establish goals in this Head Start bill for \nimproving educational standards for Head Start teachers, curriculum \nspecialists and teacher assistants. Understanding that dedicated Head \nStart teachers and staff work hard for relatively low wages, there will \nnot be penalties associated with programs not meeting the goal we have \nestablished. I would hope that we could offer funding to help teachers \nmeet these goals, but that is not possible at this juncture. I will \ncontinue to work toward increased funding to assist teachers in \npursuing additional educational goals.\n  When Head Start began more than 40 years ago, it was the only \npreschool program available for low-income children; now there are many \napproaches. Collaboration and coordination with other early childhood \nprograms is also an essential piece of this Head Start bill, reducing \nduplication and encouraging opportunities for shared information and \nresources.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues as we move this bill \nthrough the Senate.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SCHUMER (for himself, Mr. Roberts, Mr. Nelson of Florida, \n        Mrs. Dole, Ms. Stabenow, and Mr. Kyl):\n  S. 557. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to make \npermanent the depreciation classification of motorsports entertainment \ncomplexes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce ``The \nMotorsports Fairness and Permanency Act.'' This bill extends the \ncurrent tax treatment for speedways and race tracks around the country. \nJust over two years ago, Congress codified the seven-year depreciation \nclassification for motorsports facilities. However, this provision of \nthe tax code expires at the end of 2007. The bill I am introducing \ntoday would make the seven-year classification permanent, providing \nmuch needed clarity and certainty for facility owners who are planning \ncapital investments.\n  There are over fifty motorsports facilities in every part of New York \nState: from Long Island Motorsports Park to Poughkeepsie Speedway to \nUtica-Rome Speedway to Wyoming County International Speedway. These \ntracks provide entertainment for thousands of fans and are important \nengines of local and regional economic development.\n  The highest profile facility in New York State is Watkins Glen \nInternational. This storied road course has played an important role in \nopen wheel and stock car racing since it opened in 1956. The Glen has \nhosted NASCAR racing since 1986, and this year's schedule will include \nthe Grand-Am Rolex Sports Car Series, the IndyCar Series and the NASCAR \nNextel Cup. With\n\n[[Page S1864]]\n\nthese high profile events drawing thousands of out-of-state racing fans \nto Schuyler County it is no surprise that the Glen's economic impact \nhas been estimated at over $200 million a year.\n  Watkins Glen is also a prime example of the need for continual \ncapital reinvestment at motorsports facilities. Since 2005, the Glen \nhas added new grandstands and spectator suites and upgraded and repaved \nthe track. Planning multi-million dollar capital projects requires a \ncertain and stable tax regime governing these investments. In order to \nprovide this stability and certainty, I am introducing the Motorsports \nFairness and Permanency Act, and I am pleased to be joined by Senators \nRoberts, Bill Nelson, Dole, Stabenow, and Kyl as original cosponsors. \nEnacting this legislation will be crucial to supporting the economic \nbenefits that motorsports facilities provide across New York State and \nacross the country. I hope that my colleagues will join me in \nsupporting this legislation, and I look forward to working with my \ncolleague from Kansas to have it considered in the Finance Committee.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DOMENICI (for himself, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Brown, \n        Mr. Smith, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Coleman, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. \n        Warner, Mrs. Boxer, Ms. Murkowski, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Roberts, Mr. \n        Cardin, Mr. Hatch, Ms. Cantwell, Ms. Collins, Ms. Stabenow, Ms. \n        Snowe, Mr. Biden, Mr. Graham, and Mr. Nelson of Nebraska):\n  S. 558. A bill to provide parity between health insurance coverage of \nmental health benefits and benefits for medical and surgical services; \nto the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Access to mental health services is one of the most \nimportant and most neglected civil rights issues facing the Nation. For \ntoo long, persons living with mental disorders have suffered \ndiscriminatory treatment at all levels of society. They have been \nforced to pay more for the services they need and to worry about their \njob security if their employer finds out about their condition. Sadly, \nin America today, patients with biochemical problems in their liver are \ntreated with better care and greater compassion than patients with \nbiochemical problems in their brain.\n  That kind of discrimination must end. No one questions the need for \naffordable treatment of physical illnesses. But those who suffer from \nmental illnesses face serious barriers in obtaining the care they need \nat a cost they can afford. Like those suffering from physical \nillnesses, persons with mental disorders deserve the opportunity for \nquality care. The failure to obtain treatment can mean years of \nshattered dreams and unfulfilled potential.\n  Eleven years ago, Congress passed the first Mental Health Parity Act. \nThat legislation was an important first step in bringing attention to \ndiscriminatory practices against the mentally ill, but it did little to \ncorrect the injustices that so many Americans continue to face. The \n1996 legislation required that annual and lifetime dollar limits for \nmental health coverage must be no less than the limits for medical and \nsurgical coverage. But more steps are clearly needed to guarantee that \nAmericans suffering from mental illness are not forced to pay more for \nthe services they need, do not face harsher limitations on treatment, \nand are not denied access to care.\n  This bill is a chance to take the actions needed to end the \nlongstanding discrimination against persons with mental illness. The \nlate Senator Paul Wellstone and Senator Pete Domenici deserve great \ncredit for their bipartisan leadership on mental health parity. If it \nwere not for them, we would not be here today.\n  The bill prohibits group health plans from imposing treatment \nlimitations or financial requirements on the coverage of mental health \nconditions that do not also apply to physical conditions. That means no \nlimits on days or treatment visits, and no exorbitant co-payments or \ndeductibles. The bill was negotiated by and has the support of the \nmental health community, the business community, and the insurance \nindustry.\n  The need is clear. One in five Americans will suffer some form of \nmental illness this year--but only a third of them will receive \ntreatment. Millions of our fellow citizens are unnecessarily enduring \nthe pain and sadness of seeing a family member, friend, or loved one \nsuffer illnesses that seize the mind and break the spirit.\n  Battling mental illness is itself a painful process, but \ndiscrimination against persons with such illnesses is especially cruel, \nsince the success rates for treatment often equal or surpass those for \nphysical conditions. According to the National Institute of Mental \nHealth, clinical depression treatment can be 70 percent successful, and \ntreatment for schizophrenia can be 60 percent successful.\n  Over the years we've heard compelling testimony from experts, \nactivists, and patients about the need to equalize coverage of physical \nand mental illnesses. The Office of Personnel Management talks us that \nproviding full parity to 8.5 million federal employees has led to \nminimal premium increases. We heard dramatic testimony about the \neconomic and social advantages of parity, including a healthier, more \nproductive workforce.\n  Some of the most compelling testimony came several years ago from \nLisa Cohen, a hardworking American from New Jersey, who suffers from \nboth physical and mental illnesses, and is forced to pay exorbitant \ncosts for treating her mental disorder, while paying little for her \nphysical disorder. She is typical of millions of Americans who not only \nface the cruel burden of mental illness, but also the cruel burden of \ndiscriminatory treatment. No Americans should be denied equal treatment \nof an illness because it starts in the brain instead of the heart, \nlungs, or other parts of their body. No patients should be denied \naccess to the treatment that can cure their illness because of where \nthey live or work.\n  A number of States have already enacted mental health parity laws, \nbut 86 million workers under ERISA have no protection under state \nmental health statutes.\n  Mental health parity is a good investment for the Nation. The costs \nfrom lost worker productivity and extra physical care outweigh the \ncosts of implementing parity for mental health treatment.\n  Over the years study after study has shown that parity makes good \nfinancial sense. An analysis of more than 46,000 workers at major \ncompanies showed that employees who report being depressed or under \nstress are likely to have substantially higher health costs than co-\nworkers without such conditions. Employees who reported being depressed \nhad health bills 70 percent higher than those who did not suffer from \ndepression. Those reporting high stress had 46 percent higher health \ncosts. McDonnell Douglas found a 4 to 1 return on investment after \naccounting for lower medical claims, reduced absenteeism, and smaller \nturnover.\n  Mental illness also imposes a huge financial burden on the Nation. It \ncosts us $300 billion each year in treatment expenses, lost worker \nproductivity, and crime. This country can afford mental health parity. \nWhat we can't afford is to continue denying persons with mental \ndisorders the care they need.\n  Today is a turning point. We are finally moving toward ending this \nshameful form of discrimination in our society--discrimination against \nmental illness. This bill has been seven years in the making, and \nbrings first class medicine to millions of Americans who have been \nsecond class patients for too long.\n  Today, we begin to right that wrong, by guaranteeing equal treatment \nto the 11 million people receiving mental health services, and \npromising equal treatment to the remaining 100 million insured workers \nand their families who never know the day they may need their mental \nhealth benefit.\n  The 1996 Act, was an important step towards ending health insurance \ndiscrimination against mental illness. This bill will take another \nlarge step forward by closing the loopholes that remain.\n  It guarantees co-payments, deductibles, coinsurance, out of pocket \nexpenses and annual and lifetime limits that apply to mental health \nbenefits are no different than those applied to medical and surgical \nbenefits.\n\n[[Page S1865]]\n\n  It guarantees that the frequency of treatment, number of visits, days \nof coverage and other limits on scope and duration of treatment for \nmental health services are no different than those applied to medical \nand surgical benefits.\n  This equal treatment and financial equity is also applied to \nsubstance abuse.\n  Features of State law that require coverage of mental disorders are \nprotected, to assure those currently protected by state parity laws \nthat their needs will be met.\n  The medical management strategies needed to prevent denial of \nmedically needed services for patients remain intact.\n  Finally, the bill is modeled on the parity that is already guaranteed \nto the 8.5 million persons, including Members of Congress, under the \nFederal Employee Benefits Program,\n  Equal treatment of those affected by mental illness is not just an \ninsurance issue. It's a civil rights issue. At its heart, mental health \nparity is a question of simple justice.\n  It is long past time to end insurance discrimination and guarantee \nall people with mental illness the coverage they deserve.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important principle, and end the \nunacceptable double standards that have unfairly plagued our health \ncare systems for so long.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today along with my colleagues \nSenator Kennedy and Senator Enzi to introduce the Mental Health Parity \nAct of 2007. I want to thank my colleagues for all of their hard work \non this issue and I am glad we are able to introduce this paramount \nlegislation.\n  Simply put, our legislation will provide parity between mental health \ncoverage and medical and surgical coverage. No longer will people be \ntreated differently only because they suffer from a mental illness. \nThis means 113 million people in group health plans will benefit from \nour bill.\n  We are here today after years of hard work. We have worked with the \nmental health community, the business community, and insurance groups \nto carefully construct a fair bill. A sampling of the groups include \nthe National Alliance on Mental Illness, the American Psychological \nAssociation, the American Psychiatric Association, the National Retail \nFederation, and Aetna Insurance.\n  This bill will no longer apply a more restrictive standard to mental \nhealth coverage and another more lenient standard be applied to medical \nand surgical coverage. What we are doing is a matter of simple \nfairness. Statistics demonstrate that there is a significant need for \nthis change in policy. Currently, 26 percent of American adults or \nnearly 58 million people suffer from a diagnosable mental illness each \nyear. Six percent of those adults suffer from a serious mental illness. \nAdditionally, more than 30,000 people commit suicide each year in the \nUnited States. We need to reduce these numbers, and I believe expanding \naccess to mental health services will allow us to do so.\n  This bill will provide mental health parity for about 113 million \nAmericans who work for employers with 50 or more employees and ensure \nhealth plans do not place more restrictive conditions on mental health \ncoverage than on medical and surgical coverage. Additionally, the \nlegislation includes parity for financial requirements such as \ndeductibles, copayments, and annual lifetime limits. Also, this bill \nincludes parity for treatment limitations regarding the number of \ncovered hospital days and visits. This bill does not Mandate the \ncoverage of mental health nor does it prohibit a health plan from \nmanaging mental health benefits in order to ensure only medically \nnecessary treatments are covered.\n  Again, I would like to thank everyone who contributed to the \ndevelopment of this legislation. I believe we are making a difference \ntoday and I look forward to working with my colleagues to move this \nbill forward.\n  I ask for unanimous consent that the text of the bill to be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 558\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, first and foremost I want to thank my \nrespective colleagues Senator Kennedy and Senator Domenici for their \ndedication and leadership on the issues of mental health parity. Your \ncommitment and willingness to compromise has gotten us to the point \nwhere we are today--introducing a mental health parity bill that has \nthe potential to be signed into law this year.\n  For many this is monumental. Parity for mental health benefits was \nfirst championed by the late Senator Paul Wellstone. Senator Domenici \nin memory of our late colleague took over as the lead advocate for this \nlegislation after the passing of Senator Wellstone.\n  Today is a reflection of your hard work, Senator Domenici, as well as \nthe groundwork that was laid by the late Senator Paul Wellstone.\n  The advocacy of my good colleagues Senator Wellstone and Domenici \nhelped to get the Mental Health Parity Act of 1996 signed into law. \nThis legislation acted as a catalyst for many states to take action in \npassing their own mental health parity laws. To date 38 States have \npassed some sort of mental health parity or benefit law. Many of these \nlaws go much farther than the 1996 Act. However, there is a concern \nthat while the 1996 Act requires parity for annual and lifetime dollar \nlimits on coverage, group plans may impose more restrictive treatment \nand cost sharing requirements. This is a legit concern. There is a also \na valid concern that requiring parity or mental health benefits will \ndrive up the cost of insurance, and result in group plans offering less \ncoverage or even worse dropping coverage for both mental and physical \nhealth. The bill introduced today recognizes both of these concerns and \naddresses them. This in turn breaks the log jam that has halted efforts \nin the past three Congress's to pass a Mental Health Parity Act that is \nmore widely known as the Paul Wellston Mental Health Equitable \nTreatment Act.\n  The Mental Health Parity Act we are introducing today is a compromise \nbetween the proponents and those who opposed the Paul Wellstone Mental \nHealth Equitable Treatment Act. It is a result of two years of \ndiscussion and compromise between the business and insurer industry and \nthe mental health community. I want to thank both of you for coming \ntogether in good faith to find a middle ground on an issue has \npolarized stakeholders. Your support and input has been critical to \nmaking this process work. Your willingness to work together to \naccommodate each others concerns, makes it possible for a mental health \nparity law to be enacted this Congress.\n  A vital component of the Mental Health Parity Act introduced today \nrecognizes the importance and need for treating mental health equal to \nphysical health, without unfairly mandating group health plans offer \nmental health coverage. The legislation applies only to those group \nhealth plans that already offer physical and surgical benefits as well \nas mental health benefits. It does not mandate what types of mental \nhealth benefits must receive parity, but leaves that to be defined \nunder the terms of the plan or coverage or as defined under State law. \nWhat this legislation does do, is require a plan to provide financial \nrequirements and treatment limitations applied to mental health \nbenefits equal to the financial requirements and treatment limitations \napplied to medical and surgical benefits that the plan covers. For \nexample, deductibles, co-payments, coinsurance, out of pocket expenses, \nfrequency of treatment, number of visits and days of coverage will now \nbe treated equally for mental health and physical health. To allow for \nhealth plans to adequately manage the new parity requirement mechanisms \nare authorized to allow for medical management tools to be used by \nhealth plans. Provisions of this law will preempt provisions of State \nlaw that differ. But again, this bill would not preempt State laws \nmandating that mental health benefits be covered. Furthermore, States \nthat elect to adopt the Federal standards would not be subject to \npreemption.\n\n  In addition, the legislation recognizes the stress many small \nbusiness employers are under to provide health care to their employees, \nthus, this bill does exempts small employers. Any employer with 50 or \nless employees will not be affected by the Federal law, but must still \ncomply with its State law or regulation.\n\n[[Page S1868]]\n\n  Another critical component of this compromised legislation is a cost \nexemption. Under the provision, an employer may elect to continue to \noffer mental health parity if a group plan results in an increase of 2 \npercent in the case of the first plan year and 1 percent in the case of \neach subsequent plan year.\n  The compromises made in this legislation are of great importance to \nmaking sure this legislation will not burden employers struggling with \nhealth care costs, while not compromising the significance or effect \nthis legislation will have in ensuring individuals have better access \nto critical mental health services. Approximately 1 in 5 Americans ages \n18 and older, have a mental disorder that can be diagnosed in a given \nyear according to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Service \nAdministration. However, their ability to receive treatment may be \nhindered due to cost issues or the stigma attached to mental illness. \nThis legislation will help to address both by sending the message that \nmental health is just as important as physical health, and needs to be \ntreated with the same amount of importance. This bill signals to an \nindividual diagnosed with schizophrenia that his or her illness is as \nreal as an individual diagnosed with diabetes and that they should not \nhave to pay more for the mental illness than the physical. This \nlegislation will help an employee covered by an affected plan who has a \nchild with bipolar disorder better access to the treatment that child \nneeds. In the past 20 years new technologies and treatments have \nadvanced our understanding and ability to treat a mental illness. We \nnow know with the right diagnoses, support, treatment and case \nmanagement a person with mental illness can be a contributing member of \nsociety. It is time to update our laws to reflect this.\n  While introduction today is a huge step forward for a Mental Health \nParity law, much more needs to be done to secure its passage. The \nlegislation, as it is currently crafted, still must pass through the \nSenate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee as early as \nWednesday, the full Senate and then the House. At this point, a process \nhas been created that allows for open and honest discussion. I \nencourage my colleagues and the stakeholders to continue this process \nand to remain together throughout each step of the way. By working \ntogether, instead of against each other, we can achieve passage of this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleagues Senator \nDomenici and Senator Kennedy to introduce a bill that will have \ntremendous impact for the millions of Americans who will suffer from \nmental illness in their lifetime. The Mental Health Parity Act of 2007 \nis an important bill and I look forward to its passage.\n  Mental illness can affect people of any age, of any race, and of any \nincome. As a parent with a son who struggled with mental illness, I \nknow all too well the indiscriminate nature of the illness and the \nfrightening statistics of its regular occurrence for those we love. The \nstatistics on the prevalence of mental illness are indeed startling. We \nknow that in any given year, more than a quarter of our nation's \nadults--60 million people--suffer from a diagnosable mental disorder, \nmany of whom suffer in silence. We also know that mental disorders can \ndisrupt lives and are the leading cause of disability for those aged \n15-44 in the United States and in Canada.\n  Mental illness is just as deadly and serious as a physical illness. \nSuicide takes the lives of more than 30,000 people each year, with more \nthan 700,000 attempts. We also know that suicides outnumber homicides \nthree to one each year. We also know that people who suffer from mental \nillness suffer from much higher rates of other chronic conditions, such \nas cardiovascular disease. However, unlike heart attacks and strokes, \nmental illness is not something that we, as a nation, want to talk \nabout.\n  However, we know that effective treatment exists for most people \nsuffering. Help is out there, and this bill will help make it \navailable. Mental health is not a Democratic issue or a Republican \nissue. Too much is at stake when we talk about mental health care \nreform to get caught up in partisan politics. We need to work together \nto find solutions. This bill is a big step and an important step in \nmoving that needed reform forward. Through parity, we can alleviate \nsome of the burden on the public mental health system that results when \nfamilies are forced to turn to the public system when they do not have \naccess to treatment through private plans.\n  My home State of Oregon had the wisdom and foresight to see that \nmental health parity was necessary. I am proud that this year they are \nimplementing parity for the people of Oregon. In a 2004 report by the \nGovernor's Mental Health Taskforce, they found that in any given year \n175,00 adults and 75,000 children under the age of 18 are in need of \nmental health services. It also listed as one of the major problems \nfacing the Oregon mental health system the fact that mental health \nparity was not, at that time, in effect. That is no longer the case and \nI look forward to seeing significant improvements in the mental health \nsystem in Oregon as a result of the hard work done there.\n  The introduction of this federal legislation is hard fought and so \nimportant. I look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure its \npassage. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support \nthis bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/12/senate-section/article/S1868-1", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1868]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 77--EXPRESSING SUPPORT FOR THE TRANSITIONAL FEDERAL \n                   GOVERNMENT OF THE SOMALI REPUBLIC\n\n  Mr. INHOFE (for himself and Mr. Brownback) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                               S.

Mr. President, as today marks the 98th anniversary of \nthe founding of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored \nPeople (NAACP), I am proud to submit a concurrent resolution to honor \nour country's oldest and largest civil rights organization for the work \nthey have done to change the path of our Nation. The legacy of pioneers \nsuch as W.E.B. Du Bois, Thurgood Marshall, Rosa Parks, hundreds more \ncannot and must not be forgotten. I urge my colleagues to support this \nresolution honoring and praising the NAACP for 98 years of championing \nthe cause of equality in the United States.\n  At the dawn of the 20th century--over half a century after the Civil \nWar--African Americans were still denied the full rights of \ncitizenship. They were forced to endure the daily humiliation and \nstruggle of economic exploitation, social segregation, and sometimes \neven physical brutality. Racial tensions began to escalate, resulting \nin riots and lynchings.\n  It was at this critical juncture in our Nation's history that a group \nof concerned citizens, recognizing the urgent need to address these \nintolerable conditions, gathered to form the National Association for \nthe Advancement of Colored People in New York City.\n  Since its founding, the NAACP has sought to eliminate racial \ndiscrimination and has fought for the social, political, and economic \nequality of all Americans, while maintaining its commitment to \nnonviolence in achieving these goals.\n  In 1918, the NAACP successfully persuaded President Wilson to \npublicly condemn lynching and continued to raise awareness about this \nhorrifying crime. The NAACP fought for, and ultimately achieved, \ndesegregation of the military as well as other federal government \ninstitutions.\n  They were also deeply influential in watershed court cases such as \nBuchanan vs. Warley, where the Supreme Court held that states cannot \nrestrict and segregate residential districts. In the landmark case \nBrown v. Board of Education, the NAACP successfully argued that the \n``separate, but equal'' doctrine was unconstitutional, thereby making \nsegregation in public schools illegal. The NAACP has also played an \nintegral role in the passage of essential civil rights legislation, \nincluding the Civil Rights Act of 1957, 1960, and 1964, the Voting \nRights Act of 1965, and the Fair Housing Rights Act. Their efforts \ncontinue today. The NAACP led efforts to reauthorize the Voting Rights \nAct last year. They recognize that we must continue vigilantly to guard \nagainst the resurgence of discriminatory practices that would deprive \nAfrican Americans of the most fundamental right of democracy--the right \nto vote.\n  Notwithstanding its powerful voice and extraordinary accomplishments, \nwe must never forget that the NAACP works through the tireless efforts \nof its individual members united around a common vision of justice and \nequality. One act of civil disobedience, by NAACP member Rosa Parks, \nhelped to spark the civil rights movement. Another member, Medgar \nEvers, worked tirelessly, despite many threats, to desegregate schools \nand to investigate the murder of Emmett Till.\n  Mary Burnett Talbert, a teacher in Little Rock, Arkansas, was one of \nthe founders of the NAACP and eventually became its president. She once \nwrote that ``by her peculiar position the colored woman has gained \nclear powers of observation and judgment--exactly the sort of powers \nwhich are today peculiarly necessary to the building of an ideal \ncountry.'' The NAACP continues to take us closer to the ``ideal \ncountry'' that Mary Talbert envisioned, with every public education \ncampaign, every fight over a judicial nomination, and every lobbying \neffort to pass progressive legislation.\n  The NAACP's has always been a multiracial and multicultural \norganization. Many of its founding members were white, including Oswald \nGarrison Villiard, Mary White Ovington, and Henry Moscowitz.\n  Despite the last century of achievements, substantial racial \ndisparities still persist today in educational achievement, access to \nhealth care, and economic prosperity. Hurricane Katrina highlighted the \ntragic and enduring link between race and poverty in our country, as \nwell as emphasized our nation's failure to care for those among us \nleast able to provide for themselves. It is no surprise that the NAACP \nraised nearly $2 million to aid the victims of the hurricane.\n  The NAACP has always stood ready to face these and other challenges. \nNinety-eight years after a group of concerned citizens assembled in New \nYork around the common goal of creating a more just society, the \nNAACP's half million members continue to lead the way towards positive \nsocial change.\n  For striving and continuing to push our nation closer to the promise \nof equality envisioned in our Constitution, we must honor the NAACP.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/12/senate-section/article/S1869-2", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1869-S1870]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 250.

SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING REPORTS ON CAPITAL \n                   MARKETS.\n\n       ``(a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       ``(1) the Interim Report of the Committee on Capital \n     Markets Regulation (published in November 2006) and the \n     McKinsey Report on New York Competitiveness (published in \n     January 2007) have expressed concerns that United States \n     capital markets are losing their competitive edge in \n     intensifying global competition, both reports adding \n     considerably to the understanding of the challenges that \n     American capital markets face and offer solutions that could \n     help American markets, companies, and workers to better \n     compete;\n       ``(2) according to the Committee on Capital Markets \n     Regulation, `A key measure of competitiveness, one \n     particularly relevant to the growth of new jobs, is where new \n     equity is being raised--that is, in which market initial \n     public offerings (IPOs) are being done. The trend in so-\n     called ``global'' IPOs, i.e., IPOs done outside a company's \n     home country, provides evidence of a decline in the U.S. \n     competitive position. As measured by value of IPOs, the U.S. \n     share declined from 50 percent in 2000 to 5 percent in 2005. \n     Measured by number of IPOs, the decline is from 37 percent in \n     2000 to 10 percent in 2005.';\n       ``(3) according to the McKinsey Report on New York \n     Competitiveness, `London already enjoys clear leadership in \n     the fast-growing and innovative over-the-counter (OTC) \n     derivatives market. This is significant because of the \n     trading flow that surrounds derivatives markets and because \n     of the innovation these markets drive, both of which are key \n     competitive factors for financial centers. Dealers and \n     investors increasingly see derivatives and cash markets as \n     interchangeable and are therefore combining trading \n     operations for both products. Indeed, the derivatives markets \n     can be more liquid than the underlying cash markets. \n     Therefore, as London takes the global lead in derivatives, \n     America's competitiveness in both cash and derivatives flow \n     trading is at risk, as is its position as a center for \n     financial innovation'; and\n       ``(4) according to the Committee on Capital Markets \n     Regulation, `Maximizing the competitiveness of U.S. capital \n     markets is critical to ensuring economic growth, job \n     creation, low costs of capital, innovation, entrepreneurship \n     and a strong tax base in key areas of the country. Regulation \n     and litigation play central roles in protecting investors and \n     the efficient functioning of our capital markets, \n     particularly in light of recent, highly publicized abuses. \n     Yet excessive regulation, problematic implementation and \n     unwarranted litigation--particularly when occurring \n     simultaneously--make U.S. capital markets less attractive \n     and, therefore, less competitive with other financial centers \n     around the world.'.\n       ``(b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       ``(1) Congress, the President, regulators, industry \n     leaders, and other stakeholders should carefully review the \n     Interim Report of the Committee on Capital Markets Regulation \n     (published in November 2006) and the McKinsey Report on New \n     York Competitiveness (published in January 2007), and take \n     the necessary steps to reclaim the preeminent position of the \n     United States in the financial services industry;\n       ``(2) the Federal and State financial regulatory agencies \n     should, to the maximum extent possible, coordinate activities \n     on significant policy matters, so as not to impose \n     regulations that may have adverse unintended consequences on \n     innovativeness with respect to financial products, \n     instruments, and services, or that impose regulatory costs \n     that are disproportionate to their benefits, and, at the same \n     time, ensure that the regulatory framework overseeing the \n     United States capital markets continues to promote and \n     protect the interests of investors in those markets; and\n       ``(3) given the complexity of the financial services \n     marketplace today, Congress should exercise vigorous \n     oversight over Federal regulatory and statutory requirements \n     affecting the financial services industry and consumers, with \n     the goal of eliminating excessive regulation and problematic \n     implementation of existing laws and regulations.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 257.

SENSE OF SENATE ON IRAQ.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) We respect the Constitutional authorities given a \n     President in article II, section 2, which states that ``The \n     President shall be commander in chief of the Army and Navy of \n     the United States''; it is not the intent of this section to \n     question or contravene such authority, but to accept the \n     offer to Congress made by the President on January 10, 2007, \n     that, ``if members have improvements that can be made, we \n     will make them. If circumstances change, we will adjust''.\n       (2) The United States strategy and operations in Iraq can \n     only be sustained and achieved with support from the American \n     people and with a level of bipartisanship.\n       (3) Over 137,000 American military personnel are currently \n     serving in Iraq, like thousands of others since March 2003, \n     with the bravery and professionalism consistent with the \n     finest traditions of the United States Armed Forces, and are \n     deserving of the support of all Americans, which they have \n     strongly.\n       (4) Many American service personnel have lost their lives, \n     and many more have been wounded, in Iraq, and the American \n     people will always honor their sacrifices and honor their \n     families.\n       (5) The U.S. Army and Marine Corps, including their Reserve \n     and National Guard organizations, together with components of \n     the other branches of the military, are under enormous strain \n     from multiple, extended deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan.\n       (6) These deployments, and those that will follow, will \n     have lasting impacts on the future recruiting, retention and \n     readiness of our Nation's all volunteer force.\n       (7) In the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal \n     Year 2006, the Congress stated that ``calendar year 2006 \n     should be a period of significant transition to full \n     sovereignty, with Iraqi security forces taking the lead for \n     the security of a free and sovereign Iraq''.\n       (8) United Nations Security Council Resolution 1723, \n     approved November 28, 2006,\n\n[[Page S1872]]\n\n     ``determin[ed] that the situation in Iraq continues to \n     constitute a threat to international peace and security''.\n       (9) Iraq is experiencing a deteriorating and ever-widening \n     problem of sectarian and intra-sectarian violence based upon \n     political distrust and cultural differences between some \n     Sunni and Shia Muslims.\n       (10) Iraqis must reach political settlements in order to \n     achieve reconciliation, and the failure of the Iraqis to \n     reach such settlements to support a truly unified government \n     greatly contributes to the increasing violence in Iraq.\n       (11) The responsibility for Iraq's internal security and \n     halting sectarian violence must rest primarily with the \n     Government of Iraq and Iraqi Security Forces.\n       (12) U.S. Central Command Commander General John Abizaid \n     testified to Congress on November 15, 2006, ``I met with \n     every divisional commander, General Casey, the Corps \n     Commander, [and] General Dempsey. We all talked together. And \n     I said, in your professional opinion, if we were to bring in \n     more American troops now, does it add considerably to our \n     ability to achieve success in Iraq? And they all said no. And \n     the reason is, because we want the Iraqis to do more. It's \n     easy for the Iraqis to rely upon us to do this work. I \n     believe that more American forces prevent the Iraqis from \n     doing more, from taking more responsibility for their own \n     future''.\n       (13) Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki stated on \n     November 27, 2006, that ``The crisis is political, and the \n     ones who can stop the cycle of aggravation and bloodletting \n     of innocents are the politicians''.\n       (14) There is growing evidence that Iraqi public sentiment \n     opposes the continued U.S. troop presence in Iraq, much less \n     increasing the troop level.\n       (15) In the fall of 2006, leaders in the Administration and \n     Congress, as well as recognized experts in the private \n     sector, began to express concern that the situation in Iraq \n     was deteriorating and required a change in strategy; and, as \n     a consequence, the Administration began an intensive, \n     comprehensive review by all components of the Executive \n     Branch to devise a new strategy.\n       (16) In December 2006, the bipartisan Iraq Study Group \n     issued a valuable report, suggesting a comprehensive strategy \n     that includes ``new and enhanced diplomatic and political \n     efforts in Iraq and the region, and a change in the primary \n     mission of U.S. forces in Iraq that will enable the United \n     States to begin to move its combat forces out of Iraq \n     responsibly''.\n       (17) On January 10, 2007, following consultations with the \n     Iraqi Prime Minister, the President announced a new strategy \n     (hereinafter referred to as the ``plan''), which consists of \n     three basic elements: diplomatic, economic, and military; the \n     central component of the military element is an augmentation \n     of the present level of the U.S. military forces through \n     additional deployments of approximately 21,500 U.S. military \n     troops to Iraq.\n       (18) On January 10, 2007, the President said that the \n     ``Iraqi government will appoint a military commander and two \n     deputy commanders for their capital'' and that U.S. forces \n     will ``be embedded in their formations''; and in subsequent \n     testimony before the Armed Services Committee on January 25, \n     2007, by the retired former Vice Chief of the Army it was \n     learned that there will also be a comparable U.S. command in \n     Baghdad, and that this dual chain of command may be \n     problematic because ``the Iraqis are going to be able to move \n     their forces around at times where we will disagree with that \n     movement'', and called for clarification.\n       (19) This proposed level of troop augmentation far exceeds \n     the expectations of many of us as to the reinforcements that \n     would be necessary to implement the various options for a new \n     strategy, and led many members of Congress to express \n     outright opposition to augmenting our troops by 21,500.\n       (20) The Government of Iraq has promised repeatedly to \n     assume a greater share of security responsibilities, disband \n     militias, consider Constitutional amendments and enact laws \n     to reconcile sectarian differences, and improve the quality \n     of essential services for the Iraqi people; yet, despite \n     those promises, little has been achieved.\n       (21) The President said on January 10, 2007, that ``I've \n     made it clear to the Prime Minister and Iraq's other leaders \n     that America's commitment is not open-ended'' so as to dispel \n     the contrary impression that exists.\n       (22) The recommendations in this section should not be \n     interpreted as precipitating any immediate reduction in, or \n     withdrawal of, the present level of forces.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the Senate disagrees with the ``plan'' to augment our \n     forces by 21,500, and urges the President instead to consider \n     all options and alternatives for achieving the strategic \n     goals set forth below;\n       (2) the Senate believes the United States should continue \n     vigorous operations in Anbar province, specifically for the \n     purpose of combating an insurgency, including elements \n     associated with the Al Qaeda movement, and denying terrorists \n     a safe haven;\n       (3) the Senate believes a failed state in Iraq would \n     present a threat to regional and world peace, and the long-\n     term security interests of the United States are best served \n     by an Iraq that can sustain, govern, and defend itself, and \n     serve as an ally in the war against extremists;\n       (4) the Congress should not take any action that will \n     endanger United States military forces in the field, \n     including the elimination or reduction of funds for troops in \n     the field, as such an action with respect to funding would \n     undermine their safety or harm their effectiveness in \n     pursuing their assigned missions;\n       (5) the primary objective of the overall U.S. strategy in \n     Iraq should be to encourage Iraqi leaders to make political \n     compromises that will foster reconciliation and strengthen \n     the unity government, ultimately leading to improvements in \n     the security situation;\n       (6) the military part of this strategy should focus on \n     maintaining the territorial integrity of Iraq, denying \n     international terrorists a safe haven, conducting \n     counterterrorism operations, promoting regional stability, \n     supporting Iraqi efforts to bring greater security to \n     Baghdad, and training and equipping Iraqi forces to take full \n     responsibility for their own security;\n       (7) United States military operations should, as much as \n     possible, be confined to these goals, and should charge the \n     Iraqi military with the primary mission of combating \n     sectarian violence;\n       (8) the military Rules of Engagement for this plan should \n     reflect this delineation of responsibilities, and the \n     Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \n     Staff should clarify the command and control arrangements in \n     Baghdad;\n       (9) the United States Government should transfer to the \n     Iraqi military, in an expeditious manner, such equipment as \n     is necessary;\n       (10) the United States Government should engage selected \n     nations in the Middle East to develop a regional, \n     internationally sponsored peace-and-reconciliation process \n     for Iraq;\n       (11) the Administration should provide regular updates to \n     the Congress, produced by the Commander of United States \n     Central Command and his subordinate commanders, about the \n     progress or lack of progress the Iraqis are making toward \n     this end; and\n       (12) our overall military, diplomatic, and economic \n     strategy should not be regarded as an ``open-ended'' or \n     unconditional commitment, but rather as a new strategy that \n     hereafter should be conditioned upon the Iraqi government's \n     meeting benchmarks that must be delineated in writing and \n     agreed to by the Iraqi Prime Minister. Such benchmarks should \n     include, but not be limited to, the deployment of that number \n     of additional Iraqi security forces as specified in the plan \n     in Baghdad, ensuring equitable distribution of the resources \n     of the Government of Iraq without regard to the sect or \n     ethnicity of recipients, enacting and implementing \n     legislation to ensure that the oil resources of Iraq benefit \n     Sunni Arabs, Shia Arabs, Kurds, and other Iraqi citizens in \n     an equitable manner, and the authority of Iraqi commanders to \n     make tactical and operational decisions without political \n     intervention.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 260.

In sales of logs, ties, poles, posts, cordwood, \n     pulpwood, and other forest products the amounts made \n     available for schools and roads by this section shall be \n     based upon the stumpage value of the timber.\n       Beginning October 1, 1976, the term ``moneys received'' \n     shall include all collections under the Act of June 9, 1930, \n     and all amounts earned or allowed any purchaser of national \n     forest timber and other forest products within such State as \n     purchaser credits, for the construction of roads on the \n     National Forest Transportation System within such national \n     forests or parts thereof in connection with any Forest \n     Service timber sales contract.\n       The Secretary of Agriculture shall, from time to time as he \n     goes through his process of developing the budget revenue \n     estimates, make available to the States his current \n     projections of revenues and payments estimated to be made \n     under the Act of May 23, 1908, as amended, or any other \n     special Acts making payments in lieu of taxes, for their use \n     for local budget planning purposes.

(16 U.S.C. \n     553)\n\n\n                Expenditures for Forest Fire Emergencies\n\n       Advances of money under any appropriation for the Forest \n     Service may be made to the Forest Service and by authority of \n     the Secretary of Agriculture to chiefs of field parties for \n     fighting forest fires in emergency cases and detailed \n     accounts arising under such advances shall be rendered \n     through and by the Department of Agriculture to the General \n     Account Office. (16 U.S.C. 556d)\n\n  Beginning in the late 1980s, timber sale receipts, the primary \nfunding source for the 25 Percent Fund Act, began a precipitous decline \nfor reasons I have explained earlier.\n  This plunge in receipts intensified and then bottomed out at a much \nlower level in the 1990s. The decline in receipts impacted rural \ncommunities in the West, particularly communities in Washington, \nOregon, northern California, and Idaho.\n  For example, fiscal year 1998 national forest revenues were $557 \nmillion--only 36 percent of the fiscal year 1989 peak revenues of \n$1.531 billion. In fiscal year 2004, national forest revenues were \n$281.1 million.\n  Payments to many States under the 25 Percent Fund Act declined by an \naverage of 70 percent from 1986 through 1998.\n  Now these are national figures. Those in Oregon were far more severe, \nreflecting the drastic halt in the Federal timber sale program there.\n  The problem was compounded because 18 Oregon counties have a \ndifferent revenue-sharing agreement with the Bureau of Land Management \nthat manages the O lands of western Oregon.\n  In the original 1937 statute, the BLM is required to give 75 percent \nof timber revenue to the O counties. For the benefit of my \ncolleagues, allow me to read this statute:\n\n         Public Law Number 405 of the 75th Congress--H.R. 7618\n\n       AN ACT Relating to the revested Oregon and California \n     Railroad and re-conveyed Coos Bay Wagon Road grant lands \n     situated in the State of Oregon.\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled, That \n     notwithstanding any provisions in the Acts of June 9, 1916 \n     (39 Stat. 218), and February 26, 1919 (40 Stat. 1179), as \n     amended, such portions of the revested Oregon and California \n     Railroad and reconveyed Coos Bay Wagon Road grant lands as \n     are or may hereafter come under the jurisdiction of the \n     Department of the Interior, which have heretofore or may \n     hereafter be classified as timberlands, and power-site lands \n     valuable for timber, shall be managed, except as provided in \n     section 3 hereof, for permanent forest production, and the \n     timber thereon shall be sold, cut, and removed in conformity \n     with the principal of sustained yield for the purpose of \n     providing a permanent source of timber supply, protecting \n     watersheds, regulating stream flow, and contributing to the \n     economic stability of local communities and industries, and \n     providing recreational facilities:\n       Provided, That nothing herein shall be construed to \n     interfere with the use and development of power sites as may \n     be authorized by law. The annual productive capacity for such \n     lands shall be determined and declared as promptly as \n     possible after the passage of this Act, but until such \n     determination and declaration are made the average annual cut \n     there from shall not exceed one-half billion feet board \n     measure:\n       Provided, That timber from said lands in an amount not less \n     than one-half billion feet board measure, or not less than \n     the annual sustained yield capacity when the same has been \n     determined and declared, shall be sold annually, or so much \n     thereof as can be sold at reasonable prices on a normal \n     market.\n       If the Secretary of the Interior determines that such \n     action will facilitate sustained-yield management, he may \n     subdivide such revested lands into sustained-yield forest \n     units, the boundary lines of which shall be so established \n     that a forest unit will provide, insofar as practicable, a \n     permanent source of raw materials for the support of \n     dependent communities and local industries of the region; but \n     until such subdivision is made the land shall be treated as a \n     single unit in applying the principle of sustained yield:\n       Provided, That before the boundary lines of such forest \n     units are established, the Department, after published notice \n     thereof, shall hold a hearing thereon in the vicinity of such \n     lands open to the attendance of State and local officers, \n     representatives of dependent industries, residents, and other \n     persons interested in the use of such lands.\n       Due consideration shall be given to established lumbering \n     operations in subdividing such lands when necessary to \n     protect the economic stability of dependent communities. \n     Timber sales from a forest unit shall be limited to the \n     productive capacity of such unit and the Secretary is \n     authorized, in his discretion, to reject any bids which may \n     interfere with the sustained-yield management plan of any \n     unit.\n       Section 2. The Secretary of the Interior is authorized, in \n     his discretion, to make cooperative agreements with other \n     Federal or State forest administrative agencies or with \n     private forest owners or operators for the coordinated \n     administration, with respect to time, rate, method of \n     cutting, and sustained yield, or forest units comprising \n     parts of revested or reconveyed lands, together with lands in \n     private ownership or under the administration of other public \n     agencies, when by such agreements he may be aided in \n     accomplishing the purposes hereinbefore mentioned.\n       Section 3. The Secretary of the Interior is authorized to \n     classify, either on application or otherwise, and restore to \n     homestead entry, or purchase under the provisions of section \n     14 of the Act of June 28, 1934 (48 Stat. 1269), any of such \n     revested or reconveyed land which, in his judgment, is more \n     suitable for agricultural use than for afforestation, \n     reforestation, stream-flow protection, recreation, or other \n     public purposes.\n       Any of said lands heretofore classified as agricultural may \n     be reclassified as timber lands, if found, upon examination, \n     to be more suitable for the production of trees than \n     agricultural use, such reclassified timber lands to be \n     managed for permanent forest production as herein provided.\n       Section 4. The Secretary of the Interior is authorized, in \n     his discretion, to lease for grazing any of said revested or \n     reconveyed lands which may be so used without interfering \n     with the production of timber or other purposes of this Act \n     as stated in section 1:\n       Provided, That all the moneys received on account of \n     grazing leases shall be covered either into the ``Oregon and \n     California land-grant fund'' or the ``Coos Bay Wagon Road \n     grant fund'' in the Treasury as the location of the leased \n     land shall determine, and be subject to distribution as other \n     moneys in such funds:\n       Provided further, That the Secretary is also authorized to \n     formulate rules and regulations for the use, protection, \n     improvement, and rehabilitation of such grazing lands.\n       Section 5. The Secretary of the Interior is hereby \n     authorized to perform any and all acts and to make such rules \n     and regulations as may be necessary and proper for the \n     purpose of carrying the provisions of this Act into full \n     force and effect.\n       The Secretary of the Interior is further authorized, in \n     formulating forest-practice rules and regulations, to consult \n     with the Oregon State Board of Forestry, representatives of \n     timber owners and operators on or contiguous to said revested \n     and reconveyed lands, and other persons or agencies \n     interested in the use of such lands.\n       In formulating regulations for the protection of such \n     timberlands against fire, the Secretary is authorized, in his \n     discretion, to consult and advise with Federal, State, and \n     county agencies engaged in forest-fire-protection work, and \n     to make agreements with such agencies for the cooperative \n     administration of fire regulations therein:\n       Provided, That rules and regulations for the protection of \n     the revested lands from fire shall conform with the \n     requirements and practices of the State of Oregon insofar as \n     the same are consistent with the interests of the United \n     States.\n     TITLE II\n       That on and after March 1, 1938, all moneys deposited in \n     the Treasury of the United States in the special fund \n     designated the ``Oregon and California land-grant fund'' \n     shall be distributed annually as follows:\n       (a) Fifty per centum to the counties in which the lands \n     revested under the Act of\n\n[[Page S1875]]\n\n     June 9, 1916 (39 Stat. 218), are situated, to be payable on \n     or after June 30, 1938, and each year thereafter to each of \n     said counties in the proportion that the total assessed value \n     of the Oregon and California grant lands in each of said \n     counties for the year 1915 bears to the total assessed value \n     of all of said lands in the State of Oregon for said year, \n     such moneys to be used as other county funds.\n       (b) Twenty-five per centum to said counties as money in \n     lieu of taxes accrued or which shall accrue to them prior to \n     March 1, 1938, under the provisions of the Act of July 13, \n     1926 (44 Stat. 915), and which taxes are unpaid on said date, \n     such moneys to be paid to said counties severally by the \n     Secretary of the Treasury of the United States, upon \n     certification by the Secretary of the Interior, until such \n     tax indebtedness as shall have accrued prior to March 1, \n     1938, is extinguished.\n       From and after payment of the above accrued taxes said 25 \n     per centum shall be accredited annually to the general fund \n     in the Treasury of the United States until all reimbursable \n     charges against the Oregon and California land-grant fund \n     owing to the general fund in the Treasury have been paid:\n       Provided, That if for any year after the extinguishment of \n     the tax indebtedness accruing to the counties prior to March \n     1, 1938, under the provisions of Forty-fourth Statutes, page \n     915, the total amount payable under subsection (a) of this \n     title is less than 78 per centum of the aggregate amount of \n     tax claims which accrued to said counties under said Act for \n     the year 1934, there shall be additionally payable for such \n     year such portion of said 25 per centum (but not in excess of \n     three-fifths of said 25 per centum), as may be necessary to \n     make up the deficiency.\n       When the general fund in the Treasury has been fully \n     reimbursed for the expenditures which were made charges \n     against the Oregon and California land-grant fund said 25 per \n     centum shall be paid annually, on or after June 30, to the \n     several counties in the manner provided in subsection (a) \n     hereof.\n       (c) Twenty-five per centum to be available for the \n     administration of this Act, in such annual amounts as the \n     Congress shall from time to time determine. Any part of such \n     per centum not used for administrative purposes shall be \n     covered into the general fund of the Treasury of the United \n     States:\n       Provided, That moneys covered into the Treasury in such \n     manner shall be used to satisfy the reimbursable charges \n     against the Oregon and California land-grant fund mentioned \n     in subsection (b) so long as any such charges shall exist.\n       All Acts or parts of Acts in conflict with this Act are \n     hereby repealed to the extent necessary to give full force \n     and effect to this Act.\n       Approved, August 28, 1937.\n\n  As my colleagues have just heard, the O Act mandates permanent \ntimber production from these lands for the benefit of the counties.\n  This is a drastically different management direction than the \nNational Forests. In fact, the act states that timber production should \nnot be less than half a billion board feet a year--500 million board \nfeet--but within the sustained yield level.\n  This means harvesting less than the growth rate of the trees, while \nstill meeting goals for protection of water and wildlife.\n  In the 1980s, the harvest level on the O lands was well in excess \nof a billion board feet per year. By 1990, harvest had fallen to 100 \nmillion board feet--a 94-percent drop within a decade.\n  Between the O Act and the 25 Percent Act, revenue sharing with \nOregon counties capitalized public services in my State for \ngenerations.\n  These funds literally built the libraries and schools and roads in \nthe rural parts of Oregon. They paid the bills, bought the books and \nkept communities safe.\n  And then, all of a sudden, those funds vanished into thin air. \nHundreds of communities in my State--landlocked by Federal land--were \nleft to wither and die on the Federal vine.\n  In some school districts, revenues from the Forest Service have \ndeclined by as much as 90 percent. Timber receipts to Grant County, OR, \nfor roads and schools declined from a high of $12.4 million in 1992 to \n$1.9 million in 1997.\n  Schools there operated 4 days a week. Road crews were laid off. Law \nenforcement and search and rescue were curtailed.\n  The evisceration of public services in rural counties was matched by \naffliction in the private sector. In April 1999, 14 of Oregon's 36 \ncounties had an unemployment rate at least twice the national average \nof 4.1 percent.\n  There were six counties with unemployment rates in excess of 10 \npercent, led by Grant County with nearly 17 percent.\n  It is by no means an exaggeration that this condition was a direct \nresult of Federal forest management decisions.\n  And Oregon was not the only State held to the flames. The shadow of \nthe Clinton forest philosophy fell upon every State with public lands.\n  Impacted communities in Idaho, Alaska, California, Montana, Texas, \nArkansas, Mississippi, West Virginia, and South Dakota were in equally \ndire circumstances.\n  Congress responded to the outcry of these communities. Led by my \ncolleague from Oregon, Senator Wyden, and my colleague from Idaho, \nSenator Craig--Congress developed a safety net to stop the hemorrhage.\n  The future of that safety net--and of the communities helplessly held \nin it--is why I stand in the Senate chamber today.\n  Mr. President, I do want to talk about Oregon impacts.\n  On October 30, 2000, Public Law 106-393 was signed into law to offset \nthe effect of decreased revenues available to States from declining \ntimber harvests on Federal lands.\n  Also known as the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-\nDetermination Act, it authorized a temporary alternative to the \nreceipts-based payment of the previous 100 years.\n  In essence, the Secure Rural Schools Act provided direct funding to \ncounties and States based on historic rather than actual timber \nharvests and receipts. This statute provided annual payments to States \nfor fiscal years 2001 to 2006. An eligible county had the option of \nelecting to receive its share of the State's 25-percent payment or its \nshare of the average of the State's three highest 25-percent payments \nfrom fiscal years 1986 through 1999.\n  Of the 717 counties and the 4,400 rural schools in 41 States that \nwere eligible for their share of the State's amount under the act, 550, \nor 77 percent, initially decided to accept that payment in fiscal year \n2001. By 2003, 615 counties, or 86 percent, of eligible counties took \nthe safety net payments rather than payment from actual timber \nharvests.\n  The majority of these counties are located in the western and \nsouthern portions of this country, while those that have remained under \nthe 25 Percent Fund Act are primarily in the Great Lakes area, where \nFederal timber harvest has remained sustainable.\n  Payments from National Forests authorized by the Secure Rural Schools \nAct have totaled over $1 billion, and have averaged over $301 million \neach year since the act was implemented. Payments have varied by region \nof the country. For example, the fiscal year 2004 payments distribution \nincluded approximately $37 million to southern States, $14 million to \nnortheast and midwest States, $273 million to Oregon, Washington, and \nCalifornia, and $71 million to the other western States.\n  I should note that these figures represent Forest Service \nallocations, and Oregon receives an additional payment for the O \nlands.\n  Funding derived from the Treasury has provided not only more stable \nfunding but also significantly higher payments than would have been the \ncase under the 25 Percent Fund. For example, if payments were still \nbased on 25 percent of actual timber receipts in 2004, the total \npayment to all States would be $71.4 million. In comparison, the full \npayment amount for all States for fiscal year 2005 is $395.7 million, \nan 82-percent difference nationwide.\n  When President Clinton signed the Secure Rural Schools bill into law, \nhis press release stated:\n\n       Rural communities will no longer be dependent on decreasing \n     federal timber sales to staff and equip schools and provide \n     essential government services.\n\n  However, the President wrongly assumed that his Northwest Forest Plan \nwas working. Again, his release stated:\n\n       The President's Pacific Northwest Forest Plan broke the \n     stalemate over the northern spotted owl, balancing the \n     preservation of old-growth stands with the economic needs of \n     timber-dependent communities.\n\n  While the current administration is doing what it can to bring \nFederal forest management up to speed, Oregon communities find \nthemselves in the same situation they were in a decade ago.\n  The county payments safety net expired last September. As this \nChamber considers this half-trillion-dollar spending bill, Oregon \ncounty commissioners are preparing for a budgetary doomsday scenario. \nLet me describe what this grim situation is looking like to them.\n\n[[Page S1876]]\n\n  Baker County: Home of the Oregon Trail Interpretive Center, the \nGeiser Grand Hotel, and named for COL Edward Baker--Mr. President, I \nwill bet you did not know that there is one State that has more than \ntwo statues in Statuary Hall. That State is Oregon. We all get two, but \nOregon got three because Edward Baker was a Senator killed in one of \nthe first actions of the Civil War at Ball's Bluff, VA. He was also a \nformer law partner to Abraham Lincoln.\n  He found his way on a speechmaking tour to Oregon. They were so \nimpressed with him they asked him to be their Senator. I have his seat \ntoday. He came back here as a sitting Senator and as an officer in the \nUnited States cavalry. While serving in both capacities, he lost his \nlife. So Edward Baker, an Oregonian only briefly, has the third statue \nfor Oregon in Statuary Hall. It is said that at his funeral, conducted \nin the Rotunda, it was difficult to hear because of the audible \nsobbings of the President of the United States, Abraham Lincoln.\n  In 2004, the Baker County Road Department received $577,000 from the \nSecure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act. If the Baker \nCounty Road Department had to rely on actual timber receipt revenue, \nthey would have received only a fraction of that. In 2004, the Baker \nCounty School District received $211,000 from the safety net.\n  Let me go to Benton County, the home of the Oregon State Beavers. It \nis one of seven counties nationwide to be named for a U.S. Senator, \nThomas Hart Benton of Missouri--a longtime advocate of the development \nof Oregon country. Benton County stands to lose 15 percent of its \ngeneral discretionary budget, including $285,000 from its road \ndepartment.\n  Clackamas County, home of Mount Hood and the historic Timberline \nLodge that President Roosevelt dedicated. Between 1984 and 2001, timber \nharvest fell on the Mount Hood National Forest by 97 percent.\n  Clackamas County stands to lose $10 million per year without an \nextension of the safety net.\n  In 2004, the Clackamas County Road Department alone received over $4 \nmillion from the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination \nAct. If the Clackamas County Road Department had to rely on actual \ntimber receipt revenue, they would have received $333,128 from U.S. \nForest Service lands, a 92-percent reduction in these Federal funds.\n  Clackamas County schools will receive $1.5 million a year from the \nSecure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act. That goes \naway.\n  Columbia County: In 2004, their discretionary general fund received \nover $2 million from the safety net. This represents 31 percent of \nColumbia County's discretionary general fund.\n  Coos County used to be home to the world's largest lumber-exporting \nport. Coos County has not only been hard hit by Federal timber \npolicies, but by the collapse of federally managed fisheries.\n  The safety net provides nearly $8 million a year to Coos County--more \nthan twice what the county can collect in property taxes. Without the \nsafety net, 45 percent of its road and general fund will vanish.\n  County officials expect to lay off a third of their road crew. \nNineteen employees at the Coos County Sheriff's Department have already \nreceived their pink slips telling them not to show up for work on \nFebruary 27. These workers included corrections officers, two patrol \ndeputies, a 911 dispatcher, and two animal control officers. Additional \ncuts will be made from the district attorney's office, juvenile court \ncounselors, and the public health department.\n  I should note that these types of services are constitutionally \nrequired for counties to provide.\n  Crook County: Home of the Ochoco National Forest, where timber \nharvest fell 98 percent between 1991 and 2006. If the safety net is not \nextended, Crook County stands to lose 28 percent of its general \ndiscretionary budget. Its roads and its schools are in great jeopardy.\n  In 2004, the Crook County Road Department received over $2 million \nfrom the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act. If \nthe Crook County Road Department had to rely on actual timber receipt \nrevenue, they would have received $33,160 from U.S. Forest Service \nlands--a 99-percent reduction in Federal funds.\n  In 2004, the Crook County School District received $746,535 from the \nsafety net.\n  Curry County lies in the far southwest corner of Oregon.\n  Cape Blanco in Curry County stretches out in the Pacific Ocean to \nform the most western point in the lower 48.\n  You ought to see how beautiful it is there, Mr. President.\n  It shares with Josephine County the Siskiyou National Forest, the \nsite of the 2002 Biscuit Fire--the largest in Oregon history. Between \n1989 and the year of that colossal wildfire, timber harvest on the \nSiskiyou National Forest dropped 99.5 percent.\n  As such, Curry County stands to lose 62 percent of its general \ndiscretionary fund. This translates into the loss of seven sheriff's \ndeputies, two county assessors, cutbacks in juvenile services, and loss \nof a deputy district attorney.\n  The county sheriff's office presently takes about 52 percent of the \ncounty's ``safety net'' dollars, which means that if they had \nreductions to cover the amount of their percentage, it would lose all \nof its patrol deputies, two sergeants, its only lieutenant, and two \njailors.\n  The Curry County Road Department will lose 75 percent of its entire \nbudget.\n  The Brookings-Harbor School District is going to lose $700,000 from \nthe safety net. Curry County is one of those places so dominated by \nFederal land that new tax revenue from property development is simply \nimpossible. Only 3 percent of the land base is developable.\n  Deschutes County is a high desert paradise with snow-capped \nmountains, rugged mountain bike trails, swift whitewater, and the \nSisters Rodeo, the ``Biggest Little Show in the World.'' Timber harvest \nin the Deschutes National Forest fell 83 percent between 1985 and 1999. \nLarge forest fires continue to mar the landscape there, causing \nevacuations of local communities nearly every summer. We don't manage \nit. We just burn it now. They are going to lose huge amounts of their \ncounty budgets: from the road department, a 79-percent reduction; from \nthe Bend/LaPine School District, they will lose $651,000 from the \nsafety net.\n  Then Douglas County, timber capital of the world and home to Johnny \nCash's ``Lumberjack.'' Given the wood-basket of Douglas Fir, many \nbelieve this county was named after the silviculturist David Douglas. \nBut Douglas County was actually named for Stephen Douglas, Abraham \nLincoln's opponent in the 1860 Presidential election. Douglas was an \nardent congressional supporter for Oregon's entry into the Union. \nTimber harvest on their forest, the Umpqua National Forest, fell 99 \npercent between 1984 and 2004. In 2004, Douglas County's discretionary \ngeneral fund received over $26 million from the safety net. This \nrepresents 78 percent of Douglas County's discretionary general fund. \nThe Douglas County Road Department received over $13 million from the \nSecure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act. If the \nDouglas County Road Department had to rely on actual timber receipts, \nthey would have received $791,000, a-94 percent loss of Federal \nrevenue.\n  The Roseburg School District 4 received a $1.8 million from the \nsafety net in 2004. That goes away.\n  Grant County, home of the John Day Fossil Beds National Monument and \nthe Malheur National Forest, timber harvest on that dropped 98 percent. \nMore than 60 percent of Grant County is owned by the public, and their \ndiscretionary fund is going to drop a whopping amount as well. They \nwill lose millions in road and school funding. Two of its three county \npatrol officers will be eliminated. Sixty-two percent of the land in \nJohn Day School District is federally owned, so the district was \nheavily dependent on Federal forest fees. As a result, in 1998, the \ndistrict went to a 4-day school week. We always talk about No Child \nLeft Behind. We are going to leave a lot of Oregon kids behind if we \ndon't keep this bargain.\n  Harney County, home of Steens Mountain, part of the county's 77 \npercent public ownership. You ought to see Steens Mountain, be down on \nthe Alvord flat, a salt flat, and see the sun come up in the morning \nand hit those\n\n[[Page S1877]]\n\nmountains and turn them pink. It is astonishingly beautiful. They are \ngoing to get hammered. Their road department is going to lose 70 \npercent of its funding. Their school district will lose nearly \n$700,000.\n  Hood River County, home of pear orchards, wind surfing, and skiing. \nIn fact, John Kerry still goes there a lot to wind surf, wind surfing \ncapital of the world. Hood River County stands to lose 32 percent of \nits discretionary funds without the safety net. The road department \nloses over a million, and their school district will lose half a \nmillion and more.\n  Jackson County, home of the Oregon Shakespearean Festival, dominated \nby the BLM's O lands. Jackson County faces a $20 million shortfall \nwithout a county payments extension, 33 percent of its road and general \nbudget. Jackson County is on the verge of closing all 15 of its public \nlibraries, if the safety net is not extended. The county also plans to \nlay off 30 positions in health and human services and reduce the number \nof jail beds. In 2004, the Jackson County Road Department received over \n$3.8 million from county payments. If they had to rely on actual timber \nharvests, they would have received a 97-percent reduction in Federal \nfunds.\n  Jefferson County, home of Mount Jefferson--that is a pretty place--\nBlack Butte, Warm Springs Indian Reservation, 300 days of sunshine a \nyear. In 2004, the Jefferson County Road Department received $445,000 \nfrom the county payments. If the Jefferson County Road Department had \nto rely on actual timber receipts, they would have received $89,000 \nfrom the U.S. Forest Service.\n  Josephine County, the home of Oregon Caves National Monument and the \nRogue River, 62 percent of Josephine County is publicly owned. They are \ngoing to lose 79 percent of their county's general discretionary funds.\n  Klamath County, home of Crater Lake, the deepest lake in North \nAmerica and Oregon's first national park. Klamath County is also the \nhome of the devastating shutoff of irrigation water by Federal agencies \nin 2001. In 2004, Klamath County's discretionary general fund received \nover $3 million from the safety net. This represents nearly 30 percent \nof their general discretionary budget.\n  Lake County, home of the Hart Mountain National Antelope Refuge--78 \npercent of that county is owned by the Federal Government. Lake County \nstands to lose 50 percent of its discretionary general funds--again, \nroads and schools.\n  Lane County was named for the great Joseph Lane, first territorial \nGovernor, first U.S. Senator from Oregon. Lane County is one of the \nlargest recipients of safety net dollars, and for good reason. This was \nthe epicenter of the spotted owl controversy, and timber harvest was \ncut back there more than anywhere else in the Nation.\n  Mr. President, I don't want to abuse your time. I am trying to make a \npoint here. You can probably tell that. I speak more out of sorrow than \nanger, but I am angry, too. It is a tragedy. Both parties are guilty in \nthe mutation from the Federal Government becoming Oregon's protagonist \nto its antagonist. I was going to tell you more about Lane County and \nLinn County, named for U.S. Senator James Linn of Missouri--another \nMissouri Senator has an Oregon County named for him.\n  I was going to tell you about Lincoln County, home of Depoe Bay, the \nwhale-watching capital of the world. They will get hammered, too.\n  Marion County, home of the State capitol, the largest producer of \nagricultural products in Oregon. The Marion berry--you have probably \nheard of that--is delicious.\n  Morrow County; Polk County named for James K. Polk, one of our unsung \ngreat Presidents.\n  Tillamook County--you probably heard of Tillamook cheese. It is \nfabulous. Their county is in real peril because 64 percent of Tillamook \nCounty is publicly owned, and nearly 20 percent of its total \ndiscretionary budget is at risk\n  Union County, land of the Grand Ronde Valley, is near my home. This \ncounty is right in the middle of Federal forest lands. They will suffer \na 55-percent reduction in Federal funds.\n  Wallowa County is a little Switzerland. It is one of the loveliest \nplaces on Earth. It is where Oregon joins the Rocky Mountains. Their \ncounty stands to lose a tremendous percentage of their ability to \ncontinue.\n  Yamhill County. If you like Oregon pinot noirs--I don't drink them, \nbut a lot of people like Oregon pinot noirs--they come from Yamhill \nCounty. They are in trouble. And they are in trouble. Wheeler County.\n\n  Mr. President, I have talked enough, and you have been indulgent of \nme. I promised the majority leader I would take only the time he wanted \nme to speak. But the Federal Government owns my State--more than half \nof it. It incentivized the development of Oregon's resources. It laid \ndown the terms for the development of timber in Oregon. It built my \nState. I will bet it even helped build some of the homes in which you \nlive.\n  But the environmental ethic changed. Whatever side you come down on, \nin the middle of that contest are people and counties and governmental \nservices that need to be continued until the Federal Government can \nfigure out the right balance in the economic/environmental equation.\n  I have been down here talking a long time. I have to look for every \nopportunity to keep talking because I need to awaken my colleagues to \nthe Federal obligation that exists to real people with real concerns \nand with a real claim on the Federal Government. As we look for \noffsets, let me simply say that we are out of time.\n  The real offset ought to be the honor of the Federal Government. It \nought to meet this obligation until it can resolve this dispute. \nPresident Clinton tried, President Bush has tried, but the Congress and \nthe courts have been in the way. In the meantime, my colleague and I \nneed the Federal Government to get out of the way and continue to help \nus, instead of hurting the people whom it grew Oregon to bless.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/12/senate-section/article/S1877-1", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1877]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 10 A.M.
