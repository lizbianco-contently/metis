Mr. President, last Thursday a bipartisan majority of the \nSenate passed H.R. 1591. A conference report is basically what it was. \nThis bill will be sent to the President's desk tomorrow. I have and \nwill continue to encourage the President to set aside his veto threats \nand sign the bill. Our conference report honors and provides for our \ncourageous men and women in uniform. It addresses emergencies Americans \nface at home while the war in Iraq rages, and makes our country more \nsecure by charting a new course in Iraq so we can return our focus to \nthe global challenges that lie ahead. This is a good and responsible \nbill. It will begin the long process of leading us out of a war that \nhas cost so many American lives and so much treasure. It not only \nrepresents the will of Congress but also the will of the American \npeople, who call for a new course, and the expertise of the military \nexperts who tell us this war can only be won politically, not \nmilitarily, including the commander on the ground there, General \nPetraeus, who said exactly that, the war cannot be won militarily.\n\n[[Page S5262]]\n\n  Regrettably, the President declared he would veto this bill even \nbefore Congress completed action on it. He has been talking about this \nfor several weeks. As conditions on the ground continue to deteriorate, \nthat position has become increasingly isolated. In the face of this \ncontinued deterioration, this Congress stands firm with the American \npeople. We are resolved to do what we can to see if the President will \nchange course. We ask the President to listen to Congress, to the \nAmerican people, and to his own military experts.\n  The President requested $91.5 billion for continued military \noperations in Iraq and Afghanistan. We provided every penny of that \nrequest and much more for the military. We provided, in addition, funds \nfor emergencies here at home such as rebuilding the gulf coast, \nrecovering from agricultural disasters, repairing gaps in homeland \nsecurity, and keeping the children healthy and insured. Most \nimportantly, we provided a way forward to end the war in Iraq \nresponsibly.\n  The way forward is consistent with what our military leaders are \ntelling us, including General Petraeus, who repeated again last week on \nseveral occasions that this war can only be won politically, not \nmilitarily. The plan, and the conference report that will be sent to \nthe President tomorrow, immediately transitions the U.S. mission away \nfrom policing the civil war, begins a phased redeployment of our combat \ntroops no later than October 1, 2007, with the goal of removing all \nforces by April 1, 2008, imposes tangible, measurable, and achievable \nbenchmarks on the Iraqi Government, launches the kind of diplomatic, \neconomic, and political offensive the President's strategy lacks, and \nrebuilds our overburdened military.\n  Today we renew our call to President Bush. There is still time to \nlisten. There is still time to come to grips with the facts on the \nstreets of Baghdad and throughout Iraq. There is still time to sign \nthis bill and change course in Iraq. In the 4 days since we passed the \nconference report, new facts have come to light that make our call for \na new direction even more urgent.\n  This past weekend the United States death toll in Iraq for April now \nis at 104, with all reported deaths not yet known, making it the \ndeadliest month of the year and one of the deadliest of the entire war. \nThat bears repeating. Despite the President's claims of progress, this \nhas been one of the deadliest months of this 4-going-on-5-year war.\n  Also this weekend the Special Inspector General for Iraq \nReconstruction released his quarterly report that paints a dispiriting \npicture of our $20 billion rebuilding efforts. It was all over the \nnews; today all over America. The report concludes that rebuilding \nefforts are falling far short of their targets. As a result, after more \nthan 4 years of these efforts, Iraq is ``plagued by power outages, \ninadequate oil production, and shortages of clean water and health \ncare.''\n  The report also tells us that despite spending more than three-\nquarters of our allocated funds to increase electricity production, \nIraq's power grid now produces far less electricity than before the \ninvasion, with Baghdad averaging 6.5 hours of electricity per day, down \nfrom almost 24 hours before the war. The report tells us that despite \nspending nearly 2 billion American dollars, our efforts to provide \nIraqis with clean drinking water are falling miserably short. This \nreport tells us oil production, a critical component of any future \nstable Iraq economy, is still way off target.\n  President Bush continues to ask for our patience and continues to \nboast of progress, but this report gives us no reason to believe \nconditions for the Iraqi people are improving any more than they are \nfor our troops. This morning the Washington Post reported that Iraq's \nPrime Minister al-Malaki is behind the removal and disruption of the \nduty of some of the Iraqi Army and police force's top law enforcement \nofficials. Why? The apparent reason for the dismissal is they are doing \na good job of combating violent Shiite militias. This has ``angered \nU.S. and Iraqi leaders who say the Shiite-led government is sabotaging \nthe military to achieve sectarian goals.''\n  It is yet another reason for us to seriously question whether the \nIraqi Government has the ability or even desire to make the political \ncompromises so essential to ending the conflict.\n  Finally, this weekend, of all places, the Portland, ME Press Herald \npublished an editorial. This is one of many from around the country. \nThey wrote:\n\n       It is time to bring our troops home from Iraq. This stand \n     represents a shift in the newspaper's editorial position. \n     Until now, we have supported the military mission in Iraq, \n     though at times we have been harshly critical of President \n     Bush in his role as commander in chief. Now, it is our \n     opinion that major U.S. military operations should cease . . \n     .\n\n  It seems as though every day new facts emerge that give us ever \ngreater insight into the astonishing disaster unfolding in Iraq. Just 4 \ndays since the Senate passed the supplemental conference report, the \nfour grim new facts I mentioned have emerged, and this is only the \nlatest and not all of the latest.\n  The President wonders why the American people have lost patience. It \nis because the news out of Iraq grows worse by the day. When we send \nthe supplemental conference report to President Bush tomorrow, we ask \nthat he take time to reflect on the fact of that veto. We ask him to \nlisten again to the American people. From Maine to California, from \nMinnesota to Florida, we ask him to listen to the American people and \nhis own military experts. We ask that he finally summon the courage to \nadmit he made mistakes and take the steps we propose to heal the grave \nwounds caused by this war. This bill gives him a path forward. We ask \nhim to follow it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/30/senate-section/article/S5262-1", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5262]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, my good friend the majority leader \nneglected to mention the front-page story in the New York Times \nyesterday about the extraordinary success our troops are having in \nAnbar Province, the center of much of the al-Qaida activity in Iraq, \nwith Sunni sheikhs, tribal leaders coming together to support, not just \nverbally but in terms of supplying military personnel, fighters to take \non al-Qaida in Anbar Province. It is a piece of good news in admittedly \na cloudy picture in Iraq. It is also the case, I am confident, that a \nmajority of Democrats in both the House and Senate believe that funds \nshould be supplied for the troops. That certainly has been the view of \nthe chairman of the Armed Services Committee, Carl Levin. Hopefully, we \nwill find a way forward after the bill that regretfully has the \nsurrender date in it tomorrow is sent down to the President and vetoed. \nBeginning Wednesday, we will be discussing how to go forward. The \nmajority leader and I have had some preliminary discussion about that. \nHopefully, we can resolve this matter in the very near future to \nprovide the funding for the troops so General Petraeus's mission, for \nwhich we confirmed him 81 to nothing, will have the resources to be \ncompleted later this year.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/30/senate-section/article/S5262-3", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5262]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, speaking on the same matters addressed by \nboth the majority and minority leader, I remind our colleagues that \nlast week this body passed by a very narrow margin what amounts to a \nstrategy for defeat in Iraq. This course of action was not a surprise. \nAfter all, the majority leader had announced to the world that the war \nwas lost. This, of course, was news\n\n[[Page S5263]]\n\nto people in Iraq, our soldiers in the field included.\n  For example, SGT George Turkovich was quoted in the Las Vegas Review-\nJournal, saying:\n\n       We're not losing this war. Unfortunately, politics has \n     taken a huge role in this war affecting our rules of \n     engagement. This is a guerilla war that we're fighting, and \n     they're going to tie our hands. So it does make it a lot \n     harder for us to fight the enemy, but we're not losing this \n     war.\n\n  This is from a 24-year-old a half a world away.\n  I suspect the announcement that we had lost the war was also a \nsurprise to General Petraeus. Remember, we confirmed him unanimously in \nthis body. We knew what his strategy was. He has testified about it \nwhen he came here for his confirmation hearings. In fact, he had \nwritten a book about it.\n\n  Many in this body, I fear, have forgotten what he said. In a Pentagon \nbriefing, last week, when he returned from the theater to brief us on \nthe status of the conflict, he reminded us:\n\n       [A]s I noted during my confirmation hearing, military \n     action is necessary but not [a] sufficient [condition]. We \n     can provide the Iraqis an opportunity, but they will have to \n     exploit it.\n\n  Now, I mention this because the majority leader and others have \nquoted General Petraeus as saying this war can only be won politically, \nnot militarily. What General Petraeus actually said was: ``Military \naction is necessary but not sufficient.'' He has pointed out over and \nover that the political compromises and decisions and agreements that \nneed to be made cannot be made in the context of the violence and \ninstability that exists in Iraq today.\n  Let me quote him again. He said:\n\n       The situation is, in short, exceedingly challenging, though \n     as I will briefly explain, there has been progress in several \n     areas in recent months despite the sensational attacks by al \n     Qaeda, which have, of course, been significant blows to our \n     effort and which cause psychological damage that is typically \n     even greater than their physical damage.\n\n  He said:\n\n       And I again note that we are really just getting started \n     with the new effort.\n\n  He concluded by saying:\n\n       Success will take continued commitment, perseverance and \n     sacrifice, all to make possible an opportunity for the all-\n     important Iraqi political actions that are the key to long-\n     term solutions to Iraq's many problems. Because we are \n     operating in new areas and challenging elements in those \n     areas, this effort may get harder before it gets easier.\n\n  He predicted this. He said, likely we will have more casualties as we \nramp up our efforts because the fighting will be more intense, and that \nis a necessary precondition to creating the peace and stability which \nwe hope to achieve by this increase in our activity.\n  So it is mystifying to me those on the other side of the aisle can \nsay we should withdraw now because the war is lost and that the only \nsolution is a political solution, but we are going to pass a bill \ndenying the President and General Petraeus, the State Department, and \nothers much of the economic reconstruction funding we need to achieve \nthe political solution. As the majority leader noted, there is still \nmuch to be done in Iraq, other than on the military side of the \nequation, just getting things up and running there.\n  But this is the bill sent to the President, after months of delay, \nincluding 2 weeks when the other body was in recess. There, of course, \nwas no recess for our troops, nor for the Pentagon, which, according to \nSecretary Gates, in an April 11 letter to Congress, told of the \ndisruptions already taking place.\n  Let me describe what some of those disruptions from this lack of \nfunding are: reducing Army quality-of-life initiatives, including \nroutine upgrade of barracks and other facilities; reducing the repair \nand maintenance of equipment necessary for deployment training; \ncurtailing the training of Army Guard and Reserve units within the \nUnited States, reducing their readiness levels.\n  This may be just the beginning of what is to come if this \nsupplemental funding is further delayed. The National Journal, this \nmorning, reported: ``Democrats have set a Memorial Day deadline to send \nBush a reconstructed supplemental.'' Memorial Day--a month away. Why \nthe further delay, when everyone knows the detriment to the training \nand equipment availability for our troops that has resulted already \nfrom the delay in funding? This would be dangerously irresponsible, and \nthe impacts will get only more significant over time.\n  Here are some of the additional results that will occur: reducing the \npace of equipment overhaul work at Army depots, which will likely \nexacerbate the equipment availability problems facing stateside units; \ncurtailing training rotations for Brigade Combat Teams currently \nscheduled for overseas deployment. Such a step would likely require the \nfurther extension of currently deployed forces until their replacements \nwere judged ready for deployment. The self-fulfilling prophecy that \nwould result from the lack of funding is: Our colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle say we are going to have our troops have to be in \ntheater a longer period of time. Answer: Yes, if you continue to deny \nthe funding, that is exactly what will happen.\n  It will also delay the acceleration of additional modularized Army \nbrigades necessary to expand the Army unit rotational pool and reduce \nthe stress on existing units. This must be what GEN Peter Schoomaker, \nwho is the Army Chief of Staff, meant when he stated, the Army ``will \nbe forced to take increasingly draconian measures which will impact \nArmy readiness and impose hardships on our Soldiers and their \nfamilies.''\n  These political delays are keeping much needed lifesaving equipment \nout of the hands of our troops as well. I supported the amendment \noffered by the senior Senator from Delaware to add an additional $1.5 \nbillion for the Mine Resistant Ambush Protected vehicles, the so-called \nMRAPs, which, on top of the $1.83 billion for the services the \nPresident requested, would get these vehicles into the field now. As \nthe senior Senator from Delaware said:\n\n       MRAP could reduce the casualties in vehicles due to IED \n     attack by as much as 80 percent.\n\n  So why would we further delay the funding to get these vehicles into \nthe hands of our troops? Delaying this all the way to Memorial Day \nsimply means further delays in getting this equipment to the troops.\n  Meanwhile, though we cannot get this funding to the troops, the \nmajority is feverishly at work adding unrequested, nonemergency \nspending to the bill--all in an apparent effort to try to cobble \ntogether enough votes to actually pass the bill, since the underlying \nsurrender date is so unpopular.\n  The bill includes over $21 billion in unrequested items--$21 billion. \nAmong them is title V, which provides $3.5 billion in emergency \nagricultural assistance--things such as $60 million for salmon \nfisheries. The bill also includes provisions such as--and by the way, \nneither the Senate nor the House put these provisions in the bill; they \nwere added in the conference committee--such as an extension of the \nPharmacy Plus program in Wisconsin. Now, I am on the Finance Committee, \nand we did not consider this in the Finance Committee. It is, \nobviously, not an emergency, but, apparently, there were some folks \nfrom Wisconsin who could be brought along in support of the vote if \nthis was added to the bill.\n\n  These provisions have no place in the bill. They should not return in \nthe final bill after the President has exercised his veto tomorrow and \nthe majority decides to get serious and pass legislation which the \nPresident can actually sign.\n  My recommendation to the President, if they are included, is to veto \nthe bill. The military troops should not be forced to carry the pork of \nMembers on their backs. This bill should be vetoed both because of the \nsurrender date and because of the pork. It is time to end wasteful \nWashington spending, especially when it is being carried on the backs \nof our troops in an emergency supplemental bill.\n  I saw the items: the spinach farms, the peanut storage, the tropical \nfish, bailouts for sugar beets. Let these provisions go through the \nnormal channels. If they have merit, their sponsors should be able to \ncarry the day and get them supported. If not, then we should not be \nsupporting them anyway. But let's not slow down the money for the \ntroops just in the name of some special parochial earmark.\n  One thing that has been lost, I would add, in the race to enact this \nstrategy for defeat is the consequences for this premature--this \nsetting a deadline for\n\n[[Page S5264]]\n\nsurrender. Remember, this is the first time ever in the middle of a war \nwe would set a date and say: At this time we will be out of there. The \nmessage it sends to the enemy is--well, it is unthinkable. But think \nabout the message it sends to the Iraqis who have fought along our side \nand to our troops and their families. It would be a nightmare for the \nIraqi people were we to leave. As President Bush said:\n\n       [T]o step back now would force a collapse of the Iraqi \n     government, tear the country apart, and result in mass \n     killings on an unimaginable scale.\n\n  Do we want to be responsible for that in this body, the mass killings \nthat would result--exactly what we criticized Saddam Hussein for when \nhe was in power? It would not end with an American withdrawal in Iraq, \neither. As General Anthony Zinni said:\n\n       This is no Vietnam or Somalia or those places where you can \n     walk away. If we just pull out, we will find ourselves back \n     in short order.\n\n  Failing in Iraq would set back the entire region. The Brookings \nInstitution--no big supporter of the President, I would add--argues, in \ntheir study, that:\n\n       Iraq appears to have many of the conditions most conducive \n     to spillover because there is a high degree of foreign \n     ``interest'' in Iraq. Ethnic, tribal, and religious troops \n     within Iraq are equally prevalent in neighboring countries \n     and they share many of the same grievances. Iraq has a \n     history of violence with its neighbors, which has fostered \n     desires for vengeance and fomented constant clashes. Iraq \n     also possesses resources that its neighbors covet--oil being \n     the most obvious, but important religious shrines also figure \n     in the mix. There is a high degree of commerce and \n     communication between Iraq and its neighbors, and its borders \n     are porous. All of this suggests that spillover from an Iraqi \n     civil war would tend toward the more dangerous end of the \n     spillover spectrum.\n\n  We know Iran and Syria are fostering instability in Iraq. Al-Qaida \nand Hezbollah are both active there as well. Chaos in Iraq could draw \nin Saudi Arabia, and Saudi officials have threatened ``massive \nintervention to stop Iranian-backed Shiite militias from butchering \nIraqi Sunnis.'' Kurdish succession could well cause Turkish \nintervention in the region.\n  Failing in Iraq would be a dramatic setback in the war on terror. \nIraq must not be divorced from its context--the struggle between the \nforces of moderation and extremism in the Muslim world.\n  Al-Qaida has been in Iraq since before the United States invaded and \nhas dedicated itself to fomenting sectarian violence there. Much of the \nviolence between Shia and Sunni is a result of prodding by al-Qaida, \nstarting primarily with the blowing up of the Golden Mosque in Samarra.\n  Osama bin Laden himself referred to Iraq--I am quoting him--as the \n``capital of the Caliphate,'' arguing that ``The most . . . serious \nissue today for the whole world is this Third World War . . . [that] is \nraging in [Iraq].'' Those are not my words. That is what Osama bin \nLaden said.\n  One of the terrorism experts, Peter Bergen, said this:\n\n       [U.S. withdrawal] would fit all too neatly into Osama bin \n     Laden's master narrative about American foreign policy. His \n     theme is that America is a paper tiger that cannot tolerate \n     body bags coming home; to back it up, he cites President \n     Ronald Reagan's 1984 withdrawal of United States troops from \n     Lebanon and President Bill Clinton's decision nearly a decade \n     later to pull troops from Somalia. A unilateral pullout from \n     Iraq would only confirm this analysis of American weakness \n     among his jihadist allies.\n\n  Failure in Iraq will encourage further attacks against the United \nStates and provide a base from which to plan and train for attacks.\n  I must remind my friends, if you are going to push this legislation \nthrough, the strategy for defeat, you have a responsibility to tell the \nAmerican people what the consequences will be and to tell them how you \nwould respond. These are the burdens of being in the majority. These \nare the burdens of making the difficult decisions we make in this body.\n  I urge my colleagues to work together to develop a supplemental \nappropriations bill that President Bush can quickly sign, that will get \nthe funding to our troops and enable us to give the strategy a chance \nto succeed so that the horrible consequences I have described will not \nbe the result of our actions.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, last week, while the media covered Iraq \nand U.S. attorneys, the Senate spent 3 days debating and passing \nperhaps the most important piece of legislation of this 2-year session. \nAlmost no one noticed. The America COMPETES Act, which was the name of \nthe legislation, authorized $60 billion over 4 years to, among other \nthings, double spending for physical sciences research, recruit 10,000 \nnew math and science teachers, and retrain 250,000 more, provide grants \nto researchers, and invest more in high-risk, high-payoff research.\n  These were recommendations of a National Academy of Sciences task \nforce that had been asked to tell Congress--to tell us--exactly what we \nneeded to do to help America keep its brainpower advantage so we can \nkeep our jobs from going to China and India.\n  Last year, the Senate--but not the House--enacted task force \nrecommendations to encourage ``insourcing brainpower'' by giving legal \nresidency to skilled foreign students and researchers. Both Houses \nextended the research and development tax credit.\n  The process for this legislation was as exemplary as the substance. \nSenators and their staffs worked across party lines for 2 years. Senior \ncommittee members, chairmen and ranking members, waived jurisdictional \nprerogatives. The administration participated in extensive homework \nsessions with Senators and outside experts. The effort was so \nbipartisan that when the Senate shifted to the Democrats in January, \nthe new majority leader and minority leader introduced the same bill \ntheir predecessors had in the last Congress. Seventy Senators \ncosponsored the legislation. Even though no cloture motion was filed, 9 \namendments were voted upon, and 32 more amendments were addressed \nwithin 4 days. The final vote was 88 to 8.\n  Anyone who knows the Senate knows that the final margin masks how \ndifficult passage was. There were concerted efforts to derail the bill \nby those with different ideas about policy and about spending. Yet this \nsuccess with competitiveness suggests three lessons for dealing with \nother issues that are simply too big to be solved by one party alone, \nsuch as immigration, to which the majority leader has indicated we will \nturn in May, such as health insurance, such as energy independence, \nsuch as terrorism, and such as Iraq.\n  These are the three lessons as I see them:\n  First, most ideas in the Senate fail for lack of the idea. The first \nstep in our success was when Senator Jeff Bingaman and I asked the \nNational Academy of Sciences the following question more than 2 years \nago:\n\n       What are the top 10 actions, in priority order, that \n     Federal policymakers can take to enhance the science and \n     technology enterprise so that the United States can \n     successfully compete, prosper and be secure in the global \n     community of the 21st century?\n\n  The Academy's 21-member task force, headed by former Lockheed Martin \nchairman and CEO Norm Augustine and including 3 Nobel laureates, gave \nup their summer, reviewed hundreds of proposals, and presented us with \n20 specific recommendations in response to our question. These 20 \nrecommendations, along with the work of the Council on Competitiveness \nand the President's ideas, gave us something to work with other than \npet projects of various Members of Congress.\n  The second lesson is that bipartisanship is possible, even on complex \nissues. From the framing of the question to the introduction of the \nfinal legislation by the majority and minority leader, every effort was \nbipartisan. When Senator Domenici, for example, went to see President \nBush, he invited Senator Bingaman, a Democrat, to go, as well as me, a \nRepublican. Staffs worked so closely together that no one could say \nwhether it was a Republican bill or a Democratic bill.\n  Third, and finally, the last lesson is that, unfortunately, \nbipartisan success, even on the biggest, most complex issues, has an \nexcellent chance of remaining a secret. Despite the size of the \naccomplishment, the passage of the 208-page America COMPETES Act was \nbarely noticed by the major media. This is not a complaint, merely an \nobservation. More than ever, the media,\n\n[[Page S5265]]\n\noutside interest groups, and party structures reward conflict and the \ntaking of irreconcilable positions. There is little reward for \nreconciling principled positions into legislation.\n  Here is another example: The work of the bipartisan Iraq Study Group \nwas consigned almost immediately to the shelf as a bookend. Somewhere, \nthere is a letter to President Bush from 10 Senators, 5 from each \nparty, offering to work together with him to help every American have \naffordable health insurance.\n  Although there is not much attention paid to this kind of legislative \nactivity, I am convinced the American people and most Senators are \nhungry for it. I believe the last election was as much about the \nconduct of business in Washington, DC, as it was about the conduct of \nthe war in Iraq. Americans are tired of what they perceive as Senators \nplaying petty, kindergarten, partisan games while there are big issues \nthat cannot be solved by one party alone. Americans know we need a \npolitical solution to Iraq in Washington, DC, as much as we need one in \nBaghdad.\n  The irony is that last week's culmination of 2 years of work on the \nAmerica COMPETES Act demonstrates that the Senate is capable of \ntackling big, complex issues in a bipartisan way, but that we will have \nto look beyond the influences of the media, special interest groups, \nand the political party apparatus for encouragement to do it.\n  Virtue, as ever, will be its own reward.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, there is a lot of discussion today, and \nhas been in the last week or two, and perhaps there will continue to be \ndiscussions about the funding for our troops in Iraq. I think it is \nimportant to say that the Congress has passed legislation that will go \nto the President that actually requests more funding than the President \nrequested for the troops in Iraq. It also establishes a goal of hoping \nthat perhaps we will be able to extract our troops from Iraq in a year. \nThere is not a requirement that American troops be pulled out of Iraq. \nIt establishes a goal. But what I wish to talk about today is the part \nof the bill that provides a higher level of funding for the troops than \nthe President requested.\n  It is regrettable that in this country we have gone to war in Iraq \nand to war in Afghanistan. We have asked very much of our soldiers to \ngo into harm's way--3,300 plus of them have been killed in Iraq--but we \nhave not asked for similar circumstances from the American people. We \nhave not asked for a commitment from the American people. In fact, the \nvery funding the President has requested, once again, as emergency \nfunding is not paid for. The President says: Let's have emergency \nfunding and add it to the debt.\n  We have not asked the American people to pay for the war. We sent the \nsoldiers to war with the understanding that when they come back, they \nwill inherit the debt and pay for this war. That doesn't make sense to \nme.\n  Even more than that, the President says one can contribute to this \ncountry by going shopping, going to the mall. So we send soldiers to \nwar, and we go to the mall. Where is the national commitment? Where is \nit that we have asked the American people to go to war against \nterrorism, to go to war in Iraq with the American soldiers?\n  I remind everyone that what we did in the Second World War--and by \nthe way, this war has now lasted longer than the Second World War. But \nin the Second World War, our country mobilized. There was Rosie the \nRiveter. There were three shifts at the manufacturing plants. We had \nour capability humming in this country producing everything we needed \nfor that war. We had rationing. We had factory lights on 24 hours a \nday.\n  William Manchester wrote a book, ``The Glory and the Dream.'' He \ndescribes what we did. He said this:\n\n       From an initial keel-to-delivery time of over 200 days, \n     Henry Kaiser cut the average work time on a liberty ship to \n     40 days. In 1944, he was launching a new escort aircraft \n     carrier every week, and they were turning out entire cargo \n     ships in 17 days. During the first 212 days of 1945, they \n     completed 247 cargo ships, better than one a day.\n\n  We had this country's productive capacity revved up full speed. When \nStalin met with FDR and Churchill in the mid-1940s before the end of \nthe war, he said: Thank God for America's productive capability, \nAmerica's manufacturing capability.\n  Here is what they did. Manchester, in ``The Glory and the Dream,'' \ndescribed this. I want us to think about this just for a moment: From \n1941 to 1945, We turned out 296,000 warplanes, 102,000 tanks, 2.4 \nmillion trucks, 8,700 warships, and 5,400 cargo ships. America went to \nwar. In the last year of the Second World War, we were producing 4,000 \nwarplanes a month in our factories. Contrast that with what is \nhappening today.\n  The reason I ask these questions, the reason I come to the floor to \nask those questions is because of this picture. This is a picture of \nsomething called an MRAP, Mine Resistant Ambush Protected vehicle, \nwhich is much safer than the humvee. This version of the MRAP is what \nthe Commandant of the Marine Corps said we need in Iraq, 6,700 of them.\n  There have been 300 IED attacks in Iraq against this version of the \nMRAP. Not one death. Let me say that again. There have been 300 attacks \nby an IED against this vehicle in Iraq; not one death in those attacks.\n  We have had 3,342 U.S. troops killed in Iraq, 70 percent of them \ncaused by IEDs, improvised explosive devices. The Commandant of the \nMarine Corps says this vehicle will save three-fourths of the lives \nthat are being lost. Eighty percent of the casualties from IEDs will be \nsaved with this safer vehicle.\n  Why do I raise this question in the context of what we did in the \nSecond World War? Because we have been producing about 45 of these \nvehicles a month. At a time when the Commandant of the Marine Corps \nsays we need 6,700 in Iraq to safeguard the soldiers going on patrol in \nIraq, with the capability that this vehicle will save three-fourths of \nthe lives that are now being lost, we are producing 45 a month. They \nsay they want 6,700 in Iraq, and the President has requested less than \na third of that amount. We wrote money in this appropriations bill, \n$1.2 billion, to substantially increase the number of MRAP vehicles \nthat must be produced and must be sent to Iraq to save lives.\n  Let me read, if I might, James Conway, Commandant of the Marine \nCorps, understanding I am talking about this MRAP:\n\n       The MRAP vehicle has a dramatically better record of \n     preventing fatal and serious injuries from attacks by IEDs. \n     The Commander of Multinational Force West estimates that the \n     use of MRAP could reduce the casualties in vehicles due to \n     IED attacks by as much as 80 percent.\n\n  This is from the Commandant of the Marine Corps. Why is it we could \nproduce 4,000 warplanes a month at the end of the Second World War in \nsupport of our fighting men and women, and we produce 45 MRAPs a month \nin this country? Why is it we surge our troops to Iraq but don't surge \nour production of the MRAP vehicle, just as one example, that would \nprovide dramatic increased protection against the lost of life from \nIEDs? Why will we not surge this? Why is this less important? I don't \nunderstand this at all. We go to war, but it is just the troops, not \nthe country?\n  There was a story in USA Today, April 19:\n\n\n[[Page S5266]]\n\n\n       In more than 300 attacks since last year, no Marines have \n     died while riding in the new fortified armored vehicles the \n     Pentagon would like to rush to Iraq, the Marine Commander in \n     Anbar Province said. Attacks on other vehicles cause more \n     than two casualties per attack, including deaths.\n\n  IEDs are responsible for 70 percent of the casualties in Iraq. Yet, \nwhile this country has sent its soldiers to war, it has not mobilized \nthe country. We do not have third shifts with the lights on 24 hours a \nday. We don't have Henry Kaiser producing 1 ship a day, 4,000 warplanes \na month. In fact, this relates to something else I have talked a lot \nabout on the floor of the Senate. Only two U.S. steel mills are \nqualified to produce the special armored steel for the Defense \nDepartment at this point--two. Both have been acquired by foreign \ncompanies in the past year and a half.\n  Let me say that again: Only two U.S. steel mills are qualified to \nproduce armored steel for the Defense Department. Both have been \nacquired by foreign companies in the past year and a half. Oregon Steel \nis now owned by Evraz Group S.A. of Russia. The International Steel \nGroup was acquired by the Dutch conglomerate Arcelor Mittal.\n  The Defense Department has requested that the armor steel made by \nboth firms be categorized with what is called a ``DX'' rating for the \nMRAP program. DX stands for the highest national urgency. Under the \n1950 Defense Production Act, any item with a DX rating gets top \npriority and must be furnished to the U.S. Government in advance of any \nother customers. Several other items that are critical to the MRAP \nvehicles--ballistic glass, transmissions, and Mack Truck chasses--are \nalso supposed to receive the DX rating.\n  I am told Defense officials are in negotiations with both the steel \nmills I mentioned, that are foreign owned, to make sure there will be \nenough steel available for the various kits they need for the MRAP \nvehicle.\n  The point I want to make is simple: In the Second World War, we had \nsome unbelievably brave soldiers, men and women who went halfway around \nthe world to fight because their country asked them to fight for this \ncountry's freedom. But it was more than just soldiers; it was in \nvirtually every manufacturing plant in this country and with virtually \nevery citizen, through rationing, through production, through the \ncapability to produce what the soldiers needed.\n  Contrast what we did in the Second World War with what we do today. \nWe decide to send the soldiers to Iraq, but we make only a few of the \nMRAP vehicles that would save so many of those lives that are now being \nlost to IED explosions. We can't do this. This ought not be acceptable \nto anybody in this country. If we are going to war, the country needs \nto go to war with the soldiers. When the President sends us an \nappropriations request and says, Oh, by the way, the MRAP is a lower \npriority, we are not going to fund it, we are not going to ask for what \nthe Marine Corps Commandant says is necessary in the field, we will ask \nfor slightly less than a third of that number of vehicles--this \nCongress fortunately has said no, Mr. President, that is not what we \nare going to accept. We decided to invest in these vehicles as quickly \nas we can and move them to Iraq so when soldiers are on patrol and they \nare hit with an IED, they have better armor and a better opportunity to \nprotect their lives.\n  There will be a lot of discussion in the coming days about who is \nright and who is wrong on all the funding issues with respect to Iraq. \nI want my colleagues to understand a couple of things. First, we have \nactually increased the funding requested by the President. We have \nincreased the funding for couple of reasons. No. 1, we added funds for \nsafer vehicles that the President did not request enough of will save \nthe lives of troops; No. 2, we had to add funds for military and VA \nmedical care because the President did not request enough money to care \nfor the injured soldiers coming back from Iraq and Afghanistan. We \nincreased the funding for both. We have actually increased the funding \nfor the troops.\n  I understand there is a disagreement about the language with respect \nto Iraq. Ours establishes a ``goal,'' not a requirement, a goal, hoping \nwe can extract our soldiers from the middle of a civil war in Iraq \nwithin a year. That is a goal. I know the President and others suggest \nthat somehow fully funding the troops and even adding more where it was \nnecessary and establishing such a goal is pulling the rug out from \nunder the troops, but nothing could be further from the truth. What I \nthink injures our troops is to decide we are going to surge the troops \nbut we will not surge the equipment necessary to protect them. That is \nwrong. This Congress has said it is wrong in the legislation we have \npassed.\n  I hope in the coming days and in the coming conflicts, whether it is \ndealing with Iraq or dealing with the terrorist threat around the \nworld, we will decide in the future never again to send our soldiers in \na manner that allows us not to use the full impact, the full capability \nof the American people to produce that which the soldiers need to do \ntheir jobs. That has been the case, regrettably, here.\n  Early in the Iraq war I received e-mails where people would send me \npictures that illustrated what they were trying to do to protect \nthemselves. Their humvees were not armored, so soldiers had welded \npatches of various kinds of metal to make them stronger. But now we \nhave a new vehicle that can save a dramatic number of lives. The \nPresident's budget did not request nearly the money for it that should \nhave been requested. So Congress added to it. I hope this is the first \nstep to do what we should do with America's capacity to say to the \nsoldiers: You have not gone to war alone. This country goes to war with \nyou, with every capability we have to protect you.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Klobuchar). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WEBB.

Madam President, today is a day that, for Vietnamese around \nthe world, is as significant as the distinctions we often make between \nB.C. and A.D. in other cultures. Thirty-two years ago today the \nCommunist forces from North Vietnam finished their conquest of the \nsouth and South Vietnam ceased to exist. Ho Chi Minh would like to say \nthe motivation for pursuing this war was independence and freedom. If \nwe were to discuss independence, in the sense of removing foreign \ninvolvement, at that moment they were arguably correct. But if we were \nto discuss true issues of freedom, the aspirations of freedom for \nmillions of people in Vietnam ceased on that day.\n  Some liked to call the conquest of South Vietnam liberation. For \nmillions of Vietnamese around the world it was the loss of everything, \nincluding their country. A million people were sent into reeducation \ncamps, and 240,000 of them stayed in those camps for longer than 4 \nyears, some as long as 18 years; 56,000 died in those reeducation \ncamps; an estimated 1 million people jumped into the sea during some \nperiods, with more than a 50-percent chance of dying, and many of them \nended up in this country. We currently have today in this country 2 \nmillion people of Vietnamese descent.\n  I do not want, at this moment, to refight the Vietnam war, nor do I \nwant to dwell too much on the differences between the Vietnam war and \nthe present war. But I have seen people on both sides talk about the \nIraq war as if there were some correlation to Vietnam. I want to say \nthat, for those who worry about how we withdrew from Vietnam, there is \nnot a parallel. For those who worry, frankly, how we went into Vietnam, \nthere is not a parallel. There are different continents, different \ngovernmental systems, different issues with respect to our national \nobjectives. In Vietnam we assisted an existing government that had been \ncreated by international agreement. We fought side by side with an army \nthat itself lost 245,000 soldiers dead on the battlefield. We fought \nfor a very long time with the support of the American people--a reality \nthat is sometimes\n\n[[Page S5267]]\n\nmissed today as we look back on the tragic way the Vietnam war ended. A \n1972 Harris poll showed even 8 years after we began our involvement in \nVietnam, the American people agreed by a margin of 74 percent to 11 \npercent that it was important that South Vietnam not fall into the \nhands of the Communists. We rarely hear those statistics today. We \nrarely hear that viewpoint.\n  I stand here as someone who still today supports our national \nobjectives in Vietnam and who was an early warning voice with respect \nto the strategic inadvisability of going into Iraq. On this special day \nof remembrance for so many Vietnamese around the world, I wish to give \na salute, first, to our Vietnam veterans who fought with such great \nhonor, whose sacrifices are rarely remembered in an affirmative sense. \nWe saw 58,000 Americans die on the battlefields of Vietnam and more \nthan 300,000 wounded; 3 million people served.\n  I also wish to thank the veterans of the South Vietnamese Army who \nalso are so frequently wrongly portrayed in history. They fought \nalongside us. Many of them fought very well. As I mentioned earlier, \n245,000 of them died in the battlefield and many more went through \nstruggles after the war that are very difficult for Americans to \ndigest. Imagine being in a reeducation camp for 13\\1/2\\ years, where \nyou are allowed to see your family for 15 minutes a year. Imagine not \nhaving veterans status, either in Vietnam or in the United States, \nafter having gone through, in some cases, 12 years on a battlefield.\n  I wish to thank those Vietnamese, the truly forgotten warriors who \nstood alongside us on the battlefield. I also wish to express my pride \nand appreciation to the Vietnamese who came to this country and showed \nus the strength of their culture, showed us what could have happened if \nSouth Vietnam had remained free. We now have 2 million Vietnamese \nAmericans living in this country and they have done enormously well.\n  With respect to the Hanoi Government--I have been dealing with the \nHanoi Government since 1991 when I first returned to Vietnam. I have \nmade many trips back to Vietnam in many different capacities. They have \nmade significant strides since those early days when they essentially \nwere a Stalinist system. There is a lot to be proud of in terms of the \ntransformations that have been going on in Vietnam. Vietnam is growing. \nIt is growing economically. We have much work to do. We have much work \nto do in terms of encouraging that political system to open up, to \nallow religious freedom, to allow greater political freedom. We are on \na pathway where, with the right kind of dialog, I believe that is going \nto occur.\n  I think the best legacy for us to have when we look back at that era \nwould be to see Vietnam, the Vietnam of today, as a strategic and \ncommercial partner but also as a vibrant, open society whose Government \nreflects the strength of the culture itself, a strength that has been \ndemonstrated over and over again by the Vietnamese who have come to \nthis country and who, I am proud to say, are now Americans.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I come to the floor of the Senate today \nwhere there is an opportunity for a historic moment. We have passed, \ndespite critics who doubted it, a bill which is being sent to the \nPresident tomorrow. This bill is the supplemental appropriations bill \nfor the war in Iraq. It is the seventh supplemental bill the President \nhas asked for. These bills by their nature are supposed to be \nunexpected appropriations bills for unanticipated disasters and \nemergencies.\n  President Bush has decided to fund this war with these so-called \nemergency appropriations bills. It is hard to argue, in the fifth year \nof this war, that it is unanticipated that our troops need help. They \nare going to continue to need help as long as the President keeps them \nin Iraq and in the fight.\n  The President has already signaled his punch. We know what he is \ngoing to do with this bill. He said he is going to veto this bill. This \nwill be the second veto in the 6 years or more that George W. Bush has \nserved as President. Only twice will he have used his veto pen. The \nfirst was to stop a bill for stem cell research, a bill that had passed \nthe House and the Senate with bipartisan support. I will not go through \nthe litany of Republicans and Democrats who supported it. I was one. We \nsent it to the President urging him to reconsider his position that we \nought to cut off medical research if it meant using embryonic stem \ncells, that it was better to use them for research than to have them \ndiscarded, thrown away. Use them for the valuable pursuit of cures for \nillnesses and diseases so that people suffering from diabetes, \nParkinson's and Alzheimer's, spinal cord injury, so many other \ndifferent diseases, heart disease, for example, that they would have a \nchance with this research.\n  The President said, no, used his veto pen for the very first time and \nstopped that bill to continue to stop Federal funding of that research. \nI think the President was wrong and I believe others believe that as \nwell.\n  Now we have a bill that is also about life and death. This is a bill \nabout war. What we have said to the President is: We will give you \nmoney to sustain our troops in battle. In fact, we will give you more \nthan you asked for our troops, but we want you to understand, as most \nAmericans do, that we need a plan to bring our troops home.\n  The idea of funding this war indefinitely and watching it continue \nday by weary day, month by bloody month, is unacceptable to the \nmajority of Americans, unacceptable to the majority of the Members of \nthe House and Senate.\n  When we started down this path just a few weeks ago, there were some \nwho doubted that we would be able to find enough Democrats and \nRepublicans to pass an alternative, a timetable for redeployment of our \ntroops. But we did. Despite the fact that there were 50 Democrats and \n49 Republicans, that one of the Senators in our ranks voted with the \nother side of the aisle, we have been able to find at least two \nRepublican Senators who will stand with us for the argument that it is \ntime for American troops to start coming home.\n  But the President has said he is going to veto this bill. It will be \nironic if he vetoes it tomorrow because, you see, tomorrow is the \nfourth anniversary of the President's announcement that our mission had \nbeen accomplished in Iraq, 4 years ago today we were told.\n  We have had 3,351 killed in Iraq, 3,351 soldiers, marines, sailors, \nand airmen. I called many of the families who have lost someone, \ndropped a note to others, attended a few funerals along the way when my \nschedule allowed. It is a heart-sickening feeling for a father like \nmyself to walk into a funeral of a young man, 19, 20, 21 years of age, \nto watch parents with the pride, of course, in the service of their son \nor daughter, but the realization that they are gone, and what it means \nfor the rest of their life. Madam President, 3,351 funerals. Maybe we \ndon't realize that number because this administration has carefully \navoided scenes where we would be reminded. They would not allow us to \nfilm the return of flag-draped caskets. What an irony that in the \nUnited Kingdom the flag-draped caskets have become the center of a \nnational observance, the center of national respect as people pour out \nto show how much they cared for that fallen soldier. But in America it \nis kept quiet, but not quiet enough, because we know what is happening. \nWe know what is happening to our country, and we know it has to change.\n  Madam President, today the former Director of the CIA, George Tenet, \nhas published his book, ``At the Center of the Storm.'' I worked with \nMr. Tenet for 4 years as a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee. \nThere were times when I was inspired by his public face and times when \nI was angry at some of the things he did or said or failed to do. He \nwas, indeed, a public servant, and one with a long career. In the \npreface to this book, which talks about the war in Iraq in many parts, \nwe have a section which I would like to read into the Record. It is an \nimportant section for all of us to reflect upon.\n  George Tenet speaks about the day after 9/11. Imagine, the head of \nthe Central Intelligence Agency. America has been attacked for the \nfirst time since the British in the War of 1812. More\n\n[[Page S5268]]\n\nthan 3,000 innocent Americans died. The Nation is in turmoil, fear, and \nanger over what has occurred, and you are the person responsible for \ngathering the intelligence to find out who did it and how to stop them \nfrom ever doing it again.\n  He talks about the morning after, Wednesday, September 12, dawned as \nthe first full day of a world gone mad. Nothing would ever be the same: \nEarly that morning, operating on only a few hours' sleep, I headed out \nof my front door to the armored Ford Expedition that was waiting to \ncarry me to see the President of the United States.\n  He talks about his journey to the White House early on the morning of \nWednesday, September 12. This is the part I think is important to note.\n  George Tenet writes:\n\n       All this weighed heavily on my mind as I walked beneath the \n     awning that leads to the West Wing and saw Richard Perle \n     exiting the building just as I was about to enter. Perle was \n     one of the godfathers of the neoconservative movement, and at \n     that time he was head of the Defense Policy Board, an \n     independent advisory group to the Secretary of Defense. Ours \n     was little more than a passing acquaintance. As the doors \n     closed behind him, we made eye contact and nodded. I had just \n     reached the door myself when Perle turned to me and said, \n     quote: Iraq has to pay a price for what happened yesterday. \n     They bear responsibility.\n\n  Tenet writes:\n\n       I was stunned but said nothing. Eighteen hours earlier, I \n     had scanned passenger manifests from the four hijacked \n     airplanes that showed beyond a doubt that al-Qaida was behind \n     the attacks. Over the months and years to follow, we would \n     carefully examine the potential of collaborative roles for \n     state sponsors. The intelligence, then and now, however, \n     showed no evidence of Iraqi complicity.\n       At the Secret Service security checkpoint, I looked back at \n     Perle and thought: What the hell is he talking about? Moments \n     later a second thought came to me: Who has Richard Perle been \n     meeting with in the White House so early in the morning on \n     today of all days? I never learned the answer to that \n     question.\n\n  That is not a surprising story, although it is stunning because we \nhave heard the same. This administration, hours after the attack of 9/\n11, decided that Iraq had to be our next target. The Director of the \nCentral Intelligence Agency, a man privy to all of the classified \ninformation, said then and now there was no connection. Yet here we are \ntoday, 3,351 fallen soldiers, 25,000 or more seriously injured, 8,000 \nor 9,000 returning as amputees and victims of traumatic brain injury.\n  Many of us believe it is time for the Iraqis to take responsibility \nfor their own country. We have spent over 500 billion American dollars \nin Iraq, not just for our military but for the Iraqi people as well. We \nhave given them our most precious treasure, the lives of our soldiers. \nWe have given them from our Treasury freely in an effort to try to give \nthem a chance to rule their own country.\n  Their dictator, Saddam Hussein, is gone. They have been given free \nelections and an opportunity to write their own constitution. We have \nwaited patiently as they have failed time and time again to meet their \nown targets for progress.\n  April 4, a few weeks ago, Leon Panetta, a former Member of the House \nof Representatives from California, former Chief of Staff to President \nBill Clinton, a member of the Iraq Study Group, wrote an article in the \nNew York Times entitled, ``What About Those Other Iraq Deadlines?'' \nEveryone should read this because what Mr. Panetta has done is to lay \nout all of the deadlines which the Iraqis set for themselves, not \ndeadlines we imposed on them but set for themselves, to bring order to \ntheir country.\n  Mr. Panetta shows, time and again, how they have failed. The Iraqis \npromised to achieve, by the end of 2006 or early 2007, the approval of \na provincial election law. So far no progress. Approval of a law to \nregulate the oil industry and share revenues. While the Council of \nMinisters has approved a draft, it has yet to be approved by \nparliament. Approval of the debaathification laws to reintegrate \nofficials of the former regime and Arab nationalists into public life. \nNo progress. Approval of a law to rein in sectarian militias. No \nprogress. By March, the Government promised to hold a referendum on \nconstitutional amendments. No progress.\n  By May the Prime Minister committed to putting in place the law \ncontrolling militias. No progress. The approval of the amnesty \nagreement. No progress. The completion of all reconciliation efforts. \nNo progress. The Iraqi Government promised to hold provincial \nelections. No date has been set. The list goes on and on.\n  The point I would like to make for the record is that while the \nIraqis take their sweet time deciding the tough political decisions \nthat they face to have a stable country, our soldiers die.\n  Tomorrow, the President is likely to veto our suggestion that our \nsoldiers start coming home. What message will that send the Iraqis? It \nwill send the message it is business as usual: Problems in your \ncountry? Dial 9-1-1. Order up 20,000 American soldiers. Political \ndifficulties? Take your time. The Americans are standing guard over \nyour country while your civil strife continues. That is the message of \nPresident Bush's veto. It is a message which says to the Iraqis: \nContinue business as usual.\n  Many of us on a bipartisan basis in the House and Senate think that \nis exactly the wrong message. If there is anything Prime Minister \nMaliki should understand it is that the American people and their \nrepresentatives in Congress have had enough. It is our belief that the \nIraqis need to take responsibility for their own future.\n  I think we understand, as we listen to these missed deadlines, that \nthese are not just shortcomings but symptoms of a reconciliation within \nIraq that may not be possible. That is a hard thing to say, but it is a \nconclusion which we have to at least consider.\n  There was never an exit strategy for this war, a war which was \nconceived in the hours after the attack of 9/11, and a war which the \nformer Director of the Central Intelligence Agency cannot link to that \ntragic event. There was never an exit strategy and without setting \nbenchmarks we have given our issue of national security to an Iraqi \nGovernment that cannot get it together.\n  Primary Minister Maliki has fallen in and out of favor with this \nWhite House. Stephen Hadley, the President's adviser on issues of \nnational security, at one time had a memo leaked which suggested he was \nrunning out of patience. Then the White House said later, that is not \nthe official position. But it is a reality of what we face today, a \nreality that suggests that Mr. Maliki may not be up to this job.\n  If the President does not care for our exit strategy to bring \nAmerican troops home, what is his exit strategy? Is it to stay there \nindefinitely? To wait, as he has suggested, for another President, 20 \nmonths from now, to take up this challenge? Twenty months? Twenty \nmonths of losing more soldiers, twenty months of spending $8 to $10 \nbillion a month rather than spend it in the United States for our own \npeople, for their security and their prosperity?\n  What would happen if the President's escalation of this war, which \nhas gone through many different names--surge, augmentation, you name \nit. What it means is 20,000 to 30,000 more soldiers are put in harm's \nway. What happens if it is successful and secures Baghdad? Does that \nmean our soldiers can come home? I don't think so. I am afraid in the \nPresident's view of things it is just one step in a long series of \nsteps that continue to require the presence of our troops.\n  Madam President, last week I came to the floor of the Senate for the \nninth time recounting my personal experience in the lead-up to the vote \non this war. I talked about the fact that I was a member of the Senate \nIntelligence Committee when this vote came up.\n  As a member of the Intelligence Committee, we meet in closed session, \nno access by the press or public. The room is carefully guarded. It is \nswept to make sure there are no listening devices. People in our \nGovernment come in to brief the Intelligence Committee with the most \nsensitive, delicate, and important intelligence information. It is an \nunderstanding of every member of the committee that, unlike other \ncommittees, we are not supposed to talk. What we hear in that room is \nsupposed to stay in that room. I am sure there are breaches from time \nto time, but conscientious Senators do their best to avoid doing so. We \nunderstand that many times that nugget of information, as important as \nit may be, could involve a human life somewhere, someone who has risked \ntheir life to tell us\n\n[[Page S5269]]\n\nsomething important to keep us safe. We have to take that information \njust that seriously.\n  In the lead-up to the war in Iraq, we were given these briefings by \nmembers of the Bush administration about why they felt we had to \ninvade. I would sit in that room and listen day after day to hours and \nhours of testimony. What I heard then has now been declassified, so we \ncan speak of it openly, but at the time, we couldn't. It was classified \ninformation, top-secret information, not to be disclosed. As I listened \nto the administration debating one another about whether there was a \npotential for nuclear weapons or whether there were weapons of mass \ndestruction, it became obvious to me that even within the \nadministration there were serious doubts about some of the things which \nwere being told to the American people. It troubled me. I said as much \non the floor last week and say it again this week.\n  It was interesting, after having said that, one of the more \nultraconservative publications, the Washington Times, has been critical \nof me for not disclosing classified information. Senator Nelson knows \nwhat I am talking about. Had I walked out to the microphones and said: \nThe Bush administration is in a battle within its own ranks as to \nwhether this is true, you can imagine the next morning's headline: \n``Durbin Discloses Classified Information From the Intelligence \nCommittee.'' I couldn't do it. None of us could from that committee.\n  I accept the challenge from these ultraconservative publications and \nsome of their blogs. I think I did the only thing I could do. With my \nconscience and with my own knowledge, I voted against this war, feeling \nat the time that it was a mistake for us to go forward. I still feel it \nwas a mistake. Now we to have do something to turn that around. We have \nto start bringing our soldiers home.\n  I hope that when the President has a chance to veto this bill or sign \nit tomorrow, he will stop and think for a moment. If he fails to sign \nthis bill, he will, unfortunately, endanger the lives of American \nsoldiers who are wedded to his failed policy in Iraq. These fine men \nand women in uniform are the very best in America. They are doing their \nduty. They didn't write this policy. That was written by the Commander \nin Chief and those who work for him. They will go into battle as \ninstructed and risk their lives day in and day out. But we know, with \n3,351 dead and no end in sight, we have to move forward.\n  When the President vetoes this bill, if he chooses to make that \ndecision, he will be vetoing billions of dollars for National Guard \nequipment that we added to his request. He will be vetoing billions of \ndollars for military hospitals so we don't have the scandal we had at \nWalter Reed a few weeks ago. He will be vetoing billions of dollars for \nus to put into veterans hospitals to take care of returning wounded \nsoldiers. He will be vetoing billions of dollars for Hurricane Katrina \nrelief that is long overdue. The President has a chance in signing this \nbill to not only move us in an orderly manner to bringing American \ntroops home but serving so many other important needs for this country. \nI hope he won't just instinctively and reflexively veto the bill. I \nhope he will consider that it is time for change and it is time for a \nnew direction.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, I commend my colleague from \nIllinois for the very cogent and heartfelt plea he has made that this \nGovernment function as it should between the three branches and that \nthe appropriations process is one which is joined between the executive \nbranch and the legislative branch. It was never intended to be all one \nway or not. Yet that is what publicly has been insisted by the White \nHouse on this Iraq funding bill. It is expected that the President is \ngoing to veto this legislation. Then the question is, Are we going to \nbe able to have a meeting of the minds? Can we have a little bit less \npartisanship and a lot more, as the Good Book says, come let us reason \ntogether? It is my hope that we will see more of that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/30/senate-section/article/S5269-1", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5269-S5270]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         EXPANSION OF DRILLING\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, I rise to speak to the Senate \nbecause there is another thing the executive branch of Government has \ndone today; that is, the Secretary of the Interior has announced a vast \nnew expansion of drilling off of the continental United States. The one \narea proposed for lease sale for oil and gas production and drilling \nthat is acceptable is the area we negotiated in the legislation we \npassed last year, which is lease sale 181 in the central Gulf of Mexico \nand part of the eastern Gulf of Mexico. Members will recall that this \nhas been a 6-year struggle, of which this Senator from Florida actually \nhad to engage in a filibuster in 2005 to protect the interests of my \nState, as well as the interests of the U.S. military, and finally \nprevailed in that protection in 2006, when we agreed to an area that \ncould be drilled, but it was kept far from the coast of Florida and \naway from the military testing and training area, which is the largest \ntesting and training area in the world for our military. Why that? \nBecause where we are testing sophisticated new weapons systems and \nwhere there is live ordnance involved covering a vast array of space, \nyou simply cannot have oil rigs on the surface of the water below where \nall of this testing utilizing new ordnance is going on.\n  So what the Secretary of the Interior has proposed is some \nexploration in those areas we approved last year, which was approved \nwith this Senator's consent because we protected the financial, \neconomic interests of Florida, keeping the oil drilling away from our \nprecious, sugary, white-sand beaches, which spawn a $52 billion-a-year \ntourism industry, keeping it away from the bays and estuaries that are \nso necessary to the ongoing marine life, and at the same time \nprotecting the U.S. military and its interests to have its weapons \ntested so they are ready to go in case they are needed.\n\n  The proposal today also includes other areas off the continental \nUnited States; with the concurrence of Virginia, 50 miles off the shore \nof Virginia. I would think the States of South Carolina and North \nCarolina ought to have something to say about that. I would think the \nState of Delaware or the State of New Jersey ought to have something to \nsay about that because the wind and wave action doesn't just keep a \npotential oil spill right off of Virginia, even if Virginia wanted that \ndrilling 50 miles off of its coast. There is a major tourism industry \nbuilt on the beauty of those beaches in North Carolina as well as the \nbeaches of Delaware and New Jersey, not to even speak of the beaches of \nSouth Carolina.\n  The other part the Secretary of the Interior is proposing is four \ndifferent areas off the coast of Alaska. We certainly remember the \nconcerns, which were valid concerns, as a result of the Exxon Valdez \ndisaster decades ago. But my argument against this proposal by the \nSecretary of the Interior goes far beyond those valid concerns I have \njust mentioned. It goes to the heart of the matter of national security \nand protection of the national economy; that is, we have an economy and \na defense posture that puts us in the position today of being reliant \non foreign oil to the tune of 60 percent of our daily consumption of \noil coming from foreign shores in places such as the Persian Gulf \nregion, Nigeria, and Venezuela, three parts of the world that are not \nnecessarily stable and of which Venezuela--you have seen the kind of \ndifficulty we have had with the President of Venezuela, who continues \nto threaten that he is going to cut off the oil to us and, by the way, \nthat is 12 percent of our daily consumption.\n  Then someone would say: If that is true, why not drill for more oil?\n  In the first place, as to this drilling off Alaska, the oil wouldn't \nbe ready for another 10 years. The economic crisis is today. The \nnational security crisis is today. The United States has 3 percent of \nthe world's oil reserves, but the United States consumes 25 percent of \nthe world's oil production. It doesn't take a mathematical genius to \nfigure out that you can't drill your way out of the problem.\n  That brings me to the crux of my argument. The present policy of the \nadministration is to drill, drill, drill. We simply have to change that \npolicy. We have to go to alternative fuels. We have to go to increased \nmileage standards on our vehicles; otherwise, we can never get out of \nthis problem of dependence on foreign oil, all the time\n\n[[Page S5270]]\n\nmaking ourselves easily seduced by arguments of drill, drill, drill, \nwith oil companies having record profits and with, of course, the \npeople, our folks, all of us, having to endure $3 a gallon gasoline.\n  In an ideal world, you could say that you could do both--yes, in an \nideal world. But this isn't an ideal world. This is a world in which \nthe policy has always been drill, drill, drill. We have to break that \npolicy. We have to start on things just like this proposal which is \nanother part of the drill strategy of this administration. Only then \nare we going to protect our national security and only then are we \ngoing to protect our national economy by shifting to other fuels and to \nvehicles of which we easily have the technology now to get 40 miles per \ngallon on the fleet average instead of 27 miles per gallon on the fleet \naverage.\n  You can imagine, if we can do that, instead of relying on a plan to \ndrill for more oil that is not going to become available for another 10 \nyears--if we will change the policy right now, which will have an \nimmediate effect, starting tomorrow, on our consumption of oil--then, \nonly then, will America start to move on a path truly toward energy \nindependence.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/30/senate-section/article/S5270-1", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5270]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, this week the Senate has the \nopportunity to set a new and better direction for the safety of the \nprescription drugs and medical devices that make such a profound \ndifference in the lives of our people.\n  Every day, families across America rely on the Food and Drug \nAdministration in ways they barely realize. When they put dinner on the \ntable, they are counting on the FDA to see that the food is free from \ncontamination. They trust the FDA to make sure the drugs they take are \nsafe and effective. From prescription drugs, to pacemakers, to \nchemotherapy, to the food we eat, the FDA protects the health of \nhundreds of millions of Americans and monitors products that account \nfor a quarter of the Nation's economy.\n\n[[Page S5295]]\n\n  The FDA should be the ``gold standard'' for safety, but its luster \nhas been tarnished in recent years for failure to protect the American \npeople from unsafe drugs. The public was shocked that the arthritis \ndrug Vioxx was able to stay on the market for 5 years, even though it \nnearly doubled the risk of heart attack and stroke. Antidepressants \nused by millions were found to increase the risk of suicide in \nadolescents. Millions of Americans have needlessly been put at risk, \nand they want action by Congress to reform and strengthen the agency.\n  We are responding now with bipartisan legislation that is the product \nof months of work in our committee. I commend my colleague and friend \nin this effort, Senator Enzi, for his work on this proposal that will \nimprove the way FDA oversees the safety of drugs. Almost half of all \nAmericans take at least one pill a day, so this legislation will make a \ndifference in the lives of every American family. Our proposals were \nstrengthened by our colleague from New Hampshire, Senator Gregg.\n  Safety is at the core. Our legislation was guided by the \nrecommendations of the impressive report by the Institute of Medicine \non the ``Future of Drug Safety.'' Its major recommendations for reform \nare included in this legislation.\n  This chart I have in the Chamber gives the major recommendations for \nthe Food and Drug Administration: Build the internal epidemiology and \ninformatics capacity in order to improve the postmarket assessment of \ndrugs, have postclinical trial results in a public database, have \nregularly analyzed postmarket study results. This aspect about \npostmarketing surveillance is a key in terms of drug safety. We have \nincluded their recommendations. Another is: Give the FDA better \nenforcement tools. I am going to refer to that in a moment. Another is: \nConduct regular evaluation of new drug safety profiles. We have \nincluded that. I will expand on that point in a few moments. Another \nis: Substantially increase drug safety resources available to the FDA. \nWe have also included those.\n  So those were recommendations from the Institute of Medicine. We have \nreviewed the same subject matter. We evaluated those very carefully and \nwe have taken the major recommendations in terms of safety and included \nthem in this legislation.\n  A small number of health systems in America--now referring to \npostmarketing surveillance and the use of electronic records--\neffectively links the surveillance of various kinds of prescription \ndrugs to safety databases. These systems--Kaiser Permanente, Mayo \nClinic, Veterans' Administration--have the means to examine whether \nVioxx and other drugs were being used effectively. They found these \ndrugs were being prescribed inappropriately, and they took steps to \ncurb their overuse. As a result, they approved the use of these \nmedications only for patients who had no other options. Overuse went \ndown and safety improved.\n  The use of these databases should not be limited to the few health \nsystems that currently use them. FDA should make use of every aspect of \nmodern health care technology to safeguard the public's health. Mark \nMcClellan, the former FDA Commissioner, calls these kinds of systems \nhealth IT for drug safety. Our proposal includes his recommendations.\n  Surveillance is essential, but effective action is needed when a \nsafety problem is detected. Each drug has unique risks and benefits. \nThere can be no one-size-fits-all approach to drug safety. That is why \nour legislation includes a flexible but effective program for safety. \nWe call it a risk evaluation and management system. It can be tailored \nto the unique characteristics of each drug. It gives the FDA the \nauthority to act when action is needed to protect public health, but it \nalso contains safeguards to prevent such action from being imposed when \nthere is no reason to do so.\n  For some drugs, it is essential to require postmarket studies, yet \nFDA today lacks the basic authority to require such trials to be \nconducted. FDA can request them but it cannot require them, and has few \nways to see they are completed. As a result, companies routinely \npromise to conduct studies that are never even started, much less \ncompleted.\n  This chart I have in the Chamber shows how, under current law, \npostmarket studies are not completed. These are the studies that have \nbeen requested by the FDA because they are for sound safety reasons. \nYet 71 percent of them were not even started. Our legislation says when \nthey are required and recommended by the company, they must move ahead.\n  In its recent report on drug safety, GAO pointed out the failure of \nthe current system. Its report states:\n\n       In the absence of specific authority, FDA often relies on \n     drug sponsors voluntarily agreeing to conduct such \n     postmarketing studies. But the postmarketing studies that \n     drug sponsors agree to conduct have not consistently been \n     completed. The FDA has little leverage to ensure that the \n     studies are carried out by imposing administrative penalties.\n\n  Our legislation solves this problem. It gives the FDA clear authority \nto require the conduct of the postmarketing studies when there is a \npublic health need to do so, and it gives the FDA the ability to assess \nfines on those who ignore their responsibilities.\n  Databases and postmarketing studies help detect problems, but the FDA \nneeds the ability to take other action to protect the public health. \nHere, too, the current law is inadequate. FDA lacks clear authority to \nrequire measures to protect public health. When lives are on the line, \ndoctors are making the critical decisions. But because FDA's authority \nis so unclear, it must first call the lawyers for their opinion as to \nwhether the agency can act. The Institute of Medicine identified this \nmajor weakness of current law and called on Congress to give FDA the \nauthority to require risk management programs when needed to protect \nhealth. These programs can be as simple as new information on a drug \nlabel or an advisory notice to doctors or as sophisticated as special \nmonitoring of programs for patients who use a particular drug. The \nlegislation does not make the decision about which measures should be \ntaken for which drugs, but it does give the FDA the authority to make \nthe right choice for the public health. This authority has been lacking \nin the past.\n\n  For Vioxx, it took 14 months to change the drug's label to warn \ndoctors and patients of the danger. Because FDA had weak authority, it \nhad to ask the manufacturer to change the label voluntarily, and the \nmanufacturer stalled and stalled. When patients are in danger, FDA \nshould not have to wait to get legal opinions to decide how to protect \nhealth. It should be able to act immediately, and our bill gives them \nthat authority.\n  In many cases, companies have hidden evidence of safety problems. Our \nbill addresses this abuse by including a public database of all \nclinical trials and their results. Listen to that: all clinical trials \nand their results. We protect the trademark aspects of the particular \nitem but require the publication of all clinical trials and their \nresults. A company will no longer be able to hide the results if they \ndo not show what the company wanted.\n  Some would say any increase in drug safety will inevitably decrease \naccess to needed drugs, but that is a false argument. Consider the \nsituation now. When the FDA is confronted with a new drug that may \nimpose safety risks, or where additional study may be required, with \nlittle expectations that those risks will be mitigated by a voluntary \napproach--and with no ability to ensure that the studies are going to \nbe conducted--FDA might reasonably conclude the risks of approving the \ndrug are too great and, therefore, not approve it.\n  Under our legislation, the calculation is reversed. With this bill in \nplace, FDA could allow patients to have access to the drug, secure in \nthe knowledge that effective safety measures were in place. That is not \nmy judgment; it is the judgment of a coalition of advocacy \norganizations representing over 30 million patients. This coalition, \nthe Alliance for Drug Safety and Access, wrote Congress a letter \nsaying:\n\n       [T]his legislation gives the FDA the ability to continue to \n     study the safety of drugs after approval, flexible \n     enforcement tools necessary to ensure compliance with these \n     new safety protections, and additional funding to support \n     these new activities. Allowing the agency to act on clear \n     safety signals could actually allow the FDA to approve drugs \n     more quickly, knowing it will have the ability to respond on \n     behalf of patients if safety concerns appear postmarket.\n\n\n[[Page S5296]]\n\n\n  That is support from the organization that has been put together that \nis protecting safety for the consumers. That is the balance our \nlegislation strikes: greater safety, hand in hand with better access.\n  As our debate continues, I will discuss additional aspects of the \nlegislation, especially its new ideas for accelerating drug \ndevelopment, its renewal of our commitment to safe and effective drugs \nfor children, and its provisions to improve drug science, and increase \nthe transparency of the FDA.\n  We are also working with our colleagues from Iowa and Kansas, Senator \nHarkin and Senator Roberts, on ways to refine our provisions on direct-\nto-consumer advertising, to make certain they are consistent with the \nConstitution. We are working with Senator Durbin and other colleagues \non the committee on proposals for food safety on pet food. These \nbipartisan proposals are being readied for floor action shortly. I look \nforward to further discussions on them.\n  Our committee will continue to work to improve the ways FDA can \nmonitor and improve food safety. In this new era of life sciences, \nmedical advances will continue to bring immense benefit for our \ncitizens. To fulfil the potential of that bright future, we need not \nonly brilliant researchers to develop the drugs of tomorrow but also \nstrong and vigilant watchdogs for public health to guarantee that new \ndrugs and medical devices are safe and beneficial, and that they \nactually reach the patients who urgently need them.\n  Congress has ample power to restore the luster the FDA has lost in \nrecent years. The legislation we are now considering represents a \nbipartisan consensus on the best way to get the job done.\n  I want to mention a few additional items. I am quoting now from the \nFDA's report brief on 2006:\n\n       The Food and Drug Administration's authorities must be \n     clarified and strengthened to empower the agency to take \n     rapid, decisive action when necessary and appropriate. FDA \n     lacks the clear, unambiguous authority needed to enforce \n     sponsor compliance with regulatory requirements and, instead, \n     relies on the process of productive negotiations with the \n     industry.\n\n  We have taken that. That is their No. 1 statement.\n  Included in that we have--this is the IOM committee.\n\n       The committee recommends that the FDA ensure that the FDA \n     has the ability to require postmarketing risk assessment and \n     to monitor and ensure the safe use of drugs.\n\n  We have done it.\n\n       These conditions may be imposed both before and after \n     approval of a new drug, a new indication or a new dosage.\n\n  We have incorporated those concepts, as well as the identification of \nsome new contraindications or patterns of adverse effects.\n  It talks about the distribution, conditioned on compliance, with \nagency-initiated changes and drug labels. We have achieved that. \nConditioned on specific warnings, proposal materials, distribution \nconditioned on a moratorium, on direct consumer advertising. We have at \nleast addressed that.\n  It also includes distribution of restrictions for special training, \nif need be, for pharmacists and physicians. It also has distribution \nconditions on the performance of specific medical procedures. It talks \nabout clinical trials. FDA needs increased enforcement authority, \nbetter enforcement tools directed at drug sponsors which should include \nfines and injunctions and withdrawal of drug approval.\n  We haven't taken every one of these recommendations--not every one \nprecisely--but we have taken the essence of these recommendations, and \nwe have included those that are as a result of our extensive hearings. \nI could go on with this, and will later on perhaps, but I won't today. \nI wish to mention, finally, the various groups.\n  We mentioned the Alliance for Drug Safety and Access. I will include \nthese letters of support. This is to Senators Kennedy and Enzi:\n\n       On behalf of the Alliance for Drug Safety and Access, we \n     write today to express our support for the goals of titles I \n     and II of S. 1082, the Food and Drug Administration \n     Revitalization Act.\n       It will continue the timely access of patients to new \n     therapies and will improve the ability of the Food and Drug \n     Administration to ensure safety of drugs already on the \n     market.\n       S. 1082 takes a life-cycle approach to the risk-benefit \n     assessment of drugs and biologics--\n\n  This is so, though we have not included biologics in this proposal \nwith regard to drugs as endorsed by the Alliance and recommended by the \nInstitute.\n\n       We are pleased that this legislation gives the FDA the \n     ability to continue to study the safety of drugs after \n     approval, flexible enforcement tools necessary to ensure \n     compliance with the new safety protections, and additional \n     funding to support these new activities.\n\n  It allows the FDA to approve drugs more quickly, knowing it will have \nthe ability to respond to the patients if safety concerns appear \nafterwards.\n  This represents a group of at least 30 different health organizations \nthat have followed this most closely.\n  We have a letter that has been sent to Senator Enzi and myself, \nSenator Dodd and Senator Clinton, talking about how this legislation \nimpacts children and giving special recognition, as they should, to our \ncolleagues and friends, Senator Dodd, who has been such a leader in \nthis area, and Senator Clinton as well, who has been so thoughtful in \nthis area.\n  It points out the Pediatric Medical Device Safety Improvement Act of \n2000 provides a comprehensive approach to ensure that children are not \nleft behind in cutting-edge research and revolutionary technologies for \nmedical devices. It talks about swift action and passage.\n  The American Psychiatric Association talks about how the provisions \nof this bill will ensure the Food and Drug Administration is equipped \nwith the necessary tools to enhance its consistency, transparency, and \naccountability in ensuring the safety of drugs postapproval.\n  The American Psychiatric Association advocates for patient safety and \nsupports further postmarket research of medications to ensure the \nsafety and efficacy of medications used to treat mental illnesses. The \nletter says:\n\n       We look forward to working with you to rebuild the \n     Administration's reputation and creating a universal drug \n     safety monitoring system that is reliable and dependable.\n\n  They indicate their strong support for the legislation.\n  Again, another letter of support from the American College of \nPharmacy, and it talks about the particular emphasis we have placed on \nimproving science knowledge, which improves their decisionmaking \nregulatory oversight. Science knowledge grows on a daily basis. We know \nwe are in the life science century. We want that agency, the FDA, to \nhave the best in terms of science and science knowledge, and we have \nincluded special provisions to enhance that particular effort, and this \nassociation has recognized that.\n  We also have a letter from the Consumers Union, and they talk about \ntheir strong support for this legislation. They oppose any weakening \namendments of this important legislation. It also has some reference to \nsome of the recent polls which point out that 96 percent of Americans \nagree that Government should have the power to require warning labels \nif safety problems are identified, with 80 percent of those strongly \nagreeing to that authority. Right now the FDA has to negotiate safety \nwarnings.\n  It also talks about the strong support the American people have for \nthe FDA, which doesn't have the authority to provide studies to be \nperformed once the drug is on the market. The American people are way \nahead of us. They also show strong support to make public the clinical \ntrial studies. This bill does that. Sixty-eight percent of the American \npeople strongly agree the drug studies should be made public.\n  Eighty-four percent of the American people believe advertising for \nprescription drugs with safety concerns should be prohibited. Then it \ncontinues: Three-quarters of consumers agree that drug ads lead to \noverprescribing, with 38 percent strongly agreeing and 59 percent \nagreeing that the Government should restrict advertising by \npharmaceutical companies altogether. We haven't gone that route, but we \nhave taken safety considerations to heart.\n  Then the other letters from the Cardiovascular Association that talk \nabout the particular provisions dealing with children, the pediatric \nprovisions in here which are enormously important, and other letters. I \nask unanimous consent that the appropriate representative group of \nletters be printed\n\n[[Page S5297]]\n\nin the Record and the references to some of the editorials from across \nthe country--I am not going to ask that they all be printed, but I will \nask that selected ones be printed in the Record and that other \nnewspapers be referenced showing strong support.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                             The Alliance for Drug\n\n\n                                            Safety and Access,\n\n                                                   April 17, 2007.\n     Hon.

Enzi,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions \n         Committee, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Kennedy and Enzi: On behalf of the Alliance \n     for Drug Safety and Access (ADSA), we write today to express \n     our support for the goals of Titles I and II of S. 1082, the \n     ``Food and Drug Administration Revitalization Act''. We \n     appreciate your leadership in introducing this bipartisan \n     legislation, which will both continue the timely access of \n     patients to new therapies and improve the ability of the Food \n     and Drug Administration (FDA) to ensure the safety of drugs \n     already on the market. While we would appreciate the \n     opportunity to continue to work with you on strengthening \n     this legislation as it moves forward, we urge the Committee \n     on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions to report out this \n     legislation for consideration by the full Senate.\n       ADSA members advocate on behalf of over 31 million \n     patients, including those suffering from HIV/AIDS, \n     Parkinson's disease, spinal cord injuries, paralysis, \n     multiple sclerosis, leukodystrophies, Tourette syndrome, and \n     over 6,000 known rare diseases. Our members also represent \n     over 100,000 providers of care to pediatric patients and \n     individuals with mental illnesses.\n       S. 1082 takes a life-cycle approach to the risk-benefit \n     assessment of drugs and biologics, as endorsed by ADSA and \n     recommended by the Institute of Medicine. We are pleased that \n     this legislation gives the FDA the ability to continue to \n     study the safety of drugs after approval, flexible \n     enforcement tools necessary to ensure compliance with these \n     new safety protections, and additional funding to support \n     these new activities. Allowing the agency to act on clear \n     safety signals could actually allow the FDA to approve drugs \n     more quickly, knowing it will have the ability to respond on \n     behalf of patients if safety concerns appear post-market.\n       We know that you share our interest in both speeding life-\n     saving drugs to patients while also strengthening oversight \n     of drugs post-market. And, we believe that with sufficient \n     resources both goals are achievable through the legislation \n     you have authored. ADSA looks forward to working with you \n     toward these goals and toward strengthening provisions of \n     your legislation related to patient access to clinical trial \n     information and the FDA's enforcement authorities.\n       Thank you again for your leadership on this critical issue \n     and the opportunity to share our views.\n       AIDS Treatment Action Coalition\n       American Academy of Pediatrics\n       American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry\n       American Psychiatric Association\n       Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation\n       Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation\n       National Multiple Sclerosis Society\n       National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\n       Parkinson's Action Network\n       Tourette Sydrome Association.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                   April 17, 2007.\n     Hon. Edward Kennedy,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Michael B. Enzi,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Christopher J. Dodd,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Hillary Rodham Clinton,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Kennedy, Enzi, Dodd and Clinton: As \n     organizations working to ensure better health care for the \n     nation's children, we write to thank you for your long-\n     standing commitment to children's health and to express our \n     support for legislation to reauthorize the Best \n     Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (BPCA) and the Pediatric \n     Research Equity Act (PREA) and to improve children's access \n     to safe medical devices. We are very pleased that BPCA and \n     PREA reauthorization language and S. 830, the Pediatric \n     Medical Device Safety and Improvement Act, have been included \n     in the Chairman's mark of S. 1082, the ``Food and Drug \n     Administration Revitalization Act,'' for consideration by the \n     Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee \n     tomorrow.\n       Over the past decade, Congress has enacted bipartisan \n     legislation that has dramatically increased the number of \n     drugs tested and labeled for children. The results from BPCA \n     are extraordinary--over 336 requests have been generated for \n     over 780 pediatric studies, resulting in over 115 new drug \n     labels for children. Sen. Dodd's BPCA reauthorization \n     language strengthens this very successful existing program in \n     several important ways, including ensuring prompt label \n     changes, requiring that all study protocols and results be \n     made public, improving adverse events reporting for children, \n     and identifying and addressing important gaps in treatments \n     for children's diseases, In addition, the BPCA language \n     includes a reasoned approach to address the small percentage \n     of drugs for which the exclusivity provision has far exceeded \n     the incentive it was intended to provide pharmaceutical \n     companies.\n       S. 993, the Pediatric Research Improvement Act (PRIA), \n     introduced by Sen. Clinton and included in the Chairman's \n     mark, reauthorizes the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003 \n     (PREA), which requires drug manufacturers to test their \n     products for use in children. This law ensures that children \n     are not a therapeutic afterthought and has generated \n     impressive and invaluable safety and dosing information for \n     children. Since the 2003 passage of PREA, 55 drugs have new \n     or improved pediatric labeling. These drugs range from \n     treatment of ear infections to the prevention of rejection of \n     organ transplants. S. 993 places children on equal \n     therapeutic footing with adults by creating the presumption \n     that medicines coming onto the market for illnesses and \n     conditions that occur in children will be labeled for \n     pediatric use and be available in formulations (e.g., \n     liquids, chewable tablets) that children can take.\n       The Pediatric Medical Device Safety and Improvement Act of \n     2007 provides a comprehensive approach to ensuring that \n     children are not left behind as cutting-edge research and \n     revolutionary technologies for medical devices advance. Like \n     drugs, where for too long children were treated like small \n     adults, many essential medical devices used extensively by \n     pediatricians are not designed or sized for children. \n     According to pediatricians, the development of new medical \n     devices suitable for children's smaller and growing bodies \n     can lag 5-10 years behind those for adults. S. 830 improves \n     incentives for devices for small markets--while still \n     preserving the ability to ensure the safety of new products \n     once on the market. It provides assistance to innovators, \n     streamlines regulatory processes, and elevates pediatric \n     device issues at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and \n     the National Institutes of Health.\n       Despite our support for the Chairman's mark, we are \n     disappointed that a key provision to make PRIA permanent has \n     been omitted. As this legislation moves to the floor of the \n     Senate, we urge you to restore the permanent authority of the \n     FDA to ensure that children have properly studied medications \n     as a matter of fact, not chance.\n       We are grateful for your long-standing leadership and \n     commitment to improving the health of our nation's children \n     and look forward to working with you toward swift Committee \n     action and passage of these pediatric therapeutic bills by \n     the full Senate.\n           Sincerely,\n       American Academy of Pediatrics.\n       Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation.\n       AIDS Alliance for Children, Youth & Families.\n       American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry.\n       American Brain Coalition.\n       American Pediatric Society.\n       American Psychiatric Association.\n       American Thoracic Society.\n       Arthritis Foundation.\n       Association of Medical School Pediatric Department Chairs.\n       Children's Cause for Cancer Advocacy.\n       National Association of Children's Hospitals (N.A.C.H.).\n       National Organization for Rare Disorders.\n       National Research Center for Women and Families.\n       Society for Pediatric Research.\n                                  ____\n\n                                              American Psychiatric\n\n\n                                                  Association,\n\n                                  Arlington, VA, February 6, 2007.\n       The American Psychiatric Association (APA) would like to \n     thank Senators Edward Kennedy and Mike Enzi for their \n     introduction of the bipartisan bill, ``Enhancing Drug Safety \n     and Innovation Act of 2007'' (S.484).

It also will help return public trust in an \n     agency that has been severely damaged by Vioxx, Paxil and \n     other recent drug safety disasters.\n       There is nothing in this legislation that would slow down \n     the approval of important, life-saving drugs. Rather, it \n     gives the FDA effective authority to ensure safety once drugs \n     come to market by improving the surveillance of post-market \n     adverse events and communicating possible risks to doctors \n     and patients.\n       Americans are extremely concerned about prescription drug \n     safety and support Congressional action on the issue. A \n     national poll recently conducted by the Consumer Reports \n     National Research Center found that more than 60 percent of \n     Americans agree that the FDA and Congress have failed to \n     adequately protect consumers from harmful prescription drugs. \n     It also found that 84 percent agree the government should \n     ``have the authority to take any action necessary'' to ensure \n     drug safety.\n       Please support S. 1082. We also urge you to oppose any \n     attempts to weaken its drug safety sections, such as \n     amendments making it much harder to trigger a quick safety \n     action when there are signs of danger, or blocking the FDA--\n     in very rare cases--from moderating the mass marketing of a \n     new drug which has indications of safety problems. We also \n     hope that as the Senate considers FDA-related legislation, a \n     pro-consumer biogenerics bill can be added, and the FDA's \n     advisory committee conflict-of-interest provisions \n     strengthened.\n       We know that you share our interest in both speeding life-\n     saving drugs to patients while also strengthening oversight \n     of drugs post-market. We believe that with sufficient \n     resources and authority, both goals are achievable through \n     this legislation.\n       If you have any questions or concerns as to why the public \n     and the FDA need this legislation, please contact William \n     Vaughan.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                    Jim Guest,\n\n     President and CEO, Headquarters Office.\n                                  ____\n\n\n    Poll: Consumers Say Govt Failed To Protect Them From Dangerous \n     Prescription Drugs; Americans Back Host of Drug Safety Reforms\n\n       Washington, DC.--As Congress prepares to vote on the most \n     significant prescription drug safety legislation in 45 years, \n     a new Consumer Reports poll finds that the American public \n     strongly backs a host of key safety reforms. Nine out of 10 \n     agree that all clinical drug trial results should be made \n     public, and that the government should have the power to \n     require warning labels and follow-up studies on drugs with \n     safety problems.\n       In general, the survey found consumers support the \n     government taking whatever steps necessary to ensure the \n     safety of prescription drugs--84 percent agree that the \n     government should ``have the authority to take any action \n     necessary'' to ensure drug safety, with 50 percent strongly \n     agreeing.\n       Also, more than 60 percent of Americans agree that the Food \n     and Drug Administration and Congress have failed to \n     adequately protect consumers from harmful prescription drugs.\n       ``The message we're hearing from consumers couldn't be \n     clearer--they want strong laws to ensure our prescription \n     drugs are as safe and effective as possible,'' said Jim \n     Guest, CEO of Consumers Union, publisher of Consumer Reports.\n       ``Right now drug companies can game the system by touting \n     the positive results from their drug studies, while \n     downplaying information about harmful side effects,'' Guest \n     added. ``Americans are fed up with being kept in the dark \n     about critical health and safety information, and they \n     overwhelmingly want change.''\n       The telephone survey of 1,026 randomly selected adults, \n     conducted March 15-18 by the Consumer Reports National \n     Research Center, asked about reforms that would strengthen \n     the nation's drug safety system. The margin of error is +/\n     -3.1 percent. Among the responses:\n       96 percent agree that the government should have the power \n     to require warning labels if safety problems are identified--\n     with 80 percent of those ``strongly agreeing'' to that \n     authority. Right now, the Food and Drug Administration must \n     negotiate safety warning labels with a drug maker.\n       93 percent agree that the FDA should have the power to \n     order follow-up safety studies, with 65 percent ``strongly \n     agreeing'' to that authority. Today, the FDA generally does \n     not have the authority to require safety studies be performed \n     once a drug is on the market.\n       92 percent of Americans agree that pharmaceutical companies \n     should make public the results of all of their clinical trial \n     studies, which reveal a drug's effectiveness as well as \n     possible hazardous side effects. Of those, 68 percent \n     ``strongly agreed'' that drug studies should be made public.\n       Such studies are used to get a drug approved and generally \n     are conducted on human subjects. The makers of Vioxx and \n     Paxil had studies that indicated safety problems for years, \n     but failed to release those results to the public. Vioxx \n     eventually was removed from the market after being linked to \n     increased risk of heart attack and stroke; antidepressants in \n     the class of Paxil now carry black-box warnings about \n     increased suicide risk in adolescents and adults under 25.\n       84 percent agree that advertisements for a prescription \n     drug with safety concerns should be prohibited; with 59 \n     percent ``strongly agreeing'' to such limits.\n       ``Consumers expect Congress to take their concerns about \n     drug safety seriously, and deliver legislation that will \n     prevent future Vioxx-type disasters,'' said Bill Vaughan, \n     Consumers Union senior policy analyst.\n       ``Failure to act this year on the strongest possible bill, \n     when more than 80 percent of Americans agree that Congress \n     should do whatever is necessary to ensure drug safety, would \n     equate to gross legislative malpractice,'' Vaughan added.\n       The Senate Health Committee is expected to vote Wednesday \n     on a bill that includes important drug safety measures, as \n     well as reauthorizing pharmaceutical industry user fees to \n     support the FDA drug-approval and safety process (S. 1082). \n     The last significant drug safety legislation in 1962 required \n     manufacturers to prove their drugs had some positive effect, \n     but failed to give the FDA power to quickly protect the \n     public when safety questions were raised.\n       Consumers Union and other patient and safety organizations \n     are working to further strengthen the drug safety legislation \n     to require the public release of all clinical trial data, \n     make safety disputes open to public scrutiny, and raise the \n     profile of drug safety and science in the FDA.\n\n\n    Conflict-of-interests between Pharma and FDA also a top concern\n\n       The survey found that 84 percent of consumers agree that \n     drug companies have too much influence over the government \n     officials who regulate them. More than two-thirds (67 \n     percent) are concerned that much of the FDA's funding comes \n     from the pharmaceutical industry, with more than half--54 \n     percent--``very concerned'' about that funding situation.\n       Congress is expected this summer to reauthorize the \n     Prescription Drug User Fee Act, first passed in 1992 to speed \n     up drug approvals by having the industry help fund the FDA \n     approval process. The original act has been extended twice \n     and is slated to expire this fall unless Congress \n     reauthorizes it. The FDA-industry proposal calls for industry \n     to pay $393 million annually to the FDA, an increase of $87 \n     million over the previous PDUFA agreement. S. 1082 adds \n     additional user fees for safety.\n       Consumers also were concerned about conflicts of interest \n     on advisory boards that approve drugs for market. Six in 10 \n     disapproved of allowing doctors and scientists with a \n     conflicting financial interest to participate on advisory \n     boards.\n       More than half of consumers say they currently take a \n     prescription drug, which translates to 124 million adults. A \n     significant number--40 percent--say they had experienced an \n     adverse reaction to a medication.\n       ``Four out of 10 Americans say they've had a bad reaction \n     to a prescription drug, yet the FDA only receives about half \n     a million adverse-event reports a year,'' Vaughan said. \n     ``Clearly, the FDA needs to do a better job fielding \n     consumers'' experiences with side effects. ``\n\n\nPrescription drug advertising influences prescribing; should be limited\n\n       Americans are very aware of prescription drug advertising, \n     with nine out of 10 Americans (91 percent) reporting they had \n     seen a drug ad on television or in print, or heard one on \n     radio. More than a quarter of those (26 percent) said they \n     asked for a specific medication they learned about in an ad.\n       Three-quarters of consumers (75 percent) agreed that drug \n     ads lead to over-prescribing, with 38 percent ``strongly \n     agreeing.'' And 59 percent agreed the government should \n     restrict advertising by pharmaceutical companies, with 26 \n     percent strongly agreeing to such restrictions.\n       Yet some consumers find drug ads useful in talking to their \n     doctor (63 percent agree, 24 percent strongly agree) and \n     others agreed they help consumers take charge of their health \n     care (54 percent agree, 14 percent strongly agree).\n       ``Consumers are very concerned that advertising drives up \n     the prescription drug use and health-care costs, and they'd \n     like to see restrictions on those ads,'' Vaughan said.\n                                  ____\n\n                                    The Society for Cardiovascular\n\n\n                                Angiography and Interventions,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 17, 2007.\n     Hon.

We are \n     very pleased that the Pediatric Medical Device Safety and \n     Improvement Act has been included in the Chairman's mark of \n     S. 1082, the ``Food and Drug Administration Revitalization \n     Act,'' for consideration by the Senate Health, Education, \n     Labor and Pensions Committee tomorrow. Your proposal is an \n     important step forward.\n\n[[Page S5299]]\n\n       The Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and \n     Interventions is a professional association representing over \n     3,700 invasive and interventional cardiologists. SCAI \n     promotes excellence in cardiac catheterization, angiography, \n     and interventional cardiology through physician education and \n     representation, and quality initiatives to enhance patient \n     care.\n       Fortunately, cardiovascular disease is far less common in \n     the pediatric population than it is in the adult population. \n     This good fortune does however frequently lead to unique \n     challenges for the pediatric interventional cardiologist who \n     treats these patients. Some of the challenges are clinical \n     and we are more frequently solving those problems, saving \n     children's lives and avoiding the trauma of surgery. Other \n     challenges, and perhaps the most frustrating ones are related \n     to obtaining the safe medical devices necessary to treat \n     these patients. Devices that are available to our colleagues \n     in Europe are not available in America. We support the FDA's \n     efforts to ensure that only safe and effective medical \n     devices are used on patients in our country, but when the \n     entry barriers into the American markets are so high that \n     manufactures refuse to enter--some patients suffer and die \n     needlessly. Required is an appropriate balance between the \n     sometimes mutually exclusive goals of safety and \n     availability.\n       We are especially pleased that your legislation will \n     require the FDA to issue guidance to institutional review \n     committees (IRCs) on how to appropriately consider the use of \n     the humanitarian device exemption (HDE) at their institution. \n     When HDE devices are not part of an ongoing trial, IRC's \n     (which focus on reviewing the care of patients in trials) are \n     sometimes confused.\n       We believe that giving the FDA explicit statutory authority \n     to extrapolate from adult to pediatric patients in \n     appropriate situations could help FDA officials expedite \n     their review of some pediatric medical devices.\n       We applaud the provision that allows companies to make a \n     profit on HDE devices designed for children. This change will \n     encourage the development of more devices by providing an \n     opportunity for profit and also by reducing concerns about \n     audits, specifically those using different assumptions which \n     could determine a profit was made when a manufacturer \n     calculated their financial situation differently. We note \n     that the 4,000 cap is arbitrary and far below the patient \n     limit that is placed on orphan drugs. We believe that more \n     devices will be available to pediatric patients and those \n     with congenital heart disease if that cap is raised. We \n     encourage you to consider such an increase either as a part \n     of this legislation or broader FDA reform legislation.\n       We look forward to working with you and your staff to \n     support passage of this legislation and thank you once again \n     for your efforts.

We greatly appreciate your efforts \n     to expand pediatric patients' access to safe medical devices. \n     Your proposal is an important step forward.\n       The Heart Rhythm Society is the international leader in \n     science, education and advocacy for cardiac arrhythmia \n     professionals and patients, and the primary information \n     resource on heart rhythm disorders. Our mission is to improve \n     the care of patients by promoting research, education and \n     optimal health care policies and standards. We represent over \n     4300 specialists in cardiac pacing and electrophysiology.\n       We believe the Pediatric Medical Device Safety Act of 2007 \n     would help promote needed innovation and focus efforts on \n     defining and then attempting to meet the unique needs of the \n     pediatric population. In our area this would translate into \n     improved medical device treatments for arrhythmias, such as \n     use of pacemakers and Internal Cardioverter Defibrillators \n     (ICDs) tailored to pediatric patients.\n       Also of great interest to the field of pediatric \n     electrophysiology are the proposed grants for research and \n     the crafting of an agenda for evaluation of ``long-term \n     safety and effectiveness of pediatric medical devices.'' \n     Additional funds could potentially be utilized to create a \n     pediatric version of the ICD RegistryTM a database \n     registry which captures implant and outcomes data ICDs used \n     in patients at risk for sudden cardiac arrest. This project \n     would go a long way to achieve the goal outlined in Section \n     7(b)2, to ``assess the impact of growth, development, \n     activity level and other factors on the safety and efficacy \n     of the devices.''\n       We look forward to supporting you and your staff in \n     securing passage of this legislation and we thank you for \n     your efforts to enable the youngest of our patients life-\n     saving access to safe and effective medical devices. Amy \n     Melnick, Vice President, Health Policy will coordinate the \n     Heart Rhythm Society efforts to support this bill. She can be \n     reached at (202) 464-3434 or amelnick@hrsonline.org. Please \n     do not hesitate to contact us and thank you for accepting our \n     endorsement.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                    Dwight Reynolds, MD, FHRS,\n\n                                                        President,\n     Heart Rhythm Society.\n                                  ____\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 19, 2007.\n     Hon.

Mike Enzi,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, \n         and Pensions.\n       Dear Chairman Kennedy and Ranking Member Enzi: On behalf of \n     the American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy (AACP) and \n     our nation's 97 accredited colleges and schools of pharmacy \n     we thank you for your efforts to protect the public's health \n     through the introduction of the ``Food and Drug \n     Administration Revitalization Act of 2007.'' AACP, the \n     national organization representing and supporting colleges \n     and schools of pharmacy and their faculties, is committed to \n     education and scholarship for improving drug therapy.\n       In particular we appreciate the legislation's provisions \n     that will support the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) \n     publicly stated need to improve the science knowledge which \n     supports and improves their decision making and regulatory \n     oversight. Science knowledge grows on a daily basis and the \n     academic community, including academic pharmacy, is the best \n     place to look for individuals whose research is creating that \n     new knowledge. Your legislation helps the FDA increase its \n     science knowledge in partnership with academic pharmacy \n     through:\n       Opportunities to engage in extramural research; Influencing \n     FDA directly through nominations from academic pharmacy to \n     advisory committees, and the Reagan-Udall Foundation Board of \n     Directors; and actively engaging in the multiple \n     opportunities for public comment on the implementation of \n     many of the legislation's provisions.\n       Your recognition that the academic biomedical research \n     community is a cutting-edge knowledge resource recognizes the \n     important trend of translational research. AACP members are \n     already engaged with the Agency for Healthcare Research and \n     Quality (AHRQ) Centers for Education and Research on \n     Therapeutics (CERTs) program and the DEcIDE Network. This \n     provides the FDA with an excellent network of researchers \n     prepared to analyze drug safety data. Our members are in the \n     initial stages of developing practice-based research networks \n     (PBRN) that can further assist the Committee and the FDA in \n     reaching the goal of improved risk evaluation and mitigation. \n     This broad research capacity extends to medical devices, \n     pediatric care, and manufacturing.\n       The members of AACP appreciate your commitment to \n     protecting the public's health and stand ready to assist you \n     as your legislation continues the process of congressional \n     action. Please do not hesitate to contact me should you need \n     additional information regarding the role of academic \n     pharmacy in revitalizing the FDA.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               William G. Lang IV,\n                                           VP Policy and Advocacy.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, we have very solid legislation that is \ngoing to make a very important difference--very important difference in \nprotecting the American consumer. We now have in place leadership at \nthe Food and Drug Administration; for 5 of the last 6 years that has \nnot been so. We have in place leadership, and we are going to give that \nagency the kind of tools necessary for protection the American people \nare entitled to and to restore the kind of luster that should go with \nthe Food and Drug Administration, which is so important to the health \nand well-being of American families.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I wish to thank the Senator from \nMassachusetts, Senator Kennedy, for his outstanding presentation on \nwhat is in the bill.\n  I rise to speak about S. 1082 as well. It is a comprehensive bill to \nenhance drug safety and provide key resources to the Food and Drug \nAdministration--the FDA--for the review of new drugs, for the review of \nmedical devices, and to ensure that drugs and devices for children are \nsafe and effective. It has been a long and careful road for this bill.\n  The Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions \nembarked on a top-to-bottom review of the FDA's drug safety and \napproval process over 2 years ago. This bill is the culmination of our \nreview and the input of hundreds of stakeholders. I wish to speak for a \nfew minutes discussing why the drug safety components and the changes \nthat are being made are so critical to restoring the\n\n[[Page S5300]]\n\npeace of mind to Americans who want to be assured the drugs they \npurchase to address illnesses and chronic medical conditions can be \nrelied on and trusted.\n  ``Bipartisan'' is a word that is kind of thrown around in this \nChamber a lot, and sometimes it means that one person from one party \njoins several people from the other party. For Senator Kennedy and me, \nbipartisan means you actually work together to find out what the \nproblem is, what the potential solutions are, and how you can meet \nthose needs. I mentioned it has been a long process--over 2 years--and \nit is still a work in progress--and we are making progress.\n  We held hearings on the FDA. A lot of those hearings were held in the \nheat of the moment, when certain drugs were having problems, and we \nrecognize that is a problem. One of the problems with Congress is we \nusually see that if it is worth reacting to, it is worth overreacting \nto. We have always taken a very careful view in our committee to make \nsure that was not the case.\n  Other committees held hearings on the FDA, even though the FDA is \nunder the jurisdiction of our committee, and we have no problem with \nthat. We have taken the suggestions we have gotten through those \nhearings and considered them for this legislation. Then we drew up a \nlist of principles, and we took that to the stakeholders to see what \nall the people involved thought about the principles we had. Then we \ndid the tough part. We drafted the details. It is easy to sell \nconcepts, but details are tough. Until you have those details put down \nin writing and have people look at every word that is in them, you \ncan't tell whether you have a bill. But we went through that process. \nWe took it back to the stakeholders. We redrafted. We filed the bill. \nWe had more hearings. This year, we have had more hearings on FDA, and \nwe have had a markup. That is when all the Committee Members are \noffered a chance to request or suggest amendments to the bill.\n  We probably had about 50 amendments and we worked on the 12 major \ncategories of amendments. Some of those were worked into the bill as \npart of the markup. Some of them have been put into the manager's \namendment. I mentioned this is a work in progress. We are still looking \nat some of those, figuring out what is needed and how to get there. I \nappreciate the cooperation we have had from the Members with their \nsuggestions and the staffs of the Members with their suggestions, \nbecause throughout the last weekend, there were hours and hours and \nhours spent by Senator Kennedy's staff and my staff and the interested \nSenators and their staffs to arrive at the best possible solution. We \nare not there yet. We are close. That is the way we work on bills--a \nlong process with decisions being made up to the last possible moment \nso that we can have the best possible solution for the people of this \ncountry. That is bipartisan.\n  It was mentioned there have been some hearings on food safety. \nRecently, there has been some real criticism of the FDA on food safety. \nWe held hearings on food safety. I don't want the people of this \ncountry to think it is all bad. In fact, I was amazed that three \nFederal agencies have to work together on a food problem. The CDC, the \nDepartment of Agriculture, and the Food and Drug Administration have to \nwork together because each of them has a role in discovering whether \nthere is a problem. I was amazed to find out that with as few as 50 \ncases spread out across the whole United States, they can diagnose and \ndetermine there is a problem and get products off the market. If you \nare not amazed with that, you are not paying attention. We have \nagencies that work together, and they work together in critical times \nto solve problems for the people of America. They can notice, with a \nreal small sampling--when you consider the millions of people in this \ncountry, the millions of people who are being fed every day,--they can \nrecognize a problem with the food supply and get the harmful product \noff the market. It would be nice if they could prevent that. They are \nworking on that.\n  But when you consider the number of producers in this country and \nother countries, they have a tremendous job, and we have to be sure \nthey have the tools to do that job as well. But that is a job that is \nin addition to the drug approvals. This bill concentrates on the drug \napprovals.\n  Vioxx was one of the triggers of these discussions. As we saw with \nVioxx, the FDA doesn't have enough tools to deal with newly identified \nrisks when those risks become evident after a drug has been on the \nmarket for some time. Most of the FDA's current authority is based on \ninformation and plans available at the time of approval. They have a \nmassive job determining if a drug is ready to go to market. What is \namazing is that once they have given that approval, their options are \nvery limited. Now, that creates a little bit of a dilemma for them. \nThey don't know everything that will happen with that drug. Yes, it has \nbeen through clinical trials. What is a clinical trial? It is a \ncontrolled study of people taking the drug, and sometimes people who \nare not taking the drug--a controlled study. Once that drug is \napproved, it goes out to the whole market--not controlled people, not \npeople that we know what other drugs they are taking or what other \nkinds of things they are doing. That can have a different result than \nunder a controlled situation.\n  The FDA's choice has been to take the information and approve the \ndrug and then monitor the drug, but have relatively few tools after \nthat point. What can be the result of that? The FDA can say let's \nreally be careful before we approve this because we will have expended \nour toolbox. They have said: If you will give us a bigger toolbox for \nafter the approval, we can approve the drugs quicker. We can have some \nassurance that because of the controlled study things will be fine. But \nwe won't have to worry quite as much about preapproval because we will \nhave tools after approval--tools for quick recognition of additional \nproblems as it goes out to the major markets.\n  We need to have that happen if we are going to have safe drugs in \nthis country. We have always relied on that, and we expect that. The \nFDA, for the most part, has delivered.\n  So much more needs to be done to clarify the FDA's authority, to give \nthem the bigger toolbox so that FDA can proactively react to additional \nsafety information whenever that safety information is discovered. That \nis the purpose of this underlying legislation. The FDA does have some \nauthority to manage the risks of drugs--for drugs such as novel cancer \ntherapies approved under subpart H for accelerated approval. Is that \nfaster approval? The FDA has the authority to apply restrictions on \ndistribution and use for those drugs at the time of approval to provide \nfurther safeguards against misuse and adverse reactions. However, if \nsuch a risk is determined after the drug is on the market, the only \noption FDA has now is to pull the drug from the market, disrupting \npatient care.\n  Some of the people who have that drug are deriving a tremendous \nbenefit from it and are not having the adverse reaction and would feel \nhurt if it is pulled away from them as the only option that the FDA \nhas. The FDA does not want to disrupt patient care. The FDA just wants \nto protect patients. Those who need the protection they want to help; \nthose who don't need the protection ought to be able to get the \ncontinuing patient care. The option now, I repeat, is to pull the drug \nfrom everybody. Then, of course, they can put it back on the market so \nit can apply those special risk management tools. We have chosen to \ngive the FDA in this bill the authority to impose those restrictions \nafter a drug comes on the market, too, so there is no disruption in \npatient care.\n  The bill also makes several key improvements to how patients get \ntheir information through advertising and labeling. The changes ensure \nthat patients get access to new and changing information in a timely \nmanner. As Vioxx made clear, FDA has very little authority to require \nlabeling changes postmarket. Those changes are primarily negotiated and \nthey don't have any time limits on the two parties coming to agreement \nto the labeling change.\n  Now, we have included provisions that ensure that those discussions \nbetween the FDA and a drug manufacturer come to a close, rather than \nrelying on the FDA's ``nuclear option,''\n\n[[Page S5301]]\n\nwhich is pulling the drug from the market. It hurts a lot of patients \nand disrupts their care.\n  Imagine a system that gives the FDA, through sound science and \nremarkable innovation, the tools to get drugs to the market quickly and \nefficiently, especially when lives are on the line and people need new \ndrugs and therapies. Imagine a system that gives the FDA new authority \nto take swift, appropriate, and decisive action to ensure patient \nsafety and protect consumers when new information comes to light to \nexpose unexpected risks. We can make this a reality with the passage of \nthis bill.\n  FDA doesn't have a current mechanism for active, routine surveillance \nof potential safety problems. Thus, it cannot as readily detect safety \nproblems after a drug has been put on the market--short of a \ncatastrophe. FDA has minimal authority to require additional \nobservational studies or clinical trials after the product is already \non the market. FDA cannot even make companies finish studies they have \nagreed to pursue concerning safety impacts on patients.\n  Given the current FDA limitations, I strongly felt it was necessary \nto correct those problems and ensure that FDA has the right tools and \ntoolbox to address drug safety after the drug is on the market. That is \nwhy this bill creates the risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or \nREMS. The REMS gives FDA a full toolbox of options for dealing with \npotential safety problems, even if they are discovered after a drug is \nfirst marketed. I hope you are noticing a trend.\n  With this new toolbox, FDA has the ability to identify side effects \nafter the drug is marketed through active surveillance. FDA also has \nthe authority to request a separate study or clinical trial to learn \nmore about a particular potential safety problem. FDA can also obtain \ntimely label changes for the first time under the new REMS system.\n  How does this all work together? A house cannot be built without a \nfoundation. Routine, active safety monitoring using large linked \ndatabases--what I like to call ``health IT for drug safety''--is the \nfoundation. Risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, is the \nhouse.\n  I thank the Senator from New Hampshire, Mr. Gregg, for all of his \nwork on health IT for drug safety and his emphasis on being able to \nhave the right surveillance and the right triggers to be able to put \nthese things into place at an appropriate time. In designing that \nhouse, you can have a small, simple house, or you can have a big \nfancy house. The size and complexity of your house should match your \nneeds. The REMS is customizable, buildable to address whatever risks \nare present for the drug in question. The REMS allows you to build an \naddition for your house if your family grows, for example. You can also \nmove into a smaller home if you find you don't need so much space.\n\n  Let's talk about how this would work. Let's say drug A treats high \nblood pressure, has very few side effects. Therefore, the label and use \nof routine, active safety monitoring will be enough to manage the risk. \nDrug A doesn't need a REMS. However, drug B, which also treats high \nblood pressure, has serious side effects, including occasional liver \nfailure. The label and use of routine, active safety monitoring is not \nenough to manage the risk. Therefore, drug B needs REMS.\n  The REMS will include extra warnings on the label, perhaps periodic \nletters to doctors to remind them of the risks, and require testing and \na system to test patients for liver enzyme levels before they are \nallowed to fill a prescription. As I said, not every drug needs a REMS. \nHowever, every drug will need a very active FDA with all of the \nnecessary tools to identify and quickly manage additional risks.\n  Like everyone else, when I purchase a product for myself, my \nchildren, or my grandchildren, I want the assurance that the product is \nsafe and beneficial. This bill gives the FDA the necessary resources \nand tools so that moms and dads are able to trust that product at the \npharmacy counter and know that it is safe and effective.\n  As I mentioned, this bill is still a work in progress. There are a \ndozen amendments, several of which have been in the managers' \namendment, and several are still being worked on. We do want faster \ndrug approval, but we want assurances that as the whole population \nbecomes a clinical trial, connections can be made quickly to any \nproblems without the need to pull the drug off the market and away from \nthose who could benefit. I will have more to say about other potential \nthings that will not be in this bill that I think would complicate the \nbill or maybe be adverse to what we are trying to do in the bill, and \nsome of them that have not had enough study yet. I will comment on \nthose as they come up, if they come up.\n  At this point, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I appreciate the words of my colleague, \nthe Senator from Wyoming, Mr. Enzi. S. 1082 is a major piece of \nlegislation that aims to--and will--achieve a profoundly important \ngoal. It will improve the public health.\n  When it is riskier to take a drug than to skip it, the public health \nis compromised. When a lifesaving prescription drug or medical device \nlanguishes at the FDA because of backlogs in the approval process, the \npublic health is compromised.\n  When pediatricians are forced to fly by the seat of their pants \nbecause there is no data to guide the use of a drug or medical device \nin children specifically, the public health is compromised.\n  When FDA has the responsibility but lacks the tools to assess the \nsafety or effectiveness of a new drug or device, the public health is \ncompromised.\n  S. 1082 tackles each of these problems. It gives FDA more authority \nand drugmakers a greater incentive to assure the safety of medicines \nbefore and after drug approval.\n  It reauthorizes user fees, an additional source of funding that \nenables FDA to speed up the approval of new prescription drugs and \nmedical devices.\n  It reauthorizes financial incentives to encourage drugmakers to test \ntheir products for use in children, and it establishes similar \nincentives for medical device manufacturers.\n  At the same time, it puts more teeth in FDA's authority to require \nstudies when the health or safety of children is clearly at risk.\n  S. 1082 creates a new institute charged with developing up-to-date \nmethods of assessing the safety and effectiveness of cutting-edge \nmedical interventions.\n  You are no doubt going to hear complaints about this bill. Some \nMembers will tell you that it is overly bureaucratic. Coincidentally, \nthat is exactly what the brand-name drug industry says about it.\n  Nobody can accuse the drugmakers of inconsistency. They consistently \nplace their own self-interest ahead of health care safety, access, and \naffordability.\n  The drug industry doesn't want FDA to take additional steps to \nprevent prescription-drug-related injury or death, although the drug \nindustry is open to being shielded from liability when those tragedies \nhappen. When Members of this body stand up and claim this bill is too \nbureaucratic, don't buy into it.\n\n  This is a carefully crafted bipartisan bill. It is less stringent \nthan consumer groups want and more stringent than the drug industry \nwants. In other words, it is a compromise--a compromise that will \nimprove the public health. There will be amendments to this bill. As \nMembers on both sides of the aisle review them, I urge them to remember \nthis: Amendments that improve drug safety will benefit consumers and \nreduce health care costs. Amendments that increase price competition in \nthe prescription drug market will benefit consumers and reduce health \ncare costs. And amendments that weaken this bill or block price \ncompetition in the marketplace will benefit--who else--the brand-name \ndrug industry.\n  The drug industry has more than 3,000 lobbyists here and in the House \nof Representatives. Last year alone, the drug industry spent more than \n$150 million lobbying at the Federal level. That is quite a home court \nadvantage. As one might imagine, people who have lost loved ones to \nunsafe drugs and people who cannot afford to fill their prescriptions \ndon't have quite as deep pockets as the drug industry. Still, this is a \ndrug safety bill, this is a drug access bill, this is not a drug \nindustry bill.\n  I hope every Member will consider the bill and every amendment in \nthat\n\n[[Page S5302]]\n\ncontext because in that context, when we vote on the final bill, if we \nvote yes, we will be voting to improve the public health.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I was necessarily absent from the \nSenate at the conclusion of Senator Enzi's remarks. I again thank him \nfor an excellent presentation, with the emphasis on the safety aspects \nof this legislation.\n  I think all of us are reassured we are on the right track, not only \nas a result of the extensive hearings we held but the very extensive \nreview the Institute of Medicine gave, a highly regarded, highly \nrespected agency. During the course of the hearings, we had very good \nattendance and exchange of the representatives of the Institute of \nMedicine, and we have worked with them subsequently in terms of the \nlanguage and refinements.\n  As we said, we didn't just copy everything, but the essential aspect \nof the safety provisions in our legislation is, quite frankly, \npreferable.\n  I look forward to working closely with Senator Enzi as well on the \nother areas of public policy in terms of food safety and the follow-on \nbiologics which we are very much involved in as well.\n  I thank the Senator from Ohio for his comments. We know him for being \nsomeone who has spent a great deal of time making sure safe drugs are \ngoing to get to people who need them. There are many dimensions to this \ndebate. He has certainly been one whom, over the course of time, on the \nHealth Committee in the House of Representatives, I have had an \nopportunity to work with on a number of health issues. He has been very \nactive and involved with this issue on our committee and also on making \nsure we are going to have not only safe drugs but also have access to \nthem.\n  I will take a moment, because I think it is probably worthwhile in \nthe opening presentation, to go through one of the real safety crises \nwe had with prescription drugs and look at what existing authority was \nthere and then how that could have been handled under that legislation.\n  People will look through this legislation--it is not all that long, \nbut it is complex. The results are enormously important and very basic \nand very fundamental. I use Vioxx as a point of illustration, which I \nthink most Americans remember the circumstances where hundreds of \nthousands of Americans with heart needs were put at risk.\n  This was really the question--this is the FDA Reauthorization Act--\nhow we could have averted the Vioxx disaster. I think people are \nbeginning to study this legislation, and also our colleagues who are \nreviewing the record ask about how this legislation can make a \ndifference on a particular drug. This chart is very useful in \nunderstanding that point.\n  Can the FDA quickly detect safety problems with a drug? Vioxx, no. \nUnder our legislation, the answer is yes. Senator Enzi gave an \nexcellent presentation about how that can be done using the most modern \ntechnology, using the greatest availability of public and private \ncollections of adverse reactions, and bringing those together within \nthe agency. We know all of that is going to gradually expand in the \nfuture, so that agency will have the best of science. They will be able \nto protect safety. The answer with this legislation is yes.\n  Can the FDA require label changes to warn of safety problems? The \nanswer with Vioxx was no. They spent 14 months trying to negotiate the \nissue of the labels. Under our legislation, they would be able to do \nthat.\n  I mention that as one of the things they will be able to do. They can \neither take the drug off the market--they have the power to do it. It \nis not done because you don't want to take the chance that there may be \nsome people in the public, given the health risks, who are justified in \ntaking that particular medication, but for the great mass of people, it \nmight not be. Can we put label changes on? They would be able to do it \nvery quickly.\n  Are companies stopped from hiding safety problems? This comes back to \nwhat both Senator Enzi and I referenced in making public clinical \ntrials. That is enormously important. Senator Mikulski has been very \ninvolved in the transparency parts of this legislation. I hope those in \nthe Senate who are interested and concerned about the issues of \ntransparency might take a moment and talk with Senator Mikulski. \nHopefully, she will speak on these issues because she has made a very \nimportant contribution.\n  Part of this transparency is that these clinical trials will be \navailable, to understand the significance of any safety problems, which \nhasn't been the case, but they will also be available to people who may \nwant to enroll in a clinical trial, who have a particular illness, a \nparticular disease and know there is a particular trial that is going \nto take place and say: I think I want to enroll in that particular \ntrial because it is taking place. People don't know that now. That is \nenormously important and valuable to people. Whoever becomes part of a \nclinical trial and finds out a particular drug can be lifesaving, it is \nof enormous importance and consequence.\n  We have the knowledge of the clinical trial in terms of safety but \nalso in terms of the opportunities that are coming up, particularly in \nthis period of life sciences, with these extraordinary breakthroughs we \nare seeing now--the mapping of the human genome, sequencing of the \ngene, and I think before long in stem cell research we are going to see \nincredible possibilities, and people are going to want to become part \nof clinical trials.\n  But with regard to responding to this--are companies stopped from \nhiding safety problems, yes; does FDA have flexible tools to enforce \nsafety decisions--it was expressed very well by Senator Enzi. He was \ntalking about the big toolbox. That is the way we should look at it. \nThere is a variety of tools in that toolbox. He explained that. There \nare a number of different ways that those who are committed to safety \ncan titrate these different availabilities to ensure safety. Some may \nrequire a heavier hand than others. What we want, obviously, is to do \nenough to provide protection but not enough to discourage use where it \nis necessary.\n  Finally, is FDA the gold standard for protecting public health and \nassuring access? We are strongly committed to making sure it is. We \nbelieve that with the safety protections we have put in the bill and \nalso the inclusions, working with the pharmaceutical industry in terms \nof PDUFA and MDUFA to try to always find ways of expediting the \nconsideration of these lifesaving drugs--that was one of the very \nimportant purposes, giving emphasis for research of many of the areas \nof health that are of such concern to the American people: cancer, \ncardiovascular issues, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, \njuvenile diabetes disease, the AIDS virus, and many others--we can try \nto move toward a better relationship between the companies and FDA, in \nthe sense that we can move this process, move more quickly, but do it \nmore safely. That is what we are attempting to do, to ensure, in this \nlife science century, that these breakthrough opportunities are going \nto be available and also do it in a way that will be safe. This is an \nexample of one of the challenges the country has been facing recently, \nbetween the old and the new.\n\n  We have tried this afternoon to describe in greater detail the \nvarious provisions of the legislation. We have not spent a great deal \nof time on the provisions which were supported by the Senator from \nWyoming and myself with regard to children. Our committee has \nrecognized, through the good work of Senator Dodd and Senator Clinton, \nthe fact that children are not just little grownups; they are children. \nMany of these substances have different reactions, different impacts in \nterms of their development. It has taken special kinds of focus and \nattention to try to be more responsive to those needs. Our committee \nhas done that. As a result, we see strong support from the American \nPediatric Society and others for the way we have addressed those issues \nand modernized provisions to encourage greater research but also to \nprotect the interests of children. We have\n\n[[Page S5303]]\n\nstrong support from the various groups that have spent their lifetime \nspeaking for children.\n  We will probably have an opportunity to get into some greater detail \nin discussion of those provisions. As I mentioned briefly in our \ncomments, we have recognized the importance of developing and upgrading \nthe science function in this agency. We think the FDA--at a time we are \nhaving breakthroughs in knowledge, in science, in so many areas, we \nwant to make sure the FDA is out there on the cutting edge with respect \nto these breakthroughs and know where they are going. We have paid \nparticular attention to those as well.\n  Then the Udall-Reagan Foundation is to try to look longer term at \nways in which the agency functions and take a longer look to make \nrecommendations to the private sector and to the public sector about \nhow it can be more effective generally. That kind of idea has not been \nincluded in the past. It can very well be enormously valuable and \nhelpful to legislators in the future.\n  We have tried to get legislation that will provide the protection \npresently, help and assist breakthrough technologies, and provide a \nfaster track for the American people in the future, but to do it with \ngreater safety protections for all families, and to recognize we are at \na time of breakthrough science, which that agency has to have, and \nthere are going to be breakthroughs in different modalities in that \nagency working in the future. We have tried to build into this an \nagency that can give us advice so we can be more effective in the \nfuture.\n  I hope we will be able to move ahead. I know we have gone through, in \ncareful detail, the administration's positions over the weekend. We \ncertainly respect those. We have had a good exchange with the \nadministration.\n  For those who are interested, if they read through the letter they \nsent to Senator Enzi and myself, and then if they look at the \nrecommendation of the Institute of Medicine, they will find we are much \ncloser to the recommendations of the Institute of Medicine. We may face \nsome amendments in those areas. We look forward to having a good \ndiscussion and debate and the opportunity to expand some of the points \nwe have made this evening.\n  Mr. ENZI. I thank particularly Secretary Leavitt and those people on \nhis staff. We had discussions over the weekend. They had some \nsuggestions for changes. We asked for more detail on those changes. We \nalso asked for them to be prioritized. I was pleased they were \ndelivered within a matter of a very short period of time. That shows \npeople in Government can work together and that they do work on the \nweekends to get these things done. A lot of people think when we go \ninto recess for a weekend, all work around here stops. But there are \ndedicated staff who put their best effort into getting together and \nworking together, sometimes in very tense situations and long hours, \nmostly through the night--last night. Then they have to draft what has \nactually been decided. It is a very difficult process. We owe them a \ngreat deal of credit. I want the American people to know that, too.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, we have the legislation before us. We \nhope those who have an interest and have some ideas, have some \namendments, will be in touch with Senator Enzi and ourselves through \nthis late afternoon, early evening, or first thing in the morning. We \nwant to try to address those amendments early in the day, as early as \nwe can. We understand both parties have their lunches and have \nimportant matters to discuss, and I am sure this will be among them. \nBut we are ready for any of the amendments, as I underline what Senator \nEnzi has said. We had great participation in our markup with the \nmembers of our committee. As he mentioned as well, we have had enormous \ninvolvement of our committee members and many others over the period \nsince the legislation was reported out of our committee until now.\n  We are still in the process of trying to do business because we think \nthis legislation is so important.

Mr. President, it is my privilege to congratulate the High \nRollers team of Cimarron-Memorial High School in Las Vegas. This team \nrecently won a championship victory at the FIRST Robotics Competition \nat the Georgia Dome in Atlanta.\n  The FIRST Robotics Competition, otherwise known as the ``Superbowl of \nSmarts,'' is designed to inspire young people to pursue opportunities \nin science and technology careers. The competition challenges teams of \nhigh school students and their mentors to construct robots over the \ncourse of 6 weeks while adhering to competition guidelines and design \nspecifications.\n  Founded in 1989 through the vision of inventor Dean Kamen, FIRST is a \nnot-for-profit whose acronym means ``For Inspiration and Recognition of \nScience and Technology.'' As a result of Mr. Kamen's leadership, FIRST \nhas grown into one of the leading robotics competitions in the entire \ncountry. Students from more than 1,300 high schools and 23 countries \nparticipated in this year's event.\n  The High Rollers team from Cimarron paired with a coalition of two \nhigh school teams from South Windsor, CT, and Worcester, MA, to win the \nnational championship title with a thrilling 59 to 54 victory in the \nfinal round. In honor of their victory, the students will meet with \nPresident Bush and attend a congressional reception where they will \ndemonstrate their robots and share their achievements with Members of \nCongress.\n  The Cimarron team has a long tradition of success that is reflective \nof their hard work, dedication, and creativity as well as Cimarron-\nMemorial High School's strong commitment to academic excellence. They \nwere among the top participants at the FIRST Las Vegas Regional held in \nMarch on the campus of the University of Nevada, Las Vegas and were \nnamed the Las Vegas regional champions in 2005 and 2006. I know that \nevery Member of the Senate joins me in honoring the extraordinary \naccomplishments of Cimarron-Memorial High School and its FIRST Robotics \nNational Championship team.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/30/senate-section/article/S5303-3", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5303-S5304]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      HONORING MARGARET BLACKSHERE\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Margaret Blackshere, \na woman for whom I have great respect and admiration.\n  Margaret Blackshere has been involved in the labor movement for more \nthan 40 years and remains deeply committed to helping the working \nfamilies of Illinois. Until February, she served as president of the 1-\nmillion-member strong Illinois AFL-CIO, the third-largest state labor \nbody in the country.\n  Over the years, she has never been afraid to roll up her sleeves and \njoin the picket line or to lead the march.\n  Margaret always arrived first and left last.\n  She knows that America's working men and women--those who perform \nsome of the most demanding yet vital tasks in our society--are the real \nheroes. For her, her service has been a privilege an opportunity to \nfight for rights she believes should be guaranteed.\n  Margaret didn't start out to be a labor leader; she began her career \nas a kindergarten teacher in Madison, IL. She became involved in the \nlabor movement almost by accident, after she and her fellow teachers \nwere repeatedly passed over for raises they had earned. In response, \nshe and her colleagues mobilized to pass a referendum that would raise \ntheir wages. It wasn't just about the money. It was about having a \nvoice.\n  This early effort led to a job with the local Illinois Federation of \nTeachers affiliate in Madison. Through hard work, Margaret rose to \nbecome statewide vice president of the IFT.\n\n[[Page S5304]]\n\n  In 1993, she was elected secretary-treasurer of the Illinois AFL-CIO. \nAt the time, there were only a handful of female officers in State \nlabor federations, and Margaret stood out as the only female officer \nfrom an industrialized State. In 2000, she was elected president of the \nIllinois AFL-CIO--the first woman to serve as president in the State \nfederation's 102-year history.\n  Under Margaret Blackshere's leadership, the Illinois AFL-CIO helped \nlead the fight to raise Illinois' minimum wage--not once but twice.\n  Margaret also led passionate efforts to guarantee women equal pay for \nequal work, to expand health care, and to improve Illinois' workers' \ncompensation system.\n  She has a gift for uniting people from diverse backgrounds, with very \ndifferent viewpoints, under a common goal. This is no easy task, and \none that many politicians regularly attempt but often fail.\n  Margaret recognized the importance of forming an alliance with the \nIllinois Manufacturers Association and helped to save and create \nIllinois manufacturing jobs.\n  She also helped to establish the Transportation for Illinois \nCoalition, which included groups as diverse as the Illinois Automobile \nAsphalt and Pavement Association and the Chicago Transit Authority, to \nspeak with a unified voice for Illinois' transportation funding needs.\n  As Margaret fought for Illinois' working families, she raised her own \nfamily and has two sons and four grandchildren.\n  She also devotes a great deal of time to charitable organizations. \nShe has served on the boards of a wide variety of institutions, \nincluding the Illinois branches of United Way and American Red Cross, \nAlliance for Retired Americans, Voices for Illinois Children, \nUnemployment Insurance Advisory Board, and the Federal Reserve Board of \nChicago. She also is a board member of the Illinois Women's Institute \nfor Leadership, which helps prepare women with progressive values run \nfor political office.\n  Over the years, Margaret has received many accolades and awards. In \n2000, the Labor Council for Latin Advancement honored her with the \nLabor Leader Award, and the State of Israel presented her with the \nIsrael Peace Medal. Margaret also received the Protector of Working \nPeople Award in 2002 from the Illinois State Crime Commission. Always \nproud of her Irish heritage, Margaret was delighted to be the Guest of \nHonor for Chicago's St. Patrick's Day Parade in 2003.\n  Margaret says that she doesn't really intend to retire--she will \nstill be fighting the same fights but will do so as a volunteer. She \nbelieves her future efforts will involve reaching out to workers in \ncountries across the globe.\n  Mr. President, I would like to congratulate Margaret Blackshere on \nher retirement and thank her for her efforts to protect working \nfamilies in Illinois and across the country. I wish her the very best \nin her future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/30/senate-section/article/S5304-1", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5304]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       RECOGNITION OF WES WILKINS\n\n Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, today I wish to honor Wes Wilkins, \nof Middleton, DE, who will on May 2, 2007, receive the Dr. Gary Burch \nMemorial Award, given annually to the railroad worker who has done the \nmost to improve the safety of railroad passengers. For more than 30 \nyears, Wes has worked on our Nation's railroads. As one of Amtrak's \nmost talented and innovative maintenance of way employees, he helped \ndesign the Switch Exchange System and provided input on every \noperational procedure involved with this new system of switching. The \nresult of his talent helped to ensure reliable and safe train travel on \nvirtually every mile of track between here and Boston, as well as \nacross the Nation. Wes also formed the Production and Construction \nSafety Committee, whose purpose is to help ensure safe practices \nthroughout Amtrak's Production Unit, which oversees installations. He \nis known for his countless hours of double- and triple-checking, of \ntraveling to trouble spots, and of helping teach others about safety. \nHis ability to operate almost every piece of maintenance equipment \nAmtrak uses and his success in instilling safety in the minds of his \ncoworkers make him quite worthy of this award. As someone who rides \nAmtrak to work, I can testify to the importance rail transportation \nplays in providing affordable, reliable, safe transportation and I feel \nsafer knowing someone like Wes is working on the front lines. Delaware \nis home to two of Amtrak's most important maintenance shops, and I \ncongratulate all of the Amtrak employees of Delaware who helped Wes \nearn this award. Wes should be proud of all he has done to make this \npossible and I wish him the best as he continues a distinguished career \nof public service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/30/senate-section/article/S5304-2", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5304]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          CELEBRATING PURDUE UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES' CENTENNIAL\n\n Mr. LUGAR.

Two years later she married Sam Walton and \nthey formed a lasting relationship of love, friendship and as business \npartners. Helen and Sam Walton opened their first retail store, a Ben \nFranklin ``five and dime'' in Newport, AR, in 1945.\n  The daughter of a successful lawyer, banker and rancher, Helen had a \nnatural instinct for good management and played an active role in the \nfamily business. She firmly believed in the concept of family \npartnerships and insisted that their four children--Rob, John, Jim and \nAlice--were partners of Walton Enterprises.

KLAY\n\n Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, today I honor a distinguished law \nenforcement officer for her service and dedication to our Nation. After \nnearly 24 years, Ms. Rachel R. Klay recently retired as a special agent \nwith the U.S. Secret Service.\n  Agent Klay was born in Orange City, IA, which, I might add, is just \nacross the border from my home State of South Dakota. After graduating \nfrom Northwestern College in Orange City, she then went on to graduate \nschool at Sangamon State University in Springfield, IL.\n  On September 6, 1983, Rachel was sworn in as a Special Agent with the \nUnited States Secret Service and assigned to the Chicago Field Office, \nwhere she served with distinction for 4 years. During the course of her \ncareer, Agent Klay also served at the Secret Service's Western \nProtective Division, the Washington Field Office, the Presidential \nProtective Division, the Liaison Division, and the Investigative \nSupport Division.\n  From 1999 to 2002, she worked as a Resident Agent in Sioux Falls, SD. \nShe then served in the Secret Service's Liaison Division before \nretiring earlier this year to take employment at the Federal Reserve \nBoard as a Senior Special Agent.\n  Over the past decade, I have had the pleasure of getting to know \nAgent Klay and have had the opportunity to see her in action, both in \nSouth Dakota and here in Washington, DC. While always quick with a \nsmile and a friendly demeanor, she also exuded the professionalism, \nconfidence, and courage associated with the tremendous responsibilities \nshe bore as a Special Agent with the Secret Service. Simply put, our \ncountry is better, stronger, and safer because of her service.\n  It is important and fitting that we as Americans recognize the \ninvaluable contribution made every day by law enforcement officers such \nas Agent Klay. These dedicated professionals put their lives on the \nline to investigate crimes and protect us and our families. Law \nenforcement officers such as Agent Klay are the ones who stand guard \nand preserve our safety. Their tireless efforts, personal sacrifices, \nand dedication to the rule of law are an example of what is right and \ngood about our country and those who serve it.\n  It is therefore my honor and privilege to pay tribute today to the \ndistinguished career and record of accomplishment provided by Special \nAgent Rachel Klay. Through her service, she has added to the reputation \nof integrity and valor of the United States Secret Service, and in \ndoing so has provided an invaluable service to our Nation. On behalf of \nSouth Dakota and a grateful nation, I thank Agent Klay for her service \nand wish her all the best in this new chapter in her life and \ncareer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/30/senate-section/article/S5305-2", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5305]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   HONORING REV. DR. MARVIN McMICKLE\n\n Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I wish to honor and congratulate \nan outstanding spiritual and community leader from my hometown of \nCleveland, OH. This year, the Reverend Dr. Marvin A. McMickle is \ncelebrating 20 years of service as pastor of Antioch Baptist Church, \nlocated in the heart of Cleveland's Fairfax neighborhood.\n  Founded in 1893, Antioch was the second African-American Baptist \nchurch established in Cleveland, and for more than a century it has \nsought to fulfill its mission ``to teach the word, provide outreach \nministries, worship god, evangelize, and build strong church \nrelationships.''\n  Since its inception, this historical landmark has nurtured leaders \nwho have championed civil rights and equality for the poor, and it has \nworked to increase awareness on issues of poverty, health care, \nemployment, education, and human rights. Today, under McMickle's \nleadership, Antioch offers over 70 programs and services to the \ncommunity, including the Loaves and Fish Program, which serves 220 hot \nmeals weekly, the Fellowship Fund, which provides emergency financial \naid for rent, utilities, and food, the Antioch Credit Union, which has \nassets in excess of $2.5 million, and a Head Start program, which \noffers early childhood preschool.\n  In 2002, McMickle and Antioch established the Antioch Development \nCorporation to expand community outreach. The corporation now operates \ntwo signature programs to help expand community outreach, through \nprograms like Agape, which offers HIV/AIDS counseling and testing \nservices, and Project RESPECT, a job training and placement program.\n  Reverend McMickle is an accomplished author and orator. He has \nwritten and delivered countless sermons and has applied his gift for \nspeaking as a professor of homiletics at the Ashland Theological \nSeminary in Ohio. McMickle has also been a visiting instructor at \nuniversities in New York, New Jersey, and Ohio, including Ashland \nTheological Seminary in Ashland, OH, Case Western Reserve University in \nCleveland, and Cleveland State University. He has authored nine books \nand dozens of articles that regularly appear in professional journals \nand magazines. He is a contributing editor for The Living Pulpit and a \nfeatured writer for the National Baptist Voice, the quarterly journal \nof the National Baptist Convention USA, Inc. His sermons and essays \nregularly appear in Preaching magazine and The African American Pulpit.\n  As a leader in the civil rights movement, Reverend McMickle has \nserved as president of both the Cleveland NAACP and Urban League. And \nMcMickle has also been a leader of numerous government and civic \norganizations, including the Shaker Heights Board of Education and the \nKaramu Performing Arts Center.\n  Over the years, I have worked with Reverend McMickle on various \ninitiatives and issues of concern to our community. He has been \nparticularly instrumental in supporting my efforts as Mayor, Governor, \nand U.S. Senator to prevent casino gambling from taking root in Ohio, \nand I thank him for his support on this issue.\n  Throughout all of his accomplishments, his loving and supportive wife \nPeggy, has stood by his side. And everyone who knows them would agree \nthat their union is a loving partnership to be admired. Reverend \nMcMickle and Peggy have been married for 31 years and have one son, \nAaron, who is a middle school teacher in New York City.\n  Mr. President. I want to take this opportunity to thank Reverend \nMcMickle for his exceptional community and spiritual leadership. He has \ndone God's work, and our lives are better as a result of having been \ntouched by him. I extend my congratulations to him on 20 years as \npastor of Antioch Baptist Church. May God continue to bless him and his \nfamily.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.

A bill to require the President to close the Department of \nDefense detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nto close the U.S. detention facilities at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.\n  Guantanamo has become a lightning rod for international condemnation. \nBoth allies and enemies have decried the stories of detainee abuse and \nthe U.S. refusal to acknowledge that the individuals held at Guantanamo \nare legally entitled to be treated in accord with the Geneva \nConventions. In short, the continued use of Guantanamo is causing more \ndamage than benefit in our war on terrorism.\n  The Supreme Court determined last summer that the Geneva Conventions \napplies to Guantanamo detainees, and Congress passed the Military \nCommissions Act in response. There remain court challenges and policy \nquestions as to whether the proceedings at Guantanamo are now legal. \nWhat is clear, however, is that, whether legal or not, Guantanamo is \nharming our national interests.\n  This is not solely my view.\n  Secretary of Defense Gates testified recently before the House \nDefense Appropriations Subcommittee. He said, ``I came to this position \nbelieving that Guantanamo should be closed. I know that people have \nexpressed that as a wish. The president has expressed it as a wish.'' \nThe Secretary remarked that Guantanamo has ``a taint about it.''\n  According to media accounts, the current and former Secretaries of \nState, Condoleezza Rice and Colin Powell, share this view.\n  Unfortunately, these expressions will not necessarily lead to \nconcrete action. On March 23, White House Press Secretary Tony Snow \nstated that it was unlikely that the Guantanamo detention facility \nwould close during the Bush Presidency.\n  That is unfortunate, but I think the way forward is now clear. It is \ntime to close the detention facilities at Guantanamo, and it is time \nfor the Congress to act. And so today I am proud to offer legislation \nto end detention operations at Guantanamo within a year.\n  Approximately 750 enemy combatants--including individuals believed to \nbe Taliban fighters or al-Qaida irregulars have been sent to Guantanamo \nsince January 11, 2002. Roughly 385 are there today, and it is \nestimated that only 60 to 80 of them will ever be charged. According to \na Pentagon spokesman last month, another 80 detainees remain at \nGuantanamo despite having been cleared for transfer or release.\n  This is an untenable situation.\n  Let me be clear. I have no room in my heart for al-Qaida members or \naffiliates. I know full well that they would kill innocent Americans \ngiven half the chance. But the people in this administration who have \nmade these decisions have never recognized that it is not just for the \ndetainees' sake that we comply with U.S. and international law, it is \nto our benefit as well.\n  As Senator McCain and GEN Colin Powell have forcefully argued, we \ntreat individuals in accordance with international law to ensure that \nAmericans captured in battle are treated likewise.\n  Unfortunately, due to the administration's decision not to apply \nArticle 3 of the Geneva Conventions and to allow new interrogation \ntechniques, there have been abuses. These have been documented, among \nother places, in the official report by Air Force LTG Randall Schmidt \non June 9, 2005.\n  Ironically, use of these techniques not only turned the tide of world \nopinion and shocked our consciences, but they are inconsistent with \nproducing accurate intelligence.\n  The second major result from mistaken administration policies has \nbeen our fall from the world's leader in the realm of ideals, not just \nin power.\n  The detentions at Guantanamo have been decried, from moral leaders \nsuch as Archbishop Desmond Tutu to political leaders like Tony Blair.\n\n[[Page S5308]]\n\n  Archbishop Tutu said, ``I never imagined I would live to see the day \nwhen the United States and its satellites would use precisely the same \narguments that the apartheid government used for detention without \ntrial. It is disgraceful.''\n  Prime Minister Blair commented that Guantanamo Bay is an ``anomaly \nthat at some point has to be brought to an end.''\n  While world leaders and various offices of the United Nations have \ncriticized Guantanamo, terrorists around the world have used it to \nrally new recruits. Just like the horrible scenes from Abu Ghraib, we \nhave found evidence that the disrespect for Islam and the Koran at \nGuantanamo has helped breed a new generation of terrorists.\n  The legislation that I introduce today would close the Guantanamo \ndetention facilities within a year of enactment.\n  Everyone being held at that time would have to be transitioned to an \nalternative legal status. There are five major options. Detainees could \nbe transferred to a civilian or military facility in the United States \nand charged with a violation of U.S. or international law for \nprosecution in a civilian or military proceeding; transferred to a \nfacility in the United States for continued detention, for individuals \njudged to be enemy combatants; transferred to any international legal \ntribunal that may be authorized for this purpose; transferred to their \nhome nation or a third-party government for further processing. This \nwould require that the Government obtain the required assurances that \nthe detainee will not be tortured or otherwise handled in a matter \nagainst international law; or for detainees judged to pose no \ncontinuing security threat to the United States or our allies, \nreleased.\n\n  What would this accomplish?\n  First, and most importantly, it would end the stain on America's \nreputation and reiterate that we are a nation of laws and justice.\n  Second, moving trials to the United States, whether under the \nmilitary commission process or otherwise, would enhance the credibility \nof those proceedings. As Secretary Gates testified, ``no matter how \ntransparent, no matter how open the trials, if they took place at \nGuantanamo in the international community, they would lack \ncredibility.''\n  Finally, moving detainees to the mainland would ease the logistics of \ntrials and oversight. It would obviate the need for the government to \nrun its own airline business shuttling Members of Congress, lawyers, \nreporters, and military police to Guantanamo.\n  Some will argue that closing Guantanamo will damage our security. Let \nme make clear: I am not for releasing any terrorist, any Taliban \nfighter, or anyone that we will have to face again on the battlefield.\n  We have high-security prisons and military brigs around the nation \nand know how to keep prisoners from harming the local population. In \nfact, the Justice Department has successfully convicted Sheikh Omar \nAbdel-Rahman and Ramzi Yousef for their roles in the first World Trade \nCenter bombing. Jose Padilla was held in a naval brig, and is currently \nawaiting a trial in the United States. Our military and criminal \njustice systems are up to this task.\n  Nor is it the case that moving detainees from Guantanamo will hinder \nour ability to gain intelligence from them. In fact, the majority of \ndetainees are not being interrogated at Guantanamo, and almost none of \nthem have any actionable intelligence left after imprisonment for \nyears.\n  Finally, I am aware that legislation has been introduced to amend the \nMilitary Commissions Act, especially with regard to its habeas corpus \nprovisions. I support these efforts. But legal experts have testified \nthat moving detainees to the United States would have little impact on \nthe Government's ability to prosecute them. The procedures of the \nMilitary Commissions Act, or any other court martial or criminal \nproceeding, do not depend on the location of the trial. Indeed, the \nSupreme Court has already held that legal process at Guantanamo is \nsubject to U.S. law.\n  As I said at the beginning of my remarks, it is our responsibility to \nensure that the war on terror is being fought in a way that maximizes \nour ability to prevail. The situation at Guantanamo has impeded our \nsuccess. It has strained our relations with key allies. It has provided \nfodder to our detractors.

A bill to direct the United States Trade Representative to \nconduct an investigation of the personal exemption allowance that \nCanada provides for merchandise purchased abroad by Canadian residents, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to address the urgent need to \nend Canada's trade-distorting personal customs duty exemption scheme, \nwhich severely disadvantages border-area businesses in Maine and across \nthe country.\n  The U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement of 1989 and the subsequent North \nAmerican Free Trade Agreement, NAFTA, of 1994 were intended to create a \nlevel playing field for companies in both countries in terms of cross-\nborder commerce. However, the spirit--if not the letter of these \nagreements--have been abrogated by Canada's schedule of personal \nexemptions from customs duties and taxes for returning Canadian \nresidents.\n  Under this scheme, Canada allows its residents no personal exemption \nfrom customs duties on goods purchased during trips abroad lasting less \nthan 24 hours. For trips between 24 and 48 hours, Canadians are exempt \nfrom their government's duties and taxes on only the first C$50 of \npurchases. In contrast, the United States allows its residents to bring \n$200 of merchandise into the country duty free upon returning from a \ntrip abroad lasting less than 48 hours.\n  As the U.S. Trade Representative said in its 2007 National Trade \nEstimate Report on Foreign Trade Barriers, this disparity between the \nCanadian and U.S. personal duty exemption schedules discourages \nshopping visits to the United States by Canadian border residents. \nUnderstandably, it is therefore a major concern for Maine and other \nU.S. border-area businesses, which rely on such cross-border commerce \nfor their very livelihoods.\n  Canada's personal duty exemption scheme has thus produced an \nunwelcome area of friction in a largely vibrant and friendly cross-\nborder relationship. Moreover, it is inconsistent with Canada's \ninternational trade obligations to the United States under Chapter \nTwelve of the North American Free Trade Agreement. Under that \nagreement, Canada is obligated to accord to United States service \nproviders,\n\n[[Page S5309]]\n\nincluding retail and distribution service providers, treatment no less \nfavorable than that it accords to its own service providers and the \nservice providers of any other country.\n  When one considers, as Canada's government no doubt has, that foreign \ntravel by Canadian residents lasting less than 48 hours is almost \nexclusively to the United States, Canada's personal customs duty \nexemption scheme appears to be a deliberate attempt to favor its own \nretail establishments at the expense of U.S. merchants just across the \nborder. This scheme thus defeats the very purpose of NAFTA--to foster \ncross-border commerce unrestrained by protectionist policies.\n  Despite this inconsistency with NAFTA and frequent requests by U.S. \nlawmakers and trade officials, Canada has for years refused to change \nits personal duty exemption scheme. That is why Senator Cantwell and I \ntoday introduce a bill that would direct the U.S. Trade Representative \nto initiate an investigation of Canada's personal duty exemption scheme \nunder the section 301 process of the Trade Act of 1974--the statue \nsetting forth the procedures for identifying and taking action against \nforeign trade practices which are unjustifiable or burden and restrict \nU.S. commerce.\n  The section 301 process exists--like NAFTA itself--to ensure that \nmutually respectful trade relationships can efficiently handle and \namicably survive substantive disagreements over trade rules. We \ntherefore introduce this bill not to embarrass or chastise Canada but \nto formally initiate the process of bringing this particular \ndisagreement to a principled resolution. I urge our colleagues from \nborder and nonborder States alike to join us seeking that fair outcome.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCONNELL (for himself, Mrs. Lincoln, and Mr. Bunning):\n  S. 1251. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nfor the tax treatment of horses, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Equine \nEquity Act of 2007 with my colleague from Arkansas, Mrs. Lincoln, and \nmy colleague from Kentucky, Mr. Bunning.\n  On this upcoming Saturday, the sporting world turns its attention to \nmy hometown of Louisville for the annual running of the Kentucky Derby. \nIt has been appropriately called ``the most exciting 2 minutes in \nsports,'' and has given us such great champions as Secretariat, Seattle \nSlew, and the courageous Barbaro.\n  The activities surrounding the derby also allow Kentucky to show off \none of its signature industries, the horse industry. Long after the \npageantry and festivities of derby day, the horse industry remains a \nvital part of Kentucky's economy and cultural heritage. Horses are \nKentucky's largest agricultural product. The horse industry contributes \n$3.5 billion to Kentucky's economy, and directly employs more than \n50,000 Kentuckians.\n  While many Americans appropriately identify the horse industry as one \nof Kentucky's signature industries, the industry's economic impact \nextends well beyond the borders of the Commonwealth. A recent economic \nimpact study by the firm of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu found that the \nhorse industry contributes approximately $39 billion in direct economic \nimpacts to the U.S. economy each year. The industry sustains 1.4 \nmillion full-time equivalent jobs each year, with over 460,000 of those \njobs created from direct spending within the industry.\n  Nearly 2 million Americans own horses, either for racing, showing or \nrecreational purposes. While the popular image of horse owners might \nfocus on Millionaire's Row at Churchill Downs on derby day, the facts \ntell a different story. Only about one-quarter, 28 percent, of U.S. \nhorse owners have incomes greater than $100,000. More than one in every \nthree, 34 percent, horse owners has an income of less than $50,000.\n  Like many businesses, outside investments are essential to the \noperation and growth of the horse industry. Without investors willing \nto buy and breed horses, it is impossible for the industry to thrive. \nUnfortunately, there are several unfair, unwise provisions in the tax \ncode that discourage investment in the horse industry.\n  In an effort to address these concerns, today I introduce the Equine \nEquity Act with my colleague from Arkansas, Mrs. Lincoln, and my good \nfriend from Kentucky Mr. Bunning. The Equine Equity Act includes two \nkey provisions.\n  First, it will provide capital gains treatment for horses that is \nequal to other investments. Nearly all capital assets are eligible to \nreceive more favorable capital gains tax treatment once they are held \nfor 12 months. However, horses and cattle must be held for two years to \nreceive capital gains treatment. This legislation would reduce the \ncapital gains holding period for horses from 24 months to 12 months.\n  Second, it will apply equal depreciation standards for all \nracehorses. Current law states that racehorses that begin training when \nolder than 24 months of age are depreciated over 3 years, while those \nhorses that begin training before reaching 24 months of age are \ndepreciated over 7 years.\n  Most horses begin training before they reach 24 months, but their \nracing careers do not last 7 years. This legislation would reduce the \ndepreciation period for racehorses to 3 years more accurately reflect \nthe racing life of horses.\n  I appreciate the willingness of my colleagues from Arkansas and \nKentucky to join me in introducing this legislation of tremendous \nimportance to our states. I look forward to working with them and our \ncolleagues in the Senate to enact this bipartisan bill into law.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1251\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to provide for \nuniformity in the awarding of disability ratings for wounds or injuries \nincurred by members of the Armed Forces, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation that would \nreform the Department of Defense Disability Evaluation System. This \nlegislation offers common sense solutions to problems within the \nDisability Evaluation System that first gained public attention in \nconnection with the stories about the conditions at Walter Reed Army \nMedical Center. Unfortunately, the problems with the Disability \nEvaluation System are not limited to the Army but exist throughout the \nmilitary services.\n  At an April 12, 2007, Joint Senate Armed Services and Veterans' \nAffairs Committee Hearing, we received testimony that identified \nproblems with the current system. Examples of the issues identified \nwere the failure to use the VA disability rating schedule in a \nconsistent manner across the military services; the failure to include \nall, not just the most severe medical conditions that would render a \nservicemember unfit when making a disability decision; the lack of \nuniform training for Disability Evaluation System personnel; and the \nlack of accountability and supervision by DoD over the disability \nprocess.\n  Some have suggested that the solution to the problems within the \nDisability Evaluation System is to radically change it. Under current \nDoD\n\n[[Page S5310]]\n\npractice, a service-specific Physical Evaluation Board, PEB, makes a \n``fitness'' for duty determination. If a servicemember is found to be \nunfit for continued service, the PEB then makes a disability decision. \nInstead of seeking ways to ensure that the system functions as \nintended, some have suggested that the military continue to make \n``fitness'' determinations, but that the Department of Veterans Affairs \nwould be responsible for making disability decisions for servicemembers \nfound to be unfit.\n  While this may appear to be a reasonable recommendation, I am \nconcerned that if this recommendation is implemented without careful \nconsideration, we might be creating more problems than we can solve.\n  The VA disability rating system is already stressed with its existing \ncaseload. In this time of armed conflict when there are more injured \nservicemembers each day, it makes no sense to add more pressure to an \nalready overburdened VA system, especially when there is no indication \nthat VA would do a better job than DoD in making disability ratings. As \nlong as there is consistency in how we determine what percentage of \ndisability a servicemembers receives, it should not matter who makes \nthe rating.\n  Rather than shifting the focus to VA, I believe our focus should be \non solving the problems of fairness and consistency for assigning \ndisability ratings within and across the Services. To that end, the \nbill I am introducing addresses consistency of disability ratings \nwithin DoD, uniform use of the Veterans Affairs rating schedule across \nthe military services, uniform training of Medical Evaluation Board/\nPhysical Evaluation Board personnel, and accountability by DoD to \nensure compliance with disability rating regulations and policies.\n  This legislation is a good first step towards changing the DoD \nDisability Evaluation System that needs to be reformed for the benefit \nof our wounded and seriously injured servicemembers. It will improve \nDoD-wide disability rating regulations and policies, and ensure \nconsistency as these regulations and policies are applied across the \nServices.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join me in making these \npositive changes to the DoD Disability Evaluation System. We owe our \ninjured and disabled servicemembers no less.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1252\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to establish a fund for the National Park Centennial \nChallenge, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, on March 9, 2007, the Administration \ntransmitted draft legislation entitled the National Park Centennial \nChallenge Fund Act,'' which was referred to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources. On behalf of Senator Akaka, the Chairman of the \nSubcommittee on National Parks, and myself, I am pleased today to \nintroduce the National Park Centennial Challenge Fund Act, by request, \nas a courtesy to the Administration.\n  Both Secretary of the Interior Dirk Kempthorne and National Park \nService Director Mary Bomar have made clear that the National Park \nCentennial Initiative is one of the highest priorities of the \nDepartment of the Interior. The initiative proposes up to $3 billion in \nnew funds over the next decade, with three components.\n  The first component of the initiative is the ``President's Centennial \nCommitment,'' under which the Administration is proposing an additional \n$100 million per year in new discretionary funds for the National Park \nService. The second and third components, which the Administration \ncollectively describes as the ``President's Centennial Challenge,'' \nwould seek to raise up to $100 million each year over a ten-year period \nfrom private donations. All donations would be matched with new Federal \nfunding, up to $100 million annually.\n  The new funding would be used for ``signature projects and \nprograms,'' which the draft legislation defines as ``a project or \nprogram identified by the Director of the National Park Service as one \nthat will help prepare the national parks for another century of \nconservation, preservation, and enjoyment.''\n  Mr. President, while I commend the Administration for this effort to \nsecure increased funding for our national parks, I still need to better \nunderstand many of the specifics of the proposal, and until then, am \nreserving judgment on it.\n  For example, we need to understand whether the initiative will result \nin significant new funding for our national parks, or whether increases \nin funding from the initiative will simply be offset by funding \nreductions in other important areas. I also have questions\n\n[[Page S5311]]\n\nabout whether the philanthropic goals proposed by this legislation are \nrealistic, given the historic levels of private contributions for \nnational parks. In addition, we need to learn more about the type of \nprojects and programs that would be funded under the initiative, and \nwhat role Congress should have in establishing funding priorities. \nFinally, any legislative initiative that proposes $1 billion in new \ndirect spending without an offset will certainly be carefully reviewed.\n  Secretary Kempthorne and Director Bomar have indicated that they \nintend to make recommendations to the President later this month on \nappropriate signature projects and programs as well as goals for the \ninitiative. I look forward to working with both Secretary Kempthorne \nand Director Bomar on this proposal once those recommendations are \ncomplete.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord, along with the transmittal letter from Director Bomar and a \nsection-by-section analysis of the bill prepared by the Department of \nthe Interior.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1253\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Dick Cheney,\n     President of the Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: There is enclosed a draft bill, the \n     proposed ``National Park Centennial Challenge Fund Act.'' We \n     recommend that the draft bill be introduced, referred to the \n     appropriate Committee for consideration, and enacted.\n       August 25, 2016, will be the one hundredth birthday of the \n     National Park Service (NPS). In 1872, President Grant signed \n     a law to protect Yellowstone, making it America's first \n     national park. By 1916, 40 national parks and monuments \n     existed, but they had no clear or consistent management. On \n     August 25, 1916, President Woodrow Wilson established the NPS \n     to protect and manage these magnificent parks. The challenge \n     facing the NPS as it readies itself for its centennial \n     celebration is to conserve what is timeless while keeping \n     pace with the modern needs and expectations of the American \n     people. During the last five years, the NPS has built a \n     strong foundation of improving parks, with 6,600 park \n     improvements completed or underway. This past August, on the \n     90th birthday of the NPS, President Bush issued a challenge \n     to prepare national parks for another century of \n     conservation, preservation, and enjoyment.\n       President Bush stated: ``I call on all Americans to help in \n     these efforts and to enhance our parks as we get ready for \n     the National Park Service's centennial celebration. Through \n     continuing cooperation and partnership, our national parks \n     can endure for the next 100 years and beyond.''\n       The President also directed the Secretary of the Interior \n     to develop a formal written directive about the future of \n     national parks. He directed us to establish specific \n     performance goals that, when achieved, will make sure our \n     parks continue to be places where children and families can \n     learn about our nation's great history, enjoy quality time \n     together and have fun outdoors. He asked that we identify \n     signature projects and programs that reflect and highlight \n     these goals that would be undertaken by leveraging \n     philanthropic, partnership, and government investments for \n     the benefit of national parks and their visitors.\n       The President's FY 2008 budget includes the National Park \n     Centennial Initiative, one of the highest priorities of the \n     Deprtment of the Interior. This Initiative proposes up to $3 \n     billion in new funds for the National Park System over the \n     next ten years. The President's FY 2008 parks budget totals \n     nearly $2.4 billion, the largest budget ever for programs \n     that support parks. It includes the highest increase in parks \n     operation funding ever proposed. It provides for further \n     improvement of our national parks during the next decade \n     leading up to the 2016 centennial celebration. It funds:\n\n[[Page S5312]]\n\n       The President's Centennial Commitment: This is $100 million \n     a year--one billion dollars over 10 years--for activities to \n     achieve new levels of excellence in our parks. These \n     discretionary funds will be used to hire more seasonal \n     rangers, interpreters, and maintenance workers, repair \n     buildings, improve natural landscapes, and enhance the Junior \n     Ranger Program.\n       The President's Centennial Challenge: We are challenging \n     individuals, foundations, businesses, and the private sector \n     to contribute at least $100 million annually to support \n     signature programs and projects in our national parks. The \n     enclosed draft bill would allow us to match those \n     contributions with up to $100 million of mandatory funding \n     annually for the next ten years.\n       The proposed National Park Service Centennial Challenge \n     Fund Act would establish the National Park Service Centennial \n     Challenge Fund (Challenge Fund), which would encourage \n     private donations for signature projects and programs in \n     national parks by matching those donations with Federal funds \n     of up to $100 million a year for a ten year period ending on \n     September 30, 2017. The Fund would be available to the \n     Secretary without further appropriation and with no fiscal \n     year limitations.\n       A list of signature projects and programs eligible for \n     funding under the Challenge will be included in the \n     Centennial report that the Secretary plans to send to the \n     President in late May 2007. The list will be prepared by the \n     Director of the National Park Service, drawing on ideas \n     generated through listening sessions, public engagement, and \n     the input of Park Service professionals. Additional projects \n     may be added to the list from time to time, as necessary.\n       The President's Centennial Challenge Fund will not be used \n     to hire NPS permanent staff or for projects outside of park \n     boundaries. Its focus will be on those signature projects an \n     programs that will help prepare the National Park System for \n     another century of conservation, preservation, and enjoyment.\n       Soliciting for Centennial Challenge donations will be done \n     primarily through the National Park Foundation and local \n     friends' groups. National Park Service employees will be \n     subject to the current fundraising guidelines. The draft bill \n     clearly states its intent is not to expand existing authority \n     in this area. For large donations, the National Park Service \n     will enter into a written agreement with a donor that lays \n     out the terms and conditions for how the funds will be used.\n       The President has called on all Americans to help in \n     conserving natural resources and improving the condition of \n     our park facilities. It is his hope and the hope of the \n     Department of the Interior that through leveraging \n     philanthropic, partnership, and government investments for \n     the benefit of national parks and their visitors the national \n     parks can endure for the next 100 years and beyond.\n       The President's budget includes appropriate proposed \n     offsets within the budget of the Department of the Interior \n     that, if enacted, are sufficient to ensure that this proposal \n     complies with Rule XXI, new clause 10, of the House of \n     Representatives.\n       The Office of Management and Budget has advised that \n     presentation of this proposal to the Congress is in accord \n     with the President's program.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Mary A. Bomar,\n     Director, National Park Service.\n                                  ____\n\n\n  The Proposed National Park Centennial Challenge Fund Act Section-by-\n                            Section Analysis\n\n       Section 1. Short Title. The first section provides for the \n     title of the Act, the National Park Centennial Fund Act.\n       Section 2. Findings and Purpose. The second section \n     includes findings explaining the need for the National Park \n     Centennial Challenge and the Challenge Fund established under \n     this Act. Subsection (b) sets forth the purpose of the Act, \n     which is to establish a fun in the Treasury that will include \n     private donations, and provide Federal funds to match those \n     donations, for signature projects and programs to enhance the \n     National Park System as it approaches its Centennial \n     celebration in 2016.\n       Section 3. Definitions. Section 3 defines the terms used in \n     the Act.\n       Secton 4. National Park Centennial Challenge Fund. This \n     section establishes the National Park Centennial Challenge \n     Fund, the Challenge Fund for short. The Challenge Fund shall \n     consist of amounts for signature projects and programs \n     transferred from the Donations to the National Park Service \n     account and amounts appropriated from the general fund of the \n     Treasury as matching funds.\n       Subsection (b) provides that all amounts in the Fund are to \n     be available to the Secretary of the Interior without further \n     appropriation and without any fiscal year limitation. This \n     allows the National Park Service (NPS) to receive and match \n     donations for signature projects and programs that may take \n     more than one fiscal year to complete or that may need a \n     certain level of funding before they commence. No funds from \n     this account are to be used for indirect administrative \n     costs. The expenditure of amounts in the Challenge Fund shall \n     follow Federal procurement and financial laws and standards.\n       Section 5. Signature Projects and Programs. Subsection (a) \n     requires the Secretary, acting through the Director of the \n     NPS, to develop a list of signature projects and programs \n     eligible for funding from the Challenge Fund. That list is to \n     be submitted to the President and to the Senate Committees on \n     Appropriations and Energy and Natural Resources, and the \n     House Committees on Appropriations and Natural Resources. \n     Subsection (b) provides that a signature project or program \n     is a project or program identified by the Director of the NPS \n     as one that will help prepare the NPS for another century of \n     conservation, preservation, and enjoyment. Signature projects \n     and programs will be chosen after listening sessions, public \n     engagement, and the input of NPS employees.\n       Subsection (c) authorizes the Secretary, acting through the \n     Director, to add projects to the list from time-to-time as \n     they find necessary. It requires notification like that \n     required in subsection (a) for the original list of signature \n     projects and programs.\n       Section 6. Donations and Matching Funds. Subsection (a) \n     authorizes the Secretary to transfer, to the Challenge Fund \n     qualified donations of cash received by the National \n     Park Service. This includes cash payments to liquidate \n     commitments made under a valid letter of credit.\n       Subsection (b) appropriates up to $100 million a year in \n     matching funds. The amount of matching funds made available \n     each year would equal the qualified cash donations received \n     in that year, plus the amount of donations pledged in that \n     year under a valid irrevocable letter of credit. For \n     donations pledged under a letter of credit, a match would be \n     provided when the commitment is made and not a second time \n     when the donation is paid. If a letter of credit is \n     withdrawn, then the associated matching funds would be \n     returned to the Treasury. Up to $100 million in matching \n     funds would be available in each year beginning in fiscal \n     year 2008 and going through fiscal year 2017. If all of the \n     $100 million in matching funds is not used in a given year, \n     the remaining balance cannot be used to increase the amount \n     of matching funds in subsequent years. For example, if only \n     $60 million in donations or commitments under a letter of \n     credit are received and are thus eligible for the same amount \n     of matching funds in a fiscal year, that does not mean that \n     matching funds available for the next fiscal year would \n     increase to $140 million.\n       Subsection (c) specifies that the Secretary may not \n     obligate any amounts based on a letter of credit, or amounts \n     to match a letter of credit pursuant to subsection (b), until \n     the donation promised under a letter of credit is deposited \n     in the Challenge Fund.\n       Subsection (d) makes it clear that nothing in this Act \n     expands the existing authority of the NPS and its employees \n     with regard to fundraising. NPS employees will still be \n     subject to Director's Order 21, which specifically sets out \n     the guidelines with regard to this matter.\n       Section 7. Report to Congress. This section requires the \n     Secretary to submit an annual report with the President's \n     budget on the administration of the Centennial Challenge. The \n     report is to include the current list of signature projects \n     and programs and a description of any funding they have \n     received from the Challenge Fund.\n       Section 8. Regulations. This section authorizes the \n     Secretary to promulgate such regulations as may be necessary \n     to carry out this Act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/30/senate-section/article/S5312-1", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5312-S5313]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 176--RECOGNIZING APRIL 30, 2007, AS ``NATIONAL \n                         HEALTHY SCHOOLS DAY''\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON (for herself, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Sanders, Mr. \nCasey, and Mr. Bayh) submitted the following resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S. Res. 176\n\n       Whereas over half of schools have problems linked to indoor \n     air quality;\n       Whereas children are more vulnerable to environmental \n     hazards as they breathe in more air per pound of body weight \n     due to their developing systems;\n       Whereas children spend an average of 30 to 50 hours per \n     week in school;\n       Whereas poor indoor environmental quality is associated \n     with a wide rage of problems that include poor concentration, \n     respiratory illnesses, learning difficulties, and cancer;\n       Whereas research suggests that children attending schools \n     in poor condition score 11 percent lower on standardized \n     tests than students who attend schools in good condition;\n       Whereas an average of 1 out of every 13 school-age children \n     has asthma, the leading cause of school absenteeism, \n     accounting for approximately 14,700,000 missed school days \n     each year;\n       Whereas 17 separate studies all found positive health \n     impacts from improved indoor air-quality, ranging from 13.5 \n     percent up to 87 percent improvement;\n       Whereas our Nation's schools spent approximately \n     $8,000,000,000 on energy costs in the last school year, \n     causing officials to\n\n[[Page S5313]]\n\n     make very difficult decisions on cutting back much needed \n     academic programs in efforts to keep the heat and lights on;\n       Whereas healthy and high performance schools designed to \n     reduce energy and maintenance costs, provide cleaner air, \n     improve lighting, and reduce exposures to toxic substances \n     provide a healthier and safer learning environment for \n     children and improved academic achievement and well-being;\n       Whereas Congress has demonstrated its interest in this \n     compelling issue by including the Healthy High-Performance \n     Schools Program in the No Child Left Behind Act; and\n       Whereas our schools have the great responsibility of \n     guiding the future of our children and Nation: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate recognizes April 30, 2007, as \n     ``National Healthy Schools Day''.\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, today is National Healthy Schools Day. \nThis day was established to build awareness and promote healthy school \nenvironments for our children and school personnel.\n  National Healthy Schools Day has been recognized for the past 5 years \nthanks to the work of the Healthy Schools Network in New York. Many \norganizations have worked together over the years to raise awareness to \nthe conditions that many of our children and teachers are subjected to \non a daily basis. The ongoing work of these organizations is crucial in \nfostering the development and wellbeing of our Nation's children.\n  Each day, parents send their children to school with the assumption \nthat their children will spend the day in a safe environment. Many \nparents do not realize that their children's classrooms could be the \nvery thing that harms them. Alarmingly, over half of our Nation's \nschools reported that they had at least one environmental hazard. These \npollutants can have serious effects on health, such as respiratory \nproblems, and can even interfere with cognitive functioning. \nFurthermore, children are more vulnerable to environmental hazards as \nthey proportionally breathe in more air than adults.\n  It is not surprising then that approximately 1 out of 13 school-age \nchildren has asthma, which is responsible for more than 14 million \nmissed school days each year as the poor indoor air quality in these \nschools exacerbates the effects of asthma. However, a recent study \nsponsored by the American Lung Association and the American Federation \nof Teachers estimates that a shift from an unhealthy to a healthy \nschool would result in a 25 percent reduction in cases of asthma among \nstudents.\n  It is imperative that we address these problems. That is why I was \nthe proud sponsor of the Healthy, High-Performance Schools Program in \nthe No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB). By incorporating this legislation \ninto NCLB, Congress acknowledged that environmental factors can be a \nbarrier to academic success.\n  We must spread awareness of the health and learning effects that \nresult from unhealthy schools and continue to fight on our children's \nbehalf. I commend those across the nation who are using National \nHealthy Schools Day to do just that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/30/senate-section/article/S5313-1", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5313]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 177--DESIGNATING APRIL 30, 2007, AS ``DIA DE LOS \n      NINOS: CELEBRATING YOUNG AMERICANS'', AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES\n\n  Mr. HATCH (for himself, Mr. Martinez, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Salazar, Mr. \nMenendez, and Mrs. Boxer) submitted the following resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n                              S. Res. 177\n\n       Whereas many nations throughout the world, and especially \n     within the Western hemisphere, celebrate ``Dia de los \n     Ninos'', or ``Day of the Children'' on the 30th of April, in \n     recognition and celebration of their country's future--their \n     children;\n       Whereas children represent the hopes and dreams of the \n     people of the United States;\n       Whereas children are the center of American families;\n       Whereas children should be nurtured and invested in to \n     preserve and enhance economic prosperity, democracy, and the \n     American spirit;\n       Whereas Hispanics in the United States, the youngest and \n     fastest growing ethnic community in the Nation, continue the \n     tradition of honoring their children on this day, and wish to \n     share this custom with the rest of the Nation;\n       Whereas it is projected that by the year 2050, 1 in 4 \n     Americans will be of Hispanic descent, and currently \n     approximately 12,300,000 Hispanic children live in the United \n     States;\n       Whereas traditional Hispanic family life centers largely on \n     children;\n       Whereas the primary teachers of family values, morality, \n     and culture are parents and family members, and we rely on \n     children to pass on these family values, morals, and culture \n     to future generations;\n       Whereas more than 500,000 children drop out of school each \n     year, 138,000 of whom are Hispanic, and these dropout rates \n     are unacceptably high;\n       Whereas the importance of literacy and education are most \n     often communicated to children through family members;\n       Whereas families should be encouraged to engage in family \n     and community activities that include extended and elderly \n     family members and encourage children to explore, develop \n     confidence, and pursue their dreams;\n       Whereas the designation of a day to honor the children of \n     the United States will help affirm for the people of the \n     United States the significance of family, education, and \n     community;\n       Whereas the designation of a day of special recognition for \n     the children of the United States will provide an opportunity \n     for children to reflect on their future, to articulate their \n     dreams and aspirations, and to find comfort and security in \n     the support of their family members and communities;\n       Whereas the National Latino Children's Institute, serving \n     as a voice for children, has worked with cities throughout \n     the country to declare April 30 as ``Dia de los Ninos: \n     Celebrating Young Americans''--a day to bring together \n     Hispanics and other communities nationwide to celebrate and \n     uplift children; and\n       Whereas the children of a nation are the responsibility of \n     all its people, and people should be encouraged to celebrate \n     the gifts of children to society--their curiosity, laughter, \n     faith, energy, spirit, hopes, and dreams: Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates April 30, 2007, as ``Dia de los Ninos: \n     Celebrating Young Americans''; and\n       (2) calls on the people of the United States to join with \n     all children, families, organizations, communities, churches, \n     cities, and States across the United States to observe the \n     day with appropriate ceremonies, including activities that--\n       (A) center around children, and are free or minimal in cost \n     so as to encourage and facilitate the participation of all \n     our people;\n       (B) are positive and uplifting and that help children \n     express their hopes and dreams;\n       (C) provide opportunities for children of all backgrounds \n     to learn about one another's cultures and to share ideas;\n       (D) include all members of the family, especially extended \n     and elderly family members, so as to promote greater \n     communication among the generations within a family, enabling \n     children to appreciate and benefit from the experiences and \n     wisdom of their elderly family members;\n       (E) provide opportunities for families within a community \n     to get acquainted; and\n       (F) provide children with the support they need to develop \n     skills and confidence, and to find the inner strength--the \n     will and fire of the human spirit--to make their dreams come \n     true.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce an important \nresolution designating the 30th day of April 2007 as ``Dia de los \nNinos: Celebrating Young Americans.''\n  Nations throughout the world, and especially within Latin America, \ncelebrate Dia de los Ninos on the 30th of April, in recognition and \ncelebration of their countries' future--their children. Many American \nHispanic families continue the tradition of honoring their children on \nthis day by celebrating Dia de los Ninos in their homes.\n  The designation of a day to honor the children of the Nation will \nhelp us affirm the significance of family, education, and community. \nThis special recognition of children will provide us with an \nopportunity to reflect on their futures, articulate their dreams and \naspirations, and find comfort and security in the support of their \nfamily members and communities.
