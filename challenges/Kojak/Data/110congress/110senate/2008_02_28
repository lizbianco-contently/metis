We did that. Cloture \nhas been invoked. But now we are leading up to 30 hours.

Mr. President, it is another day in Iraq and another $400 \nmillion. One only need look at the Washington Post, as I did yesterday, \nto see what is happening in Iraq. Front page: ``Sunni Forces Losing \nPatience With U.S.'' And it goes on to say how hundreds and hundreds of \nthese Sunnis, who were helping us, have gone home.\n  Now, Mr. President, the Sunnis, even before Saddam Hussein, \ncontrolled Iraq. They are a minority, but they have controlled Iraq for \ngenerations. Now the Shias control Iraq, and the Sunnis, as we all \nknow, are trying to make a comeback. This should cause everyone some \nconcern.\n  Also, if you look a little bit further in the newspaper, go over to \npage 12, you will see another story dealing with Iraq. ``Iraq Leaders \nVeto Law on Elections.'' We have been trying, and in fact it was the \npurpose of the surge, to bring about some ability in the Iraqis to take \nover the Government themselves, and they passed 4 pieces of legislation \nof the 18 that they were supposed to pass. Everyone said at the\n\n[[Page S1324]]\n\ntime they passed they thought basically they were for show. And, \nobviously, the one calling for elections, which was one of the four, in \nfact, that has taken place; the Iraqi leaders vetoed the bill on \nelections. There still could be elections in the fall, but right now \nthey are going to have to do new legislation. So now we are down to 3 \nout of the 18.\n  During the month of July, more than one American was being killed per \nday. We are now at 30 on the 28th day of February. Yesterday, one of my \nRepublican friends, one of the leaders, said the Democrats are in \ndenial. ``It's almost as if they are sorry things have gotten better.''\n  Mr. President, all Americans are glad for any American or Iraqi life \nsaved. But unlike the minority, which spent 6 years ignoring the \nwarning signs and following the President's policies in lockstep, \nDemocrats are clear-headed about where this war has been, where it \nstands today, and what we must do to change course and make our country \nsafer.\n\n  Mr. President, last night, I think it was about 7:30 or 8 o'clock, I \nwent back to my office, and there was a man waiting there, one of the \nCapitol guides. As disabled and wounded Iraqi veterans come through, he \nbrings them by, and if I am in my office, I am always happy to say \nhello to these wounded veterans. Burt is the tour guide, and my office \nis just off the Senate floor, so it is fairly easy for them to bring \nthem by.\n  Last night was a remarkable night. I have met probably 50 of these \nveterans whom Burt brings around. Last night, a 22-year-old man from \nMissouri by the name of Matthew McGuire came by. He was there with his \ngirlfriend, his wife to be.\n  I said: How are you doing?\n  He said: I'm OK.\n  He was standing. He was unstable. He had a cane that held him up.\n  I said: Why don't you sit down, and we will talk a bit.\n  I said: How long were you in Iraq before you got hurt?\n  He said: Well, I was there for 6 months.\n  Five times in that 6-month period, Mr. President, he suffered \nattacks. Once he was on foot patrol, and he was knocked down by a bomb. \nOne time he was a gunner on a vehicle and was knocked off that. He has \nall of his limbs. But last month, in January, in one 24-hour period, he \nhad 37 seizures. And I told him about Senator Johnson and said: I wish \nSenator Johnson were here.\n  I talked about Senator Johnson being in a coma for the period he was \nand how much he had improved and that he can now walk on his own and \nspeak 95 percent of how he was able to. I had a picture taken with him; \nsat and gave them both a hug and kissed her on the cheek. It was really \na dramatic night when this young man was telling me that in one 24-hour \nperiod he had 37 seizures.\n  It is one thing to talk about almost 4,000 Americans being killed and \n30,000 being wounded, and another when you talk to one of these heroic \nyoung men and women. I told him I so appreciated his service to our \ncountry and that we are going to do everything we can to make sure the \nsacrifice he made is not in vain. But these are more than just \nstatistics. These are people. And Matthew McGuire is a person who has \nbeen hurt extremely bad. His life will never be the same.\n  I said: Have you been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder? \nAnd he said, yes. But in addition to that, he has brain damage, as \nindicated by the 37 seizures he had in one 24-hour period. He is only 1 \nof the 30,000 who have been wounded in a war that is stretching our \nmilitary to a breaking point.\n  There is going to be testimony in the Joint Economic Committee today \nby Nobel Prize winning economist Stiglitz. Mr. Stiglitz has written a \nbook that will come out in about 10 days called ``The $3 Trillion \nWar.'' This is a Nobel Prize winning economist who has had access to \nPentagon records, and he has written how this war has cost and will \ncost at least $3 trillion.\n  General Powell said last year that the Army is about broken, and that \nis a quote. The day before yesterday, General Casey, Chief of Staff of \nthe Army, confirmed what Powell said a year ago, when Casey said:\n\n       The demand for our forces exceeds sustainable supply.\n\n  Admiral Fallen and Admiral Mullin agree that concerns about our troop \ncommitment to Iraq may limit our ability to address other global \nchallenges. So we have to take seriously the concerns of General Casey, \nGeneral Powell, Admiral Fallen, Admiral Mullin, and countless other \nmilitary leaders and foreign policy experts.\n  It is time that we understand the sacrifices made by our valiant, \nheroic military have come at a time when they have done what they \nneeded to do, and we have to get them home. Four hundred million \ndollars a day. I repeat what I have said a couple times in the last 2 \ndays, Mr. President. The Iraqis believe they have the most significant \noil reserves in the world. Everybody recognizes they have the second \nlargest oil reserves in the world. They think they have the largest oil \nreserves in the world. It is a wealthy nation, and they should take \ncare of their own.\n  I think what we have talked about is that there should be a force \nleft there of American troops to take care of any counterterrorism \nactivities that need to go forth, and we should have limited training \nof Iraqis. We have trained almost a half million now, 430,000. And, of \ncourse, we have to protect whatever assets we have there. It is a \nsituation that calls for a conclusion.\n  As I said yesterday, when is enough enough? I think this debate has \nbeen good. I think we need to have more in-depth discussions on a \nFederal program that is costing us more than $400 million a day. I \nthink we have spent 2 days on this, and I believe that is not adequate, \nbut we will be back. The President has asked for another, I think, \nabout $120 billion more to the end of this fiscal year for the war in \nIraq, and there will be more discussion at that time. I think we will \nwait until somewhere late in April to take that up. But the time is \ncoming when we will discuss this in more detail.\n  I appreciate the good nature of the debate. We just disagree. The \nRepublicans think everything is fine; we don't.\n  It has been a very positive, in my mind, debate. It has been a \ncivilized debate. I think the American people have been served well by \nthis debate we have had the last couple days.\n  I would say on the schedule, I am working with the Republican leader \nto find out when he feels it would be appropriate to have a vote. We \nare waiting for him. I will visit with him later today.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican whip.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/28/senate-section/article/S1324-1", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1324-S1325]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             IRAQ AND FISA\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, for the benefit of our colleagues, I will \nsummarize where we are this morning as well. The majority leader and \nthe Senator from Wisconsin offered a resolution, a piece of \nlegislation, and sought to proceed to consider it. Republicans agreed \nto that. We voted last night to invoke cloture, which means we agreed \nto proceed to the consideration of that resolution.\n  It has to do with developing a strategy to deal with al-Qaida. It is, \nas the majority leader said, a debate worth having. As a result, \nRepublicans were happy to engage in that debate and we will throughout \nthe day.\n  After the period of morning business, we are back on the resolution. \nI would urge my Republican colleagues to let us know, let the \nleadership staff know, when they wish to be here to speak on the matter \nso the schedules can be coordinated, that everyone can debate the issue \nas they see fit, and that the minority and majority leader a little \nlater in the day can get together and decide when we might be able to \nschedule the next vote based upon everyone's desire to speak. So if our \ncolleagues would let us know when they desire to come and make their \npresentations, that would be very helpful.\n  I would like to correct one thing the majority leader said, in saying \nRepublicans think everything in Iraq is ``just fine.'' I know he did \nnot mean to suggest Republicans believe the situation in Iraq is ``just \nfine.'' Because clearly it is not. If it were, we could bring our \ntroops home today.\n  Unfortunately, it is not ``just fine,'' although it is steadily \nimproving. And when it gets to the point when it is ``just fine,'' we \nwill be able then to bring the remainder of our troops home. The \nprimary difference between\n\n[[Page S1325]]\n\nthe majority and minority is the majority would like to bring the \ntroops home right now. ``Enough is enough,'' says the majority leader.\n  The Republicans, on the other hand, believe we have to finish the \njob. And while great progress has been made as a result of the surge \nimplemented by General Petraeus several months ago, the job is not \nfinished. And until the job is finished, there is a great danger that \nwere we to pull out prematurely, al-Qaida, not totally defeated, would \ninfiltrate right back in, reestablish its presence, begin the terrorism \nwhich has taken us so many months now to repress, and that we would \nhave to then come right back in again, all at a greater cost than if we \nsimply see the job through right now.\n  It is possible every day to have a headline from a newspaper \nrevealing a suicide bomber attack or some other incident similar to \nthat in Iraq. That is the unfortunate reality. Everything is not yet \n``just fine'' in Iraq. But it is also true that because the surge has \nworked to essentially defeat al-Qaida, it has now resorted to the most \nreprehensible tactics of all: using women, children, the disabled as \nsuicide bombers to go into places where those people are not suspects \nand they can blow up innocent people in Iraq.\n  That is the situation we need to help stop, not turn our back and \nwalk away from. It is also true many Iraqis have now been trained by \nour forces. That is the good news that will enable us eventually, \nhopefully sooner rather than later, to withdraw our troops from Iraq. \nWe are withdrawing them now.\n  We will, by June as I recall, be down to a level that is very close \nto the level that existed prior to the surge. We will be able to do \nthat because the surge has worked. What happens after that, we will \nawait a report from General Petraeus when he comes back to the Capitol \nand briefs us on the situation in Iraq.\n  In the meantime, Ambassador Crocker and others have noted significant \nprogress on the political and diplomatic front as well as the economic \nfront in Iraq. The Parliament there is now engaging in vigorous debate, \npassing resolutions. I note that one was vetoed yesterday. It kind of \nreminds me of the process in Washington, where we do not always agree \non everything and we have a robust debate about it.\n  We should not be critical of the Iraqis because they cannot agree \nalways on everything, but we should continue to push them to move \nforward with alacrity, so the things that need to be done politically \nto enable us to eventually remove our troops can be done. I know we \nall, Republicans and Democrats, share that goal.\n  So the bottom line is, we will continue this debate today. I would \nconclude with this point: One of the important reasons for having this \ndebate today about a strategy for dealing with al-Qaida is because \nthere is a difference of opinion between the House of Representatives' \nleadership and the Senate on this issue.\n  The Senate voted with 68 Senators, Democrats and Republicans, to \nreinstitute FISA, the law that enables us to gather intelligence on \nthese terrorists abroad. That law had to be reauthorized because it \nexpired 6 months after we first passed it.\n  So we had to reauthorize it and make one additional change; that is, \nto make sure the telecommunications companies that are cooperating with \nus are protected from lawsuits that have been filed against them simply \nfor their participation with the U.S. Government in collecting this \nforeign intelligence.\n  Without that liability protection, they are not likely to continue to \nhelp us. So we made that change. It was recommended by the Intelligence \nCommittee on a vote of 13 to 2, a very bipartisan recommendation. The \nSenate then passed it with 68 affirmative votes. It went to the House \nof Representatives and there it sits. It sits without a law in force \ntoday that enables us to begin new intelligence surveillance activities \nagainst terrorists abroad.\n  This represents a deficiency in our intelligence gathering at a time \nwhen as both Admiral McConnell, the Director of National Intelligence, \nand Attorney General Mukasey have noted that we are losing intelligence \nevery day that would help us in the war against these terrorists.\n  Every day that goes past that we cannot intercept a communication \nbecause the law has not been reauthorized is a day of lost \nintelligence, intelligence we will never get back. The terrorists are \nnot going to make the phone call a second or third time to accommodate \nus so we can finally collect the intelligence we need, so we can find \nout who he is calling and what they are planning. We cannot do that.\n  So phone calls that occurred yesterday or the day before or the day \nbefore that, they are gone, they are lost forever. It is critical we \nreestablish this capability for collecting foreign intelligence on \nterrorists.\n  The legislation passed by the Senate will do that. The President says \nhe will sign it into law, and it is critical that the House of \nRepresentatives' leadership allow the House of Representatives to vote \non it. If they do, it will pass and it can be sent to the President and \nit will be signed.\n  The reason, I gather, it has not been brought forth is because the \nleadership of the House knows it will pass and, for whatever reason, \nthey do not want this Senate-passed bill to become law.\n  It is critical the Congress fulfill its responsibility to ensure that \nour intelligence-gathering capabilities continue on. I would urge again \nthat the best strategy for dealing with al-Qaida starts with \nauthorizing the kind of intelligence collection that we understand is \ncritical to understanding al-Qaida's intentions and thus being able to \ndefeat them.\n  So in developing a strategy for al-Qaida, No. 1, the House of \nRepresentatives' leadership should bring this legislation up for a \nvote, allow those who support it to send it to the President for his \nsignature, and we can get on with this important collection.\n  I urge my colleagues to come to the floor and let us know when they \nwish to speak so we can organize the debate today with an eye toward \nthe minority and majority leader being able to get together and work \nout a time schedule that would be acceptable to all of us.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/28/senate-section/article/S1325-1", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1325]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, our servicemembers in Iraq are fighting \nunder incredibly stressful conditions each and every day. We are on the \nfloor today talking about an Iraq resolution. We are focused on the war \nor the surge. I wish to talk today about the soldiers themselves who \nare called on. Many of them, as we know, have come home with terrible \ninjuries that need specialized care. Yet there are too many examples \nthat show today the Bush administration was caught unprepared to take \ncare of these men and women when they have come home.\n  So as we continue to talk about Iraq, I think it is important we also \ntalk about the toll that this war is taking on our troops and our \nveterans. I wish to focus today on the need to ensure that our injured \nservicemembers and veterans can get the care they need and deserve by \nreminding all of us what happened in the last year and how much we \nstill have to do.\n  A year ago this month, the Washington Post published a story that \nuncovered the depth of the problems facing our servicemembers who were \nbeing treated at Walter Reed Army Medical Center. The Post reported \nthen that servicemembers were living in rooms with moldy walls and \nbroken ceilings while they waited, waited to get care. The Post found \nthat many of our servicemembers and their families felt trapped at the \ntime in a bureaucratic catch-22 as they fought to get the disability \nbenefits they had earned.\n  The news of the extent of the squalid conditions was a watershed \nmoment in\n\n[[Page S1326]]\n\nthe care of our military men and women. It focused the attention of the \nAmerican people on the needs and treatment of our injured \nservicemembers and veterans. It put a spotlight on the frustrating \nredtape that was facing servicemembers as they transitioned out of the \nmilitary and into the VA.\n\n  I am very proud that Congress, led by the Democratic majority, moved \nquickly to investigate the problems, not just at Walter Reed but \nthroughout the military and VA systems to take that action.\n  Shortly after the Washington Post story ran, the Democratic leaders \nwent to Walter Reed and met with our injured servicemembers. The \nVeterans' Affairs Committee and the Armed Services Committee joined in \na historic partnership to address the problems we saw there and at \nmilitary and VA facilities across the entire country.\n  Many of us have continued to go to Walter Reed and other facilities \non a regular basis, as we had even before those stories ran. In fact, I \nwas up at Walter Reed a short time ago to tour the mental health ward \nand learn about what efforts are being made to decrease the stigma \nattached to mental health care and to help improve care.\n  As a result of the action we took, our country has made a lot of \nchanges in its care for our servicemembers and our veterans. One of the \nmost significant was the Wounded Warriors Act, which was included in \nlast year's Defense authorization bill.\n  With the Wounded Warriors Act, we laid out a clear path, directing \nthe Defense Department and the VA to address the shortfalls in the care \nof our injured servicemembers. So a year after the Walter Reed report, \nwe required the Defense Department and the VA to work together to \ndevelop a comprehensive plan to prevent, treat, and diagnose traumatic \nbrain injury and post-traumatic stress syndrome, and we directed the \nDefense Department to create Centers of Excellence for TBI and PTSD to \nimprove our understanding of these devastating injuries that were \nimpacting our soldiers.\n  We are addressing the frustrating bureaucracy with which our troops \nhave struggled. We have now directed the VA and the Defense Department \nto develop a joint electronic health care record. And we are requiring \nthe military and the VA to work together, finally, on disability \nratings.\n  The Defense Department is investing in new technology, more \nequipment, and state-of-the-art treatment to better care for injured \nsoldiers. Walter Reed and facilities across the entire country are \nmaking similar improvements. In fact, in my home State of Washington, \nFort Lewis has taken great strides in its treatment of wounded \nservicemembers who are recovering there. In one example, leaders there \nare working very hard now to help our servicemembers and, critically, \ntheir families understand the benefits available to them.\n  I am optimistic the action we took is changing the way our military \nand the VA operates. But as I stand on the floor today, I must tell you \nwe have a lot of work left to be done. Yesterday, the GAO reported to \nCongress the Army has significantly improved its support for \nservicemembers at Walter Reed and our military hospitals.\n  According to the Washington Post this morning, there is an article \ntoday: Army officials say they have transformed the way they care for \nsoldiers and their families.\n  But the GAO also said, as has been reported this morning, there are \nstill shortages of staff and other gaps we have to address. In fact, \none-third of warrior transition units are still understaffed. And that, \nto me, raises concerns about the progress of a streamlined disability \nranking system.\n  We still have a long ways to go to provide our servicemembers with \nthe care they deserve. And some of these changes are actually going to \nrequire a cultural transformation within the military. We have to keep \nour eye on the ball.\n\n  I got a personal reminder of this when I reconnected recently with \nArmy retired SPC Rory Dunn. He is an amazing young man who comes from \nmy home State and lives in Renton, WA. Rory was horribly injured when \nhis humvee was hit by a roadside bomb outside Fallujah in 2004. When I \nfirst saw Rory, he was in front of me with his entire skull crushed in, \nhis head crushed from ear to ear. He lost an eye. He lost his sense of \nsmell. He lost much of his hearing. He still today, in fact, has \nshrapnel in his brain. Rory, sitting in front of me, had visibly \nsacrificed for our country, nearly losing his life several times as he \nwas moved from Fallujah to Germany and finally to Walter Reed. When he \ngot to the United States, he was sent to Walter Reed, and there the \nArmy tried to discharge him before he completely had recovered.\n  He and his mother have struggled to help make sure he gets the \nbenefits he needs, not just that, the lack of medical care as he \nprogressed. When I saw Rory at one time he was excited. He was being \nsent to Richmond, VA polytrauma center for treatment. Recently he told \nme about the horrific experience he had there. I hope much has improved \nsince then, but he told me at the time, even though he could not get \nout of bed because of the tremendous extent of his injuries, he would \nwake up in the morning, ring his call bell, which apparently was not \nplugged in, and wait for a nurse to come and help him with basic \nrestroom needs. No one came for hours. Rory was left there. A soldier \nwho fought for his country in the Iraq war, had done everything his \ncountry asked of him, injured horribly, was left to sit in his own \nwaste in a polytrauma center in Virginia.\n  Thankfully we have come a long way from there. Rory should never have \nhad to go through that.\n  He was then sent on to Palo Alto for reconstructive surgery. They did \nan amazing job. In fact, when I first talked to Rory after his \ninjuries, he asked me to pin his Purple Heart on him when he was \nawarded that. But he wanted to wait until he had his face reconstructed \nbecause he wanted the picture to look good. So he had to wait many \nmonths before I finally met him in Seattle and was so proud to pin that \non his chest as his mother sat and watched with tears running down her \nface.\n  That was several years ago. Rory has continued to struggle every \nsingle day, a young man, barely out of his teenage years, injured \ndramatically in the war in Iraq, 4 years later, still struggling to do \neverything he can to be an American. What is Rory doing with his time? \nHe and his mother, who has now spent 4 years helping Rory recover, are \nback at Walter Reed and other VA facilities to make sure no soldier \ngoes through what Rory did, advocating for them, making sure they \nunderstand what they need, making sure they get the help and support \nand, importantly, making sure I continue to understand what is \nhappening in the military in our VA system and making sure that no \nsoldier goes through what he did when he came home. Rory told me a few \nweeks ago: There is much work left to be done. He still talks to \nsoldiers who have been left behind, who are not getting the help they \nneed, who feel like second-class citizens, who feel they are still \nfighting their Government when they come home.\n  For me, Rory is the face of this war. I think we have to ensure that \nthe changes we are making to improve the conditions for all of our \nservicemembers and veterans such as Rory are not a flurry of action \nwhile the cameras are rolling. We have to work to ensure that action \ndoesn't drop off once the media has moved on to the next story. I \nremain firmly convinced that we have to remain vigilant on three \nspecific fronts if we are going to talk about real change for our \ntroops and our veterans. I believe, first, we have to ensure that we \ncut through the bureaucracy between the military and the VA. It is \nsimply unacceptable that after fighting for our country, our \nservicemembers have had to return and fight against the Government for \nthe care they deserve. It isn't only from this war. Go back and talk to \nVietnam-era, Korean-era veterans who have been fighting for years to \nget the disability benefits they deserve.\n  Thanks to the Wounded Warrior Act, we have now started a pilot \nproject to work out ways to make the Defense Department and the VA \ndisability rating systems compatible so our soldiers do not face this, \nbut we do have to remember, this is the first step between bridging the \ngap between the VA and the Defense Department. It is only a pilot. We \nhave a lot more work we need to do to ensure that those agencies don't \ndo a pilot project and put it on\n\n[[Page S1327]]\n\nthe shelf; that they look at how it is working, what is working, what \nis not, what are the challenges in front of us, are we making sure that \nwe stay on them every day. Congress has to keep a close watch to make \nsure this isn't because the cameras were rolling a year ago or today \nbut something that is effective far into the future. We have to work to \nmake sure they meet those goals.\n  Secondly, we have to focus our attention on treating the new injuries \nto our servicemembers who are suffering in Iraq and Afghanistan, \nparticularly traumatic brain injury. TBI is a significant wound of this \nwar, but we have only just begun to understand how we treat it. We have \nto recognize that whenever there is an explosion in Iraq or Afghanistan \nor wherever we have soldiers on the ground, the effects of that, not \njust on the soldiers in the vehicle but even those close by and \nsometimes hundreds of yards away, can have a damaging impact on the \nbrain, called traumatic brain injury. We still don't know all we need \nto about how to treat TBI, and we still have soldiers coming home every \nday, every month who have just been diagnosed with TBI or perhaps not \ndiagnosed, and we need to make sure they get the correct diagnosis and \ntreatment.\n  Congress has authorized millions of new dollars for research, but we \nhave to ensure that we get the results from that research. Then we have \nto make sure we take action based on what we have learned.\n  I am extremely disappointed that the President seems to have lost \nsight of that already. He has proposed to this Congress an 8-percent \ncut for VA medical and prosthetic research in his fiscal year 2009 \nbudget. That is incredibly shortsighted, and he can be sure--and every \nMember of this body can be sure--I am going to fight that every step of \nthe way. We need to find out how to better treat TBI, how to diagnosis \nit, how to deal with PTSD and how to diagnose and treat it effectively. \nThat takes research, and we have to stay on top of it.\n  Finally, and most difficult, we have to change a military culture in \nwhich servicemembers are told that mental illness is an excuse for \ntheir pain and which fails to recognize that psychological wounds can \nbe more serious than some of their physical injuries. Congress again \nhas given the military hundreds of millions of dollars to improve its \nmental health care system. We have pushed through legislation this past \nyear requiring the military and the VA to destigmatize mental health \ntreatment, to increase awareness of the symptoms of post-traumatic \nstress syndrome, and to do further research on traumatic brain injury. \nBut recent reports show that the Army's suicide prevention efforts need \na lot more work. The numbers of suicides have risen since the wars in \nIraq and Afghanistan began, and last year as many as 121 soldiers \ncommitted suicide. That is a 20-percent increase over the year before.\n\n  I was struck by a recent report by the Associated Press which was a \nstark reminder of how serious this issue is. That article reported on a \nVA study which found that more than half of the veterans who took their \nown lives from 2001 to 2005 were members of the National Guard or \nReserve, even though the Guard and Reserve have made up less than a \nthird of U.S. forces in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  Prolonged deployments are stretching our troops to the breaking \npoint. Earlier this week General Casey acknowledged his concern about \nthe strain on the military. He told the Senate Armed Services Committee \nthat the Army is under so much stress from extended deployments that we \nmust reduce the length of combat tours as soon as possible. Many of our \nservicemembers have seen their best friends killed. They have seen \nother untold horrors. Yet somehow we expect them to come back from the \nbattlefield, come back home unaffected by what they have seen, or their \nexperience. We have to ensure that the military takes action to ensure \nthat our troops are getting the psychological care they need. We need \nto see a change in the culture. That change has to be more than a \ntalking point. Senior military leaders have pledged to do more, but \nthey have to ensure that their words and their programs are being \nexecuted in the field. They have to work to break down the stigma that \nis, unfortunately, associated with seeking mental health treatment. \nThey have to ensure that troops have psychiatrists and psychologists to \ntalk to, and they have to ensure that those who seek help aren't then \npenalized. We have to find ways to reach out to servicemembers who are \ndischarged and are not seeking care from the VA. This is especially \nimportant for our Guard and Reserves who oftentimes, when they come \nhome, don't think of themselves as veterans. They return from the war \nand go back to their civilian jobs without ever getting help.\n  In my State of Washington, over 10,200 Guard and Reserve members have \nnow served in Iraq and Afghanistan. Our troops and veterans are heroes \nwho are sacrificing for our Nation. It is time for our Government to \nwake up and provide them with the care they need.\n  I voted against going to war in Iraq. But I have said consistently \nthat no matter how anyone feels about the war, we have an obligation as \nleaders to make sure our men and women who fight for us get the care \nthey deserve. I am proud of the way this Congress, led by the \nDemocratic majority, moved to address the problems facing our returning \nservicemembers, which clearly wasn't a priority for the Bush \nadministration. Here in Congress, we said: Not on our watch, not \nanymore.\n  A year after the Walter Reed story drew attention to the treatment of \nservicemembers, we have made progress. But we cannot let this issue \nfade away. After examining the President's VA budget proposal, I have \nto tell my colleagues, I am disappointed that the administration still \ndoesn't seem to get it. In his State of the Union Address this year, \nPresident Bush said he was dedicated to providing for our Nation's \nveterans. But at a time when thousands of new veterans are entering the \nVA system with serious medical needs as a result of the wars in Iraq \nand Afghanistan, the administration is underestimating the cost of \nmedical care and is cutting funding for construction and medical and \nprosthetic research. At a time when our older veterans are seeking care \nin record numbers, the President is proposing fees for them and copays \nthat are essentially going to shut the door of the VA to thousands of \npeople who served our country. That is wrong. I am going to be working \nvery hard this year to ensure that those misguided proposals do not \nbecome reality.\n  The same is true as we address the budget for caring for our troops. \nOur servicemembers risk their lives for our security every single day. \nThey have done everything we have asked. We have to live up to our \ncommitment to them.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, we are confronted with a piece of \nlegislation introduced by the distinguished Senator from Wisconsin, Mr. \nFeingold, which calls for setting forth the global strategy of the \nUnited States to combat and defeat al-Qaida and its affiliates. The \nquestion I guess I would ask is: Where have those who propose a new \nstrategy been? Have they been paying attention to the good news that \nhas been coming out of Iraq and Afghanistan when it comes to our \nability and\n\n[[Page S1328]]\n\nour successes to combat global terrorism and particularly the threat of \nal-Qaida?\n  I think the legislation that has been proposed is both misguided and \nunnecessarily duplicative of the efforts which I will describe here, \nwhich are ongoing, and would literally cause us to snatch defeat from \nthe jaws of victory.\n  On a more basic level, I think this legislation misses the point. \nEvery time I come back to work here in Washington, DC, I almost feel \nthere is a parallel universe operating here in Washington where some \nhave voluntarily suspended their powers of disbelief and ignored the \nfacts that seem to me to be as plain as the nose on your face. But I \nthink in light of the fact that this legislation has been introduced, \nwe need to talk about it and provide the American people with the \nevidence with which they can make their own decisions about what is \nhappening with regard to the fight against al-Qaida.\n  This bill would require the administration to set forth a strategy \nfor fighting al-Qaida. I do not know what the proponents think we have \nbeen doing since 9/11 but fighting al-Qaida wherever we may find them, \nbut that is what the bill calls for. Of course, the bill also \nconveniently neglects the various strategies we have in place, \nincluding some that are classified which we cannot talk about here on \nthe floor of the Senate, but which the distinguished Senator from \nWisconsin as a member of the Intelligence Committee knows--because he \nis on the Intelligence Committee; he has been briefed in a classified \nsetting about these strategies--he knows we have a number of strategies \nin place, and this proposal seems to act as if nothing has happened, \nwhen that is not the case at all.\n  I would interject that overall in the operations against al-Qaida, in \nIraq in 2007, we have seen the capture of 8,800 terrorists, while an \nadditional 2,400 have been killed. Of those we captured or killed, 52 \nwere senior emirs or commanders, 32 were leaders of improvised \nexplosive device teams, 24 were cell leaders, and 92 were other \nfacilitators. In other words, we have been effective in going after \nhigh-value targets in Iraq and literally decapitating the leadership of \nal-Qaida. That is the reason why al-Qaida is on the run in Iraq and, \nyes, even in Afghanistan.\n  But to recapitulate, the various strategies that are already in place \nwould seem to be ignored by this legislation. These include the \nPresident's National Strategy for Combating Terrorism, which was \nrevised by the administration in September of 2006, and which outlines \nin a clear and straightforward fashion the strategic vision for the \nglobal war on terror.\n  Also, there is the President's National Implementation Plan, which \nwas completed in June of 2006. This document is a classified, \ncomprehensive plan, so we are not going to talk about it on the floor \nin detail. But it provides for the execution of our national \ncounterterrorism strategy, and it provides a detailed breakdown of \nwhich executive branch agencies are charged with carrying out the \nspecific tasks and activities as part of that overall strategy.\n  Now, Congress, as I said, is aware of all these documents. We get \nclassified briefings. Any Member of Congress who cares enough about it \ncan go to room 407 here in the Capitol and gain access to them. \nAdditionally, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is conducting \nhis own review of the al-Qaida strategy, which will be finished later \nthis year. So it is a disingenuous and hollow argument, indeed, to say \nthe administration or this country, the U.S. Government, lacks a \ncoherent plan to neutralize al-Qaida or that the current strategy for \ncombating al-Qaida is not working and it needs to be replaced.\n  The numbers speak for themselves. I am going to go through these in \nrather quick order, but I think the numbers speak louder than words.\n  During the period of May to June 2007, as this chart demonstrates, we \nhave seen 26 al-Qaida in Iraq leaders captured or killed. They include \nsome pretty evil characters, people such as Khalil al-Mashhadani, a \nsenior Iraqi in the al-Qaida-Iraq network. He was a principal \nintermediary between al-Qaida senior leadership and Abu Ayyub al-Masri. \nHe ordered all Iraqi emirs to wear suicide vests--a trend we are still \nseeing today--and confirmed in interrogation that al-Qaida lost the al-\nAnbar safe havens due to coalition operations and tribal engagements by \nthe Awakening Groups, which I will talk about in a minute. He was \ncaptured in July and sentenced to death by an Iraqi court this past \nSeptember.\n  We have seen since that time, in July and August, senior terrorists \ncaptured or killed. It simply is not true to suggest that we are \nineffective or not focused on capturing or killing al-Qaida's senior \nleadership in Iraq or wherever we may find them in Afghanistan or \nelsewhere.\n  For example, in August, we were successful in capturing the emir of \ngreater Samarra, the mastermind behind the destruction of the Samarra \nmosque in February of 2006, generally credited with unleashing the \nethnic conflict which nearly led to a civil war in Iraq. He operated \nthe Samarra terrorist network responsible for improvised explosive \ndevices and vehicle bomb attacks. He orchestrated the Kirkuk courthouse \nbombing in June of 2006 that killed 20 and injured more than 100. This \nemir of greater Samarra was killed in a targeted raid this past August.\n  But to remind my colleagues of the kinds of barbaric and evil attacks \nthese al-Qaida leaders have perpetrated on their own people, by and \nlarge in Iraq, this individual orchestrated the Kirkuk courthouse \nbombing in June of 2006. He masterminded a vehicle bomb attack against \nthe Iraqi Army checkpoint in Samarra in 2006, in which 29 Iraqi \nsecurity forces were killed and another 66 injured.\n\n  So that is August of 2007. As you can see, the numbers even go up in \nSeptember of 2007, with senior terrorists captured or killed. Each one \nof these pictures on this chart is a different story: the brown squares \ndepicting those who have been captured; the red squares indicate those \nwho have been killed.\n  Clearly, Iraqi, American, and coalition forces, along with our \nallies--the Iraqis who have basically turned state's evidence on al-\nQaida in Iraq have allowed us the intelligence necessary to capture or \nkill some of the worst of the worst among al-Qaida in Iraq.\n  In October of 2007, as you can see, the pace remains a steady one and \na strong one in terms of capturing or killing al-Qaida's leadership.\n  The fact of the matter is, we could put up a new chart for each month \nuntil this month and last month. The fact is, we are making enormous \nprogress. So why in the world would this Senate want to change course \nand grab defeat from the jaws of victory, when it comes to putting al-\nQaida on the run?\n  I have to say on a contentious subject such as this, where it seems \nas though people have their own version of reality, the best evidence--\nand one that is undeniable--is the fact we have not had another \nterrorist attack in the United States since September 11, 2001.\n  While al-Qaida is on the minds of my colleagues, though, this is a \nvaluable opportunity for us to talk about the fight against al-Qaida as \npart of the overall global war on terror. Today, al-Qaida and other \nlike-minded radical jihadist groups still pose a very real threat to \nthe safety of America's vital national security interests, both here \nand abroad.\n  These Islamic extremists go under a lot of different names: \nHezbollah, operating in Lebanon and in parts of Iran and Syria; Hamas; \nal-Qaida in Iraq; the Taliban--all of which have the common ideology \nwhich allows them somehow to celebrate the murder of innocent civilians \nas part of their twisted goals.\n  Al-Qaida remains active not only in Iraq but worldwide. This is \nliterally a franchise operation which in an Internet age allows like-\nminded radicals to communicate with one another, and through the use of \nrelatively cheap explosives and human bombs to basically commit terror \nall around the world.\n  It is the existence of this threat that warrants our continued \nvigilance and sustained efforts to neutralize them, and Congress must \ncontinue to support our military in defeating al-Qaida on every front. \nWe have been successful. But it is important to recognize this threat \nis not only located in Iraq and Afghanistan, but it is a global threat.\n  Recently, ADM Mike McConnell, the Director of National Intelligence, \noutlined terror attacks prevented in New Jersey and Illinois--that is \nright, right\n\n[[Page S1329]]\n\nhere in the United States of America. He also outlined attacks that \nhave been prevented abroad in Denmark, Spain, France, Germany, and the \nUnited Kingdom. In the opinion of those who know best--our intelligence \nprofessionals--this enemy and this threat is real. This enemy plans to \nattack us, and it is smart, adaptable, and ruthless.\n  Somehow, some Members of the Senate have been able to convince \nthemselves against all the evidence that al-Qaida is not present in \nIraq and that if we fought al-Qaida in Afghanistan we would be safe \nhere at home. The fact is, it is true the Taliban provided safe havens \nfor al-Qaida in Afghanistan. Al-Qaida has also found a safe haven in \nIraq. But due to the great work of our young men and women in the \nmilitary, due to our intelligence professionals, due to the \nintelligence we are able to gain from the cooperation of Iraqi citizens \nthrough the Awakening Councils, who have simply gotten fed up with the \nbarbaric tactics of al-Qaida--the murder, the rape, the torture of \ntheir own people and thus have cooperated now with coalition forces to \nroot out al-Qaida--we do have al-Qaida on the run in Iraq.\n  But that is a fragile condition, and a trend we must continue, not \nonly through the use of allied and coalition forces but through the \nrebuilding of the Iraqi police force and military, and encouraging \ncitizens, such as the Awakening Councils, to come forward and provide \nintelligence.\n  But the fact of the matter is, if the United States of America does \nnot lead the fight in this global war on terror, more innocent people \nwill die. There is no other country in the world that is capable as we \nare, that has the vital national security interests that we do, to \nfight this war.\n  Again, this parallel universe that some occupy here in Washington, \nDC, that allowed them somehow to convince themselves that this threat \nis not real, defies the facts. There are those who propose countless \nresolutions in the Senate and the Congress to withdraw from Iraq based \non a political or arbitrary timetable, which makes no sense. As the \nIraq Study Group said, we should leave Iraq as soon as possible and \ndefine it not in political terms but in terms of conditions on the \nground, and that is once the Iraqis are able to govern and defend \nthemselves.\n\n  We know that politicians here in Washington have declared the surge a \nfailure before it even started, but they have had to come to grips with \nthe fact that you are always in jeopardy when you bet against the men \nand women of the U.S. military and our leadership and under the \nleadership of people such as GEN David Petraeus and GEN Raymond \nOdierno.\n  We have seen the surge of American troops, along with the increased \ncapacity of the Iraqis to defend themselves, meet with enormous success \nand reverse a trend that was dangerously cascading toward a civil war \nand ethnic cleansing. But the fact is that despite the repeated efforts \nby some here in Congress who have declared defeat before this new \nstrategy was even allowed to take hold have now had to deal with the \nfact that almost without exception, everyone who goes to Iraq comes \nback with the report that our men and women in uniform are being \nsuccessful and that the surge is working.\n  I went with a couple of my colleagues, Senator Isakson and Senator \nColeman, to Iraq in January where we were able to ride, in armored \nvehicles, admittedly, to forward operating bases that previously had \nbeen lost to al-Qaida, where refugees had simply abandoned their shops \nand their homes given the threat posed to the Iraqi people themselves \nfrom this ruthless enemy. The fact is, people are moving back home. \nShop owners are opening their shops. We were able to taste some of the \nbread cooked in a bakery in an area called Ghazaliya outside of Baghdad \nthat previously could not operate. We went to a local department store \nthat previously had to be closed and abandoned literally because of the \nthreat of al-Qaida and looked at some of the wares for sale.\n  So this debate that continues here in Washington seems to me to be \nincreasingly out of touch with the reality in Iraq and the clear \nevidence that this new tactic, this counterinsurgency tactic being \ndeployed by General Odierno, General Petraeus, and our men and women in \nuniform in Iraq is succeeding. It is because of that success that we \nare able to bring back by this summer roughly 40,000 troops to the \nloving arms of their families and in answer to the prayers of many \nAmericans who wish to bring them home but bring them home with honor \nand after they have been successful in accomplishing the goals they set \nout to do.\n  Now, because of the evidence of the military effort in Iraq, a \ncombination of our coalition forces and Iraqis and local citizens \ncooperating to get al-Qaida on the run, there are those who said: Well, \nOK, the glass is not half full, it is still half empty. Where is the \npolitical reconciliation that is necessary for the Iraqis to govern \nthemselves?\n  While progress on the political front has been slower than any of us \nmight have wished for, we are seeing very positive signs of political \nreconciliation. The Iraqi Parliament recently met some major milestones \nfor success, and these are very important because these are the \nevidence of the political reconciliation many of the skeptics have \nlooked for and pointed out as not having been met. So it is important \nto acknowledge the facts.\n  First, they passed an accountability and justice law--the first major \nstep in debaathification reform. We know that many of Saddam Hussein's \nBaath Party members were excluded from the new Iraq, and this is the \nfirst major step to allow people who do not have blood on their hands, \nwho weren't part of the leadership of Saddam's Baath Party, responsible \nfor the murder of hundreds of thousands of Iraqis, to allow them to \ntake their first steps back into governing the new Iraq and \nparticipating in full civic life.\n  In addition, just a few short weeks ago the Iraq Parliament passed \nthree other significant pieces of legislation. They set a date for \nprovincial elections, recognizing, as we do here in Washington, that \nnot all wisdom emanates from the Nation's Capital, that they believe in \nlocal governance and regional governance, and that is why the \nprovincial elections are so important as well.\n  The Iraqi Government or Parliament allotted $48 billion for 2008 \nspending, meaning that because of increased oil revenue, they were able \nto take on more and more of the financial responsibilities of \nrebuilding and governing their own country.\n  Finally, they provided limited amnesty to certain detainees in Iraqi \ncustody--an important, although difficult, step to try to make sure the \nreconciliation occurs on an individual level so that people need not be \npermanently cast as outsiders and given nothing but the opportunity to \nundermine reconstruction and reconciliation but actually be part of the \nsolution rather than part of the problem.\n  The passage of the provincial powers law is one of the 18 benchmarks \nfor reconciliation in Iraq which were set by the Congress just this \nlast year.\n  Despite this concrete evidence of improvement and of meeting \nbenchmarks for political reconciliation, there are those here in \nCongress who have simply ignored those positive steps, not only on the \nsecurity front but on the political reconciliation front. \nUnfortunately, it seems as if too often our partisan differences seem \nto overwhelm facts and common sense and the common interests of all of \nus in America in an Iraq that is able to govern and to defend itself \nbecause our shared goal--which is to bring home our troops--is one that \ncould be met when conditions on the ground permit those troops to come \nhome without squandering the blood and the treasure that have been \nspent in trying to restore democracy to a country that knew nothing \nother than the boot heel of a dictator for too many years.\n  There are so many wonderful stories of success and commitment and \npatriotism in Iraq, and I would like to just close on this. I see my \ndistinguished colleague from Wyoming on the floor, and I want to defer \nto him after another few minutes. I want to recognize and honor the \ngreat sacrifice by Texans deployed in harm's way in support of the \nglobal war on terror.\n  Some of our troops serving in faraway battlefields since 9/11 have \nexhibited incredible bravery and heroism in the face of personal \ndanger, and I wish to share one story of one Texan among\n\n[[Page S1330]]\n\nmany who has served in Operation Iraqi Freedom. I wish to tell the \nstory of SGT Omar Hernandez, assigned to Bravo Company, the 1st Cavalry \nDivision out of Fort Hood, TX.\n\n  Sergeant Hernandez has been awarded the Silver Star for exceptional \nbravery and gallantry in action against an enemy. He did this while \nserving as a team leader on a foot patrol in Baghdad. His patrol \nconsisted of a squad of American soldiers, an interpreter, and eight \nIraqi national policemen. Their mission, as is critical to the \ncounterinsurgency strategy in Iraq, was to secure the population, to \nmake them feel safe. They moved from house to house on crowded Baghdad \nstreets interviewing the local population as part of their job.\n  During the course of one interview, though, Sergeant Hernandez and \nthe Iraqi police accompanying him were moving to security positions on \nthe outside of a home when they were suddenly engaged by several well-\naimed bursts of machine gun fire from the south. Sergeant Hernandez \nimmediately identified the enemy's location and returned fire, \nsimultaneously instructing the Iraqi police to follow his lead. A \nsecond burst of well-aimed fire erupted from the enemy's position, \nwounding all three members of the team. Sergeant Hernandez himself \nsustained a gunshot wound to his right thigh. Both Iraqi police \nsustained serious injuries, immobilizing both of them.\n  Not realizing the severity of their wounds, Sergeant Hernandez \nordered the Iraqi policemen to follow him to a covered position behind \na cement wall. As he continued to engage the enemy, Sergeant Hernandez \nrealized that the Iraqi police were too badly injured to reach cover on \ntheir own. Seeing that these Iraqi policemen were stuck in the enemy's \ndirect line of fire, Sergeant Hernandez went above and beyond the call \nof duty, risking his own life by running under direct fire to pull \nthese Iraqi policemen to safety. Without covering fire, Sergeant \nHernandez left his covered position--not once but twice--to move these \nwounded Iraqi policemen to a safer position. He did all of this despite \nthe danger to himself and having a gunshot wound to his leg. Despite \nhis injuries and despite the continued barrage of enemy fire, Sergeant \nHernandez continued to fire on the enemy position. It was only after he \nwas certain that the threat was eliminated that he finally allowed a \nsquad mate to treat his wounds.\n  Sergeant Hernandez is just one of many brave men and women who wear \nthe uniform of the U.S. military who are serving nobly in Iraq and \nAfghanistan. While there is no doubt that his courage and strength were \nextraordinary, in some ways this is a typical sort of story of the \nbravery of our men and women in uniform. It should be clear that \nSergeant Hernandez is representative of the quality and character of \nour military men and women.\n  I think this also tells a story of the relationship that exists \nbetween our soldiers and Iraq security forces. They fight shoulder to \nshoulder. They fight and sacrifice together to make their country a \nbetter place so that peace and stability might come to Iraq and so that \nthe forces of terror and extremism that wish America and our allies \nharm will find no sanctuary in that country.\n  Sergeant Hernandez, thankfully, has now recovered from his wounds and \nis stationed at Fort Bliss out in El Paso, TX. He has a 17-month-old \nboy and has been married to his wife Jennifer Kay for 3 years.\n  Sergeant Hernandez, it is worth noting, was on his third tour in \nIraq. These young men and women and their incredible families are our \nmost precious national asset. The tremendous sacrifices they make and \nhave made over these last years ought to leave us with awe-struck \nsilence. Think of what these men and women have invested in this war in \nterms of their sweat, their blood, tears and effort. What message would \nwe be sending to these brave men and women when we tell them to come \nhome when victory sits on the horizon?\n  Sergeant Hernandez wouldn't abandon his colleagues in the Iraqi \nNational Police force, but there are some here in Washington--a world \naway--who want to ask him and all of our troops to abandon the Iraqis \nand come home before the job is done.\n  Those who have been clamoring for troop withdrawals for months upon \nmonths, regardless of the news from Iraq, all the while extolling the \nvirtues of our military, I think have been telling only half the story. \nYet, at the same time, they refuse to pass the critical funding, \nintelligence capabilities such as the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance \nAct reauthorization bill which sits over in the House of \nRepresentatives and which, because of the failure to act by Speaker \nPelosi and the leadership in the House, has left our intelligence \nauthorities deaf to new terrorist targets that, if detected, would \nlikely detour and defeat attacks against American citizens, both here \nand abroad.\n  Mr. President, the American people often accuse politicians of saying \none thing and doing another. But this is a clear case. Servicemembers \nsuch as Sergeant Hernandez deserve not only our words but our \nunmitigated support.\n  I think our task is clear and that is to let our men and women in \nuniform do the job they have volunteered to do and which they are so \nably performing. We ought to do nothing to deter or impede or obstruct \ntheir success, especially when success appears to be so much more \nclearly on the horizon than a few short months ago. But as these charts \nhave indicated, we are having tremendous success in taking down al-\nQaida--those who celebrate the murder of innocent civilians in pursuit \nof their own twisted goals. The last thing we need to do is to pass \nlegislation that would literally draw defeat from the jaws of victory.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). The Senator from Wyoming is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I will make a few comments about what is \ngoing on around here. I am not sure what has gotten into the water \naround here, but something strange has happened over the last couple \ndays. Well, maybe it is not so strange, or even unusual, and that is \nunfortunate. What I am talking about is a sort of snowstorm, a \nwhiteout--the people in Wyoming will know what I am talking about--\nexcept this whiteout isn't made of snow.\n  Bear with me while I describe our last vote, the one we did last \nnight. It was cloture on a motion to proceed to a measure that says we \nshould have a plan to fight al-Qaida and that we should basically put \nthat plan out for public comment. That might strike people outside \nWashington as a little odd, and it should. Doesn't our military already \nhave a plan? Yes, it does. Why would we want to tell al-Qaida how we \nplan to defeat them? Good questions. Good points.\n  The fact that the motion to debate the proposal passed overwhelmingly \nmight further leave people scratching their heads. Senators, the \nmajority of whom, I would venture to say, do not want the proposal to \nbecome law, voted to waste the Senate's time debating this measure. \nWhy? Is it because debating this will actually help us to defeat al-\nQaida? Is it because debating this will make our Nation more secure? \nNo, it would not.\n  This is all happening at a time when we have an urgent need to work \non solutions to the problems just about every one of the American \npeople worry about. Health care is at the top of the list. Congress \nneeds to wrangle with spiraling health care costs. Medicare is going \nbroke. Social Security is following suit a little bit later. There are \neducation measures on the table right now that we need to finish. Our \neconomy begs for positive action. We have a budget problem in Congress. \nBut the Senate came to a decision. On a vote of 89 to 3 last night, \nthis body decided that instead of working on these problems I \nmentioned, we needed to debate a bill few of us want to ultimately \napprove. That is wrong. The American people did not elect us to play \n``gotcha'' politics. They want to see action on real problems. They \nwant to see results--positive results.\n  I voted against debating on this ill-begotten proposal because \nCongress needs to be doing the work the people sent us here to do.\n  National defense is of utmost importance to our Nation. Without a \nstrong national defense, we would not have the free country we have. I \nstrongly support our troops. I thank them every day and pray for them \nand their families every night. I do all in my power to\n\n[[Page S1331]]\n\nsee that they have the support and the resources to do their job. Their \nlives, and ultimately our way of life, depend on it; it depends on \nthem. But this proposal we are debating now doesn't help them. Our \nmilitary strategists, our leaders in the field, do not want this \nlegislation.\n  Of course we need a plan to defeat al-Qaida in every corner of the \nworld where this wretched terrorist group hides. We need to focus on \nthe terrorists and defeat them at every turn. But is it Congress's role \nto insist on a plan and then share the plan with al-Qaida? That is \nultimately what this legislation would do. If Congress forces the \nadministration and our military to write this plan according to \nCongress's specification, then Congress is going to want to see the \nplan to ensure it meets Congress's requirements. We all know Congress \ncannot keep a secret. If you tell the enemy your strategy, then your \nstrategy will not work. This is a bill that is fundamentally flawed at \nthe outset. I voted not to debate the bill. I was one of three, but a \nbill not worth doing is a bill not worth debating.\n  Just before September 11, 2001, I was given the opportunity to serve \non the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. I was the ranking member of \nthe Subcommittee on International Operations and Antiterrorism. It was \nduring August that I was assigned to that. So in September, since I was \nthe newest person on the committee and the least ranking, a lot of \npeople said: How did he get on that committee? It wasn't important \nuntil after September 11, 2001--or at least we didn't place that kind \nof importance on it. Through that role, I was given the opportunity to \nwork directly with other countries at the United Nations on ways to \nstop terrorism. I am an accountant, so I was delighted to be a part of \nthe group that said one of the answers was to concentrate on following \nthe money. It made a huge difference and it continues to make a \ndifference. Countries that will never publicly admit to helping in the \nhunt for terrorists have helped. I know countries peer pressured other \ncountries into helping with the fight against terrorism. Terrorists \nwere caught, they were prosecuted, and some were executed. More \nsophisticated versions of this plan to fight terrorism are still in \noperation today. But we should not disclose the plan because that would \nmake them worthless.\n\n  The Senate wants additional reports. Why? Congress has already \nmandated reports on the National Security Strategy of the United \nStates, the National Defense Strategy of the United States, the \nNational Homeland Security Strategy of the United States, the National \nMilitary Strategy of the United States, the Quadrennial Defense Review \nReport, the National Military Strategic Plan for the War on Terror, the \nNational Military Strategy to Combat Weapons of Mass Destruction, the \nNational Strategy for Victory in Iraq. Does that sound like plenty of \nwork for the Pentagon?\n  I want you to know the Pentagon is already doing what this bill wants \nus to do. We do need a plan. We have a plan. We cannot make that plan \npublic without allowing the enemy to figure out how to combat every \narticle in it. Why are we having this debate? Well, I know we are \nhaving this debate partly to place emphasis on the fact that we need to \nget the FISA legislation passed. Daily, we are missing opportunities to \nknow what al-Qaida is doing and planning. We were able to do that until \nabout a week ago. Congress could easily approve the FISA bill. It \npassed out of this body by a significant majority. The House needs to \npass it and send it to the President. What does that bill do? One of \nthe things it does is make terrorists almost as accountable as drug \ndealers. Yes, we have stronger laws in this country for drug dealers \nand the way to interdict that than we do for terrorists, without having \nthe FISA bill.\n  What do the American people want Congress to do? They want us to \nimprove their ability to access quality health care. They want us to \nhave the capability under FISA, but they want us to concentrate on \nthose areas that we have specific jurisdiction on, not just checking up \non other people to see if they are getting their work done but checking \nup on ourselves to see if we are getting our work done. I think the \neconomy, which includes health care, is the biggest issue the American \npeople are interested in. Are we debating that? No. We are debating \nsomething I think we already have had 36 votes on in various forms, all \nof which failed. If you try something 36 times and it doesn't work, \nmaybe you ought to move on to something else. I am suggesting health \ncare is one of those issues we ought to be working on and that we could \nwork on and that comes under our jurisdiction and we have direct \nresponsibility for it. Or maybe education. I know the people of America \nwant better education for their kids. They expect us to have as much as \npossible in place that will expedite that, that will work with the \nparents, the teachers, the administrators, and the communities to make \nsure our kids have the best job opportunities in the world. They want \nthem to be able to have jobs and afford a home and have food for their \nfamily. They want a retirement system that helps them to be secure when \nthey finish working.\n  That is why I voted against debating this bill. We are not here to be \nnonresponsive and nonproductive by taking nonactions. Let's act. Let's \nsit down together and come to an agreement on what we can do to make \nhealth care better for this country. Let's talk about what we can do to \nimprove education in this country and then let's make it happen. Let's \nspend the Senate's time on real legislation of substance--ones we are \nsupposed to solve and that we have the jurisdiction to solve and ones \nwe have the ability to solve and ones we have the desire to solve. I \nhave been working with people on both sides of the aisle on a number of \nbills that are solvable--maybe not to perfection, but hardly anything \nhere winds up with perfection. They can be solved with 100 percent \nagreement across the aisle on the 80 percent of the issues that we \nagree on. That would be real progress for America.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I understand we are in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Morning business has expired.\n  Without objection, the Senator is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/28/senate-section/article/S1331-1", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1331-S1334]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE SURVEILLANCE ACT\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise to speak briefly about one of the \nissues that has been debated over these 2 days, which is the \nreauthorization of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. This \nbill, which passed the Senate in a bipartisan way, is now sitting in \nthe House. This bill is critical to our national security.\n  I know there are some who will argue that the bill represents a \nthreat in some way to American civil liberties. From my standpoint, \nnothing is more important to me than protecting the rights of Americans \nunder the terms of our Constitution.\n  One of the terms of our Constitution is that the Federal Government \nhas the responsibility to protect the American citizens and America \nfrom attacks by enemies. That is what we swear an oath to, by the way, \nwhen we take this job, to protect and defend this Nation.\n  We know for a fact that the forces of Islamic fundamentalists, which \nare led by fanatical individuals, have committed themselves to \nattacking our Nation, destroying our culture, and killing Americans. We \nhave already seen their actions take place in the 1990s when they \nattacked the warship USS Cole, when they attacked our Embassies in \nAfrica, and, of course, on 9/11.\n  We also know for a fact that our best weapon of self-defense in this \nwar is to be on the offense, to find them before they can harm us. That \nis one of the reasons we are in Iraq and in Afghanistan.\n  The great advantage we have in this war is the sophistication of our \nNation. Obviously, the greatest advantage we have is we have the cause \nof right on our side--freedom, democracy, and liberty. But the great \ntactical advantage we have is the sophistication of our Nation and our \ncapacity to use that sophistication in the area of our military\n\n[[Page S1332]]\n\nand in the area of our intelligence gathering to defeat these people \nbefore they attack us. At the essence of this, at the center of this is \nthe ability to gather effective intelligence.\n  We cannot stop someone who wants to attack us if we wait until they \ncommit the act. This is not like a criminal situation where somebody \ngoes out and robs a bank and then we go and find them. This is a \nsituation where people want to use every weapon at their disposal, and \nif they get a weapon of mass destruction, they will use it to try to \nkill hundreds, thousands, tens of thousands of innocent civilians, and \nAmericans specifically, in order to carry out their perverse purpose of \npromoting what they see as their Islamic faith, as they interpret it.\n  We cannot be so naive as to believe these people are not out there \nand intending to pursue these courses of action when they have made it \nabsolutely clear that is what they intend to do, when they have said \ninnumerable times that is what they intend to do, and when they have \nactually done it by attacking us on 9/11.\n  To stop them, we have to find them before they can harm us. And the \nway we find them is we use, in part, our great advantage in the area of \ntracking them through electronic surveillance. And that is what the \nFISA bill is all about--giving the legal tools necessary to totally \ndedicated American citizens who man agencies, such as the National \nSecurity Agency, the Defense Department, the CIA, the State Department, \nand the FBI--to give those individuals who are totally dedicated to \nfinding the people who want to attack us the tools necessary to do \nthat, and to do that in a way that protects Americans' rights and civil \nliberties. This law does accomplish exactly that. No American can have \ntheir calls intercepted or overheard intentionally unless there has \nbeen a court review of that decision and a court order approving that \naction.\n  This law is directed not at Americans, it is directed at foreigners--\nnot Americans--whose purpose it is to do us harm, and they do not have \nthe same rights as Americans. They should not. Their purpose is to \ndestroy America. Why would we give them American rights? Yet for some \nreason the House of Representatives refuses to act on this critical \nissue in the area of giving our people who work for us, who work for \nthe American people, and who are trying to protect America, the tools \nthey need to accomplish that. It makes no sense to me at all.\n  Some argue the force behind denying this right and these authorities \nto the people who have responsibility to monitor these foreign \nactivities and foreign individuals, these Islamic fundamentalists who \nwish to do us harm, the terrorists, the people who wish to limit that \nright wish to do so because they want to give the trial lawyers more \ncapacity to bring lawsuits against the telephone companies, which are, \nobviously, an integral part of any electronic monitoring that is going \nto go on. I think that is unfortunate if that is the case.\n  We have asked these various groups, these corporations--remember, \nthey are made up of American citizens. An American corporation is \nnothing more than a group of American citizens who have gotten \ntogether. Most of these corporations are pension funds which involve \npensions of people who work at day-to-day jobs. Most Americans have \nsome interest in stock through their pension funds, and these stocks \nare the companies that, basically, we are talking about, the telephone \ncompanies, in many instances.\n  These companies are being asked, and have been enlisted, and have \nbeen asked in the past to participate in protecting America. When the \nGovernment does something such as that, I think the Government also has \na responsibility to say to those companies and their stockholders and \ntheir employees, many of whom are Americans, many of whom are working \nAmericans, obviously, the ones who work for them and the stockholders \nwho have pension funds who invest in them, that they should have \nprotection from lawsuits which are basically inappropriately pursued \nbecause these companies are doing the bidding of the American \nGovernment as we try to protect the American people.\n  For some reason, the desire to energize those lawsuits has held up \nthe ability to give the tools necessary to our intelligence community \nto pursue surveillance of very evil people who intend to do us harm.\n  It would be a great tragedy and a terrible outcome of this situation \nif America is attacked and that attack could have been thwarted or \nmuted if we had the intelligence which would have been able to be \ngathered by electronic surveillance which would be made available \nthrough the authorities of FISA. It would be a true tragedy. I cannot \nimagine the recrimination that would occur in this country from the \nAmerican people were we to be attacked and then discover that the \ninformation which might have thwarted that attack was unable to be \nobtained because the law which gave people the authority to pursue that \ntype of information through electronic surveillance was being held up \nin the House of Representatives because the trial lawyers want a cause \nof action against the telephone companies.\n  It is incomprehensible to me that we have gotten to this point in the \nprocess of trying to develop our defense as a nation against people who \nclearly exist and who have expressed their intent so clearly and who \nhave executed on that intent, as was shown on 9/11.\n  I cannot imagine that when a bill passes the Senate which has \nbipartisan support--this is not a partisan issue. It should not be a \npartisan issue. It has bipartisan support. It came out of the Senate, \nand it has been worked out between the leaders of the key committees in \nthe Senate in a way that protects American civil liberties--that such a \nbill which gives the authority to those we ask to protect us, the \nauthority they need to pursue the course of action they see is \nappropriate in electronic surveillance, that such a bill would be \nstopped in the House of Representatives out of what appears to be a \ntangential question of lawsuits--tangential in the sense that nothing \nis more critical to this whole exercise than protecting Americans from \nattack.\n  I join my colleagues who have risen over the last couple of days to \nexpress their frustration with the failure of the House of \nRepresentatives to act in this area. We need the House to act on the \nSenate bill, pass it, send it down to the President, and have it signed \nso that the people who we ask to protect us through electronic \nsurveillance of terrorists who do not have the rights of Americans and \nwho are not American, so that electronic surveillance can continue.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am sorry that the Senator from New \nHampshire, who spoke relative to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance \nAct, has left the floor. I was hoping he would be here. That is why I \ncame down. Senator Gregg is a friend of mine, and I certainly wanted to \nmake my remarks in front of him. I hope if he is nearby that he will \ncome back to the floor.\n  He raised some serious questions about the security of the United \nStates, and we have no greater responsibility under the Constitution \nthan to protect this great Nation. The tragedy of 9/11 is still fresh \nin our memories, even though it was 6\\1/2\\ years ago. We know that when \nwe work together on a bipartisan basis we can achieve the kind of \nresults the American people expect, not only of the Congress but of our \nentire Government.\n  This Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act has been the source of \nsome frustration. Understand how this started. This is a program where \nthe Government listens to the communications of other people in the \nhopes that they can intercept information and with that information \navoid another tragedy. That is time and money well spent. The best line \nof defense against terrorism is good intelligence. We want to stop the \n9/11 events of the future from ever occurring. So we certainly are all \non board for that effort.\n  Here is the problem: The administration started doing this without \nthe authority of law. There was a provision in\n\n[[Page S1333]]\n\nthe law which said that if this President, or any President, for \npurposes of national security and gathering of intelligence, wanted to \nreach out to find this information in the United States, there was a \ncourt that was established, a FISA Court, Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Court, and this court would approve surveillance orders in \nsecret, on an expedited basis, using a lower standard than a normal \ncourt. That was the standard in the law. It was a standard that was \nconsistent with our Constitution.\n  If our intelligence agencies want to listen in on the conversation of \nan American citizen in this country, it is necessary to go for a court \norder. So, when it comes to the privacy of American people, you have \nanother branch of Government looking at the executive branch of \nGovernment, saying: This is fair, this is constitutional, this is \nlegal, you can do this. In the criminal justice process, there is \nreasonable cause to believe that a crime has been committed. Similarly, \nin the FISA area--the area of foreign intelligence surveillance--there \nis a reasonable belief that a suspected terrorist or spy is involved in \nthe communication.\n  Now, the FISA court was very cooperative with every President. In \nfact, it overwhelmingly approved requests, and in only a tiny \npercentage of cases were questions ever raised. If the President, \nthrough his agencies, said, I need to listen in on a conversation, this \ncourt said, yes, do it, keep America safe, in the overwhelming majority \nof cases. So it wasn't a novel process. It was one well established in \nthe law, but it was one that this administration avoided.\n  They started this surveillance program, the so-called warrantless \nwiretapping program, but didn't follow the existing law. They didn't go \nto the existing court. They did it on their own, and they did it for \nyears. It wasn't until this program was disclosed to the American \npeople by the New York Times that we had any personal knowledge that it \nwas going on. There may have been a handful of Members of Congress at \nthe highest levels of the Intelligence Committee who knew about it, but \nmost of us did not and weren't given the information.\n  So the information becomes public that this warrantless wiretapping \nis going on after 9/11, a program not authorized by law, and it is \nchallenged in court. When the court takes a look at it, the court says, \nas good as the reason may have been for this program, as good as its \npurpose may have been, this President, no President, is above the law. \nYou need a law authorizing you to do what you are currently doing. So \nthen the President came to Congress asking for changes in the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act so the power of the President over the \nnew technology that is available around the world would be consistent \nwith the law. That is the legislation that is before us, a bill to \namend the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.\n  We talked about changes in the law, and we made changes in the law. \nWe were moving along on, I think, a positive track toward reforming, \nchanging, amending this law to meet the current needs of keeping \nAmerica safe. But there was one nagging issue out there, and it was the \nissue of telephone companies. Here is what it was all about.\n  Telephone companies doing business in America have a responsibility \nunder the law. That responsibility is to protect the identity and the \ncommunications of their customers. If I sign up with my BlackBerry or \nmy cell phone with a telephone company, it is with the confidence that \nthe company that is transferring my communication and my conversation \nis going to protect my privacy unless--unless a court steps in and \nsays, we have reason to believe a crime was committed or that a party \nto this conversation is a terrorist or a spy. We need to listen in to \nthis conversation. That has been the standard in America. It was the \nstandard facing the telephone companies.\n\n  So the President, through his intelligence agencies, during the \nperiod when this warrantless wiretapping program was going on--before \nit was made public; before it was authorized by law--went to the \ntelephone companies and said, we want the conversations of certain \npeople who are your customers. So the question is: Were the telephone \ncompanies doing their patriotic duty under the law by turning over this \ninformation, or did they go too far? Did the President misrepresent his \nauthority at that time, or did he not?\n  These are legitimate questions. Some say, well, wouldn't we err on \nthe side of caution and say to the telephone companies: Cooperate. We \ndon't want another 9/11. Well, of course, we would. And you can \nunderstand in the heat of the moment, in the emotion after 9/11, why, \nwhen these telephone companies were asked to help, they did it.\n  I have seen the documentation presented to us in closed session. All \nI can say about it is, it was extremely limited. There was no legal \nbrief given to the telephone companies saying, this is the authority of \nthe President. It was a very scant document with very little \ninformation in it. But this program went on way beyond 2001, 2002. It \nwent on for years. And for years the telephone companies were \nsurrendering this private information about their customers and access \nto their customers' conversations in a questionable situation under the \nlaw.\n  Some people are testing that in court. They want to know if the \ntelephone companies went too far, if they broke the law, if they \nviolated the Constitution. The President's belief, and the belief of \nmany, is they shouldn't be challenged in court. They shouldn't be held \naccountable in court. They shouldn't have to answer as to whether they \nlived up to the law. There are others, like myself, who believe neither \na President nor a telephone company is above the law.\n  If a telephone company, I believe, goes into court facing one of \nthese challenges, and faces any jury of Americans and says, immediately \nafter 9/11 we did what we thought would keep America safe, I would put \nall my money on that telephone company winning that part of the \nlawsuit. I think the American people would come down on their side. But \nthere are important questions still unresolved as to whether these \ntelephone companies went too far and whether we should be careful in \nthe future not to give any President, this one or any future President, \npowers beyond the law. That is really what this battle comes down to.\n  The reason I was hoping the Senator from New Hampshire would stay on \nthe floor is that I wanted to ask him, as I have asked every Republican \nSenator who has brought up this issue, if they are arguing that somehow \nor another the current situation--debating this law on foreign \nintelligence surveillance--is making living in America more dangerous, \nthen they have to answer a very simple question: Why, repeatedly, over \nthe last several weeks, when the Democrats offered to extend the law so \nit would continue without any missing intelligence in terms of the \nsurveillance efforts being made, why did the Republicans, the \nPresident's party, consistently object to extending the law?\n  They can't have it both ways. They can't argue we are in a more \ndangerous situation because the law is not in place, and then object to \nextending the law. This is exactly what they are doing. They cannot \nhave it both ways.\n  We have tried repeatedly to extend the Protect America Act while we \ndebate what to do with the lawsuits involving telephone companies, and \nthey have said no, let it expire. Then, they have gone public with \ntelevision ads and speeches on the floor saying, woe is me, it looks \nlike this law is going to expire, but it is because they objected to \nextending the law.\n  They are trying to play both sides of this issue politically, and \nthat doesn't work. It is totally inconsistent, illogical, and I don't \nbelieve it is the right thing to do for this country. Let's finish this \ndebate between the House and the Senate as to the liability of \ntelephone companies, whether there will be immunity or liability. Let's \nreach an end point in terms of that debate on a timely basis. But in \nthe meantime, why do the Republicans continue to object to extending \nthis law so that there is no gap in coverage, so that there is no gap \nin the protection it offers to the people of this country? I think that \nis an important element that was missed in the earlier statement.\n  I wish to read, if I can, from what the USA Today recently said in an \neditorial.\n\n       Bush is pressing the House to accept the Senate bill and \n     refusing to temporarily extend the current law, which \n     recently expired.\n\n  According to the USA Today, they say:\n\n\n[[Page S1334]]\n\n\n       That's irresponsible. The House and Senate need time to \n     negotiate their differences because the House has no telecom \n     immunity provision. Bush's implication that expiration of the \n     law would expose the Nation to terrorist dangers is worse \n     than disingenuous: The eavesdropping authorizations under the \n     law continue for a year. Crucial decisions about civil \n     liberties in an age of terror shouldn't be driven by fear-\n     mongering.\n\n  That was from the USA editorial.\n  I think this President, unfortunately, is manufacturing a crisis. \nThis is the same thing we heard from this President and this \nadministration in the lead-up to our invasion of Iraq. They painted the \nmost frightening picture of Iraq and Saddam Hussein--weapons of mass \ndestruction which could be aimed at our allies in the Middle East, such \nas Israel, and aimed at the United States; Condoleezza Rice talking \nabout mushroom-shaped clouds and nuclear weapons striking the United \nStates; drawing linkage between Saddam Hussein and 9/11, when no \nlinkage existed. That was the climate of fear this administration \ncreated before they asked this Senate to vote on whether we should \nauthorize the invasion of Iraq.\n  They are trying to create a new climate of fear on the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act. That is fundamentally unfair to the \nAmerican people. I must warn this President, and every President: The \nAmerican people will only be frightened by red alerts, orange alerts, \nand all this rhetoric for so long before they turn it off. We don't \never want to reach that point. We want to make certain when we tell the \nAmerican people a danger exists, it truly does exist.\n  If any danger exists now from the expiration of the Protect America \nAct, it is a danger created by the President's party in objecting to \nour efforts to extend this law. They cannot have it both ways. They \ncannot object to extending this law and then say to the American \npeople: Be afraid. Be really afraid, because this law hasn't been \nextended. That is exactly what has happened.\n  Time and again this administration's allies have pressured Congress \nto consider controversial proposals immediately before an election. Now \nwe see them raising another security issue in the run-up to an \nelection. This comes from a playbook written by former adviser Karl \nRove that the administration has used over and over again. Think about \nthat vote for the authorization of war in the climate of fear the \nadministration created, and then think of the reality of what we found \non the ground when we went into Iraq. Despite heroic efforts by our men \nand women in uniform, despite their successes in deposing Saddam \nHussein, despite the expenditure of billions of dollars, we have never, \never uncovered one shred of evidence of weapons of mass destruction \nthat this administration warned us about. Not one shred of evidence of \nnuclear devices aimed at the United States or any other country, not \none shred of evidence linking Saddam Hussein to 9/11. All of the fear \ngenerated by this administration before that vote has not been \nsubstantiated.\n\n  But the invasion of Iraq has been substantiated in another way, in \nalmost 4,000 Americans' lives that have been lost, 25,000 seriously \nwounded, and at a cost to the United States and our Treasury--record \namounts. By the end of this year, it is estimated we will have spent $1 \ntrillion on this war that this President created on a foreign policy \ndecision which I think may be the worst in my lifetime and sadly \nendangering so many brave, courageous soldiers who serve our country in \nuniform and risk their lives when called to duty. It is unfortunate.\n  Yesterday, at the insistence of the Republicans, we ground to a halt \nthe debate on the war policy in Iraq. It means we will have to wait \nseveral months. When we return to it, there will be more than 4,000 \nAmerican casualties in this war, there will be more injured soldiers, \nand there will be more money spent.\n  This President is trying to run out the clock. He wants to leave that \nWhite House on January 20, 2009, turn the keys over to his successor, \nand say: Good luck in Iraq--to leave two wars behind and to leave the \nUnited States in turmoil in terms of our foreign policy around the \nworld.\n  Well, it is imperative now that we have the truth on the floor, and \nthe truth is that we have tried to extend this in law despite the \nobjections of Republican Senators. The truth is that we can work out \nour differences, and we should do so in a bipartisan way. We all have \nthe same goal here: Keep America safe.\n  We also want to make sure that when it comes to the use of military \ncommissions for the trials of would-be terrorists, we have a commission \nor at least some form of justice that will stand up to the test of our \nConstitution.\n  I do not want a single person released from our detention, wherever \nthey may be, who can endanger the United States. I want them all held \nresponsible for what they have done to endanger us. But the fact is, \nthere has been only one conviction in the 6 years, 6\\1/2\\ years since \n9/11. The fact is, what has happened in Guantanamo has been the \nsecuring and detention of hundreds of prisoners for years at a time, \nmany of whom have been released without a charge, to return back to \ntheir families and back to their countries with a bitter taste in their \nmouth about justice under this administration.\n  The American people will take a hard look at this issue in this \nelection, as they should. One would hope the administration would have \nlearned a lesson from what has occurred with the invasion of Iraq and \nwhat has occurred every time they have heightened fears before an \nelection campaign.\n  The American people have the final word. Now the President is \nclaiming our security is at risk because this Protect America Act has \nexpired. But at the same time, his party, the Republican Party, has \ntime and again objected to extending this law. The American people have \nheard this song before. They are not going to buy it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/28/senate-section/article/S1334-1", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1334]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of the motion to proceed to S. 2634, which the \nclerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to proceed to consider calendar No. 576, S. 2634, a \n     bill requiring a report setting forth the global strategy of \n     the United States to combat and defeat al Qaeda and its \n     affiliates.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise to make a number of points on the two \nFeingold bills which are before us. I will be happy, after I conclude \nmy remarks, if my neighbor from Illinois, the majority whip, wants to \ncome back and discuss some of the points he made. I believe I disagree \nstrongly with them. But I wish to take the time to lay out my views of \nwhat is happening in Iraq and in our battle against al-Qaida and why \nthe two measures before us make absolutely no sense.\n  On the second Feingold bill, he asks for a strategy dealing with al-\nQaida. Let me assure you, as the ranking Republican, the vice chairman \nof the Intelligence Committee, I know one of the most important \nelements we have in dealing with al-Qaida is to be able to listen in on \ntheir electronic communications. That is covered by the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act.\n  On February 16, 2008, after being extended for an additional 15 \ndays--and we agreed, the Republicans agreed, the President agreed to \ngive an additional 15-day extension on the Protect America Act, but it \nexpired. The Protect America Act which I was pleased to sponsor passed \nin Congress in August 2007 to provide a short-term legislative solution \nto intelligence gaps that were occurring because of the outdated \nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA, which put a 6-month \nsunset on the PAA to give Congress ample time to work on permanent \nchanges to FISA.\n  Our Intelligence Committee, in September, immediately answered the \ncall. We went to work, and after many discussions among staff on both \nsides, members on both sides, visits to NSA, and in close collaboration \nwith the intelligence community, we passed out a\n\n[[Page S1335]]\n\nbill that was a strong bipartisan bill that would, with a few \nmodifications, ultimately become the bill the Senate passed. The \nmajority leader, however, did not act on this bill until the final days \nof the session in December. Even though it was passed out in October, \non December 17 several Democrats led a filibuster preventing the Senate \nfrom considering this vital intelligence legislation.\n  I find it ironic that the assistant majority leader is now accusing \nRepublicans of taking up postcloture time on S. 2633, the troop \nwithdrawal bill, when it was one of his own members who filibustered \neven bringing FISA to the floor last December by demanding postcloture \ntime that killed moving to the FISA legislation in 2007. And it aided \nin jamming us with a deadline of the expiration of the PAA. That was \nthe Senate Democrats, not Republicans, who jammed this body on the FISA \ndeadline.\n  Again, when Congress returned from its recess in January, the PAA was \nset to expire in a few short weeks. The majority leader did not take up \nthis important legislation, however, but he went to a debate on the \nIndian health bill. With the original PAA deadline looming, a short 15-\nday extension of the PAA was agreed to with the understanding that both \nHouse and Senate would be able to act within that time.\n\n  Why the majority leader wanted to put the Senate up against this \ndeadline, I have no idea. He claimed the Senate Republicans did that. \nWell, I can assure you that it is not the Senate Republicans who \nfilibustered moving the bill in December and insisted on bringing up \nIndian health before FISA in January. Why was that done? We just passed \nIndian health recently. It was an important bill, but there was no \ndeadline requiring us to bring up that bill before we went to FISA. \nUnfortunately, once we did get on the FISA bill, more time was wasted \ntrying to come up with a bipartisan agreement on how to handle \namendments.\n  Ultimately, the Senate passed its bill on Tuesday, February 12--5 \ndays before the expiration of the Protect America Act. The Intelligence \nCommittee bill has been available for review by both Houses since its \npassage in October. As I said, there are a few modifications in the \nbill passed by the Senate, but the authorities and concepts remained \nunchanged.\n  Additionally, Senate and House majority staff were in close \ncoordination during the deliberation of our bill in the Senate. And it \nhappened more than once, when we were trying to move forward on the \nSenate floor, that Democrats had to pull their staff out of meetings \nwith our House counterparts to talk to us so we could move forward in \npassing the bill out of the Senate.\n  After we passed our bill, the House Speaker refused to allow the \nSenate's bill to come up for a vote, even after she failed to get \nagreement from her own body to extend the PAA a second time. The House \nrefused to grant an extension. The Speaker spent the remaining period \nof time before the recess considering censure resolutions against \ncurrent and former administration officials and debating and listening \nto the potential steroid abuse by Major League Baseball players. She \nhad been assured by the majority of her colleagues in the House, \nRepublican and Democrat, that they would pass the Senate bill were she \nto allow it to come up for a vote. Nonetheless, she allowed the Protect \nAmerica Act to expire on February 16, and the House went home on \nrecess, as we did in the Senate.\n  We all know the Senate's bill was passed by a strong, bipartisan 68-\nto-29 vote. As we all know, this bill goes further than ever before in \nproviding a role for the FISA Court in foreign intelligence collection. \nIt requires, for the first time in history, that the Government obtain \na court order to target a U.S. person overseas. And let me be clear, \nthis is not even a requirement in criminal matters, but it is for \nintercepting terrorist communications. We have gone further in \nprotecting civil liberties than ever intended by Congress previously in \nFISA or other measures, permitting law enforcement authorities to \nlisten in on conversations or intercepted communications of people \nengaged in criminal activities.\n  Finally, of the utmost importance, the Senate bill afforded civil \nliberties to those companies that aided us with the President's \nterrorist surveillance program following the September 11 terrorist \nattack. Why is this last point so important? Well, the events of this \npast week should make it clear that we need the voluntary cooperation \nof our private partners in order to collect timely intelligence. The \nPAA did not provide any civil liberty protections for those providers \nthat assisted with the terrorist surveillance program. It did, however, \ngive prospective liability protection to companies that complied with \nthe directives while the PAA was in existence.\n  Let me address one point that has been brought up on the floor. The \nPresident authorized the use of the terrorist surveillance program \nunder his constitutional article II authorities, which have been used \nconsistently by many Presidents throughout history.\n  I understand--and I was not involved at the time--that the \nadministration talked with the top leaders on the intelligence \ncommittees in both bodies, the Senate and the House, on a bipartisan \nbasis, about trying to get the FISA law changed before they instituted \ncollection. It was the advice of those leaders that the President not \ntry to wait until we could amend and change FISA.\n  It is a good thing they gave that advice because, as we have seen, \ntrying to get a long-term FISA amendment passed has taken an inordinate \namount of time since we first were advised of the need to amend FISA \nlast April when one of the courts involved in this issued an order \nsaying that because technology had changed, we could no longer \nintercept communications of foreign terrorists whose communications, \nbecause of modern technology, came through the United States. That is \nwhat shut us down, and that is what still continues to bother us today. \nThat still continues to limit us today, with the expiration of the \nProtect America Act.\n  Once the PAA expired, the liability protections as well as the \nGovernment's ability to compel assistance were thrown into doubt. \nProviders that were being threatened with hundreds of millions of \ndollars in damages from frivolous lawsuits because they helped their \ncountry after 9/11 began to delay or refuse assistance with directives \nunder the now expired PAA. And who can blame them? These providers have \na fiduciary obligation to their shareholders, and if the law becomes \nuncertain, as it now does with the expiration of the PAA, it becomes \nharder to satisfy those obligations, especially when they are faced \nwith the ongoing frivolous litigation that was described here a few \nmoments ago.\n  There is a very real difference between having the authorization to \nmake the collections and being able to collect. Being able to exercise \nthose authorities requires that the intelligence community have the \nfull cooperation of the intelligence community and that the \nintelligence community have the full cooperation of the private telecom \ncarriers.\n  Based on the opinions and legal documents I have read, they were \nrequired by law, by the Constitution, to participate. Yet having \nparticipated, now they are being faced with frivolous lawsuits which \nwill, I am confident, never show any wrongdoing by the \ntelecommunications companies. The purpose of these lawsuits is not to \ncollect intelligence but, rather, to destroy the ability of the \nintelligence community to collect information by imposing unbearable \npublic costs on the companies, threatening not only their reputations \nand potentially a very large amount of their shareholder value but also \nexposing their personnel and facilities here and abroad to retaliation \nby terrorist groups.\n  Finally, the lawsuits, which were applauded recently, have the very \nreal potential of providing more information to terrorists on how we \ncollect their electronic communications. The more we tell them about \nwhat we do to collect against them, the better off they are in being \nable to avoid those collections.\n  The Director of National Intelligence has told us that now, after a \nlag, the surveillance under existing directives has resumed. That is \ngood news. But what this means for collection tomorrow, next week, or \nnext month is simply unknown, especially if, for example, the need \narises to issue a new directive to a new provider, if some new \nterrorist group, some new target comes\n\n[[Page S1336]]\n\nup not covered by previous orders. It is this uncertainty due to \nCongress's inaction that the DNI and the Attorney General have said is \ntheir greatest concern. Let me assure you, the providers share this \nconcern. It is only because of the heroic around-the-clock efforts of \nthe men and women of the intelligence community and the Department of \nJustice that the providers have agreed to cooperate for the time being, \nbut it is only for the time being. We should not be lulled into \nthinking we have time, certainly not time for another extension of the \n15 days after the 6-month sunsetting bill, to get this legislation to \nthe President for signature. Just as easily, any one provider could \ndecide at any one time that it is no longer in its business's best \ninterest to comply with the Government's lawful request for assistance \nwhen the legal authority has expired. Losing the cooperation of just \none provider could mean losing thousands of pieces of intelligence on a \ndaily basis. Moreover, because we have already lost cooperation for \nseveral days, we lost the foreign intelligence information that will \nlikely never be within our ability to recall.\n  What terrorist communications we have missed or will miss in the \nfuture because of this 1-week gap we cannot calculate. We do not know. \nI for one believe we were elected in Congress to establish the \nframework for protecting our national security and for encouraging \nassistance from our citizens to serve their country rather than \nencouraging or allowing a state of fear to fall upon our citizens and \ncompanies that would dare to assist their Government in a time of need.\n  Is this really the message we want to send? Do we really want to send \nthe message: Don't help your country or you will get sued and your \nelected officials will condemn you? Isn't that really the main issue \nand the heart of the message here? I am afraid it is. I deeply regret \nthat is what we are seeing on this floor.\n  Some in Congress, particularly in the House Democratic leadership, \nhave asserted that even though the PAA has expired, the country is just \nas safe as we were after the PAA was enacted. They claim the procedures \nunder FISA are more than adequate to allow the intelligence community \nto do its job. They point out that the certifications already issued \nunder PAA do not expire until at least August. These arguments simply \ndo not carry water. Those who claim we can revert simply to emergency \nFISA orders demonstrate they really don't understand how the FISA \nprocess works. The intelligence gaps that led to the need for PAA were \ncaused not by backlogs in processing FISA warrants but because of the \nway FISA was being applied to foreign intelligence collection, and \nseeking emergency authorization is not simply a solution, as though the \nintelligence community could just tell the Attorney General they are \nintercepting terrorist communications and then build a case for \nprobable cause. Rather, the intelligence community must first establish \nprobable cause on each target before they go to the Attorney General \nfor emergency authorization.\n  The problem prior to PAA--and it is the same problem that exists now \nthat the PAA has expired--is that the probable cause standard cannot \nalways be satisfied easily when we are talking about foreign \nterrorists, foreign terrorists who are not entitled to constitutional \nprotections. Analysts who should be spending their time tracking the \nterrorists will be forced to expend countless hours, hundreds of hours, \nto develop enough information to support the FISA probable cause \nstandard. We all understand the merits of a probable cause \ndetermination when we are talking about U.S. citizens. That is what the \nfourth amendment is all about. But when we are talking about foreign \nterrorists, applying such a standard absolutely makes no sense.\n  Is the House Democratic leadership really advocating a system that \nimposes unreasonable burdens on our intelligence analysts at the \nexpense of our ability to track terrorists and affords foreign \nterrorists the same fourth amendment protections our own citizens have? \nI would hope not. The people I talk to back home don't think that makes \nsense. There is a lot of common sense around the country. When you go \nout and talk to people and you listen to them, you hear that common \nsense. They say: What are we doing, giving our constitutional rights to \nforeign terrorists who seek to harm us?\n  These points were reiterated this past week by the DNI and the \nAttorney General in their letter to House Intelligence Committee \nchairman Silvestre Reyes. The DNI and AG disagreed that FISA could be \nemployed in place of the PAA, pointing out that it was ``the very \nframework that created intelligence gaps in the past.''\n  Further, just because existing authorities will continue in effect at \nleast until August doesn't mean the intelligence community has the \nflexibility and authorities it needs to address future unknown threats \nor technologies. Having the authorization doesn't necessarily mean you \nhave the ability, particularly in the situation in which we have placed \nour vital private sector partners who must cooperate with us.\n  As the DNI noted this weekend in an interview:\n\n       A new personality, a new phone number, a new location--we \n     now have to put it into the system to be able to collect that \n     information. That's the question, because the private sector \n     partners said nothing new. So we had to negotiate that \n     because what it created was uncertainty, and the position \n     from the private sector point of view, ``Am I protected? \n     Does the law allow you to compel me to comply?'' And when \n     the act expired last week, that's in question. And that's \n     why we feel that we are less capable of doing our job.\n\n  The immediate problem for the intelligence community is how to \naddress this uncertainty so that new threats not covered under current \ncertifications or directives may be pursued. And the DNI has told us \nthis is no longer a hypothetical concern. While I cannot discuss \ndetails publicly, any Member may come to the Intelligence Committee's \nspaces for a classified briefing on this issue.\n  Simply to sum up on the second Feingold amendment--for the safety of \nour country, the safety of our troops abroad, the safety of our allies, \nthe House must bring up and pass our bipartisan FISA bill now.\n  Turning to the first Feingold amendment, that is another one seeking \nto renew and rejuvenate a measure that we have voted down more than 40 \ntimes in this body: that we cut and run, that we declare defeat and \nretreat from Iraq. I thought it was interesting; this morning I saw a \nPresidential candidate on the trail stating that al-Qaida was not even \nin Iraq before we went in to take out Saddam Hussein. If you take time \nto get informed about what was going on in Iraq, as we have in the \nIntelligence Committee, you will know there was a very vibrant group, a \nvery vibrant Islamic terrorist group called Ansar al-Islam. Its leader \nwas Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. We got to know him well because he was that \nvicious villain who beheaded his enemies on television. Innocent \ncitizens, American troops, journalists, he took great delight in \nlopping off their heads in front of television.\n  And, yes, his group, Ansar al-Islam, picked up the major franchise. \nHe joined officially what he had been unofficially, and that was an \nally of al-Qaida. His group is now called al-Qaida in Iraq. They may \nhave changed the name, but the people were there. The terrorists were \nthere. David Kay went into Iraq after we deposed Saddam Hussein. He was \nsent there with a group called the Iraqi Survey Group to find out why \nwe got the information wrong. There were wrong things in our \nintelligence. We made assumptions that weren't correct. But we missed \nother dangers, such as his ballistic missile program, the fact that he \nfound Iraq to have been a very dangerous place in which terrorist \ngroups were running loose and where Saddam's government had the ability \nto start a just-in-time inventory production of weapons of mass \ndestruction.\n  The conclusion of the Iraqi Survey Group, which was discussed with us \nmany times in the Intelligence Committee and was then stated publicly: \nIraq was a far more dangerous place ever than we knew. That is what the \nbest intelligence post-fall of Saddam Hussein had to say for those who \nquestion why we went in. We didn't get it all right. But we had enough \nright to make the right decisions. From the intelligence we know now, \nal-Qaida was not only in Iraq before we went in, it is the primary \ndanger we fight there now, and its leaders have said repeatedly\n\n[[Page S1337]]\n\nthat they want to make their headquarters for their worldwide caliphate \nin Iraq.\n  Fortunately, our military leaders have developed a strategy that is \nworking against them: General Petraeus, the surge and, most \nimportantly, the counterinsurgency strategy, COIN, to go in, clear, \nhold, and build.\n  We can't just knock out a terrorist activity. We have to go in and \nmake sure al-Qaida doesn't come back. We have to go in with Iraqi \nsecurity forces to make sure the area can be safe so they don't come in \nand retaliate against citizens who cooperate with us.\n  We have been hearing on the floor some very compelling testimony by \nmy colleagues who have recently returned from Iraq about the tremendous \nprogress that has been made there. My last trip to Iraq was in May of \n2007. We saw, when our Intelligence Committee was there, the beginning \nof a turnaround that showed that the COIN strategy of General Petraeus \nwas working. But last night, I had an opportunity for an extensive \nconversation with a Marine combat platoon commander who went back to Al \nAnbar province in March of 2007, having left there 1 year previously \nafter spending 13 months there on his first tour in Fallujah.\n  In March of last year, it was a very difficult situation, and al-\nQaida was still hanging on to control in Al Anbar. The Marine platoon \ncommander had left there in February 2006. We were working toward \nprogress, but then al-Qaida bombed the Golden Mosque at Samarra and the \nensuing chaos allowed al-Qaida to establish a firm foothold in Al Anbar \nand served up grave sectarian stress.\n  Things began to change in the spring with the COIN strategy. American \nand Iraqi forces were clearing, holding, and building, embedded in the \ncommunities they had cleared. As of May of last year, Marine outposts \nand Iraqi Army outposts were still being bombarded with mortars, \nthreatened by IEDs, and continually harassed by small arms fire, a \ndeadly combination of attacks on them. But when the American troops \ndemonstrated they came in to clear and help Iraqis hold a secure area, \nthings started changing dramatically. Iraqi security forces began \nworking better among themselves and with their forces. There was much \ngreater civilian cooperation, and Iraqi civilians became our most vital \nsource of intelligence. That intelligence, combined with the good work \nof the Iraqi security forces and Marine action, essentially eliminated \nmost of the kinetic threats, the killing threats.\n  By the end of July 2007, the Iraqi Army was no longer needed in Al \nAnbar and moved on to other areas to chase al-Qaida. They turned the \nsecurity in Al Anbar back to the Iraqi police, backed up by the \nMarines.\n  This began a very positive trajectory that continued throughout the \ntime the platoon commander was there. In the last 4 months he was \nthere, he said the 2nd Battalion 6th Marines did not suffer any \ninjuries from hostile kinetic attack--mortars, IEDs, small arms fire. \nBut probably the most important thing was that al-Qaida lost its \ntraction. It was denied the assistance and support of local \npopulations. And for the Iraqis, the most significant thing was the \nIraqis were much safer themselves, having less to fear from the \nterrorists who killed Muslims as freely as they killed Americans.\n  In my view, that is a military strategy for success. Al-Qaida forces \nmust be driven out wherever they amass to mount attacks against us or \nour allies or peaceful Iraqis. Iraqis are taking over security with \ntheir Army and police. We must continue to train and support them and \nback them up when al-Qaida amasses forces against them. That is \nessential.\n  Al-Qaida will not go away anytime in the near future. But right now \nthe military battle is in Iraq, and we must continue to strengthen the \nISF to fight al-Qaida jointly with them and enable the ISF to do the \nbasic job of assuring security and stability in Iraq. Al-Qaida will no \ndoubt try to establish other beachheads, and we will attack them where \nwe find them.\n  That is our military strategy. That depends upon good intelligence. \nThat depends upon the passage of FISA. Our intelligence strategy is \nclear. We must have the FISA bill, and it is time for the House to act. \nIt is the only way we can monitor top-level communications of al-Qaida \nleaders.\n  Working with our Pakistani allies, we have seen the death recently of \nAbu Laith al-Libi, the fifth-in-line operational chief of al-Qaida, who \nbecame eliminated. Fortunately for us, the operational leaders, the \nones who give the orders, are taken out on a regular basis because we \ncan get the information on them and we can work with our allies to take \nthem out.\n  I would say, parenthetically, we need a clear, hold, and build \nstrategy wherever terrorism threatens. That means before a radical \ngroup steps up and takes over a country. That means we must reject \nprotectionist calls from those who would stop American economic ties \nand development activities, educational exchanges, with Islamic and \nThird World countries where terrorism seeks to gain a foothold.\n  What we call smart power is the essential element in maintaining \nlong-term safety and security. The battle against terrorism is 20 \npercent kinetic. That is what our military does so well, and we are \ndoing it well in Iraq. We need to be aggressive in going after their \nkinetic threats, against terrorists. We need strong intelligence \nactivities. But 80 percent of the battle is economic development, \npersonal contact, educational exchange, helping those countries know we \nare with them in partnership to assure their democracy, human rights, \nand economic opportunity through free markets in their countries. That \nstrategy is working in Iraq, and we need to apply that strategy \nwherever the danger exists or where it may exist.\n  What is working in Iraq right now? We have seen the COIN strategy. \nAttacks by insurgents and rival militias have fallen by 80 percent in \nBaghdad. Our marines have returned from Al Anbar on success, having \nrouted al-Qaida. Al-Qaida once controlled big chunks of Iraq and is now \nfighting to maintain its last stronghold in the country in Mosul. \nAccording to senior Iraqi military officials, concrete blast walls that \ndivide the capital can soon be removed.\n  These dramatic security improvements and our COIN strategy have, as \nintended, created an environment in which Iraqi political leaders can \nreconcile. Everybody wanted to see them act quicker than this body, \nCongress, can act. They passed a debaathification law, a provincial \nelection law, an amnesty law, a $50 billion budget. These things are \ngoing to go through the political process. One of them was vetoed. But \nthey are making the process work, and that is what we can expect, not \nthat they will move more efficiently and effectively than we do.\n  Despite all the progress, some on the other side remain unwavering in \ntheir commitment to withdrawal. The artificial deadlines, timelines \nwould jeopardize Iraq's very real chances that it will emerge as a \nsecure and stable state.\n  Are the Democrats so intent on denying President Bush a victory for a \nwar they insist is his that they would deny their own country a now \nachievable victory--a secure and stable Iraq? Trying to blame the Iraq \nwar on Karl Rove is a political shot that has to be dismissed as \nnothing more.\n  The Iraqi Government has its problems, and there is too much \nsectarianism in the Government and the Iraqi Security Forces. But \nsaying the benchmarks have not been met--and damning the war to failure \non that basis--is shortsighted, defeatist, and yesterday's sound bite. \nWe do not need any more sound bites. We do not need any more political \ncampaigning on keeping our country safe. It is time we got serious \nabout assuring our troops they have the support they need and that our \nintelligence agencies have the ability to use their full capabilities, \ntechnical capabilities in partnership with the private companies, to \nmake sure we get the best intelligence available.\n  No responsible Iraqi official thinks we can leave now, nor do our \nU.S. commanders, and nor do any responsible world leaders, regardless \nof whether they felt we were right to go into Iraq in the first place.\n  If you think our world standing has gone down as a result of Iraq, \nwatch it take a nosedive if we pull out precipitously and \nirresponsibly, leaving a mess in our wake: Chaos, widespread killing, \npotential regionwide sectarian\n\n[[Page S1338]]\n\nwars, and the reestablishment of an al-Qaida safe haven, a caliphate.\n  The same people who were wrong about the surge a year ago are \ndetermined to remain wrong about it now. We must defeat the retreat-\nand-defeat resolution. We must defeat an effort to establish our al-\nQaida fighting strategy in public. We have a strategy. Anybody who \nwants to learn about it can learn about it. Some of it is classified. \nWe are not going to talk about it publicly. But I join with my \ncolleagues in urging defeat of both the Feingold amendments.\n  Now, Mr. President, I yield the floor for my colleague from Florida.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tester). The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Missouri for \nhis steadfast direction on this very important issue to the national \nsecurity of our country and for the great work he does in our \nIntelligence Committee. But I also know he is someone who not only \nlooks at this issue as it relates to the safety of the American people, \nbut he also has had, as you might say, a little skin in the game. He \nhas had his son over there on more than one occasion. So he is someone \nwho speaks not only as a terrific Senator but as a father of someone \nwho has been on the frontlines of this battle.\n  So I, too, rise in opposition to both Feingold proposals. I believe \nthis is a time when anything other than retreat is the order of the \nday. It is odd we should come to this point at this point in time. Why, \nonce again, after now repeated and repeated attempts without success to \ninsist on a withdrawal and a retreat and a defeat, do we come back to \nrevisit this very subject?\n  So I rise in opposition to the Feingold measure. The measure requires \nthat the administration develop a strategy ensuring the deployments do \nnot undermine military readiness or homeland security--which that is \nwhat they are about; they are about homeland security--and that Reserve \nunits are not deployed more than once every 4 years and regular units \nnot more than once every 2 years.\n  The fact of the matter is much of what this Feingold proposal--the \ncurrent one--suggests or asks is information that the sponsors of this \nlegislation, if they truly just seek to obtain that information, would \nfind in very comprehensive documents that are already available.\n  There is something called a Quadrennial Defense Review, something \nelse called the National Military Strategy. Also, there is the National \nSecurity Strategy. And there are many other documents such as these \nthat are already available. These documents exist so we can have a \nfuller view of the challenges we face and the assets and plans we have \nin place to defeat the enemies of America.\n  I would further suggest that one of the key tools in the fight \nagainst al-Qaida is FISA, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. \nThat is something both the military and nonmilitary intelligence \nagencies use to track terror suspects. It is probably the single most \neffective tool we have in making arrests and disrupting terrorist \noperations.\n  The Protect America Act, nearly 2 weeks ago--which updated FISA--\nexpired because the Congress failed to act. The Senate acted, the House \ndid not. As a result, we run a serious risk of losing the cooperation \nof the partners we rely on for gathering intelligence. As the 9/11 \nCommission and others have pointed out, small gaps in intelligence or \nthe inability to connect the dots can have catastrophic consequences.\n  Because of the uncertainty this Congress has helped to create, we are \nrunning the risk of losing these partners and missing out on \ninformation that could be vital to securing this Nation. It is \nimperative for our intelligence community to have every tool they need \nto collect intelligence at their disposal.\n  The core authorities provided by the Protect America Act have helped \nus to obtain exactly the type of information we need to keep America \nsafe, and it is essential Congress reauthorize the act's core \nauthorities, while also extending liability protection to those \ncompanies that assisted our Nation following 9/11.\n  As a member of the President's Cabinet on the fateful day of \nSeptember 11, 2001, I can readily recall what this city was like on \nSeptember 12. We could still see the smoke rising from the Pentagon \nbuilding--that unbelievable sight of destruction, of death. It was a \ntime when the Nation was assured we were about to be hit again. The \ndecision was made that we needed to act, that we needed to move forward \nto try to protect our Nation. And thank the Good Lord, until today our \nNation has been kept safe. That has not been by accident. That has not \nbeen just by fate. It has been because we have been aggressive in \nintelligence gathering, and we have been aggressive in taking the fight \nto the enemies of America.\n  Some in this body have argued the expiration of the Protect America \nAct has not weakened the intelligence community's ability to conduct \nsurveillance and have cited an Executive order as a legitimate \nsubstitute for the act. I do not agree with that. I disagree.\n  An Executive order is not always as effective, efficient or safe for \nour intelligence professionals as the conditions accorded to them under \nthe Protect America Act. In fact, this Executive order failed to aid \nour intelligence community in a particular case prior to 9/11. One of \nthe September 11 hijackers communicated with a known overseas terrorist \nwhile living in the United States. But because that collection was \nconducted under an Executive order, the intelligence community could \nnot identify the domestic end of the communication and, further, were \nunable to collect the information that may have given greater insight \ninto the planning of the 9/11 attacks.\n  In fact, this was cited as one of the central criticisms to the \ncongressional joint inquiry that examined the intelligence failures \nleading up to the September 11 attacks.\n  In the absence of the Protect America Act, others have argued \nemploying the outdated provisions of FISA would be sufficient to ensure \nthere is no dropoff in the way we gather foreign and domestic \nintelligence. Unfortunately, using these particular provisions accorded \nunder the FISA Act--unlike the Protect America Act--would impair our \nability to collect information on foreign intelligence targets located \noverseas.\n  FISA was designed to govern intelligence surveillance of persons in \nthe United States where the fourth amendment mandates that there must \nbe probable cause before surveillance can begin. While this makes sense \nwhen targeting suspects in the United States for surveillance, it \ndoesn't for surveillance of overseas targets and could result in the \nloss of potentially vital intelligence as our intelligence officials \nwait for the process to occur. It could also divert the attention of \nour linguists and analysts away from their core role, which is to \nprotect the Nation from the task of providing detailed facts for FISA \nCourt applications.\n  It is false to assume Congress's amendments to FISA are sufficient \nand that there is no longer a need to modernize the act. This past \nAugust, Congress amended the Protect America Act on a basis that runs \ncounter to this particular statement. Since its inception in 1978, \nthere have been many advancements to communications that have to be \nreflected, that have to be updated, and that have to be a part of FISA.\n  There has been an issue of concern also about Congress's failure to \nprovide liability protection for private sector firms which helped the \nFederal Government in defending the Nation following the September 11 \nattacks. This was part of the Senate bill which had strong bipartisan \nsupport. Not providing liability protection, some have argued, will \nhave no effect on our intelligence collection capabilities. The fact is \nthat these companies acted in good faith, and they acted in good faith \nwhen they were called upon to assist our intelligence professionals in \nkeeping our Nation safe after our Nation was attacked.\n  I once again want to remind us about September 12. What did we feel \nlike? What were our thoughts at that time? What would we not have done \nto ensure that America was kept safe from another savage attack? By the \nway, our enemies are still at it. Nothing has changed in terms of their \nintentions. What has changed is their capabilities, because we have \nbeen on the offense.\n\n[[Page S1339]]\n\nWhat has changed is America's ability to defend itself because we have \nbeen protecting ourselves.\n  It was the right thing for these companies at the time to assist \ntheir Nation in need, and it was the right thing for us to do to \nprovide them with immunity from the potential barrage of lawsuits they \ncould face. It was the fair and the just thing to do. Private party \nassistance is necessary and critical to ensure that the intelligence \ncommunity can collect the information needed to protect our country \nfrom attack.\n  In a report on S. 2248, the Senate Intelligence Committee agreed when \nstating:\n\n       The Intelligence Committee cannot obtain the intelligence \n     it needs without assistance--\n\nfrom our telecommunications partners.\n  Exposing the private sector to potential billion dollar class action \nlawsuits would set a dangerous precedent after they worked admirably \nwith the folks in our intelligence community to defend our country. If \nwe are unable to count on their support in the future, we cannot \ncontinue to pursue terrorists who are still very much interested in \nattacking us again.\n  Yesterday, testifying before the Senate Armed Services Committee, \nAdmiral McConnell was very clear. This is necessary. It is essential \nfor Admiral McConnell and for our intelligence community to be able to \ndo their work. We have a solemn obligation to keep to the American \npeople, which is to keep them safe and to remain proactive in \nidentifying threats before they materialize.\n  Through the benefit of hindsight, we have identified some areas where \nthe bureaucracy has failed the American people, and we must work to fix \nthem by ensuring our intelligence officials have everything they need \nto stay on the offense in the war against our enemies.\n  One thing I think we can agree on is that Iraq is the pivotal front \non our global war on terror. That is where we are fighting al-Qaida. We \nfight them there so we don't have to fight them on our soil.\n  Osama bin Laden has called Iraq the ``central front'' against the war \non America and the West, and al-Qaida in Iraq shares that goal. Our \nsoldiers are on the front lines of this war on terror, and it is our \nduty to give them everything we can to help them achieve their \nobjectives.\n  Admiral McConnell yesterday was talking about how this particular act \ncould help in the case of kidnapped soldiers on the front and that this \ninability would be a tremendous detriment to our ability to keep our \nsoldiers safe on the battlefield.\n  I understand the bill we are on today and the legislation we \nconsidered earlier this week are aimed at pulling United States troops \nout of Iraq immediately, precipitously, irresponsibly, and signaling \ndefeat. If we are seeking conditions in Iraq today such as those we saw \na year ago--presurge--then I could understand why we would be debating \nthis. When we were here a year ago, many of my friends on the other \nside of the aisle were ready to admit defeat. The distinguished \nmajority announced that the United States had ``lost'' the war in Iraq, \nthere was no way to win, and that we should pull our troops out as soon \nas possible. Presidential candidates still continue to insist that an \nimmediate pullout is the only logical answer that a Commander in Chief \nshould take.\n\n  A lot has changed since a year ago. In February of 2007, \nethnosectarian violence accounted for nearly 800 deaths in Baghdad. So \nfar this month, ethnosectarian-related deaths number below 40, a 95-\npercent decrease. During the same period in Baghdad, suicide attacks \nwent from 12 a month to 4 this past January, a 66-percent decrease. \nAttacks have decreased in 17 of 18 provinces in Iraq. IED detonations \nare down by 45 percent in Baghdad since February of 2007.\n  This is to say that the war wasn't lost. Admitting defeat was \npremature, if politically expedient, at the time. We did not lose the \nwar. The surge is effective. Our troops, as we knew they would, did \nrise to the challenge. By the way, it is not only our troops, it is our \ncommanders. It is General Petraeus. It is the brilliant strategies that \nhave been followed.\n  No one wants to have our troops in Iraq any longer than necessary. I \nlook forward to the day when young people I know who are paying this \ncountry's duty there can come home to their families and to their young \nchildren. We are there because our military presence is necessary. It \nis necessary for our national security.\n  The troop withdrawal measure, Feingold No. 1, was debated this week \nand would cut off funds for combat deployments in Iraq in 120 days. Not \nonly would it cut off money for our troops, it would cut off any chance \nat continuing the political process that has begun to take hold in \nIraq.\n  The atmosphere that the surge has created in Iraq has allowed \npolitical progress to take place. Sure, the voices of defeatism would \nsay we have made no political progress. The fact is from time to time \nwe get a little bogged down in the Senate, even after 200 years of \nmeeting together and after 200 years of relative peace and tranquility. \nBut progress is being made politically.\n  This month, on February 13, the Council of Representatives passed \nthree key pieces of legislation: the amnesty law, the provincial powers \nlaw, and a fiscal budget.\n  The amnesty law: The Government of Iraq's general amnesty law \nrepresents a benchmark in facilitating political reconciliation and the \nrule of law of Iraq. It addresses the scope of eligibility for amnesty \nfor Iraqis in Iraqi detention facilities, whether they have been \nbrought to trial or not. The law exempts from this amnesty those who \nhave committed specific serious crimes such as premeditated murder or \nkidnapping or those who are subject to the death penalty.\n  The provincial powers law: Along with the elections law, the \nprovincial powers law provides the establishment of a new provincial \nelection by October of 2008 and defines the authorities of the federal \ngovernment in relation to the provinces.\n  The fiscal budget: The $48 billion Iraqi budget would represent a 17-\npercent increase in spending over last year's budget, with a 23-percent \nincrease in security expenditures. They are beginning to pay for \ndefending their country. Capital funds allocated to the 15 provinces \nwill increase over 50 percent, from $2.1 billion to $3.3 billion, \nreflecting the improved budget execution performance by the provinces \nin 2007.\n  Democrats' proposals for a quick withdrawal of American forces \nwithout regard to consequences will leave America less safe and \nundermine our national interests. Moreover, disclosing to al-Qaida our \nplan for defeating them is a recipe for defeat of our own troops. \nGeneral Petraeus tells us that the effective fight against al-Qaida \nbegins in Iraq. General Petraeus says:\n\n       We have an enormous national interest in Iraq, first of \n     all, in helping the Iraqis achieve its objectives, our \n     objectives of a secure, stable Iraq, connected into the \n     region. Not a regional problem, not a base for al-Qaida from \n     which to train and export terror. . . .\n\n  And, I would add further, one of the possibilities of a triumphant \nIraq, of a triumphant United States in Iraq, of a state that could be a \nstable democracy in the heart of the region, and what a difference it \ncould make as an example to other nations.\n  I am still hopeful enough to believe that this can be achieved, and \ncertainly when we look to where we were a year or so ago to where we \nare today, a lot has changed and a lot has happened.\n  I see my colleague from Colorado patiently waiting.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I personally thank the Senator from \nFlorida for a fine statement. I listened very carefully to what he had \nto say on FISA, and then his message of hope to the Iraqi people. I \nhave had an opportunity to serve with the Senator from Florida in the \nSenate and I feel very honored to be able to do that. I also had an \nopportunity to interact with him when he was a member of the \nPresident's Cabinet. He is a leader whom I think has a future and I \ncertainly appreciate his leadership here in the Senate as well as in \nthe President's Cabinet. I thank him for his dedication to our country.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I also want to recognize Senator Bond, the Senator from\n\n[[Page S1340]]\n\nMissouri. He spoke before Senator Martinez. I thought he gave a very \nmeaningful talk about the importance of FISA, along with Senator \nMartinez. He has a personal interest in what happens, not only as a \nSenator from the State of Missouri, but he has a son who serves in \nIraq. So he gets a firsthand report, and I know he spends a lot of time \nstudying it. He certainly has become one of the more knowledgeable \npeople in the Senate as far as intelligence matters are concerned. I \nthink it behooves all of us to listen to his presentation and the \nmessage he is sending.\n  I rise today to discuss S. 2634 in light of the current situation \nregarding the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. The bill we are \ndiscussing calls upon the Secretaries of Defense, State, and Homeland \nSecurity, along with the Joint Chiefs of Staff and Director of National \nIntelligence, to jointly submit to Congress a report setting forth the \nglobal strategy of the United States to combat and defeat al-Qaida and \nits affiliates. I can't imagine that this proposal would have any \neffect--given, for instance, that the Director of National Intelligence \nMike McConnell has been calling for an extension of the Protect America \nAct, and the House refuses to listen. Director McConnell feels an \nextension is necessary to combat and defeat terrorists, including all \nal-Qaida, but that proposal doesn't seem to matter much.\n  As we all know, the existing authorities provided by the Protect \nAmerica Act expired nearly 2 weeks ago. On February 16, the House \nDemocratic leadership allowed these provisions to expire without a \nvote. So for the last 2 weeks, our intelligence community has lost out \non opportunities to gather intelligence and to continue to keep our \nNation safe.\n  As a majority of Senators know, the recently passed Senate version of \nFISA is a solid, workable, bipartisan bill that would greatly enhance \nthe protection of this country. In addition, it would increase civil \nliberty protections and the protections of the privacy rights of \nAmericans.\n  The Senate passed FISA modernization with bipartisan support. Since \nthen, the House has failed to take up the provisions. What is most \ndistressing, and quite frankly the most insulting factor in this \nsituation, is that within the same week the House chose not to take up \nand make permanent essential provisions from the Protect America Act, \nthe House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform found time to \nconduct a hearing on steroids in professional baseball that amounted to \nnothing more than a media circus. It is for reasons such as these that \nCongress has some of the lowest approval ratings in history. To top it \noff, the House promptly adjourned for a week of recess as the FISA \nprovisions expired. If nothing else, this action--or more correctly \ninaction--presents the appearance that House leadership is prioritizing \nmedia-friendly events above the hard work of keeping our Nation safe \nand providing our intelligence agencies with the tools they need.\n  FISA in its current form is not sufficient to fight the war on \nterror. This issue, as much as any issue brought before Congress, needs \nto be clarified in a timely fashion. Time is most certainly not on our \nside, and continued delays in the passage of this bill will simply \nprolong our existing vulnerabilities.\n  Director of Intelligence Mike McConnell and Attorney General Michael \nMukasey wrote on February 22 that:\n\n       We have lost intelligence information this past week as a \n     direct result of uncertainty created by Congress's failure to \n     act.\n\n  Mr. President, is this a comment we simply want to disregard? Are \nHouse Democrats under the impression the DNI and Attorney General are \nbluffing? These claims need to be taken seriously, and political \nposturing simply will not suffice at this point.\n  Our intelligence community must act quickly in order to be \nsuccessful. As lives literally depend on their expeditious decisions, \nit is not in our best interests to deprive our intelligence community \nof the ability to collect necessary foreign intelligence information. \nHaving the ability to collect and obtain correct information at the \nright time is of critical importance to our struggle against radical \nIslamic terrorists who have grown increasingly brazen in their tactics. \nAdditionally, our enemies have become more adept to changes in \ntechnology. The world moves quickly, and we have no choice but to keep \nup with the changes if we are to keep our country safe. The absence of \na legislative framework creates an ambiguous environment that presents \nour enemies with opportunities to exploit our weakened defenses.\n  Nearly 2 weeks later, these provisions are still surrounded with \nuncertainty, as the House has failed to act on the bipartisan \nlegislation put forth by the Senate. The information that has been lost \nin the last weeks is lost forever. We will never know what happened \nand, hopefully, we will never learn what we missed during this time the \nhard way. If we think the enemy is not watching the actions of \nCongress, we are simply fooling ourselves. Simply put, this is too \ncritical an issue to be playing politics.\n  We are only hurting ourselves and insulting the men and women of our \nmilitary and intelligence community who risk their lives every day \nwhile gathering and acquiring certain intelligence data, if we are \ngoing to waste their efforts by bogging down the collection of critical \ninformation. We know full well we must do a better job of connecting \nthe dots in our enemies' communications, and the challenge is only \nincreased with the Internet, cell phones, and other forms of \ncommunication. We don't need to unnecessarily place Americans in \ngreater danger. To needlessly fail to detect a terrorist plot is one of \nthe most egregious disservices that our Government could commit. The \nfact is, we are not on the same playing field as our enemies. As \nAmericans, we have higher standards. We abide by laws and protocols \nwhich our enemies do not follow.\n  Protecting the civil liberties of Americans has always been one of \nthe cornerstones of our democracy. However, a balance must be struck \nbetween protecting civil liberties and protecting our citizens from \nforeign threats. I believe this balance has been struck through the \nSenate bill. The legislation strikes this necessary balance. In \nchanging times, revision of our surveillance laws needs to occur.\n  In the time between the court ruling requiring the Government to \nobtain FISA Court orders for foreign surveillance and passage of the \nProtect America Act, collection of foreign intelligence information \ndecreased by 66 percent. We cannot ignore that fact. We are not making \nour Nation safer if our intelligence-gathering capabilities are \nfunctioning at one-third of their capacity. As such, Congress addressed \nthese concerns through the Protect America Act. But now we have \nessentially taken a step back, and that is inexcusable.\n  As it stands today, there currently exists a legal uncertainty for \nthe telecommunications companies assisting us in this critical task of \ngathering intelligence. This simply makes it more difficult to collect \nthe vital information needed to keep Americans safe. I cannot emphasize \nenough how paramount it is to have the assistance of private \ntelecommunications carriers to carry out intelligence gathering.\n  The Senate bill provides protective immunity to those carriers whose \ncooperation will be needed in the future. It also provides retroactive \nimmunity to private carriers from civil lawsuits arising out of their \nalleged cooperation with the National Security Agency in their \nterrorist surveillance program between September 1, 2001, and January \n17, 2007. Also, this immunity does not extend to Government officials \nor to any criminal proceedings that may arise in the future out of the \nterrorist surveillance program.\n  Thus far the House version does not offer immunity to the \ntelecommunications companies. I hate to even allude to the fact that \nfailure to offer this immunity stands to benefit only two groups--\nterrorists who exploit our system and trial lawyers who file class \naction suits--but I feel I must.\n  Mr. President, the U.S. Government owes these patriotic companies and \ntheir executives protections based on the good-faith effort they made \nin working with our intelligence community, assisting in their efforts \nto discover and thwart attacks against our Nation. The Senate \nIntelligence committee found and stated in its report that, without \nretroactive immunity, the private sector might be unwilling to \ncooperate with lawful Government\n\n[[Page S1341]]\n\nrequests in the future, resulting in what the committee calls ``a \npossible reduction in intelligence.'' This is simply unacceptable for \nthe safety of our Nation.\n  Because the companies stepped up to help their country in a time of \nwar, they have been the subject of over 40 lawsuits, and counting. It \ndoesn't take an accountant to realize these claims and the litigation \ninvolved could end up costing hundreds of billions of dollars. These \ncompanies could end up in bankruptcy, and the trial lawyers will \ncontinue to get richer.\n  The bottom line is the FISA temporary provisions need to be \nreauthorized as soon as possible. The temporary provisions expired on \nFebruary 16, almost 2 weeks ago, and since then leaders in the \nintelligence community have stated that we have lost important \ninformation as a result of Congress's failure to act. It is \nunacceptable and irresponsible to ignore the needs of our intelligence \ncommunity at this stage of the legislative process. The House owes it \nto America to accept the Senate bill or expeditiously work out changes \nin a conference so we can provide the protection the American people \ndeserve and demand.\n  I see my colleague from the State of New Mexico is prepared to make \nhis comments. I publicly thank him for his service over the years. He \nis a great leader. I appreciate what he has done for America.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                                 energy\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I have come to the floor to speak about \nour Nation's growing reliance on foreign oil, and to outline many of \nthe ideas that can help reduce that dependence.\n  Ten years ago, I gave a speech at Harvard University entitled, ``A \nNew Nuclear Paradigm.'' Its purpose was twofold: to shine a light on \nthe substantial benefits of advancing nuclear power, and to outline \nspecific policy initiatives needed for a nuclear renaissance in the \nUnited States. At the time, I stated that it was ``extraordinarily \ndifficult to conduct a debate on nuclear issues.'' After all, it \nappeared that America had given up on nuclear power.\n  In my speech, I observed that an open discussion of nuclear energy \nissues produced only ``nasty political fallout.'' A lingering worry lay \ndeep within me that as such critical issues retreated into the halls of \nthe academy, rather than the Halls of Congress, we risked losing an \nopportunity to have a serious debate. Had that come to pass, the United \nStates would have missed out on the vital contribution that nuclear \nenergy offers to our national security, economic strength, and foreign \npolicy objectives.\n  My remarks came in the midst of a stretch when nuclear energy was \nlargely dismissed. Between 1978 and 2007, not a single application was \nfiled for a new nuclear plant to be constructed in the United States. \nInternationally, the story was much different. During that same period \nof time, more than 250 nuclear reactors were brought on-line around the \nworld. And, as President Carter took our Nation down the short sighted \npath of a once-through nuclear fuel cycle, Europe and Japan wisely \nchose to proceed with their reprocessing and plutonium-use programs. \nThe poor decisions made here stood in stark contrast to those made \nabroad. Nations that chose to pursue nuclear power became more \ncompetitive in the global economy, and America's long-standing edge in \ninnovation began to slip.\n  In the decade since my address at Harvard, we have changed the face \nof the debate on nuclear energy. We did this by ensuring that it was \nframed in the context of how to advance nuclear energy, not whether we \nshould. It is now clear to serious thinkers that advancing nuclear \npower is essential to providing clean, safe, affordable, and reliable \nelectricity. And, it should be equally clear that the advancement of \nnuclear power is the essential tool in confronting the challenge of \nglobal climate change.\n  The clearest evidence of this shift in thinking came with the passage \nof the Energy Policy Act of 2005, which included loan guarantees, tax \nincentives, risk insurance, and an extension of the Price-Anderson Act. \nAll of these policies are important for the development of nuclear \npower. And to this day, the signing of that important legislation, in \nmy home State of New Mexico, remains a watershed moment in America's \nnuclear renaissance. In the 30 months that have passed since the bill \nwas signed into law, we have seen the planning stages begin for 33 new \nnuclear reactors in the United States. I was thrilled to take part in \nan event last fall celebrating the first operating license application \nin decades. Since then, six more applications for new nuclear reactors \nhave been filed with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.\n  To put the importance of these achievements in their proper \nperspective, one must appreciate the enormous global benefits of a \nnuclear renaissance in this country. Consider that today, there are 104 \nnuclear reactors in service around the Nation. Together, they displace \nthe same amount of carbon dioxide as is emitted by nearly every \npassenger car on the road in America. A future for nuclear power in \nthis country will truly mean a brighter tomorrow.\n  The Energy Policy Act of 2005 has already had a positive impact on \nthe advancement of other energy resources as well. The Federal \nGovernment has now approved seven new Liquefied Natural Gas terminals, \nwhich could bring an additional 15.1 billion cubic feet of natural gas \nto the U.S. marketplace. As a result of that bill, enough wind-power \nhas been brought on-line to power 2\\1/2\\ million homes. Along with \nmuch-needed electricity capacity, this new wind production has \ngenerated $16 billion in economic activity, created new green jobs \nacross the country, and displaced 16 billion tons of carbon dioxide.\n  The Energy Policy Act of 2005 also included the first-ever ethanol \nmandate, a small but important step toward reducing our dependence on \nforeign oil. This standard has been so successful that since the bill's \npassage, 77 new ethanol plants have broken ground across the country. \nLast December, we voted to substantially expand this standard to \ncontinue to revitalize rural America and provide our Nation with home-\ngrown energy.\n  In the years ahead, the benefits of this act will be even more \napparent. Renewable fuel usage will increase. The decline in domestic \noil production will slow. And if the 33 nuclear reactors now being \nplanned are built, they will generate enough electricity to power 28 \nmillion American homes.\n  In the following year, 2006, Congress picked up where it left off and \npassed the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act. Staring down a more than \ntwo decades-old moratorium that prevented the discovery of our Nation's \ndeep sea resources--we acted. By lifting a ban in the Gulf of Mexico, \nwe allowed for the production of American resources in an area that \ncovers more than 8 million acres.\n  This bill is already attracting great interest, and investment, in \nAmerica's ocean energy resources. An estimated 1.26 billion barrels of \noil and 5.8 trillion cubic feet of natural gas were made available as a \nresult of the decision to open this area. That is enough natural gas to \nheat and cool nearly 6 million homes for 15 years.\n  The 2006 bill is also delivering significant revenues to the \nTreasury. Last October, the Department of the Interior conducted a \nlease sale in the central Gulf of Mexico, part of the area covered by \nthe new law. That sale attracted $2.9 billion in high bids, the second \nhighest total in U.S. leasing history.\n  More important than the resources made available, and the revenues \nbrought in, were changes to the prevailing mindset--that it is \nacceptable to lock up American resources as both foreign dependence and \nthe costs of essential goods and services continue to rise. We must \ncontinue fighting against that type of outdated thinking.\n  Last December, after 12 full months of debate, Congress again \nresponded to America's energy and environmental challenges by calling \nfor greater efficiencies, a stronger energy supply, and a cleaner \nenvironment. With the enactment of the Energy Independence and Security \nAct of 2007, we will see a 40-percent increase in fuel economy by 2020, \na savings of several billion barrels of oil, and 36 billion gallons of \nbiofuels introduced into our fuel mix by 2022. As a result of this new \nlaw, energy usage in Federal buildings will be reduced by 30 percent, \nand 6 billion tons of carbon dioxide will be displaced by 2030.\n  I begin with these examples to prove that progress on energy policy \nis not only possible--but that it has, in fact, become something of a \npattern. While\n\n[[Page S1342]]\n\nconventional wisdom holds that Washington has been asleep in meeting \nour energy challenges, those of us in Congress have agreed on three \npieces of landmark, bipartisan energy legislation in the past three \nyears.\n\n  Despite this progress, the energy debate should, and must, continue. \nToday more than ever, policymakers are faced with a daunting task: how \nto meet America's growing energy needs efficiently, affordably, and \nresponsibly. Congress's recent achievements have been years in the \nmaking. They are steps in the right direction. But in many ways, they \nare overshadowed by the enormity of the challenges that remain.\n  Americans now spend hundreds of billions of dollars to import oil \neach year. Over the course of decades, these billions will become \ntrillions. A tremendous amount of American wealth, accumulated over \ngenerations, is being transferred to nations that are rich with oil. We \nare trading our American capital--a resource that can grow and \nmultiply--for Middle East oil, a volatile and finite commodity. Just as \noil and gas wells bore into the surface of the Earth, so too has the \nstable foundation of the American economy been penetrated by those who \nsell us the energy that we cannot, or will not, produce for ourselves.\n  Consider our current situation. In 2005, the United States consumed \nroughly 7.6 billion barrels of oil. More than 60 percent of this supply \ncame from abroad, and it came at a cost of $230 billion. It is too \nearly to calculate how much money we will send overseas this year, but \nat our current pace, this number could surpass $400 billion.\n  To put those numbers in perspective, it would cost less--$188 \nbillion--to repair every structurally deficient bridge in America and \n$230 billion per year is more than enough to provide health care, not \nonly for every American child but for every American. It is eight times \nmore than the United States distributed in Federal foreign aid in 2005, \nand enough to reduce that year's Federal deficit by nearly three-\nquarters. In the wake of the devastation wrought by Hurricanes Katrina \nand Rita, $230 billion would have been enough to completely rebuild the \ngulf coast. And, $230 billion is well beyond the cost of the economic \ngrowth package that the Congress just passed to get our Nation's \neconomy back on track.\n  With high prices, growing consumption, and decreasing production here \nat home, the amount of money Americans spend to import oil is set to \naccelerate dramatically. If oil prices remain high over the next 25 \nyears--and there is little reason to believe that they will not--the \nEnergy Information Administration projects that our reliance on foreign \noil will cost as much as $8.5 trillion, even without taking inflation \ninto account. This calculation assumes $89 trillion to be the average \nprice of oil through 2030, a price that we surpassed for much of 2007 \nand nearly all of this year so far.\n  Here is one thing we can all agree on: $8.5 trillion is a staggering \nsum, especially when compared to spending on oil imports for the \nprevious 25-year period. According to the EIA, we spent a total of $1.6 \ntrillion to import oil from 1980 to 2004. This bears repeating: $1.6 \ntrillion over the past 25 years, $8.5 trillion over the next 25 years, \nmore than $10 trillion in half a century. These figures reveal \nAmerica's dependence on imported oil for what it is--a great and \ngrowing burden that will require sustained action to resolve.\n  The dire consequences of this arrangement are already becoming \nevident. In the future, they will be felt even more acutely--rippling \nthrough our economy, decreasing household income, and siphoning away \njobs. Left unchecked, this dependence will threaten our prosperity and \nour way of life. It has the potential to make us poor.\n  Unfortunately, these costs are merely the tip of the iceberg. No \ndiscussion of oil imports is complete without an examination of the \nbroader implications for our economy, our national security, and our \nrelationship with the rest of the world. The figures I have quoted \naccount only for the transaction price that our refiners and marketers \nwill pay to acquire oil from foreign countries. These costs reflect \none, but not all, of the many consequences associated with our reliance \non imported oil.\n  A good place to start is by looking at our economy, a main focus of \nthe Presidential primary races, because oil imports will have a \nsignificant impact on its continued vitality. It is testament to the \nstrength of our economy that high oil prices alone have not already \nthrust our country into a recession. As many experts have noted, our \neconomic energy intensity has improved greatly over the past few \ndecades. Energy consumption has leveled off on a per capita basis, and \nenergy spending as a percentage of GDP dropped significantly between \nthe 1970s and early 21st century.\n  Many now consider our economy less vulnerable to the price of oil, no \nmatter the cost of each barrel. To be sure, some progress has been \nmade. But the economy is certainly not immune to expensive crude, and \nwe cannot ignore historical precedent, which has established a trend of \neconomic downturn in the wake of high oil prices.\n  In 2001, the EIA reported that there have been ``observable, and \ndramatic changes in GDP growth as the world oil price has undergone \ndramatic change. The price shocks of 1973-74, the late 1970s/early \n1980s, and early 1990s were all followed by recessions . . .'' Our \npresent experience has been a gradual and sustained increase in prices, \nnot a price shock. And yet the lesson here is the same: an economy so \ndependent on such a volatile commodity can only be so strong. As we \ncontinue to export capital in order to import oil, and as oil-exporting \nnations grow more competitive as a result, it will become increasingly \ndifficult for our country's resilience to endure.\n  I will mark this, as per my request, and I will continue tomorrow \nwith the second part.\n  I will stop at this point, yield the floor, and I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                   Foreclosure Prevention Act of 2008\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I have two topics to address, the first \non the bill that Senator Grassley and I have on HGH, to keep it out of \nthe hands of people who don't need it, but I will wait a few minutes on \nthat. We are hoping that maybe we can get clearance on the other side \nof the aisle. I have talked to both of these Senators who have \nobjections, but I will talk about housing first.\n  We are now on our housing stimulus bill. It is called the Foreclosure \nPrevention Act of 2008. It was offered by Senator Reid, but Senator \nReid had consulted, of course, with all of the relevant committee \nchairmen--Senator Dodd, chairman of the Banking Committee; I am \nchairman of the Subcommittee on Housing of the Banking Committee; \nSenator Baucus on the Finance Committee; Senator Leahy on the Judiciary \nCommittee--and this is a carefully thought-out, modest, balanced \npackage that aims at the bull's eye of our economic crisis, which is \nhousing.\n  Make no mistake about it, unless we address the housing crisis, we \nare not going to be able to clear up this economy. In fact, \nunfortunately, the inverse is true. If we don't address the housing \ncrisis, the likelihood of this economy plummeting into a rather deep \nrecession is large. So there is an urgency to addressing this housing \ncrisis.\n  The voluntary measures President Bush has supported, that Secretary \nPaulson--a man I have great respect for--has tried to put together, \nhave not worked. That is a general and broad consensus, that it has not \nworked at all. The need to do something is greater than ever. Over 2 \nmillion people are likely to have their homes foreclosed upon in the \nnext few years. That, of course, damages them greatly, but it also \ndamages the financial institutions that hold the mortgages, estimated \nat each foreclosure to cost the mortgagor, or mortgagee, the financial \ninstitution, over $60,000.\n  It hurts the people who live around them. Because what has been shown \nis that if there is a foreclosure within one-tenth mile of your home, \nyour housing value goes down about .8 percent. And it hurts the overall \neconomy,\n\n[[Page S1343]]\n\nbecause when people are not in their homes, or even people who are in \ntheir homes and who have fully paid their mortgage but they find their \nhousing values declining, they spend less. The housing crisis is \ndirectly related to the fact that this Christmas season was the lowest \nspending Christmas season in about 7 years.\n  Then we have another problem also emanating from the housing crisis, \nand that is the credit crunch. We have a severe credit crunch occurring \nin our country today. All kinds of financial instruments are not being \nbought and sold. They do not have a market and there is a freeze. \nPeople are afraid to move. As a result of this credit crunch, our \nmarkets are frozen.\n  The Port Authority of New York, one of the most stable institutions \nin this country--it owns the airports, it owns a lot of the bridges--\ngets a steady, regular stream of income. No one believes it is ever not \ngoing to pay its bonds. Yet it had to pay 20 percent on temporary bonds \nbecause the markets are so frozen.\n  I heard from my roommate in that little house we live in, George \nMiller of California, that the East Bay has a similar authority, and \nthe East Bay of San Francisco had to pay about 17 or 18 percent. So \nthis is a nationwide problem.\n  We have problems with student loans now. I read in today's paper that \nthe Pennsylvania Student Loan Authority is no longer lending. So this \nis spreading way beyond housing, and it relates to a fear that we have \nnot evaluated credit properly.\n  We have to do something about it. The package that has been put \ntogether and offered by the Democratic majority has five pieces--five \neasy pieces--that should be acceptable to everybody.\n  It includes two kinds of tax changes: raising the cap on mortgage \nrevenue bonds, so that States can issue more of these bonds and help \nhomeowners get refinanced; and it also includes what is called the loss \ncarryforward, so home builders and others in the housing area, who are \nnot able to actually go forward because they have losses, carry forward \nthose losses and build homes again.\n  It also contains another $200 million for mortgage counselors. This \nis a provision I originated with Senator Casey and Senator Brown, \nbecause we need someone on the ground to help those about to go in \nforeclosure to avoid it, particularly those who have the financial \nmeans to do it. Over 60 percent of the people who will potentially be \nforeclosed upon have that ability. We did allocate $180 million in the \nomnibus bill, with Senator Murray's leadership. We went to her, and she \nwas great, and put it right in. But of that 180, 130 has already been \nspent. It shows you the great need. We always predicted 180 wouldn't be \nenough. This is another modest amount--200.\n  The fourth provision is money for CDBG, Community Development Block \nGrants, to go to the cities so they can buy foreclosed homes, they can \nbuy vacant lots, and prevent the whole neighborhood from going down the \ndrain because of the foreclosure crisis.\n  And, finally, the bankruptcy provision which my friend and colleague \nSenator Durbin has authored, which I support, would say that \nhomeowners, when they go into bankruptcy, can use their primary \nresidence as part of the workout, which now, for some arcane reason, \nthey are not allowed to do.\n  These are five modest provisions that can do a lot. But, \nunfortunately, there are some on the other side, including the White \nHouse, who are sticking to the status quo. They say, don't do anything. \nThe Government should not be involved. They have ideological handcuffs \non. The Government not being involved? That is reminiscent of the 1920s \nor the 1890s. It sounds like William McKinley or Herbert Hoover. That \nis no longer the economics the vast majority of Americans live by \ntoday. No Government involvement when someone's house is about to be \nforeclosed upon?\n  Earlier this week we saw status quo on the war in Iraq. Now we are \nbeginning to see status quo on the mortgage crisis. The American people \nare crying out for change on the war in Iraq and on housing. And it is \nso regrettable that so many of my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle, and it is so regrettable that the President, ensconced in the \nWhite House, is talking status quo when 75 percent of the people in \nAmerica want a change in the direction in this country.\n  We can certainly debate that change. There are different \nprescriptions for it. But almost no one says status quo except, it \nseems, the minority in this body, the minority in the other body, and \nthe President: The status quo, do not have the Government be involved, \nhave these voluntary programs which do virtually nothing.\n  It is not going to work. So I would urge my colleagues to support us \nin this housing program. Senator Reid has said he will allow amendments \nif we have changes in the housing program. I am not talking about \nwhether we should debate the estate tax or debate Bush's tax cuts but \nreal changes in these programs, modifications or additions. I heard my \ncolleague from Georgia, Senator Isakson, who has a proposal for a \n$5,000 credit for new home buyers. That is something that I would look \nat seriously. We can come together and have what unfortunately now has \nbecome a good, old-fashioned debate on this issue that affects us and \ncome up with a consensus piece of legislation.\n  So, please, do not block the bill. Do not stand there with your arms \ncrossed and say: Do nothing. There are 2 million homeowners about to go \ninto foreclosure. There are 50 million homeowners whose home values are \ndeclining. There are 300 million Americans who see the economy hurdling \nsouth, all of them crying out for us to do something.\n  The one thing on which there is a consensus, and there may be a broad \nconsensus on what to do, that although I think there may be in our \nbill, but the one thing everyone agrees on is do not just stand there \nand do nothing. Yet my colleagues across the aisle, when we vote on \nthis housing measure, who will try to block it with another filibuster, \nthey are saying: Do nothing.\n  I don't think that is wise policy. Frankly, I don't think that is \nwise politics. I am sort of surprised because when we offered the \npackage, we did it in the best of faith. And Senator Reid has offered \nto allow amendments that are germane amendments to be debated to show \nthat we do not want to say our way or the highway, but we did want to \nmove forward on housing.\n  To repeat, the need to do something is real. Housing is the bull's \neye of our economic problems. We can do things that almost everyone \nagrees will do some good. To my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle, please, please, please, join us. We want to work with you and \ncome up with a package that will turn our economy around, and the \nhousing market and the other markets as well.\n  I am going to briefly ask to put us into a quorum call so I can \ndiscuss with some of the folks on the other side of the aisle whether \nwe can move forward on the HGH bill.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Would the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I will yield.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I would request to be able to speak for 10 minutes and \nthen go into a quorum call, if that is OK.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I do not have a problem with that. I will come back to \nthe floor. I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from South Carolina \nbe allowed to speak for 10 minutes, then we will come back and try to \nhandle the HGH bill.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I appreciate the ability to speak. And I wanted to talk \nabout the pending business before the Senate, the bill by Senator \nFeingold, with 30 hours of debate about whether we should have a \nrequirement for different agencies to report back to the Congress about \nwhere al-Qaida exists and how to defeat them and how to deploy our \nforces to defeat them.\n  I would argue that you do not have to be a military expert to \nunderstand where al-Qaida exists. They exist in all corners of the \nglobe. Their goal is to prey on poverty, to take smart people and \nconvert them to their cause. And how do we beat them? Fight them. \nUnderstand what they are up to so we can hit them before they hit us.\n  And whatever problems we have with coming together over domestic \nproblems and domestic agenda items, it is important that we try to find \ncommon ground to deal with the problems facing the country \ndomestically, but surely we can come together to authorize\n\n[[Page S1344]]\n\nan intelligence tool called FISA to make sure we understand where al-\nQaida is, what they are up to, and what their plans are vis-a-vis the \nUnited States.\n  And this body, to its credit, the Senate passed a reauthorization of \nFISA that I think is a great balance between intelligence needs, \ntracking an enemy that we are at war with, and making sure that \nAmerican citizens are protected in terms of their constitutional rights \nand civil liberties.\n  This passed 68 to 27 or 28 and went to the House and here we are \nwithout a bill. The bill has expired. The FISA legislation that the \nCongress came up with last year is now expired, and there is a hole in \nour intelligence-gathering capabilities. So those of us who wanted to \nfind out what the enemy is up to--and I think that is the vast majority \nof this body--those of us who want to have a balance between civil \nliberties and being at war with a vicious enemy, we need to push the \nCongress, particularly our colleagues in the House, to get this FISA \nlegislation reauthorized.\n\n  Al-Qaida is in Iraq. They were not there before. That is probably \ntrue. They are there now. And the reason they came to Iraq is to make \nsure we lost. They came to Iraq to make sure this effort of moderation \namong Muslims in a Muslim country fails. It is their worst nightmare \nfor a Muslim nation such as Iraq to come together and align themselves \nwith the West, coalition forces, adopt democratic principles, allow a \nmother to have a say about the future of her child, and to live under \nthe rule of law and not the rule of the gun, and to accept religious \ndifferences. That is al-Qaida's worst nightmare.\n  The reason they were not there under Saddam Hussein's regime is he \nwas not the problem to them. You know, dictatorships are very \nnonthreatening to al-Qaida. Saudi Arabia has been a problem because \nSaudi Arabia has aligned itself with the West at times and allowed \nAmerican troops to operate out of Saudi Arabia, such as when Saddam \nHussein attacked its neighbor, Kuwait. So al-Qaida has gone after Saudi \nArabia.\n  But they were indifferent to Iraq because Saddam Hussein vowed to \ndestroy the State of Israel, it was an oppressive regime, and pretty \nmuch not their problem. Al-Qaida's biggest fear, again, is tolerance, \nmoderation, the rule of law, a role for a woman in society, and the \nability to worship God in more than one way. That is why they are in \nIraq.\n  And to say they were not there before Saddam Hussein and think that \nis a clever answer to our problems and the justification to withdraw \nmisses the point and shows a lack of understanding of why they chose to \ngo to Iraq.\n  Why do the Taliban fight in Afghanistan? They would like power back. \nWhy are we fighting them? To make sure they do not get power back. So \nif you really want to defeat al-Qaida and come up with a strategy to \nmake sure they are diminished and defeated, do not leave Iraq before \nthe job is done.\n  The greatest news of all from the surge is not the stunning political \nprogress that has exceeded all of my expectations, it is not the \neconomic vitality that is coming back to Iraq, not the reductions in \ncasualties, not the reduction in sectarian deaths, the big picture, the \nbig story line from the surge in Iraq is that Muslims aligned \nthemselves with coalition forces to make sure that al-Qaida would be \ndefeated in Iraq.\n  Sunnis in the Anbar province that were at this time last year very \nmuch living in fear of al-Qaida decided to take matters into their own \nhands, align themselves with us. And due to additional combat power and \ncapability, we were able, along with the Sunni Arabs in Anbar province, \nto deal al-Qaida a devastating blow.\n  They have left Anbar for the most part. They are diminished in Anbar, \nstill not completely defeated. And they are moving north. And we are \nright after them. They are up in the Mosul region. If we are patient \nand we are persistent and we keep the troop levels we need to keep \nthem, along with the Iraqi security forces that have grown by 100,000 \nsince last year, we will crush them. We will capture or kill them in \nlarge numbers as we have done over the past year.\n  The answer to the question of this legislation by Senator Feingold: \nWhat do we do to defeat al-Qaida? We align ourselves with people in the \nregion and throughout the world who will help us fight them. We do not \nleave them hanging. We do not withdraw because of the politics of the \nnext election. We align ourselves with people who are willing to fight \nal-Qaida over there so we do not have to fight them here. And we do not \nwithdraw in a way that would allow al-Qaida to get back off the mat, \nback into the fight. The first thing they would do is go to the \nmoderates who have helped us and try to kill them.\n  So this whole idea of leaving Iraq because we need to fight al-Qaida \nis absurd. We need to fight al-Qaida wherever we find al-Qaida. And \nthey are now in Iraq because they know this experiment in democratic \nprinciples and moderation that is going on in Iraq is a death blow to \ntheir agenda.\n  So if you want to defeat them, make sure Iraq succeeds. Their biggest \nnightmare, again, is a tolerant, moderate form of government in the \nMideast. Iraq could be an ally to this country for years to come. It \ncould be a place that denies al-Qaida a safe haven, that rejects \nIranian expansion. The payoffs of winning in Iraq to our national \nsecurity interests are enormous.\n  The question as to whether Iraq is part of a global struggle or a \nmere side adventure, I would give you some guidance there from Osama \nbin Laden himself. December 2004:\n\n       I now address my speech to the whole Islamic Nation. Listen \n     and understand. The most important and serious issue today \n     for the world is this Third World War. It is raging in the \n     land of Two Rivers. The world's milestone and pillar is \n     Baghdad, the Capitol of the caliphate.\n\n  This is Osama bin Laden telling his would-be followers where to go \nand what to do. The Third World War he talks about raging is raging in \nIraq. That is why he wants us to fail in Iraq because he would like to \nbe able to have a place from which to operate in Iraq to perpetuate his \nagenda.\n  He understands very clearly if we are successful in Iraq, if the \nIraqi people themselves are successful, it is dealing al-Qaida a great \nblow. So the good news from the surge is that after having tasted al-\nQaida life in Anbar province, the people of Anbar said: No, thank you. \nThey are now taking their fate in their own hands with our help. And \nthe idea of withdrawing from Iraq as some way to better fight al-Qaida \nis absurd, naive, and dangerous. The way you beat al-Qaida is align \nyourself with people like we found in Iraq. You help them help \nthemselves, and you make sure that when Iraq is said and done in terms \nof battle and a greater struggle that we have won and al-Qaida has \nlost.\n  To leave prematurely would put this enemy back into the fight. I \ncannot think of anything more heartening to al-Qaida operatives \nthroughout the world than to hear that the Congress of the United \nStates is going to precipitously withdraw from Iraq, giving them hope \nwhere they have none now. They know they cannot win in Baghdad, Mosul, \nFallujah, Basra. They understand that. It is very demoralizing to them \nright now. The only place they are holding out hope is here in \nWashington. Can they do something spectacular to create a headline \nthroughout the world that would break the will of the American Congress \nto stand behind the Iraqi people, who are stepping to the plate and \nmaking not only Iraq safer but the United States safer? I hope the \nanswer is no.\n  I hope we will not let terrorists, murderers, some of the worst \nforces known to mankind in the form of al-Qaida dictate foreign policy \nin the United States because they are willing to murder and kill the \ninnocent to break our will.\n  I hope we are smart enough to reauthorize FISA because this hole in \nour intelligence-gathering capability is incredibly dangerous. \nEverybody acknowledges that we live in a dangerous time. Well, do \nsomething about it, reauthorize FISA now before we pay a heavy price.\n  As to those who think we can leave Iraq, and it is going to make \nthings better with al-Qaida, I do not think you understand what al-\nQaida is after.\n  I do hope that the Congress will come together and reauthorize FISA \nin a way to make us safe. I hope we will understand that the outcome in \nIraq is not yet guaranteed, but we are on the right path. Let's don't \ndo anything\n\n[[Page S1345]]\n\nhere in Washington because of the next election that will haunt this \ncountry for decades. Let's not put every moderate force at risk in the \nMiddle East by pulling the plug in Iraq and undercutting General \nPetraeus. This man and those who serve with him deserve our respect, \nour gratitude and, more than anything else, our support.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nSchumer be recognized for 5 minutes; followed by Senator Tester for 5 \nminutes; and then Senator McCaskill for 5 minutes; she wanted an \nopportunity to speak; and then I be given the remaining 15 minutes. \nThat consumes the half hour between now and 2 o'clock.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Will my colleague yield?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I think I might need 7 minutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Senator Schumer for 7 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New York.\n\n\n                                  HGH\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise in support of a very \nstraightforward bill that will keep the dangerous human growth hormone, \nnow known throughout the Nation as HGH, out of the hands of people who \ndon't need it and toughen penalties on those who sell it illegally.\n  First, I thank my friend from Iowa, Senator Grassley, for joining me \nin recognizing the importance of this issue. I also commend the \ndistrict attorney in Albany, David Soares, for his hard work in \nuncovering a major multi-State HGH ring last year and helping to bring \nthis issue the recognition it requires.\n  I was going to come to the floor originally and ask unanimous consent \nto move the bill because it had been blocked. A hold had been put on by \nmy some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. I have now \ncome to an understanding as to whom the people are, the two. Each of \nthem has said they want to work with us to try and get the bill moving \nby early next week. So I will not ask unanimous consent. I know it \ndoesn't move the clock forward, which I would like to do in hopes that \nwe can come to a negotiation and get this bill passed early next week.\n  There is widespread support for this legislation, people such as \nMajor League Baseball, the NFL, the U.S. Olympic Committee, the U.S. \nAnti-Doping Agency, the Partnership for a Drug-Free America. This bill \nis good for every parent, every coach, and every young athlete who \ncares about kicking drugs out of sports for good. The widespread growth \nof human growth hormone in Major League Baseball has put a cloud our \nnational pastime. But if is there is a silver lining in that cloud, it \nis the opportunity that recent scandals have presented to do something \npositive about the problem. ``Dangerous opportunity,'' the Chinese say, \nand that is true in this case. That is what our bill does, change \ndanger into opportunity. Change danger into something good, getting rid \nof HGH for those who should not have it.\n  No one disputes that HGH has some important medical uses--adults with \nAIDS, children with serious kidney disease can benefit from small, \ncarefully administered doses of HGH. But in the wrong hands, HGH can \nlead to serious problems. Some of the worst side effects include \ncancer, heart disease, gigantism, impotence, menstrual problems, and \narthritis.\n  As we remember, last year, former Senate majority leader George \nMitchell did an excellent report on the use of drugs in professional \nbaseball. One of the main themes was about the widespread abuse of HGH. \nThe report says that because HGH is hard to detect through testing, it \nis very attractive to athletes. Kids look up to their heroes. They \nmodel their behavior after them. They want to be just like them. \nAccording to a Columbia University study cited in the report, athletes \nare second only to parents in the extent to which they are admired by \nchildren. So if a sports star says it is OK to illegally take steroids, \nHGH, or other performance drugs, it is almost certain children will \nfollow. We have to make sure dangerous substances can only get to the \nsmall number of people who need them.\n  That is exactly what the bill Senator Grassley and I have put \ntogether does. It adds HGH to the list of schedule III controlled \nsubstances, placing it alongside anabolic steroids in the eyes of the \nlaw. Congress did a similar thing with andro, another potentially \ndangerous performance enhancer in 2004. Adding a substance to schedule \nIII creates a formal recognition that even though a drug has some \nmedical use, it may lead to dependence. HGH fits this bill. Right now \nit is only illegal to distribute HGH to a person where there is no \nmedical need for the person to get it. Adding HGH to schedule III adds \nin illegal manufacture and possession, along on with other serious \ncrimes to the list. Penalties will be tougher. Someone could face up to \n10 years in jail and serious fines for breaking the law. Most \nimportantly, schedule III drugs must be regulated closely. This means \nthat all legitimate manufacturers, distributors, and practitioners \nwould have to register with the DEA. They would have to keep data and \nrecords on how they make, sell, and dispose of the drug.\n  HGH needs to be placed alongside other serious substances like it. \nOne more youngster who starts using HGH and other performance-enhancing \ndrugs is one too many. I welcome a debate with anyone who might want to \ndisagree with that point. I hope we can come to agreement and pass by \nunanimous consent this important legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Salazar). The Senator from Montana.\n\n\n             120th Fighter Wing, Montana Air National Guard\n\n   Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the brave men \nand women of the 120th Fighter Wing of the Montana Air National Guard. \nThe 175 members of the unit will be deployed to the 332d Air \nExpeditionary Wing for 60 days, joining 50 of their brothers-in-arms \nalready operating out of Balad Airbase, just north of Baghdad.\n   These airmen will join nearly 200 or so members of nearby Malmstrom \nAir Force Base's Red Horse Squadron in Iraq.\n   All together, nearly 500 airmen and Army Reserve component soldiers \nbased in Montana are now serving in Iraq. Our State is small in \npopulation, but our sacrifice is significant.\n   The 120th Fighter Wing has a storied history in Great Falls, MT--a \ncity chosen for its 300 good flying days a year and outstanding \ntraining airspace. During World War II, the 120th was tasked with \nflying aircraft to the eastern front to fight the Nazis. Over 60 years \nago, two A-20 light bombers took off in order to help our allies fend \noff Operation Barbarossa, the German effort to take over Eastern \nEurope.\n   As members of the 332d, they will join with their colleagues from \nthe Wisconsin and Iowa Air Guards to provide close air support \nmissions.\n   As the pilots of the 120th Fighter Wing will tell you, it takes a \ncore of dedicated maintainers to keep the squadron in the air. Keeping \nour F-16s flying in the harsh desert environment is a tough task, but \nthe men and women of the 120th are up to the challenge.\n   It has been reported that the U.S. military conducted five times as \nmany airstrikes in Iraq in 2007 as it did in 2006. This clearly \nunderscores the fact that the Air Force is a vital part of the mission \nin Iraq.\n   I have no doubt that the members of the 120th Fighter Wing will be \nan excellent addition to the forces in Balad during their rotation.\n   I want each of them to know they have the support of every Montanan. \nWe honor their sacrifice, especially those on their second, third, or \neven fourth tours. We pray for their safety and take great pride in \nknowing that the men and women of Montana's Air Guard are serving us \nproudly.\n   And when the 120th comes home, it is vitally important that our \nNation keep its promise to them by providing all the resources that \nthey need for job training, medical care, mental health counseling, \nfamily counseling, or any other services that they need to return \nsuccessfully to civilian life.\n   I am fully committed to making sure that every member of the Armed \nForces has these resources available to them when they return or if \nthey are currently here.\n\n[[Page S1346]]\n\n  I wish to address the debate on the Feingold amendment. When I was \nsitting in the chair, I heard several Members talk about the war in \nIraq. We need a change of course in Iraq. We need to get our folks \nhome, make no mistake about it. Things are not glorious in Iraq right \nnow. It is true violence is subsiding some. It is true some of the \nfolks who were shooting at us are now on our side, pushing al-Qaida out \nof the country. That is a good thing.\n  The fact is, Iraqis want their country back. We need to join with \nthem as allies, but they need to be the major offensive standing alone \nin the world. It is no longer a coalition fight. Everybody else has \npulled out. We need to support Iraq. We need to continue our war on \nterror wherever it is in the world. But the fact that we are spending \nso much resources in Iraq puts our fight on terror around the world at \nrisk.\n  The debate has been good, but I look forward to changing the course \nin Iraq so we can start focusing on issues other than Iraq, the issues \nthat revolve around our economy. Kids can't get loans to go to college \nbecause economic forces out there have decreased the ability of lending \ninstitutions, as well as the fact that people are potentially losing \ntheir homes and probably are losing their homes as we speak. There is a \nlot of big issues, infrastructure, highways, bridges, water systems \nthat are worn out that we need to start addressing. Quite frankly, I am \nconcerned this country cannot afford to address any of those kind of \nthings with our current conditions.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant majority leader.\n\n\n                            Housing Stimulus\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, later this afternoon the Senate will have \nan opportunity to vote on a procedural motion, a cloture motion, to end \ndebate and to move to another issue. The issue we want to move to is \nthe housing stimulus package. We are expecting resistance from the \nRepublican side of the aisle. They don't want to debate the housing \nissue facing America. That is a serious mistake. I hope enough \nRepublican Senators will step forward and join us to initiate this \ndebate about housing in America. Our economy is in trouble. It is \nstruggling. The first indication we had was in the housing market. We \nknow we passed a stimulus bill recently, a bipartisan bill which the \nPresident signed. It is going to be a good bill, I hope, to help \nfamilies across my State and across the Nation. But we all know \nintuitively that until the housing market gets well, our economy is not \ngoing to get well.\n  The housing market is very sick today. Last Friday, Moody's \nEconomy.com reported that 1 out of 10 homeowners in America are holding \nmortgages on homes where their debt is larger than the value of their \nhome; 8.8 million homes in America are so-called underwater, as they \nsay. That is the greatest percentage of homes in such a state since the \nGreat Depression. Goldman Sachs estimates that by the end of 2008, as \nmany as 15 million homes will be in that situation, almost double the \nnumber we know today. The Center for Responsible Lending estimates 2 \nand a quarter million homes may be lost to foreclosure in the next \ncouple of years. Fitch Ratings has recently estimated that for subprime \nloans originated in the years 2006 and 2007, 50 percent of them could \nend up in foreclosure.\n  But the crisis goes beyond the families who have their mortgages \nforeclosed. Forty million American families who are currently making \ntheir mortgage payments, through no fault of their own, will see the \nvalue of their homes go down because of this housing crisis. Why? \nBecause the value of your home is based on comparable sales in the \nneighborhood. When that neighbor 2 blocks over has a distress sale, an \nauction, because his house is in foreclosure and the house sells for \nless than fair market value, that is a calculation that affects the \nvalue of your home. Make your mortgage payments and still lose value in \nyour home; that is what is happening.\n  So when we hear from some people that this is a narrow problem for a \nnarrow group of people, trust me, it goes, unfortunately, way beyond. A \nthird of all residences in America will lose value because 2.2 million \nhomes will face foreclosure at rates that we have not seen since the \nGreat Depression.\n  When the President was asked today in his press conference what \nshould we do about this, he said: Let's sit tight. We just passed one \nstimulus bill. The checks are going to go out in May or June. Let's \nwait and see what happens.\n  It is that kind of bold, innovative attitude that led Herbert Hoover \nto do nothing in the Great Depression and for the situation to go from \nbad to worse.\n  This housing crisis is our wake-up call. If we do not rally on a \nbipartisan basis and do something about it, the economy is going to get \nworse. I do not say that with any sense of pride--just disappointment. \nMy home is going to go down in value, too, in Springfield, IL. That is \na fact. Though my wife and I make our mortgage payments, we are facing \nthat reality.\n  So we have to do something about this. In Illinois, the fourth worst \nhit State in the country, it is estimated that nearly 45,000 homes will \nbe lost to foreclosure and over 2.5 million neighboring homes will see \na loss in value. Our State will see $15 billion lost in housing values, \nand as property values go down, property tax receipts go down. That \nmeans that your city, your county, trying to raise money for schools, \nfor police protection, is going to have less money coming in.\n  We should have seen this coming. I was on this floor sitting back \nthere in the corner as a relatively new Member in 2001 when we \nconsidered the bankruptcy bill. I wanted to put in a provision, and \nhere is what it said: If you are a lending institution and you are \nguilty of predatory practices--those are illegal practices, where you \nmislead people into debt--you will be limited, if not precluded, from \nforeclosing on that home because you do not have clean hands because \nyou were guilty of predatory lending. You cannot take over the home of \nsomeone if you tricked them out of their money and tricked them out of \ntheir home. I lost. I lost by one vote in the year 2001.\n  Do you know what I said when I offered this amendment in 2005? And I \nthought this was a stunning statistic. I said: ``1 in 12 subprime \npredatory loans ends in foreclosure. And I said that is ``an \nastonishing statistic''--1 out of 12 subprime loans in 2005 ended up in \nforeclosure. Do you know what the number is today? One out of two. This \nis because we did not pass the kinds of laws we needed to pass to keep \nan eye on this industry, these mortgage bankers who are ripping people \noff.\n  Have you ever heard these stories in Colorado, in Alaska? Have you \ntalked to these people? A lot of folks would have you believe they are \npeople who are just smoothies, who think: We are going to make a little \ninvestment here, we are going to make this payment, and pretty soon we \nwill have a big home, and we will not have to pay for it. Boy, those \naren't the stories I am hearing. The stories I am hearing are of \npeople, by and large elderly people, who are dragged into real estate \nclosings, facing a stack of papers 10 times larger than this. The agent \nturns the pages and say: Keep signing. We will tell you when it is \nover. And they walk out the door with the understanding that everything \nis fine. Then they look at the fine print when things go bad. And what \nhappens? There is a reset on their mortgage. The interest rate just \nwent sky high. The monthly payment just went beyond their means.\n  That is the reality. There are provisions in some of those subprime \nmortgages where the interest rate can never go down--never--only go up.\n  I met a poor lady from Peoria, IL, 2 weeks ago, Carol Thomas, who is \n70 years old, a widow, whose husband just died. She bought a single-\nlevel home because her husband was so sick he could not climb the \nstairs anymore in their old home. One of these business advisers came \nto her and said: Mrs. Thomas, what you ought to do is consolidate your \ndebt. You hear that on TV all the time: Consolidate your debt. This \npoor lady did not know. She said: Fine. They took all her debts and \nconsolidated them into her new home loan. They took a debt she had--a \nloan she received from her city for siding on her home that was a zero-\npercent interest loan--and threw it into the consolidation. She was now \npaying interest on the zero-percent loan. When did she realize it? When \nthe mortgage reset and her monthly payment went from $500\n\n[[Page S1347]]\n\nto $900 a month. Four hundred dollars a month may not be a crisis for a \nSenator or a Congressman; it was a crisis for Carol Thomas. She was \nabout to lose her home, getting the runaround day after day from the \nmortgage company: Well, don't make the payment this month. Now you are \nin default. It is a shame you are in default. Maybe you should have \nmade the payment.\n  She was beside herself. Well, we got it worked out with a couple \nphone calls. They finally renegotiated the mortgage. But the problem \nMrs. Thomas faced is shared by many others. Do you think Carol Thomas \nin Peoria, IL, thought she was pulling something over on people? Not at \nall. She thought she was taking good advice. Unfortunately, the advice \nwas bad.\n  We met a family here. Senator Sherrod Brown from Ohio and I had a \npress conference the other day with the Glicken family from Cleveland, \nOH. Nice folks. John Glicken came in and had his Cleveland Indians \njacket on and told his story. The same thing happened to him.\n  Well, he decided he would try to take advantage of the Bush \nadministration's plan for saving homes, to save his home. So they said: \nIf you want to make an application for a loan modification under one of \nthese new programs, it will cost you $425 to apply. John did not want \nto lose his home. He paid the $425. He was turned down. So not only is \nhe facing foreclosure, he is out $425 for nothing.\n  In Ohio, the Center for Responsible Lending conservatively estimates \nthat 85,000 families are at risk of losing their homes and almost 1.4 \nmillion families could lose nearly $3 billion in value in their homes. \nState after State--Kentucky, Pennsylvania, Iowa, Indiana, Maine, North \nCarolina--the list goes on and on. In every one of these States, the \nsame stories.\n  Well, the question is, what are we going to do about it? There is one \nthing we can do that can make a big difference. We need to change the \nbankruptcy law. Listen to this: If you are facing bankruptcy but you \nare not completely out in the cold--you have an income coming in--you \ngo into something called chapter 13. You walk into bankruptcy court, \nand you say to the judge: I am in trouble. I cannot pay my debts. This \nis my income. These are my assets. Here are my debts. Is there a \npossibility we can work out and renegotiate these so I do not lose \neverything? Chapter 13.\n\n  So when you go in there, the judge takes a look at it and says: Well, \nlet's bring in your creditors and sit down and see if we can work out \nsome kind of payment arrangement so you don't lose everything and they \ndon't lose everything through foreclosure.\n  One of the things they can do is take a look at your mortgages. Do \nyou have a mortgage on a vacation home, a vacation condo, for example? \nWell, the bankruptcy court can take a look at that mortgage, bring in \nthe creditor, modify the terms of the mortgage--change the length of \nthe mortgage, for example--even change the amount paid on the mortgage, \neven change the interest rate on the mortgage. You can do that. You own \na farm? Let's take the mortgage on the farm. The bankruptcy court can \nrenegotiate the mortgage on the farm. The same thing with a ranch. But, \nwait a minute, what about your home? The law prohibits the bankruptcy \ncourt from modifying the terms of the mortgage on your primary home. \nAll they can do is foreclose. That is it. Does that make any sense? A \nhome is something that virtually everybody brings into that court. It \nis the most important asset we ever own, and the mortgage cannot be \nmodified in the bankruptcy court for your home.\n  This provision of law in our housing stimulus package changes that. \nBut we narrow it very strictly. It only applies if you live in the \nhome. This puts the speculators out of business. We do not want the \nspeculators to benefit from this.\n  Secondly, you have to qualify to get into bankruptcy court. You don't \nhave any income, can't make it in there? You are not going to get into \nthat court. They do a means test now to get you into bankruptcy court.\n  Third, it has to not only be an existing mortgage--not prospective, \nnot for those 2 years from now, 3 years from now, but right now--but it \nhas to be one of these subprime mortgages.\n  Then, what can the court do? The court cannot lower this new modified \nmortgage below the fair market value of the home. This protects the \nlender. Lenders are very lucky to get a fair market value out of a home \nthat is sold at auction. But they are protected here. And judges can \nonly reduce interest rates to the prime rate plus a reasonable premium \nfor risk.\n  All of these things taken into consideration give the court the \nopportunity to modify the mortgage on your home so you can stay there. \nIt is treated just like a vacation home, just like a farm, just like a \nranch.\n  How many people will be affected by this? About a third of the people \nfacing foreclosure. A third of those people will be eligible for this \nconsideration. I think the good news is this: When we pass this bill, \npass this change in the law, it is an incentive for these banks and \nlenders to sit down before you get into bankruptcy and work out terms \nthat you can live with. That is not happening today. These lending \ninstitutions just are not doing that. They will if this provision in \nthe law is included.\n  Now, who would oppose this? Think long and hard about it. It is a \nhard question, right? No. It is an obvious question. This change in the \nbankruptcy law is opposed by the Mortgage Bankers Association. Those \nsame wonderful folks who brought us the subprime mortgage crisis oppose \nthis change to allow people to stay in their homes--the same people.\n  Have you been listening to the Presidential campaign? I have. I have \na colleague from Illinois who is involved in it. You know what it is \nabout. It is about whether the special interests control this Chamber \nor we operate in the public interest.\n  Well, this will be a classic showdown when we have this cloture vote, \nand we need 60 votes to move forward on this housing stimulus package. \nThe Mortgage Bankers Association is trying to stop this bill. They do \nnot want this change in the Bankruptcy Code to give people a chance to \nstay in their homes, even though it has been narrowed and modified to \nthe point where it is really strict. They do not want this. The same \npeople who created this crisis in America by deceiving and misleading \npeople into mortgages which were totally unfair and totally unrealistic \ndo not want those people to have a chance to stay in their homes even \nif they can make a mortgage payment.\n  Well, it will be an interesting outcome. Let's see how this turns \nout. Let's see if the mortgage bankers are going to win or if the \npeople whose homes are on the line will win this debate. It is just \nthat simple, and it is just that straightforward. What a shame it would \nbe--what an absolute shame it would be, if not scandalous--if at the \nend of the day the Mortgage Bankers Association, which created this \nmess in America, ends up winning on the Senate floor. If they do, I can \nunderstand the cynicism across this country about how this body works. \nPeople have a right to be cynical if at the end of the debate we cannot \nmove to this housing stimulus bill. I think it is important we do.\n  Now, there is a Senator on the other side who wants to offer an \namendment to give the mortgage bankers the last word in the bankruptcy \ncourt; in other words, that the mortgage bankers have to give \npermission before the court can modify the mortgage. Well, what is the \npoint if they are going to have the last word? They have the last word \nright now. They can renegotiate a mortgage if they want to, but they \nare not doing it. They are not doing it on a voluntary basis. Unless \nand until those mortgage bankers know this mortgage can be modified, \nthey are not going to sit down and negotiate.\n  Well, there is a big argument that comes back from the mortgage \nbankers: Oh, you know what is going to happen here. If you give a \nportion of these 600,000 people a chance to stay in their homes, we are \njust going to raise everybody's interest rate across America.\n\n  Well, let me tell you something. That is a vacant threat. The \nGeorgetown University Law Center did a survey and study of this \nproposed change in the Bankruptcy Code and said it would have zero \nimpact on the cost of credit across America--zero. So they can threaten \nall they want, but do they have any credibility? Does this industry \nhave any credibility when we look at the mess we are in today?\n\n[[Page S1348]]\n\n  Four years ago, we were dealing with 1 out of 12 subprime mortgages \ngoing belly up. And now half of them? When you hear those stories, \nState after State, family after family, of the way they were deceived \ninto this situation, when our lack of law and lack of regulation led to \nthis circumstance, does that tell you the mortgage bankers were the \nvictims here? No way. It should be in their best interest to avoid \nforeclosure.\n  What happens when a property goes into foreclosure in court? Well, \nthe lending institution spends a fortune in legal fees, and then they \nmay end up with the property when it is all over. Then they have to cut \nthe grass and pick up the newspapers and the mail and make sure the \nplace is presentable, and then try to sell it at an auction, if they \ncan. Most of them cannot, incidentally, now. They are lucky if they get \na fair market value out of it. But they want to stick to their rights \nunder the law.\n  The one part of it that I like the best is when the mortgage bankers \ncome out and say this is about the sanctity of the contract. The \nsanctity of the contract? Sanctity suggests holiness. If you read any \nof these contracts I have read and hear the terms of the mortgages \nthese people facing foreclosure had to deal with, there is nothing holy \nabout it. It was an unholy attempt to rip these people off, to put them \nin homes they could not afford under terms they never understood and \nthen let the market work. This is not about the sanctity of any \ncontract. When that bankruptcy court modifies your vacation condo \nmortgage, your farm mortgage, your ranch mortgage, they are modifying a \ncontract. What happened to the sanctity of the contract there? That \nbasic standard should apply when it comes to a person's home.\n  When we get to this bill later today, it will be a procedural motion. \nWe need 60 votes. It will be a face-off between the mortgage banking \nindustry, the people who brought us this subprime mess and those on \ntheir side with the Herbert Hoover mentality that says: Don't get \ninvolved; let it work out; in a year or two, it will all be behind us--\nand those who think we ought to stand up to allow people to stay in \ntheir homes, giving them a chance in court to modify their mortgage \nterms so they have a fighting chance to stay in their homes. I think \nthat is a basic American value.\n  I hope my colleagues in the Senate will come down on the side of \nthose families and on the side of bringing this housing crisis to a \nresolution in a responsible way.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n\n\n                   Report on Trip to the Middle East\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, in late November, Senator Inouye and I \ntraveled to the Middle East to assess the security situation there. I \nwant to share some of the insights from our travels, especially as they \nrelate to Iraq. We visited Tunisia, Iraq, and several other countries. \nWe met with senior U.S. State Department, intelligence, and military \nleaders regarding U.S. policy in Iraq, in the Middle East, and in \nEurope.\n  Our first stop was in Tunisia where we met with U.S. Ambassador \nRobert Godec and his staff regarding political, economic, and social \nconditions in Tunisia. Tunisia is a moderate Muslim country which has \nstrongly supported women's rights. The Tunisian economy has averaged \n5.6 percent growth each year, with an 80-percent level of home \nownership. It is a real democracy. The United States has a close \nworking relationship with Tunisia, including strong military-to-\nmilitary contacts. Tunisia straddles the Middle East, Europe, and \nAfrica, creating a strong interest in regional security issues, \nparticularly concerning Iraq. During our visit, we had many discussions \nabout the situation in Iraq and the possible impacts on the rest of the \nregion.\n  We have discussed many of these same issues with the Foreign Affairs \nSecretary of State Saida Chtioui and Minister of Defense Kamel Morjane. \nTunisia is interested in strengthening the foreign military financing \nrelationship with the United States. We call that FMF.\n  Before departing Tunisia, Senator Inouye and I presented a wreath at \nthe U.S. North Africa American Cemetery and Memorial in Tunis. There \nare 2,841 American servicemen who are buried in that cemetery. It was \nestablished in 1948 and covers 27 acres. It sits near the site of the \nancient Carthaginian city destroyed by the Romans in 146 B.C. and lies \nover part of the Roman city of Carthage. The cemetery is located in the \npart of Tunis that was liberated from the Germans by the British 1st \nArmy in May of 1943. We last visited that area with Senator Hollings, \nwho is now retired from the Senate. He made the landing there in World \nWar II. Many of the men who were interred there gave their lives in \nthose landings and in the occupation of Morocco and Algeria, and the \nsubsequent fighting which ultimately liberated Tunisia. Some have seen \nthose scenes in the recent movies that were shown of World War II. \nOthers involved there died as a result of accidents or sickness in \nNorth Africa or while serving in the Persian Gulf command in Iran. But \nI want to tell the Senate it is a very impressive sight and it is \ntouching to see how well that cemetery staff takes care of the \ncemetery. It is a United States military cemetery, and our visit to \nthat cemetery left Senator Inouye and me very humbled since we were \ninvolved in World War II ourselves.\n  We then traveled to Iraq, where we spent 2 days meeting with senior \nU.S. and Iraqi Government officials. We arrived at the Baghdad \nInternational Airport, formerly known as Saddam International Airport, \nwhich is located approximately 16 kilometers west of Baghdad. It has \nboth a civil international terminal and a smaller military ramp. The \nBaghdad International Airport is served by a class 1 runway of 13,000 \nfeet, and the military side has almost 9,000 feet. The military runway \nwas bombed by coalition aircraft and closed early in Operation Iraqi \nFreedom. The 1st Expeditionary RED HORSE Group and the 447th \nExpeditionary Civil Engineering Squadron helped repair the runway, and \nit is once again operational. It opened to commercial aircraft in 2003. \nIt can handle 7.5 million passengers a year. I tell the Senate that \nbecause it is partially back. I think that is what I am trying to tell \nthe Senate. Many things are returning to normal in various parts of \nIraq.\n  Baghdad International Airport has been refurbished as part of a $17.5 \nmillion contract to rebuild Iraqi airports in Baghdad, Basra, and \nMosul. This project is administered by the U.S. Agency for \nInternational Development.\n  Coalition forces began returning control of Baghdad International in \nJune of 2004 with the turnover of the air traffic control tower and \ncheckpoints. The process was concluded with the exchange of the main \ngate on August 25, 2004. Our major access to Baghdad is in civilian \ncontrol of Iraq now.\n  Upon arriving in Iraq, we traveled to the international zone formerly \nknown as the Green Zone. This area in central Baghdad houses most of \nthe city's diplomatic and Government buildings. Part of this area was \nSaddam Hussein's family playground, including the Presidential palace, \nwhich is now the U.S. Embassy annex, numerous villas for Saddam's \nfamily, friends, and former Baath party loyalists, along with an \nunderground bunker which reminds one of Hitler. We were informed it was \nalso the home to Saddam's man-eating lions, which have since been moved \nto Iraq's national zoo, I am happy to say.\n  Most of our briefings took place in the Presidential palace, which, \nas I said, is now part of the American Embassy. We discussed the \ncurrent situation in Iraq with U.S. Ambassador Ryan Crocker and his key \nstaff.\n  Let me tell the Senate a little bit about Ambassador Crocker. He is a \nmost impressive individual. He grew up in an Air Force family, attended \nschools in Morocco, Canada, Turkey, and the United States, and joined \nthe Foreign Service in 1971. Since those early years he has served in a \nvariety of hot spots around the world. His assignments have included \nIran, Qatar, Iraq, Egypt, as well as right here in Washington, DC. He \nalso served as U.S. Ambassador in Pakistan, Kuwait, Syria, and Lebanon. \nThis man has an impressive list of senior assignments during which he \nrepresented our country, and he is representing us very well now in \nIraq.\n  In January of 2002, Ambassador Crocker reopened the American Embassy \nin Kabul. In 2003, he served as the\n\n[[Page S1349]]\n\nfirst Director of Governance for the Coalition's Provisional Authority \nin Baghdad. He was subsequently confirmed by this Senate as our \nAmbassador to Iraq on March 7, 2007. We have here a true Middle Eastern \nexpert representing our Nation in this country.\n\n  Ambassador Crocker and General Petraeus are a great team. Their \npartnership serves our country well.\n  I was very impressed by that team and by the Department of State \nofficials working throughout Iraq. Whether serving in the Baghdad \nEmbassy or in numerous provisional reconstruction teams that are now \nknown as PRTs that are located throughout the country, they deserve \nmuch credit and they deserve our support. I was especially pleased with \nthe progress the PRTs have made over this past year. Their efforts are \nimportant to achieving our counterinsurgency strategy by bolstering \nmoderates, promoting reconciliation, fostering economic development, \nand building provincial capacity.\n  The PRT initiative is a civilian military interagency effort that \nserves as the primary interface between U.S. and coalition partners and \nprovisional and local governments throughout Iraq. They are helping \nIraq develop transparency and stable provisional governments by \npromoting increased security, the rule of law, political and economic \ndevelopment, and providing the provincial administration necessary to \nmeet the basic needs of the Iraqi population. Twenty-five PRTs serve \nall the provinces in Iraq. Ten full-sized teams stretching from Mosul \nin the north to Basra in the far south serve the majority of Iraqis. \nCoalition participation includes the British-led PRT in Basra, the \nItalian-led team in Dakar, and the Korean-led team in Erbil. The PRTs \nwork closely with U.S. and coalition military units to strengthen \nprovisional governments.\n  Ten of the twenty-five teams are the new ``embedded'' PRTs, as they \nare called. These civilian-led teams work hand in glove with the \nbrigade combat teams or the U.S. Marine regiments to support the surge \nin Anbar Province and in the greater Baghdad area.\n  Manning of these PRTs is diverse. Personnel represent our Department \nof State, USAID coalition, and the U.S. Department of Justice, the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture, the gulf region division of the Army Corps \nof Engineers, and our contract personnel. The office of Provincial \nAffairs within the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad provides the policy guidance \nand support to the overall PRT program. This program is one of the \nsignificant things we saw that has taken place in Iraq since the surge, \nand it has been very successful.\n  As part of the President's new way forward, PRT personnel doubled \nfrom 300 to over 600 team members countrywide by the end of last year. \nThe PRT's financial support comes from a variety of sources, including \ncoalition partners and donor nations, with the majority coming from the \nUnited States, of course. Principal programs associated with PRTs \ninclude the U.S.-funded community stabilization program, the provincial \nreconstruction development committee program, the local governance \nprogram, the civil society program, and the Inma agribusiness \nprogram,--by the way, Inma means growth in Arabic--amounts to progress. \nProgress has taken place as a result of the surge.\n  During our visit, it was announced that security conditions had \nimproved enough to allow the drawdown of U.S. combat troops from Diyala \nProvince. This was the first drawdown of combat forces since the surge \nbegan in 2007, and these forces will not be replaced. This redeployment \nwithout replacement reflects the overall improved security conditions \nwithin Iraq, improved capabilities of the Iraqi security forces, and \nthe increased participation of concerned local citizens. Improved \neconomic factors and declining tribal conflicts in the province have \nmade the drawdown possible. I think General Petraeus's ability to reach \nout to the tribal leaders has contributed greatly to what we have seen \nin terms of the progress being made in Iraq.\n  Diyala Province has been plagued by rampant corruption in the past. \nLeaders placed their ambitions ahead of the needs of the constituency. \nThere was a lack of food, water, electricity, and fuel, and residents \nviewed Iraqi security forces as sectarian. Tribal conflicts divided the \npopulation. We met with some of those forces. Iraqi security forces and \nthe government of Diyala Province worked diligently over the past 18 \nmonths to bring stability and services to that province. Acts of \nviolence have dropped in the past year by 50 percent alone. The surge \nenabled the coalition and Iraqi security forces to dominate the terrain \nand secure the population, allowing the government to function properly \nand to shift focus from defense to reconstruction and providing \nessential services. We saw progress. That is what I am trying to say. \nWe saw with our own eyes the progress that is taking place in Iraq \nsince the surge.\n  We met with Deputy Prime Minister Barham Salih and his staff and \npersonally stressed the importance of moving forward on the political \nreconciliation. The national Government must reconcile. We must keep in \nmind that Iraq's political system, though, is still in its early stages \nof development. Its leaders are trying to establish a government and \nresolve fundamental issues in the midst of continuing violence.\n  Iraqi leaders agree political progress can be improved. However, \nthere have been steps forward during the past several months. While the \nso-called benchmark legislation has been slow in terms of the national \nlegislature, I believe that actions will flow from the laws that have \nbeen passed and those that have already been enacted. Steps are already \nbeing taken. We were encouraged by the distribution of oil revenues \ndespite the absence of an agreement on the overall revenue-sharing law.\n  I don't know if the Senate knows it, but many people went from Alaska \nto talk about our basic concept in Alaska of our system of a general \nfund, a basic fund where we put aside 25 percent of all of our oil \nrevenue. That is our security for the future. We tried to convince Iraq \nto do something like that, and I am pleased to say they are going to do \nsomething like that. But they have a different circumstance, of course, \nsince they have so many differences between their provinces. But the \nconcept of working on a national basis to provide for a distribution of \noil revenues throughout the provinces is still proceeding.\n  We received an extensive briefing from General Petraeus and \nAmbassador Crocker on the impact of the recent military surge and the \ndeclining level of violence throughout the country. General Petraeus \nhighlighted the success our soldiers and their Iraqi partners have had \nin taking control of many sanctuaries from al-Qaida in Iraq and \ndisrupting extremist networks throughout the country. Since the surge \nof offensives began in June of last year, attacks and civilian deaths, \nwe were told, have decreased by 60 percent. I believe that is progress.\n\n  Iraqi security forces are having a greater impact on the battlefield. \nIn the last year, they have added over 100,000 new soldiers and police \nand increased their capabilities. Senator Inouye and I met with some of \nthe leaders of the Iraqi Army in Iraq and with heads of the police from \nsome of the areas. I am confident they were moving as quickly to \neliminate conflicts between their people, between the Sunnis and \nShiites, and between the various tribes. Most important was the new \nrole of tribal leaders in trying to bring about a peaceful situation \nwithin Iraq. In 2008, the Iraqis will add 30 additional battalions to \ncompensate for our reduction of about one-quarter of our combat forces \nby the end of July. In areas of Iraq, the atmosphere resembles the \nspring of 2003, where many communities were feeling liberated. This \ntime, they are feeling liberated from al-Qaida and the extremist \nelements that have come in after the defeat of Saddam Hussein.\n  In many provinces Iraqis are completely in charge. In some areas, in \nfact, there are no coalition forces there at all.\n  The rejection of al-Qaida and the military extremists has led to the \nrise of concerned local citizen groups, more than 75,000 strong, and \ncomprised of both Sunni and Shia volunteers. These groups are helping \nto secure their communities, provide intelligence on the enemy and \nreport improvised explosive devices, or IEDs, and weapons caches. You \nshould have heard some of the stories we heard about how citizens are\n\n[[Page S1350]]\n\ncoming forward to say where these caches are located and where the \nweapons are, because they have confidence in their own people, that \nthey are going to be in charge of their own security. This move has \nsaved the lives of countless Iraqi civilians and coalition soldiers.\n  We discussed the overall security situation throughout the country \nwith LTG Ray Odierno, Commander of the Multinational Corps, and his key \nstaff. This is a photo of the meeting we had with that staff. It was an \ninteresting briefing.\n  Since our visit, LTG Odierno has redeployed to Fort Hood, where he \nhas reassumed his responsibilities as the Commander of the 3rd Corps. \nHe is a very capable individual who I believe will be assigned to more \nsenior positions, and we will hear a lot from this officer in the \nfuture.\n  We flew to forward operating base Kalsu, south of Baghdad, where we \nmet with the commander of the 4th Brigade Combat Team of the 25th \nInfantry Division, COL Michael Garrett, and his senior staff. This is a \nphoto the Senator and I had taken with him. Colonel Garret impressed us \nwith his leadership and insights into the complexities of his mission. \nThis 3,600-soldier brigade is home-stationed at Fort Richardson, AK. \nThat also gave us a good reason for visiting with them. We were \nimpressed with what they are doing.\n  This 4/25th brigade was preparing to rotate back to Alaska. They \nserved in Iraq for 15 months, from September 2006 to December 2007.\n  Two years ago, there was no 4th Brigade Combat Team, Airborne, in the \n25th Infantry Division, or in Alaska. Colonel Garrett and the corps of \nhis paratroopers grew it from a battalion to a robust airborne brigade, \nand they deployed to Iraq after it had been literally put together in \nAlaska.\n  The brigade was headquartered at forward operation base Kalsu, in Al-\nHillah Province, but also worked in Babil, Karbala, and Najaf \nProvinces. I am not sure I like the way my helmet looks in this photo. \nSenator Inouye took his off before the photo. It was an interesting \nmeeting under a tent with Army soldiers deployed in the field.\n  Unfortunately, 53 of the 4/25th made the ultimate sacrifice while \nvaliantly serving America in Iraq. We in Alaska will always remember \nthem. I can tell you that along with all Alaskans we have expressed our \nlove, admiration, and honor for their service and are doing our best to \nmake sure their survivors are well cared for.\n  The 1st Brigade Combat Team, Stryker, of the 25th Infantry Division \nalso spent 15 months serving in and around Mosul. They returned home to \nFort Wainwright, AK, at the end of 2006. By all accounts, they did a \ntremendous job providing security in that region of Iraq. They were led \nby COL Mike Shields, a very capable and talented leader.\n  We also met with senior Iraqi military and police officials from Al-\nHillah Province. They agreed the security situation in this province is \nmuch improved, with the number of attacks significantly down. The \nmayor, army, and police leaders had a close working relationship with \nthe Alaskan-based brigade.\n  Before departing Iraq, we asked to see a Mine-Resistant Ambush-\nProtected vehicle, an MRAP. I had a photograph taken of it as I left \nthis vehicle. It carries 6 passengers and weighs 16,000 pounds. It is \nthe smaller and lighter version of MRAP variants and is designed for \nurban operations. This is the new protection for our forces. It is a \ncategory 1 vehicle used by our soldiers and marines in Iraq for mounted \npatrols, reconnaissance, and direct interaction with the civilian \npopulation. This is protecting our forces from the threat of IEDs, and \nthis has saved many lives since its deployment. To date, we have \nfielded 2,317 of these MRAP vehicles in Iraq and Afghanistan. We are in \nthe process of adding 9,000 or more by the end of this year, which I \nhope will be the end of the war. Anyway, these vehicles are good news \nand this shows what our country can do in a short period of time. Those \nother military vehicles did not have the level of protection as MRAPs. \nThis is a survivable vehicle. I think the Senate should be \ncongratulated for moving rapidly to get the money up and get the \nprogram up. I congratulate Senators Warner and Levin for their support \nin this regard.\n  We have worked together with the Appropriations Committee and Armed \nServices to make sure these vehicles were supported and delivered in \nthe shortest time in history. They were originally flown directly to \nIraq. Now that significant numbers are coming off the production line, \nthey are now going over by ship. These are the most successful vehicles \nfor urban warfare we have ever had. We need them there. I think they \nwill be largely responsible for completing the operations we have to \nfinish in Iraq.\n  I have taken a little more time than I thought I would. But the \nreason for my report is that my personal conclusion, from what I saw \nand heard, was that the surge has worked. There is still work to be \ndone and still support we have to give these people in the field. This \nis no time to consider a withdrawal from Iraq under the conditions such \nas the Russians withdrew from Afghanistan. I urge those who have any \nthought of such a withdrawal, a mandated withdrawal, to look at the \nhistory of the Russian withdrawal from Afghanistan. It was one of the \nmost costly in history in terms of the deaths of the Russian soldiers \nwho were trying to get out of that country. They turned around and \nliterally fled from the country under difficult circumstances, where \nthey were ordered out by their political masters without regard to the \nsafety of the people involved. I will not participate in such a \nwithdrawal. If we withdraw, it must be because we have finished the job \nand the Iraqi military and police forces can take responsibility for \ntheir own security.\n  As Israel has done for so many years, I believe Iraq will come to be \nable to defend itself. We have to stay the course in order to do that. \nThe people who were lost there deserve for us to finish the job.\n\n\n                    47th anniversary of peace corps\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, this week we mark the 47th anniversary of \nthe U.S. Peace Corps and I ask the Senate to recognize the men and \nwomen who represent the best of America and volunteer to serve those \nless fortunate around the world.\n  Since its inception in 1961, 190,000 volunteers have served in 139 \ncountries. You may be aware our colleague Senator Dodd served in the \nDominican Republic in 1968.\n  My good friend and associate in law practice, Jack Roderick, took his \nfamily to India to serve as the Peace Corps regional director in 1967 \nand 1968. Jack tells me that, like many volunteers, he feels he got \nmore out his experience than he could have ever given.\n  His two daughters were 11 and 13 at the time and they attended Indian \nschools and learned to speak Hindi. The experience changed their lives.\n  The 1,000 volunteers Jack worked with in India faced many health \nrisks due to the difficult living conditions. But they were committed \nto the mission of the Peace Corps and worked with the people of India \nto improve the country's agricultural production.\n  Today, 36 Peace Corps volunteers from Alaska are working in countries \naround the world including Mongolia, Uganda, Ecuador, Romania and \nCambodia. They work directly with the people of these countries and \nhelp improve education and develop small businesses. They work with \nsmall farmers to increase food production and teach environmental \nconservation practices. They fight malnutrition and help provide safe \ndrinking water. They fight the spread of HIV/AIDS and assist people \naffected by this disease which is devastating many developing nations.\n  When these volunteers return home to Alaska they share their unique \nexperiences and perspectives with their communities and help expand our \nunderstanding of places which for many of us are just a name on a map.\n  A member of my staff, Ray Sorensen, spent 2 years in Haiti with the \nPeace Corps. Since he returned he has enjoyed visiting elementary \nschools and sharing stories, photos and Haitian music with students. \nThis type of cultural exchange provides students with an understanding \nnot available from their textbooks.\n  The objective of the Peace Corps is to eventually work itself out of \na job. We all hope for the day when there is no need to fight against \npoverty and disease and all nations enjoy the prosperity with which we \nare blessed. Until that time, we should support the men and women of \nour Peace Corps and the good work they do around the world.\n\n[[Page S1351]]\n\n  I congratulate the Peace Corps on its 47th anniversary and wish it \ncontinued success.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business and to take such time as required for myself, Senators \nHagel, Warner, and Lautenberg to discuss the reintroduction of S. 22, \nthe GI bill legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska). Without objection, it \nis so ordered.\n  Mr. President, my first day in office in the Senate, I introduced \nlegislation that we had worked on from the time of my election through \nthe interim period, before I was sworn in as a Senator, that would \naddress a true inequity in terms of how we are rewarding military \nservice.\n  The legislation was designed to provide a level of educational \nbenefits for those who have been serving since 9/11 that would be equal \nto the service they have given. The way that would be measured would be \nfor us to do the best we could to shape legislation that pretty much \nmirrored the benefits that those who came back from World War II \nreceived.\n  I am very pleased today to be reintroducing this legislation with \nrefinements that we have been able to gain through 14 months of \ndiscussions with all people who work in this area, and to also mention \nthat we have new and very important lead cosponsorship as well. As of \ntoday, we will now have 35 sponsors in the Senate for this piece of \nlegislation, plus we will have the full national support of the major \nveterans organizations, including the Veterans of Foreign Wars, The \nAmerican Legion, the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, the \nMilitary Officers Association of America, and other veterans groups. I \nwill also point out that the combined veterans organizations, when they \nmade their proposals to the Veterans' Committee about what the veterans \nbudget should look like--the so-called independent budget that is put \ntogether every year--included a policy proposal for legislation that \nhas all of these pieces in it.\n  I am very pleased and excited at where we are right now on this piece \nof legislation. I am very gratified to have with us on the floor today \nSenator Chuck Hagel who, in October, became the lead cosponsor on the \nRepublican side, and Senator John Warner, who has agreed to be a lead \ncosponsor, both of whom I have known for many years. I wish to say a \nlittle bit about that and also ask that they join me in discussing \nwhere we need to go on this.\n  I have known Senator Chuck Hagel for 30 years. We both came up into \nGovernment together, working on veterans issues. We are the only two \nground combat veterans from Vietnam to be serving in the Senate. We \nhave worked on many issues over the years and have worked together on, \nI think, some very important efforts last year in trying to bring some \nsense into the rotational cycles that have been ongoing with respect to \nthe occupation of Iraq and the war in Afghanistan.\n  I first was able to serve under Senator John Warner when I was a 25-\nyear-old marine, my last year in the Marine Corps, when he was Under \nSecretary of the Navy, and then as Secretary of the Navy. He was \ninstrumental in helping me as I left the Marine Corps, moving on to \nother parts of my life. I was privileged to follow Senator Warner--not \nonly into the Marine Corps, but also into the position of Secretary of \nthe Navy during the Reagan administration, and I am very proud to be \nserving with him as the junior Senator from Virginia.\n  I think that Senator Hagel, Senator Warner, Senator Lautenberg, who \nis a World War II veteran who benefited from the GI bill, are all an \nindication of the will and the heart of the people who know what it is \nlike to step forward and have to serve their country, when it comes to \ntrying to reach a proper reward for service, and to assist those who \nhave stepped forward to serve our country into the most meaningful \nfuture that they can obtain. This bill does that. We have listened to \nthe veterans groups. We have listened to other colleagues about the \ndifferent pieces of legislation they have. We have incorporated a \nprovision in here at the suggestion of Senator Lincoln of Arkansas that \nis a very good provision that will assist those in the National Guard \nand Reserve to have a meaningful GI bill for their service.\n\n  So this is legislation that I believe is ready to go and, as I said, \nwe are reintroducing it today with 35 sponsors. I am very hopeful that \nour body and the other body can pass this legislation this year. This \nis the kind of bill where time really matters because educational \nbenefits pursuant to military service are a transitional benefit. They \nare designed to assist people when they readjust from military life \nback into civilian life. Those who have been serving since 9/11 have \nbeen leaving the military as their enlistment expires, and they need \nthis type of benefit.\n  I am hopeful, again, that we can move this bill forward swiftly.\n  I yield to the Senator from Nebraska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague, Senator \nWebb, for his generous comments and for his leadership in writing and \ninitially introducing this legislation. I also thank my friend and \ncolleague, Senator Warner from Virginia. As has been noted by the \njunior Senator from Virginia, the senior Senator from Virginia has had \nmany years of important experience. He has contributed many years of \nservice in many capacities to this country. When you take the service \nof the two Senators from Virginia together, it is a remarkable story. I \nam privileged to join them, as well as over 30 of our colleagues, and a \ndistinguished Senator in his own right and World War II veteran, \nSenator Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey.\n  We all share similar experiences in our service to our country, but \nmost of the veterans in the Senate, and I suspect in the House of \nRepresentatives, also share the common experience of using the GI bill \nwhich was enacted after World War II to educate a generation of \nAmericans who changed the world, who transformed the world.\n  I put the GI bill in the same universe of importance as the original \nHomestead Act enacted in the early 1860s which truly transformed this \ncountry. I think the original GI bill did much the same.\n  What Senator Webb is talking about, what Senator Warner, Senator \nLautenberg, and others are committed to is a relevant new GI bill that \naddresses the challenges of the 21st century. We in this country not \nonly appreciate, but revere, the service of our military, and that is \nas it should be. These are selfless men and women who have committed \nthemselves to a higher cause than any other cause, and that is the \ndefense of their Nation, defense of their fellow Americans. They ask \nnothing in return. Each generation of Americans who has fought for this \ncountry, who has served in uniform has never expected anything in \nreturn because they have considered it a privilege to serve this \ncountry in uniform.\n  But one of the reasons the GI bill was first enacted after World War \nII was to reinvest in our country, to reinvest using the loyalty, \ncommitment, and resources of Americans to even go further and do even \nmore for this country and society in the world. Education does that. An \nimportant foundational element in the history of the country over the \nlast 200 years, as any other, has been public education. It has been \npublic education. It is the tradition of our country, not just to \nreward service, to acknowledge service, but be smart about that service \nand reinvest in our society. That is essentially what this is. This is \nreinvesting in our society. It is assuring that those who have given so \nmuch to our country have an opportunity to develop skill sets in \neducation to compete in the most competitive world history has ever \nknown, to go beyond expectations, go beyond what is possible. This is \nnot just a payback or reward.\n  I wish to make a couple of general comments about the bill that I \nthink not only are appropriate but need to be addressed. I have noted \nthat there have been some who have questioned the need for this bill \nwhen we have a current GI bill which was authored by a friend of \neveryone in this body, a distinguished American who left us last year, \nthe late chairman of the House Veterans' Affairs Committee with whom \nSenator Webb worked, Congressman Sonny Montgomery from Mississippi.\n  On a personal note, it is because of Congressman Montgomery I met my\n\n[[Page S1352]]\n\nwife who was working for Congressman Montgomery at the time.\n  In the early 1980s, he took the reality and the need of our time and \nthe relevancy of this bill, the GI bill in law, and made it appropriate \nto what the circumstances were 25 years ago. We are in a different \nplace in the world today. We are engaged in two wars. We have 190,000 \ntroops in those two wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. We have new \npressures, new challenges, and new opportunities. So it is appropriate \nto readdress this issue that has played such an important role in \neducating our veterans and investing and reinvesting in this country \nand in society.\n  This does not displace or replace any other educational program. \nToday, the largest grant aid program the Federal Government sponsors is \nthe Pell Grant Program, an important program. I believe most all of us \non the floor of the Senate support that program. I surely do. It is a \nprogram based on financial need, and it is appropriate. It is one area \nin which I happen to believe the Federal Government can play a role, a \nmeaningful role. It gives these Pell grant awardees some options.\n  Just as what we are addressing today, we need to ensure that these \npeople who have sacrificed for this country are given the same kind of \noptions that other programs in the past have allowed.\n  Senator Lautenberg will talk about that issue. Senator Warner will \ntalk about that issue. This program needs to be updated and upgraded.\n\n  I mention the cost issue because it is an appropriate issue at a time \nwhen we are running $400 billion deficits. But I remind everyone here, \nMr. President, that we are spending approximately $15 billion a month \non war--two wars. We are getting to nearly $1 trillion spent on two \nwars over the last 7 years. Surely we can find the resources necessary \nto upgrade and update the requirements for a 21st-century country as it \nrelates to our veterans.\n  I want to also address one other issue that I have heard from some \nwho say: Senator, if we do this, if we go forward with this program and \nmodernize the GI bill, wouldn't it undermine our recruitment and \nretention efforts? That is an interesting question, again, a relevant \nquestion. You recognize the fact that, first, we have an all-voluntary \nservice, so people have choices. We want the finest, brightest, most \ncapable young men and women we can find, and we have been able to do \nthat over the last 25 years--build the best trained, best educated, \nbest led, best equipped, most motivated force in the history of man. \nBut we are on the edge of ruining that force structure.\n  Why do I say that? The Chief of Staff appeared before the Senate \nArmed Services Committee for the last 2 days. In order for the Army to \ncontinue to recruit enough manpower to fight in two wars, as well as \nthe other obligations, we have had to define down the standards of the \nU.S. Army--waiving criminal records, waiving drug records, waiving high \nschool diplomas, and high school equivalence in order to attract enough \npeople.\n  In addition to that, we have put hundreds of millions of dollars of \nlarge incentive bonuses on the table, $40,000 at a time, for \nreenlistment and for signup bonuses, plus the promise of down payments \nfor houses. So we are already in the marketplace for competing with \nyoung men and women to serve this country.\n  Isn't it far better to invest in education? Isn't it far better to \ngive these young men and women more educational opportunities if they \ndecide or when they decide to leave the service after they have served \nthis country in an honorable way? Isn't that more important in many \nways to recycle that commitment and loyalty and talent into a new \ninvestment in education that will serve these young men and women far \nlonger than a $40,000 bonus? Far more.\n  I think just the opposite. I think it enhances recruitment. I think \nthis enhances the quality of our service. I think this helps us get \nback to defining our standards up. No institution can long survive when \nit defines its standards down. There will be a consequence for that, \nand we are seeing that consequence today, as I think General Casey made \nvery clear in his comments before the Senate Armed Services Committee.\n  In conclusion, I am very proud to be part of this effort. I am, like \nmy colleagues, hopeful the Senate and the House and the administration \nwill act on this bill this year. It is, as Senator Webb noted, a \ntimely, important, and critical issue for our country and our force \nstructure.\n  I will continue to do everything I can to be part of that effort and \nwork hard to that end.\n  Again, I very much appreciate the leadership of Senators Webb, \nWarner, Lautenberg, and others who have brought this bill forward.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am hopeful to join in the debate. I see \nmy colleague from New Jersey. Does he have a pressing matter? I can \nwait until he completes his remarks, if that will help him.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, this is what happens when we get on \nthe floor of the Senate and longtime friends meet. I defer to the \ndistinguished Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. President, I have looked forward to this moment. This is a \nspecial day for me in many respects. But, first and foremost, what a \nprivilege it is to stand on this floor with three magnificent combat \nveterans--my colleague and dear friend of 35 years, Jim Webb; Frank \nLautenberg of New Jersey, and my good friend from Nebraska, Chuck \nHagel--all of these three gentlemen are combat veterans. Two were \nawarded the Purple Heart. My military career was far more modest.\n  I would also like to thank the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, \nparticularly its chairman and ranking member Senator Akaka and Senator \nBurr for their leadership on behalf of our veterans. I look forward to \nworking with them on this initiative.\n  And finally I just want to say thank you to all who have been working \non this bill, particularly to Jim Webb, who led the effort, drawing on \nhis experience as a young marine officer in Vietnam; as Assistant \nSecretary of Defense, explicitly assigned to the affairs of the Reserve \nand Guard units; and then in a position that we both shared as \nSecretary of the Navy. All of that experience he draws on to bring \nforth this bill and to lead this effort. Your career in the Senate, I \nthink, will be marked by many successes, but this will be one of the \nfoundations of that success. I say to my colleague that you will always \nlook back upon this accomplishment with a humble sense of pride knowing \nthat you ``led the charge.''\n  I am very optimistic that we will prevail with this legislation. \nThere may be challenges, but we will prevail. We will prevail because \nit is the right thing to do.\n  I also want to say thank you to my country that gave me an education, \nfor my modest periods of service in World War II in the Navy and \nservice in the Marines during the Korean war. It was not as valorous as \nthe careers of the sponsors and cosponsors joining in this debate.\n  Mr. President, I am grateful to have been the recipient of two GI \nbills and I wouldn't be standing here today--it is as simple as that, \nhad it not been for the GI bill. Three months after I was discharged \nfrom the Navy, my father died. He was a very wonderful, successful \nmedical doctor. He had served in World War I in the trenches in France \nas a medical doctor, caring for the wounded. I mention that only \nbecause I am not sure I would have had the means within our family \nstructure to go on and receive higher education without the GI bill.\n\n  The original GI Bill of Rights was enacted in 1944, and in successive \nCongresses they made changes to it. But the key to the bill that the \ntwo of us from World War II--Senator Lautenberg and myself--is that our \ngroup of veterans could go to any college or university of his choice, \nsubject to academic or admission requirements. I want to repeat that. \nThere wasn't a college or university in the United States to which they \ncould not attend, for the GI bill covered the full tuition costs of all \ninstitutions of higher education. Today's GI bill, largely through the \nefforts of Sonny Montgomery, a dear friend whom we all value, simply \ndoes not have the financial provisions to enable young men and women of \nthis generation to go to any campus they desire. There are low caps on \nthe\n\n[[Page S1353]]\n\namount of tuition the current GI bill will cover. And so we have \ncarefully structured in this bill the opportunity for institutions of \nhigher learning to step up and share in this program.\n  I would like to briefly outline the sharing provision. Under this \nlegislation, the full basic educational benefit will allow GIs who have \nhonorably served to have the full cost of tuition covered at any public \ncollege or university in their home State of residence. Veterans will \nalso be given a monthly stipend tied to the Department of Defense's \ngeographic rate for housing, and a small stipend for books. For \nveterans who choose to attend a private college or university--or an \nout-of-State public college or university--admittedly, this basic \nbenefit might not cover the full costs of tuition. Thus, this bill will \nprovide an educational enhancement for veterans who complete at least \n36 months of honorable active duty service. The Federal Government will \nmatch--dollar for dollar--any additional financial contributions \nprivate and public colleges and universities voluntarily contribute \ntoward their respective tuition costs. We believe that many \ninstitutions of higher learning will participate in this concept, thus \nvastly increasing the educational choices for veterans, commensurate \nwith the choices that World War II veterans received.\n  Mr. President, we talk a lot about academic freedom. It is one of the \nmost cherished things we have in this country. It is a part of the \nfundamental system of higher education. With that academic freedom, \nfrom campuses all across this country, have come great ideas, great \ninspiration, and solutions which have helped this Nation structure \nitself as the strongest and most powerful in the world today. But that \nacademic freedom comes at a price. And much of that price is borne by \nthe young men and women today of the all-volunteer force who go \nforward, raise their right hand, and assume all the risks associated \nwith military service and preserving our freedom.\n  Educators should stop to think about that. It is important that \ninstitutions of higher learning, when possible, have as a part of a \nstudent body, young men and women who have proudly worn the uniform of \nthis generation. And this bill puts forward a financial structure for \nthe sharing of tuition costs. I was privileged to go to two schools in \nmy State: Washington and Lee University and the University of Virginia. \nOne a private institution, the other a public institution. But most of \nthe private institutions today, fortunately because of their \nextraordinary standing and achievements, have tuition rates which \ncannot be met by a GI completing honorable service and relying on the \ncurrent GI bill tuition caps.\n  This bill enables a voluntary, I repeat voluntary, cost sharing \nbetween the U.S. Government and the academic institution. I think we \nowe no less to the preservation of academic freedom at these schools, \nthat freedom being guarded by the young men and women who seek \nadmission, and who have honorably served this Nation. Therefore, if a \nGI has the requisite academic credentials for admission--we are not \nasking that any special exception or deviation should be done by these \nschools.\n  These valiant men and women deserve nothing less than our full \nmeasure of support and unending gratitude for their service and \nsacrifice. A GI bill for the 21st century, to provide educational \nbenefits for uniformed personnel who are sacrificing so much to \npreserve our freedom, is the least we can do.\n  So in closing, Mr. President, I say thank you. I have so much, \nindividually, to be thankful for. Simply stated, I would not be a U.S. \nSenator today had it not been for the GI bill of World War II and \nKorea. I want the same opportunity for the current and future \ngenerations of ``fighters for our freedom.''\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, first, I wish to say how proud I am to \nbe on the floor with my three colleagues who are sponsoring this, with \nSenator Webb as the lead sponsor on this very important legislation. \nSenator Warner and I kind of outrank the others in terms of when it is \nthat we served. I point out that we have two commissioned officers here \nand we have two noncommissioned officers. Senator Hagel, I think, \noutranked me. I was a corporal.\n  I am so pleased to be here with my colleagues. I got an undeserved \ncredit because it was said I was a combat veteran. Well, I served in \nthe combat theater, and my job was to climb telephone poles while the \nbombing was going on in Belgium. I would not say there were the same \ndangers as someone on the line, but people got hurt and worse doing \nwhat I was doing. But I want to clear the record because I didn't carry \na rifle. I carried a carbine, which is a lot smaller weapon, and, \nfortunately, I didn't have a chance to fire it. But it wasn't fired at \nme either.\n  I look at what we are doing here and think about what it means to \nthose who are serving and what it meant to me in my life. My parents \nwere brought to America when they were infants, but they were people \nwho would be classified as blue-collar people--no education but wanted \nto work hard. Honesty was constantly preached: Be mindful of your \nresponsibility to others, do whatever you can, work as hard as you can.\n  When I got out of high school, I got a job loading milk trucks. \nBecause going to war was imminent, I enlisted when I was 18. I served \nwith 16 million other people in uniform at that time.\n  We used to talk about college around the dinner table, when we had \ndinner together, and my parents would say you have to get an education. \nMy father took me into the mill he worked in when I was 12 years old. \nHe said: I want you to see what it is like. It was a textile factory in \nPaterson, NJ, an industrial city. As we walked in the building, he \nsaid: Do you hear the noise? The whole building would vibrate. And I \nsaid: Yes, Dad. And he took me up to the machine he operated. It was a \nbig old machine with a wheel that converted fibers into fabric. He \nsaid: You see how dirty it is here? Yes, Dad. He said: Do you see how \ndark it is? Yes, Dad. And he took my hand and he rubbed it across the \nsilk fibers he was working on, and it left a film. He said: You see \nthat? That is bad for you.\n  My father, when he did that with me, was 37 years old. Six years \nlater, he was dead. Cancer that developed occupationally. My \ngrandfather worked in the same place. And not unlike those who worked \nin the coal mine or some other place, my grandfather was 56 when he \ndied.\n  So for me, being in the military was a responsibility that I \nwillingly took on. My friends, my neighbors, we all did it. The future \nwas not particularly bright. But then, when all of that was finished, I \nhad a chance to go to a university. And Senator Warner, with his usual \ngrace, he said that you could go to any school you wanted. I don't know \nthat it wasn't just the recognition that we needed financial help, but \nI think there might have been a little give also on the standards that \nyou had to meet. I don't know that in today's world we would have fared \nquite as well. I was lucky enough to go to Columbia University. They \nwelcomed me. And I stood there in amazement when I graduated because \nnone other than GEN Dwight Eisenhower handed me my diploma. He was then \nthe President of Columbia University. I was a little upset that he \ndidn't recognize me. We had both served in Europe. I didn't understand \nwhy he didn't say: Hello, Frank.\n  It was exciting to be in a university--exciting to know that somehow \nor other I was not only going to be able to help myself, I was going to \nbe able to help my widowed mother and my kid sister and be something \ndifferent than still loading milk trucks in Clifton, NJ. I was excited \nbecause not only did I learn subjects--statistics and finance and the \nkinds of things one learns at business school, in particular--but also \nI learned there was a different way of life; that there was something \nyou could do besides standing with my folks when they had to buy a \nstore because the mills closed. I learned you didn't have to live in \ncramped quarters and that maybe there was something else out there you \ncould do.\n  So when I look at what we are talking about today, I am particularly \nmotivated to see that with the leadership of Senator Webb and with the \nhelp of the three of us, that we get this legislation through. We know \nwhen there is a debate here and it gets to veterans'\n\n[[Page S1354]]\n\nsupport, usually that quiets the troubled waters and we talk to one \nanother, almost civilly at times, and we gather support from one \nanother and are encouraged. We might feel differently about which \nprograms ought to get more funding, but we are all concerned about the \nmedical care, the post-service conditions that come up like post-\ntraumatic stress disorder. And when we read stories about service \npeople who get so distraught that they destroy their lives, that is \noften a sign of the kind of stress and the kind of trauma that people \nhave been left with after they serve. So when we look at this \nlegislation's opportunity, it is consistent with our need to show our \nrespect and gratitude to the people who serve and who served in a war \nthat is far longer and more vicious than anyone ever dreamed it might \nbe.\n  Because in previous wars, and the war that Senator Warner and I \nserved in, it was not the case that your enemy wanted to give their \nlife and thusly would not be frightened off by anything you do. Their \nprinciple was to destroy the enemy. In the current war, the enemy is \nwilling to destroy itself to destroy us. So the kind of violence that \nhas been exhibited in this war is different than in any other war. \nVietnam was the place where it was learned that people would die for a \ncause, but it was not like this war where people want to die. So \nconditions are different.\n  So here it is, very simply put: There are scholarship assistance \nprograms like the Montgomery bill which provides 38,000 dollars' worth \nof support for education, for the cost of maintaining one's self, as \nwell as room and board. But the average cost of a public education \ntoday is $51,000.\n  Well, it still is significant when someone graduates college with \nhuge debt, and typically they are relatively young, wanting to start a \nfamily, wanting to get going in life. So it is simple math. Many of our \nveterans just cannot make up the difference and thusly are denied a \ncollege education. So this has real consequences.\n  People with a college degree earn nearly double the salary of those \nwho do not have one. We have got to close the gap between the current \ncost of college and the amount that the GI bill pays for. Remember, \nAmerica built something that was called and supported as the ``greatest \ngeneration.'' Now, why, with all the technology, with all of the \nrichness this country has, with all of the talent this country has, can \nwe not create another ``greatest generation''? We should move on that. \nThere is only one way to get there, and that is to provide the ladder \nup to that success. You have got to take the first step. The first step \nis to make sure you get as much education as your mind and your body \nand your will can handle.\n  So when we look at what we owe to or can do for these veterans, to \nme, this is the ideal thing. I would hope that whatever party, however \nhigh the seniority is, that we all get together on this one and say: \nVeterans, we appreciate those of you who served, who left your \nfamilies, in service. I was at Fort Dix, a major base in the State of \nNew Jersey, for people who were going to deploy or be deployed back in \nIraq. Many of them have served months already. These were not people \nwho were living on a base where there was a culture to accompany their \nfamilies, where there was a clinic, where there were schools, where \nthere were libraries. They were in towns, they were paying their \nexpenses, they have mortgages to deal with.\n  This is a time to say: We owe you something. We owe you something \nbig. We are going to make it up to you. I encourage all of my \ncolleagues to support this legislation. Join us in giving something \nback to our veterans that really stands out, that shows a lasting bit \nof gratitude for the valiant service that all of them have put in to \nserve their country.\n  I congratulate my colleagues for their effort, and Senator Webb for \nhis leadership. And I hope we will see success.\n\n\n                       Honoring our Armed Forces\n\n              petty officer third class jeffrey l. wiener\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise to speak for a son of Kentucky \nwho journeyed to Iraq to save the lives of his fighting brethren, only \nto tragically lose his own. On May 7, 2005, PO3 Jeffrey L. Wiener of \nLouisville, KY, died in combat operations near a hospital in western \nIraq. The hospital corpsman was 32 years old.\n  ``My son was a hero and died doing what he loved, helping people no \nmatter who they were,'' says Jeffrey's mother, Diana Wiener. An \nemergency medical technician in civilian life, Petty Officer Third \nClass Wiener dedicated himself to healing others.\n  For his bravery in uniform, Petty Officer Third Class Wiener received \nnumerous medals and awards, including the Purple Heart and the Navy and \nMarine Corps Achievement Medal.\n  Jeffrey moved to Kentucky later in life, after growing up in \nLynbrook, NY. He settled on his life's calling at an early age and \nbegan volunteering with the local fire department at 13.\n  Always helpful, Jeffrey eagerly assisted everyone at the firehouse \nwith any task. What little free time he had left when not volunteering \nwent to the school wrestling team. Jeffrey graduated from Lynbrook High \nSchool.\n  As an adult, Jeffrey worked in New York's Nassau County EMS and \nserved as captain of a volunteer fire department. Jeffrey was committed \nto his profession as a paramedic and constantly pursued the latest \ntraining activities.\n  Jeffrey eventually settled in Louisville, moving to help his mother \nraise his younger brother David. He got a job with Jefferson County EMS \nand made an immediate impact on his new friends and coworkers.\n  Jeffrey ``was always real gung-ho, straightforward, no beating around \nthe bush,'' says John Cooney, a Louisville paramedic who partnered with \nJeffrey. ``That was his demeanor.''\n  Jeffrey proved his value in short order when he suggested to his \nsupervisor that the Louisville paramedics use something called a Reeves \nstretcher, which is more maneuverable in tight quarters than the \nstandard carrying board. Jeffrey was familiar with it from his time in \nNew York.\n  Jeffrey's supervisor agreed and put him in charge of training \neveryone on the new device. Major Rockey Johnson, Jeffrey's supervisor, \ntold family and friends gathered at a memorial service for Jeffrey that \nto this day the Louisville paramedics call the device ``the Wiener \nboard.''\n  After the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, Jeffrey was moved \nto serve his country in uniform, and joined the U.S. Navy Reserve in \n2002. He then underwent special training to become a hospital corpsman.\n  The Navy hospital corpsman is a respected and revered position in our \nArmed Forces, and the most decorated rating in the U.S. Navy. Hospital \ncorpsmen are often attached to Marine units and are trained to handle \nemergency medical procedures near the front lines of battle. For the \nman who had been eager to heal since age 13, it was the perfect \nmission.\n  Jeffrey was assigned to the II Marine Expeditionary Force and \ndeployed to Iraq. ``He took care of his troops,'' says LT John Rudd, a \nNavy chaplain who served with Jeffrey.\n  Jeffrey made friends with his fellow sailors as easily as he had with \ncoworkers in Louisville or New York. One fellow corpsman, who hailed \nfrom Lexington, KY, knew Jeffrey but couldn't remember his name. \nJeffrey told him to call him ``Louie,'' because he was from Louisville.\n  Hospital corpsmen are often affectionately called ``Doc'' by the \nMarines they serve alongside, and Jeffrey soon earned the nickname \n``Doc Wiener.''\n  As much as Jeffrey relished the opportunity to serve, he dearly \nmissed his family. Jeffrey married his high school sweetheart, Maria, \nin 1998, and together they raised two beautiful daughters, Mikayla and \nTheadora.\n  Jeffrey's older brother Joshua also served in Iraq and was there when \nJeffrey arrived. Today, Joshua is in the Marine Forces Reserve and a \nfireman in New York City.\n  Jeffrey's younger brother David is also a marine and currently on his \nsecond deployment.\n  Jeffrey was looking forward to what life would hold for him and Maria \nwhen he left active service. He was considering continuing his EMS \nwork, or going to the Department of Homeland Security. And many in his \nfamily believe his true calling was to become a doctor.\n  Jeffrey was buried in Calverton National Cemetery in Calverton, NY, \non\n\n[[Page S1355]]\n\nMay 16, 2005. Many friends from the Navy and the fire departments and \nEMS departments he had worked in over the years attended. Jeffrey was \nposthumously promoted to the rating of Hospital Corpsman Second Class.\n  I know I speak for all of my colleagues when I say our prayers go to \nthe Wiener family for their terrible loss. We are thinking today of his \nwife Maria; his daughters Mikayla and Theadora; his mother Diana; his \nfather Wayne; his brothers Joshua and David; his sisters Wendi, \nJessica, and Delayne; the Barberio family; and many other beloved \nfamily members and dear friends.\n  ``Jeffrey's desire to serve in the military was prompted by his \ndesire to be a part of bringing peace,'' says his mother, Diana.\n  Mr. President, no one can doubt Jeffrey Wiener's compassion after he \nchose to dedicate himself from an early age to relieving the suffering \nof others.\n  And no one can doubt his bravery after he donned his uniform and \nvolunteered to tend to our fighting forces in Iraq.\n  This Senate is humbled by PO3 Jeffrey L. Wiener's service and \nsacrifice. His family and friends are blessed for knowing him in life. \nAnd his State and Nation are stronger for his efforts in freedom's \ncause.\n\n\n                    Louisville Sculptor Ed Hamilton\n\n  For more than 30 years, Americans have set aside one month every year \nto remember in a special way the contributions of African Americans to \nour national life. Black History Month has its roots in an old February \ntradition of celebrating the life and work of Frederick Douglass, the \ngreat writer and abolitionist. But its expansion over the years has \ngiven us an opportunity to recall the many other Black men and women \nwhose personalities enliven our Nation's history but whose stories were \noften overlooked by those who recorded it.\n  Today, Black History Month is also an occasion to draw attention to \noutstanding African Americans of our own day--people like Ed Hamilton, \none of America's great artists I and one of Kentucky's favorite sons.\n  As a boy growing up on Walnut Street in Louisville, Ed learned the \nvalue of hard work and the importance of family from his Dad, a \nbusinessman and a World War I vet. And from his Mom, he learned to \nthink big. ``You can do anything,'' she always said. And so, roller-\nskating around the tight-knit neighborhood around the Hamilton family \nhome at Walnut and 7th, Ed would learn to dream.\n  It is one of the ironies of history that so many great artists and \nthinkers barely ever left their hometowns. The whole world opened up to \nShakespeare in a tiny town in England. Rembrandt saw all of history on \nthe faces of merchants in Amsterdam. The Divine Comedy was written in \nexile. And for Ed Hamilton, Louisville has always been enough.\n  Ed and his family have lived in the same house on 43rd Street for \ndecades. And all of his sculptures--from the Amistad memorial in New \nHaven to the African American Civil War Memorial monument here in \nWashington--were brought to life in the same Shelby Street studio. \n``Louisville has been my lifeblood,'' he says.\n  Ed's memories of post-war Louisville are vivid--right down to the \nsharp smell of the stockyards and the sweet smell of hops that floated \nfrom the breweries. He remembers spending too much time at the Lyric \nTheater--and being fascinated as a young boy by a bronze statue of \nAbraham Lincoln at the public library on 4th and York. It was the seed \nof his life's calling. Next year, more than half a century after Ed \ngazed at that bronze statue of Lincoln outside the public library, \nKentucky will celebrate the bicentennial of Lincoln's birth with a new \nstatue of Lincoln, this one by Ed, at Waterfront Park in Louisville.\n\n  Ed's life didn't always follow a straight path. As a kid, his mom \nwanted him to be a doctor. But a teacher at Parkland Middle School saw \nhis talent as an artist and decided she wasn't going to let him waste \nit. So she called his Mom at home. ``I think Ed's got something,'' she \nsaid, ``and I want to help him develop it.''\n  At Shawnee High School, other teachers did the same. Ed developed a \nlove for sculpture--and for a pretty girl named Bernadette--during his \ntime at the Art Center School. They got married. And for the last 40 \nyears, Bernadette has been his confidante and special muse.\n  Early on in their marriage, Ed taught ceramics and sculpture at \nIroquois High School. He enjoyed the work. It was a stable job. But \neverything changed after a chance encounter in 1973. That's when Ed met \nBarney Bright, the only man in Louisville who actually earned a living \nas a sculptor. ``Barney invited me into his studio,'' Ed later \nrecalled, ``and my entire life changed.''\n  Channeling the entrepreneurial spirit of his parents, Ed decided to \nset out on his own. And after a few years of working on abstract pieces \nand some impressive but minor liturgical art, the big breakthrough \ncame. It was a commission for a bust of Booker T. Washington at Hampton \nUniversity in Virginia. Ed always told Bernadette they didn't need to \nmove to a big city for his work. If he was good enough, he said, they \nwould come to him. Now they were.\n  When the Hampton commission came, in the early 1980s, Ed had never \nbeen on a plane before. So when it came time to visit the school, he \ntook a Greyhound bus. It stopped in every town and hamlet for 600 \nmiles. When they told him he had the job, he called Bernadette to tell \nher the good news and to tell her he was coming home in a plane.\n  Other important commissions followed: a statue of Joe Louis in \nDetroit; the Amistad Memorial in New Haven; York, the slave who \naccompanied Lewis and Clark on their western expedition, in Louisville; \nand then, the Spirit of Freedom monument in Washington, an epic work \nthat teaches thousands of Americans each year about the vital role the \nslaves played in the Union victory in the Civil War.\n  The movie ``Glory'' focused on a single regiment of Black soldiers. \nThe Spirit of Freedom honors all 200,000 of them, including nearly \n24,000 from Kentucky alone. This fighting force of former slaves made \nup about 10 percent of the Union Army. Twenty percent of these brave \nsoldiers and sailors died in battle.\n  The Spirit of Freedom was 6 years in the making. Ed says he used to \ndream about it in his sleep. The final product features 3 soldiers and \na sailor on one side. On the other side are the grandparents and \nparents of 3 children, one of whom is on his way to battle. Another \nchild is an infant.\n  The message of the statue is clear: When the war began, everyone in \nthe family it depicts was a slave. When the war ended, they were free. \nSome had lived their entire lives in bondage, but their children would \nnot. Black men had helped secure a life of freedom for themselves, \ntheir families, and future generations and helped unite a country.\n  The Spirit of Freedom is a tribute to the soldiers who fought. It's \nalso a special gift to their descendents. One woman, who came from \nSeattle to see it, sent a letter to the museum's director when she got \nback home. Here's what she wrote: ``I don't know what I expected when I \ncame to see the memorial, but when I came up out of the escalator and \nthis statue rose in front of me my eyes were filled with tears.''\n  Ed has two big binders of letters just like these at home. This one, \nfrom a woman in Louisville, is typical: ``Dear Ed: How wonderful for \nyou to make history come alive for generations to come. Now you are \nmaking history yourself as a sculptor and an African American. It is \nall wonderfully earned and deserved.''\n  Ed's gotten a lot of awards. In 1996, he was given the Governor's \nArtists Award in the Arts. In 2000, he was made an honorary doctor of \nHumane Letters at Spalding University. In 2001, he was inducted into \nthe Gallery of Great Black Kentuckians. In 2004, he was made an \nhonorary doctor of arts at Western Kentucky University.\n  But he wears his fame lightly. Locals are surprised to see him \nwalking down the aisles at Kroger. And he always answers his own phone. \n``I don't believe my own press,'' he says. ``This is all fleeting.''\n  Speaking once about the Spirit of Freedom statue, Ed called it an \n``honor'' for him to pay tribute to the thousands of Black men who gave \ntheir lives in the service of freedom but who were not allowed to march \nin the victory parades after the war was over.\n\n[[Page S1356]]\n\n  In this Black History Month, it is an honor for me to pay tribute to \nEd Hamilton on behalf of all Kentuckians and on behalf of the many \nthousands of people across the country who have been touched by his \nspecial gift.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Klobuchar). The Senator from Missouri is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as \nin morning business for up to 10 minutes and that following my remarks, \nthe Senator from South Dakota be recognized to speak as in morning \nbusiness for 20 minutes, and following him, the Senator from Washington \nbe recognized for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I have a brief statement I want to make \ninvolving a police officer who was killed. I will come back and maybe \nyou could allow me a couple minutes interspersed with all of this.\n  Mr. DODD. I ask unanimous consent that I be recognized for 15 minutes \nafter the Senator from Washington.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Missouri.\n\n\n                              Citizenship\n\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Madam President, I rise to speak briefly about \npatriotism and common sense. Every once in a while you open the morning \npaper and you go, huh? I had one of those moments this morning. In our \nConstitution, there are certain legal requirements to run for President \nof the United States. One of those is to be a natural born citizen. The \narticle in the morning paper I read raised legal questions about the \ndefinition of ``natural born citizen.''\n  Actually, it talked about an ambiguity that could be interpreted in a \nway that would mean a child of someone in the Active military, \nstationed somewhere around the world, could have a baby, and that baby \ncould never be President of the United States. In fact, Senator McCain \nwas born in the Panama Canal Zone while his father was Active-Duty \nmilitary in the Navy stationed in the Panama Canal Zone.\n  Clearly, that is a notion that defies common sense and certainly \noffends all of our patriotism. I can envision someone actually being \nmisguided and trying to bring some kind of legal action to determine \nwhether Senator McCain should run for President. That would be a waste \nof public time and resources. We should quickly and without fanfare fix \nthis ambiguity and make it clear that any child of anyone serving in \nthe Active military should, in fact, be qualified to run for President.\n  I will offer legislation I am confident everyone can agree on. How \nrefreshing that notion is. It very simply defines ``natural born \ncitizen'' to include any child born to a member of our military \nregardless of where in the world they may be serving. In America, so \nmany parents say to their young children: If you work hard and play by \nthe rules, in America someday you could be President.\n  Our brave and respected military should never have to spend a minute \nworrying whether that saying is true for their child. I hope we can \nquickly, by unanimous consent, pass this into law so there is no \nquestion that those children of the men and women who give it all for \nus can someday grow up to lead this great Nation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota is recognized.\n\n\n            Master Sergeant Woodrow Wilson ``Woody'' Keeble\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, today I rise to honor MSG Woodrow Wilson \n``Woody'' Keeble for earning the Medal of Honor for his heroic service \nto our country in World War II and the Korean war. Although President \nBush won't present the medal to Master Sergeant Keeble's family until \nnext Monday, this is indeed an historic event as he is the first member \nof the Great Sioux Nation to be awarded this honor.\n  Master Sergeant Keeble went beyond the call of duty not for a medal, \nbut for the mission he believed in and the country he loved. His legacy \nis a great source of pride for his family, his fellow South Dakota \nSioux, and all Americans. The example he set for the just cause of \ndefending freedom and democracy is truly heroic.\n  Master Sergeant Keeble was born in Waubay, SD, in 1917 to parents \nfrom the Sisseton-Wahpeton Sioux tribe. Master Sergeant Keeble's mother \ndied at a young age, forcing his father to enroll him in the Wahpeton \nIndian School so he could get an education and three meals a day.\n  After graduating, Master Sergeant Keeble worked at the school and \nbecame well known for his baseball pitching, a skill that would serve \nhim well in combat. In fact, the Chicago White Sox were actively \nrecruiting him to play professional baseball when he was called into \naction in World War II.\n  After basic training, Master Sergeant Keeble served with ``I'' \nCompany of North Dakota's 164th Infantry Regiment. He trained in \nLouisiana and was soon deployed to Australia to prepare for operations \nin the Pacific Theater. There, Master Sergeant Keeble's regiment was \nassigned to the 23rd Infantry Division, better known as the Americal \nDivision.\n  On October 13, 1942, Master Sergeant Keeble landed on Guadalcanal in \nsupport of the First Marine Division, which had suffered heavy losses \nfrom the relentless Japanese forces. This was the first offensive \noperation the U.S. Army had conducted against the enemy in any theater \nof World War II.\n  Fighting alongside Marines, Master Sergeant Keeble gained valuable \nexperience in jungle warfare that would later prove valuable in future \noperations.\n  The campaign on Guadalcanal saw some of the most brutal combat of the \nwar. Japanese troops adopted the ``banzai charge'' tactic of attacking \nin human waves and hand-to-hand combat would sometimes last through the \nnight. During this operation, Master Sergeant Keeble developed expert \ncontrol of his Browning automatic rifle. He also earned a reputation \nfor bravery as one of the best fighters on the island because his \npitching skills came in handy as he used his incredibly strong arm to \neffectively throw grenades into enemy bunkers. James Fenelon, a member \nof the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe who fought beside Master Sergeant \nKeeble once said, ``The safest place to be was right next to Woody. I \ndon't know how many rounds he carried, but he had bandoliers on each \nshoulder. His gun just never stopped--no matter where you were, there \nwere Japanese. He was unbelievable.''\n  Master Sergeant Keeble was awarded his first Bronze Star and Purple \nHeart at Guadalcanal for his meritorious actions in ground operations \nagainst the Japanese. His division fought so valiantly that they \nreceived a Navy Presidential Unit Citation for their support of the \nMarines. After Japan surrendered, the 164th occupied the Yokohama \nregion of Japan.\n  After the war, Master Sergeant Keeble returned to Wahpeton and \nresumed work at the Wahpeton Indian School. He married Nattie Abigail \nOwen-Robertson on November 14, 1947, and settled down to start a \nfamily.\n  However, Master Sergeant Keeble's rest would not be a long one as the \n164th was reactivated in 1951 to serve in the Korean war. After \ntraining at Camp Rucker, Alabama, several of Master Sergeant Keeble's \nfellow sergeants were to be selected for deployment to the front lines \nin Korea. After agreeing to draw straws to decide who would take this \nunwanted duty, Master Sergeant Keeble volunteered to take a short straw \nsaying, ``Somebody has to teach these kids how to fight.''\n  The leadership and bravery Master Sergeant Keeble displayed in \nvolunteering continued through his time in Korea. He was assigned to \nGeorge Company, 19th Infantry Regiment, 24th Infantry Division. His \nstrong character, robust leadership, and jungle combat experience \nbrought him several quick promotions to the level of Master Sergeant. \nThe Regimental leadership saw his potential, and placed him in charge \nof the first platoon.\n  On October 15, 1951, in a particularly bloody battle near Kumsong, \nNorth Korea, all of the officers of G Company were either wounded or \nkilled in combat. Master Sergeant Keeble was among the wounded, but \ndemanded he be released after treatment and volunteered to lead the \n1st, 2nd, and 3rd Platoons in assaults against the enemy.\n  On October 17, Master Sergeant Keeble was again wounded, and again \nreturned to battle after being treated. His actions on the following \nday, October 18, earned him the Silver Star for continuing to lead his \nmen after being\n\n[[Page S1357]]\n\nhit by grenade shrapnel. During this battle, Master Sergeant Keeble \nsuffered two bullet wounds to his left arm, a grenade blast near his \nface that nearly removed his nose, and a badly twisted knee. On October \n19, doctors removed 83 pieces of shrapnel from Master Sergeant Keeble's \nwounds.\n  The following day, October 20, 1951, would prove to be Master \nSergeant Keeble's most heroic. After insisting he be allowed back to \ncombat, Master Sergeant Keeble cemented his place in history. While \nleading the 1st Platoon up a steep hill during this battle, he saw that \nmachine gun fire from three enemy emplacements had pinned down the \nentire 2nd Platoon on the same hill. The steep, rocky terrain was of \ntactical importance and Master Sergeant Keeble took it upon himself to \nensure the operation carried on.\n  Master Sergeant Keeble crawled ahead to the 2nd Platoon. He then \ncontinued to advance on the enemy by crawling forward on his own. \nAlthough the enemy began to train all of its fire on Master Sergeant \nKeeble, he continued to hug the ground and advance until he was close \nto the emplacements. He then activated a grenade and successfully \ndestroyed one of the enemy positions. Continuing his assault, Master \nSergeant Keeble moved towards the remaining two machine gun posts and \nsingle handedly destroyed both of them with grenades. After removing \nthe last position, he was stunned with an enemy concussion grenade, but \npressed on after he recovered. Master Sergeant Keeble then resumed his \nadvance and neutralized the remaining enemy personnel with his rifle.\n  In all, Master Sergeant Keeble eliminated nine machine gunners and \nseven riflemen. His heroic determination to press on and endure enemy \nfire inspired his fellow servicemen to rally and continue advancing on \nthe enemy. By the end of the campaign, Master Sergeant Keeble had \nreceived five separate wounds to his chest, both arms, and both legs. \nDespite all of these injuries, Master Sergeant Keeble only received one \nPurple Heart, with the Oak Leaf Cluster, bringing his total to two. He \nwas also awarded the Distinguished Service Cross and the Bronze Star \nFirst Oak Leaf Cluster.\n  Although he has been recommended twice for the Medal of Honor, it was \nnever granted. That is why I rise today and honor Master Sergeant \nKeeble for finally being recognized for his truly remarkable heroism \nand valor. While he died in 1982 in part due to complications resulting \nfrom his war injuries, I am sure he would be proud to know that he has \nfinally been given this honor he earned long ago.\n  Master Sergeant Keeble stood proudly for his country, his tribe and \nhis family. He was strong, humble, compassionate, and committed to \ndefending freedom. His actions were extraordinary and his bravery \novercame the chaos that surrounded him. Master Sergeant Keeble once \nsaid, ``There were terrible moments that encompassed a lifetime, an \nendlessness, when terror was so strong in me, that I could feel idiocy \nreplace reason. Yet, I have never left my position, nor have I shirked \nhazardous duty. Fear did not make a coward out of me.''\n  I am proud that next Monday, President Bush will be presenting this \nhonor posthumously to Master Sergeant Woodrow Wilson ``Woody'' Keeble. \nHis bravery is undoubtedly deserving of the Medal of Honor he has \nfinally been awarded after a 55-year wait. The legacy he has left is a \nsource of pride for his family, the Great Sioux Nation, and the country \nhe nobly served.\n  Madam President, I would like to, if I might, shift gears and speak \nfor a moment to some of the debate that has been going on on the Senate \nfloor this week dealing with, primarily, the resolution that has been \noffered by the Senator from Wisconsin, Mr. Feingold, dealing with the \nwithdrawal from Iraq and also the more recent resolution which has been \nthe subject of debate here today on the Senate floor. But I think it is \nimportant that we also, as we debate these issues, acknowledge the good \nwork that has been done by our troops.\n  Make no mistake about it, we are making progress in Iraq. The \nDirector of the Defense Intelligence Agency, GEN Michael Maples, who \nwas this week here in Washington and testifying in front of the Armed \nServices Committee, commented that violence across Iraq has declined to \nits lowest level since April 2005 and violence against coalition troops \nis at the lowest level since March of 2004. Things are, indeed, \ntrending in the right direction, especially compared to a year ago.\n  Although these trends are certainly reversible, the fact remains that \nthe security situation in Iraq has improved significantly. The surge \nhas and is working. The surge has worked despite relentless efforts to \nundermine it by several Members on the other side of the aisle.\n  At one point last year, we had people saying the surge had not \naccomplished anything. We heard a Democrat on the floor of the Senate \nsaying that General Petraeus, our commander in Iraq who has so \nbrilliantly led the surge, had been ``made the de facto spokesman for \nwhat many of us believe to be a failed policy'' and that ``the reports \nyou provide to us really require the willing suspension of disbelief.'' \nThankfully, they were wrong--utterly wrong. Nevertheless, the other \nside is continuing their wrongheaded approach by offering legislation \nagain this week that would undo all of the progress our troops have \nmade in Iraq. Once again, the extreme left in this country has demanded \na vote on cutting off funds for our troops and near immediate \nwithdrawal from Iraq. The leadership on the other side continues to \nmake obligatory gestures to satisfy that extreme leftwing base.\n  The Senate voted four times last year on versions of this bill that \nwe debated earlier this week to cut off funds for the troops in Iraq, \nand on four separate occasions the Senate rejected it. The legislation \nwas defeated by overwhelming bipartisan margins. It never received more \nthan 29 votes. Yet again this week, we went through the exercise of \nhaving yet another debate on this issue.\n  I think it was about a year ago this week, actually, we had a rare \nSaturday session where Members were called back in to make votes on an \nIraq withdrawal resolution, again designed to score political points to \nundermine progress in Iraq rather than to get anything else done.\n  I think it is important to note--as we think about how we best combat \nthe terrorist threat we face in this country and how we assist those \nyoung men and women who are carrying that fight overseas for us--we \nfind today the House of Representatives has adjourned for the week \nafter having acted on, I think, the naming of five post offices, when \nthe Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act has still yet to be voted on \nin the House of Representatives.\n  The Senate, before we took off for our last recess, voted by a margin \nof 68 to 29 to pass the terrorist surveillance bill through the Senate. \nIt had broad bipartisan support in the Senate. If it had been taken up \non the floor of the House, it would have passed there with broad \nbipartisan support as well. Yet we have the House today adjourning to \ngo home, having acted on five resolutions to name post offices, without \naddressing what is one of the most important issues we all need to deal \nwith here; that is, making sure our intelligence community and our law \nenforcement community and our men and women in uniform have the tools \nat their disposal to do the job we asked them to do.\n  It is critical that the intelligence community have that legislation \npassed so we can close gaps in our intelligence collection. We need \nthat to get a better understanding of international al-Qaida networks \nand to gain insight into future terrorist plans and to disrupt \npotential terrorist attacks.\n  So I would hope cooler heads will prevail around here, that Congress \nwill do the right thing for the protection of the American people, the \nright thing to aid those who are diligently working day in and day \nout--those in our intelligence community, those in our law enforcement \ncommunity, those men and women in uniform who are fighting to keep this \ncountry safe--that they have the tools at their disposal to carry out \nthe important responsibility we have given them to protect Americans. \nActing on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and giving our \nintelligence community, under this terrorist surveillance bill, the \nauthorities it needs to intercept communications that are being \nconducted by terrorists around the world would be an\n\n[[Page S1358]]\n\nimportant place to start. Right now, we have a gap in that intelligence \ncollection because the House has failed to act on this very important \npiece of legislation. It is irresponsible.\n  It is important that we put the politics of this matter aside and we \ndeal with the important issues that will keep America safe and ensure \nfuture generations of Americans are not subject to terrorist attacks. \nSo I hope my colleagues will get the message, will come back into \nsession, and take care of business, which is to get this important \nlegislation passed, and act with the Senate in a broad bipartisan way \nto put a bill on the President's desk that he can sign into law that \nwill make sure our intelligence community has the resources and the \ntools they need.\n  Madam President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I have been talking often to my \ndistinguished Republican colleague.\n\n\n                 Unanimous-Consent Agreement--H.R. 3221\n\n  Madam President, I now ask unanimous consent that at 4:45 p.m. today, \nthe motion to proceed to S. 2634 be withdrawn, and the time until then \nbe equally divided and controlled between the leaders or their \ndesignees, with Senators permitted to speak for up to 10 minutes each, \nwith the leaders controlling the 20 minutes prior to the vote and the \nmajority leader controlling the final 10 minutes; that at 4:45 p.m. the \nSenate proceed to vote on the motion to invoke cloture on the motion to \nproceed to H.R. 3221.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank the Chair.\n  Reserving the right to object, Madam President, I would ask the \nmajority leader if he would modify his consent request that if cloture \nis invoked on the motion to proceed and the Senate does indeed proceed \nto the bill, there then be up to five amendments per side related to \nhousing and economic growth.\n  Mr. REID. Five amendments per side?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Related to housing and economic growth.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I am anxious to try to work something out. \nWe have Republicans who have indicated to me they have amendments to \noffer. I have Democrats who have come to me and actually given me the \nlanguage of amendments they want to offer. So it is not as if \nRepublicans are the only ones who want to offer amendments to the \nhousing stimulus package.\n  So the answer to the question is yes, but I just cannot give carte \nblanche. I will be as fair and reasonable as I can be. That is pretty \nwide. It does not require germaneness. It does not require relevancy. \nAll it requires is it be related to housing and something dealing with \nthe economy. If cloture is invoked on this matter, I want to legislate. \nI think this bill, which I think is so essential to the American \npeople, would be a much better piece of legislation if it were \nbipartisan in nature. So I don't know if that gives the Republicans \nenough comfort, but I will try to be fair. I want to try to work this \nout. I think the number of five is fine. They suggested three. I think \nfive is fine. I am not going to be trying to micromanage what they do, \nbut I think it is something that, in fairness, the Republican leader \nwould want to see what amendments were going to be offered and he would \nhave the ability to say no to that. I think I should have--I have an \nobligation, a right, to look at what they do.\n\n  I will repeat: I can't do any more than say I will try to be as fair \nas humanly possible. I acknowledge the legislation has some \ncontroversy, and that being the case, there should be amendments \nallowed on it and I will do my best.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Consequently, I gather the majority leader is \nobjecting to my request that he modify his consent.\n  Mr. REID. Yes. I think it was kind of a weak objection to his \nmodification, but it is one.\n  While the distinguished Republican leader is on the floor, I ask that \nmy request be modified for the vote to occur at 4:55.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to revise the \nprevious consent order for the speakers on our side to be 5 minutes for \nthe Senator from Washington, 5 minutes for the Senator from New York, 5 \nminutes for the Senator from North Dakota, and 5 minutes for the \nSenator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask to have the vote at 4:56, because I \nhave a brief statement. A police officer was killed in Nevada, if I \ncould make a brief statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                TRIBUTE TO TROOPER KARA KELLY-BORGOGNONE\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, it is with a heavy heart that I rise to \nhonor Nevada State Trooper Kara Kelly-Borgognone.\n  On Monday night, she was killed responding to a terribly difficult \nassignment, where there was a suspected bomb at a gas station in \nSpanish Springs, NV, which is a suburb of Reno-Sparks. While en route \nto the scene, her patrol car was struck by a driver headed in the wrong \ndirection.\n  Trooper Borgognone was rushed to Renown Regional Medical Center in \ncritical condition. She succumbed to her injuries and died.\n  Trooper Kelly-Borgognone gave her life protecting the people of \nNevada, just as she did every day. Even in passing, she saved more \nlives by donating her organs.\n  In the final hours of her life, her brothers and sisters and the \nNevada Highway Patrol stood guard by her side. They cared for and \nprotected their fallen sister, just as they care for and protect us \nevery day.\n  This is the way it is all over the country--not only in Nevada.\n  So today, as their solemn vigil--that is the police officers--comes \nto an end, standing with their fallen sister, we will try in some small \nway to share the burden of grief for police officers who fall all over \nAmerica in the line of duty.\n  Our hearts and prayers are with the trooper's husband Dirk, and their \ntwo daughters, Blair and Ashlyn. I hope it is of some comfort for them \nto know the life of their mother and the life of Dirk's wife is a life \nthat was given in service to the people of the State of Nevada.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n\n\n                       Foreclosure Prevention Act\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I rise this afternoon in support of the \nForeclosure Prevention Act because we have to take action now to help \nso many families in this country who have been hurt in the mortgage and \ncredit crisis.\n  The bill that we will hopefully vote to move to shortly is going to \nhelp provide the resources to keep our families in their homes, help \nour communities recover from this foreclosure crisis, and help \nstruggling businesses to weather this shaky economy. The bill we will \nconsider going to will provide some commonsense solutions to help \naddress the problems that are at the heart of our country's economic \nwoes. It is an opportunity finally for us to invest in our communities \nnow so we can prevent millions of families from going into foreclosure.\n  I wish to share with the body quickly a story of a constituent from \nmy home State, a man named Clifford, who lives in Olympia and who let \nme know about what happened to him, which is happening to so many \nAmericans. He thought he had achieved the American dream by owning a \nhome. His home, he said, represented stability to him. It was his \ninvestment in his future. But he, similar to many Americans, lost his \njob in a factory. The bills started stacking up. The stress wore on him \nand his family. His wife, who had diabetes, got sick and she had to \nhave surgery. Before he knew it he was several months behind in his \nmortgage.\n  Suddenly, all his dreams for a secure future evaporated.\n  He told me how he struggled to work with his mortgage company and he \ncouldn't catch up. Eventually, he made a phone call to Consumer \nCounseling Northwest, and through the help of that counseling, he was \nable to get his payments reduced with his mortgage\n\n[[Page S1359]]\n\ncompany, get back on track, and keep his family home.\n  That is why in this bill we are going to vote on, we have included \ncritical funding for housing counseling that will allow our families \nacross the country to make a phone call--not to their mortgage company \nto say I can't pay my bill but to a housing counselor who can sit down \nwith them and their family to get their finances back in order so they \ndo not have to go to foreclosure.\n  We know the housing crisis is impacting millions of families. In \nfact, experts tell us it may impact as many as 2 million families in \nthis coming year alone. We can help prevent that if we can give these \nfamilies a place to go, a counselor to help them, and the ability to be \nable to manage their finances.\n  Why is it so important? Not just for those families who lose all \ntheir wealth and their home if they have to foreclose but for the \nneighborhood: So their home doesn't become a blight in the \nneighborhood, losing the value in the rest of the homes; so their \ncommunity and neighborhood is safe and so we are strengthening the \neconomy.\n  These and many other provisions we will hear about as my colleagues \ntalk about this bill are critical. We cannot wait for another year. We \ncan't wait and see what happens in June or September or December. We \nneed to act now, and I urge my colleagues in the Senate to vote with us \nfor cloture to move to the housing bill we are proposing today--the \nForeclosure Prevention Act--so we can begin the process to help \nfamilies stay in their homes.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I, too, rise in support of this \noutstanding bill. The bottom line is, despite what the President said \ntoday, most Americans feel we are in an economically difficult times. \nThe President says we are not in recession. The President doesn't think \nwe are going in recession. For most, the debate is not whether we are \nor will be in recession but how deep it will be.\n  So the bottom line is very simple: We have to do something about this \neconomy. There is no better way to turn the economy around, to prevent \nthe recession from being long and deep, than dealing with the housing \nmarket because housing is at the center of the economic problems we \nhave today. Housing is the bull's-eye at which we should aim if we want \nto rectify the economy.\n  The proposal before us is a good one. It has five important measures. \nThey are modest, but they are thoughtful, and they are aimed right at \nwhere the problem is.\n  Now, our colleagues on the other side of the aisle are probably going \nto block our proposal. They are becoming the ``Dr. No'' of this \nCongress. We have a crisis; everyone knows housing is at the heart of \nthe crisis. No one believes the administration's voluntary ideas have \nworked. Yet we are hearing we shouldn't do anything that is \ngovernmental. That makes no sense.\n  Early this week we heard stay the course on the war in Iraq. Now we \nhear stay the course in terms of the economy. Don't you hear it? The \nAmerican people want a change in course, a change in direction. We are \ntrying to present that to them in a nonconfrontational way, in a way we \nhad hoped and thought would be bipartisan. Because when we put this \nproposal together, we realized there were a couple of provisions--\nparticularly the bankruptcy provision--that others objected to, but the \nrest of the provisions seemed quite unobjectionable. Yet here we are \nhearing, for instance, from the administration that we don't need more \nhousing counselors because we have already allocated $180 million. That \nwas our proposal. In fact, I originated it and had good help from \nSenator Brown and Senator Casey and then Senator Murray, who helped put \nit into the omnibus bill. But of that $180 million, $130 million is \ngone already. It shows you the need. Do we need some more mortgage \nrevenue bonds? Many States are tapped out and cannot help mortgagors, \neven if they wanted to. Loss carry forwards will help those who build \nhomes move forward for getting out of the housing recession. Yet the \nadministration and most of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nseem to just say no.\n  My colleague from Georgia has a very interesting proposal that I \nwould certainly entertain. What we ought to be doing on this bill is \nhaving a debate, offering amendments relevant to housing--not the \nfuture of the country and not whether we should extend the President's \ntax cuts or the estate tax; that is irrelevant to this bill--but having \na debate on provisions such as those in our bill, debate on the \nprovisions such as the ones from the Senator from Georgia and come up \nwith a product that can help move us forward. Instead, all we hear from \nthe minority leader is no, no, no, no.\n  The economy is in a degree of serious trouble. The housing market is \nat the core of that trouble. There are 2 million homeowners who will be \nforeclosed upon, most of whom through no fault of their own. Those \nforeclosures will help bring the economy further down. Why don't we do \nsomething careful, targeted, modest, and not terribly expensive?\n  The only thing I hear from the President anyway is: Well, Government \nshouldn't be involved. That is the reasoning of maybe McKinley, maybe \nHoover but certainly not Republicans in the post World War II era. All \nof a sudden, we are having a throwback to these earlier days. \nUnfortunately, if we adhere to that kind of thinking, the boom and bust \ncycles that have plagued the American family will continue.\n  So I urge this administration to change its mind. I urge my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle who seek a degree of \nbipartisanship to reach out to us and work with us. We will modify our \nprovisions, change some, maybe even drop one or two to get a good \nproduct. Please don't just say no. Please don't say the only thing we \nshould debate is the same thing we have debated before: whether we \nshould extend the President's tax cuts. We have been there, done that. \nWe have new problems and we need a new direction. This bill begins to \nprovide it. I hope my colleagues will support it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Madam President, I wish to acknowledge the kind remarks \nof Senator Schumer with regard to a proposal I have made. For the \npublic's edification and amplification, nobody over here is just saying \nno, except the majority leader just said no to offering our amendments \nto the stimulus package we want cloture on. What we are going through \nright now are some gymnastics and the gymnastics are this. Members on \nboth sides of the aisle want to do something because we do recognize \nthere is a housing problem, because there are ways we can help the \nAmerican public. But you can't address all those ways if you don't \nallow all those ideas to be debated as a part of the amendment process \non the legislation.\n  So I appreciate the kind remarks of the Senator regarding my \nproposal, but a favorable comment doesn't do us any good if you can't \noffer the amendment on the floor. I don't think I have all the good \nideas. I don't think they have all the good ideas. I think, \ncollectively, we probably do have all the good ideas. But this is not \nabout just saying no. This is us saying yes to a process that is open, \na process that is debatable, a process where we can reach out and try \nand help the American people, particularly those who are having great \ndifficulty because of the housing market today.\n  So I wished to throw that in. My remarks were intended to be about \nIraq, which I am going to close with, but I had to respond to the \nstatements the Senator from New York made.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Madam President, would the Senator from Georgia yield \nfor a moment before you go to the Iraq comments?\n  Mr. ISAKSON. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. I wished to follow up on the Senator's comments because \nthere are a number of amendments that would be worth considering when \nwe look at the problem we are facing.\n  First, I heard the Senator from New York. He is wrong to suggest that \nthe President and the Republicans do not understand there is a problem \nin America. People are being foreclosed on, and there are families \nsitting at the kitchen table to see how to save that precious piece of \nthe American dream\n\n[[Page S1360]]\n\nthey have--their home. We are trying to help in that regard as well.\n  The stimulus package we did a few days ago was a bipartisan measure. \nWhat we should do now with the housing package is work that as a \nbipartisan idea as well, coming together as both Republicans and \nDemocrats to make it better. The Senator from Georgia has a terrific \nidea, one I support and I think would make a lot of sense in the \ncurrent situation in Florida in the housing market, and there are a \nnumber of other ideas. One has to do with whether mortgage brokers--\nSenator Feinstein and I bipartisanly have come together on this--\nwhether there ought to be a national registry for mortgage brokers. \nSenator Carper and I have worked together on a number of things that \nwould improve the housing passage.\n  We cannot simply say or follow a pattern that seems to be the current \npattern in the Senate, which is that it is put forward by the majority, \nwhich then forecloses the ability of the minority to have amendments. \nThe minority leader proposed five amendments per side, and that was \nrejected. This bill will go down if all they want is a symbolic moment \nfor the Senator from New York to tell the Republicans how they are \nheartless and don't care about the poor and don't understand that \nAmerica has problems with housing, and then we will go about our \nbusiness as usual. If they do that, cloture will not be invoked and \nnothing will be done. Five amendments to a side seems to be a \nreasonable way of doing it if we want to get something done.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Florida, and I \nacknowledge that he is a former Secretary of the Department of Housing \nand Urban Development, who has done tremendous work on the housing \nissue. I concur with each of his remarks.\n  I will close with this. When you talk about ``just say no,'' we ought \nto have been on the stimulus debate when we got back here on Tuesday. \nFor some reason, and because the majority wanted to, we have been \ndebating the Iraq situation while the stimulus and housing sit on the \nsidelines. I hope we can get through these gymnastics and get to a \nsituation where we can debate good ideas on both sides and not preclude \nand leave people out. Instead of saying ``just say no'' to amendments \nand to a sincere effort, say yes to what this body is all about: \ndeliberation, decisions, and doing what is right for the people of \nAmerica.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I would not try to make a deal on behalf \nof the majority leader, but my guess is that if the other side is \nagreeable to amendments that deal with housing, we would probably have \nan agreement. Every time we put something on the floor, we get an \nabortion amendment or an amendment to provide tax breaks for wealthy \npeople. I would guess that if there are housing amendments, Senator \nReid will want to visit with Senator McConnell about this.\n\n\n                      Strategic Petroleum Reserve\n\n  Mr. President, I want to speak for a moment about what happened \ntoday. cnnmoney.com says:\n\n       Pain in the pocketbook within a few weeks. Gas could cost \n     $3.50 a gallon. By spring, the price could hit $4 a gallon.\n\n  While there are predictions of $3.50 and $4 a gallon for gasoline, we \nstill have the U.S. Department of Energy putting oil underground in the \nStrategic Petroleum Reserve. They have been putting 50,000 and 60,000 \nbarrels a day. By the way, in the second half of the year, I have been \ntold that they plan to put as much as 125,000 barrels a day.\n  When the price of oil is around $100 a barrel, as it was trading at \n$102 barrels earlier today, it is putting upward pressure on gas \nprices. Our Government is taking oil from the Gulf of Mexico in the \nform of oil-in-kind transfers and putting it into a reserve. Instead of \nputting that oil into the supply pipeline to reduce prices, they are \nsticking it underground. The Energy Information Administration \nindicates that, on average, the price of regular gasoline last February \nwas $2.22; in August, $2.78; in February, $3.02; and it is headed \nnorth.\n  Yet, the U.S. Government takes royalty-in-kind oil, and our \nDepartment of Energy is sticking it underground in big salt caverns to \nsave it for a rainy day. They are putting it in the SPR, the Strategic \nPetroleum Reserve.\n  I support the SPR, but it is about 97 percent full. Why on Earth \nwould we put upward pressure on oil and gas prices to take $100-a-\nbarrel oil and stick it underground? Here is where it is going: Bayou \nChoctaw, West Hackberry, Big Hill, and Bryan Mound. These are the \nlocations where the Department of Energy is sticking it underground. It \nmakes no sense at this time when prices are so high.\n  I have introduced bipartisan legislation and intend to try to move it \non an appropriations bill, if I must, to stop this. There is no reason \nto take 50,000 or 60,000 barrels a day out of supply. This especially \nincludes sweet light crude. This is a subset of all oil, sweet light \ncrude, which is even more valuable. We have heard testimony at a \nhearing before the Energy Committee that indicates that this diversion \nof light sweet crude could add as much as $10 to a barrel of light \nsweet crude trading on the market. It is putting upward pressure on \nprices.\n  In addition to this, there is unbelievable speculation going on in \nthe futures market. Fidel Gheit, with Oppenheimer & Company, testified:\n\n       There is absolutely no shortage of oil. . . . I am \n     convinced that oil prices should not be a dime over $55 a \n     barrel. Oil speculators include the largest financial \n     institutions in the world. I call it the world's largest \n     gambling hall. It is open 24/7. Unfortunately, it is totally \n     unregulated. This is like a highway with no cops and no speed \n     limit and everybody going 120 miles per hour.\n\n  Investment banks are buying their own storage capability to keep the \noil off the market. As he says, this is a 24/7 gambling hall. Who pays \nthe price for this unbelievable speculation? It is the American \nconsumer that pays with ever higher prices for oil and gasoline. There \nare experts who say the price of a barrel of oil is trading at least \n$30 above where it is justified in being, given all other issues \nbetween supply and demand.\n  In addition to this lack of regulation of hedge funds and other \nactivities in this carnival of greed, there is excess speculation in \nthe futures market. On top of that as I have indicated, our own \nGovernment is making it worse by taking oil and sticking it \nunderground. It is not rocket science when oil is where it is and \ngasoline prices are where they are and headed north.\n  The President, when asked about that today in the news conference, \nsaid, ``I have not heard this $4 issue.'' Well, read the newspapers \nfrom time to time. Gas prices are going through the roof. This \nGovernment is sticking oil underground and putting upward pressure on \nprices. There is no justification for doing this. We ought to have a \npause, and we ought to say to the Administration that the 50,000, \n60,000, or 70,000 barrels a day being put in storage today is impacting \nprices. It may be 125,000 barrels in the second half of the year if the \nAdministration gets its way. This oil needs to go into the supply \nstream, and that would put downward pressure on gas and oil prices.\n  Some say, well, it is a populist issue. You ought to produce more \ndomestically. Here is where we should produce. Some of us were \ncosponsors of a bill that became law in 2006 to begin that production \nin what is known as the Lease Sale 181 area of the Gulf of Mexico. I \nagree with that. The Gulf of Mexico is our greatest resource asset. I \nthink putting this oil in the ground at this point is nuts, and we need \nto stand up for consumers and for a decent price for oil and gas. We \nought not have a government policy that makes things worse.\n  My understanding is that my 5 minutes is up. I will speak about this \nsubject later.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I wanted to speak a little bit to the \nsituation we find ourselves in. We have been here before. This is \n``deja vu all over again,'' to quote Yogi Berra. We were under the same \nstricture when we were debating the agriculture bill a couple months \nago. The Senate, by definition, is an institution that is supposed to \nwork its will on legislation. The legislation doesn't come to the \nSenate under a closed rule as they have\n\n[[Page S1361]]\n\nin the House, where the House leadership says this amendment will be \noffered, and that amendment will be offered, and time will expire and \nwe have to vote. The whole concept of the Senate is that you have an \nopen and free-flowing debate, where people can bring their thoughts to \nthe floor. You don't limit amendments and they can be on about \nanything. As a practical matter, the Senate then votes after it has \nfully digested the various ideas that have been put forward.\n  This approach the Senate has always taken was first defined and most \neffectively defined, ironically, by George Washington, when he said \nthat the Senate is the saucer into which the hot coffee is poured--the \ncoffee being the House ideas. Now, the majority leader seems to view \nthe Senate as an adjunct of the House, that we should actually be a \nreplication of the House, that the majority leader should have the \nunilateral right, first, to bring a bill to the floor, which he has \ndone, but once he does that, he should not have the unilateral right to \ndetermine what the amendments will be, how many will occur, and how \nlong the debate will be on those amendments.\n  This is not an autocratic institution. In fact, the Senate is about \nas far from an autocracy as you can get. Each Senator has the capacity \nto have a fairly strong impact around here. Each Senator has the right, \nunder the rules of the Senate, to make their case. So the majority \nleader should not be surprised when he suggests he is going to \nimmediately file cloture on a bill--which is fairly substantive--\nstimulus II, as it is called--in order to shut off amendments from our \nside, our side is going to say, no, that is not the way the Senate \nworks. We want to be heard. We want to be able to have the capacity to \nhave our amendments.\n  The package they are talking about bringing forward may not be a \nstimulus at all. In fact, it may be the antistimulus package. What they \nare suggesting is a change in bankruptcy laws that will raise the cost \nof mortgage insurance--and it is estimated by 1 percentage point--for \nall Americans who try to get a mortgage after this, if this law were to \nbecome effective. It is populist politics, no question about that. You \ncan beat the desk and say we are going to give relief to mortgages by \nallowing people to go into bankruptcy court and write their mortgages \ndown. But the practical effect of that will be that the market will \nreact and mortgage prices will go up, because people who lend money \nwill have to anticipate that risk. That is what interest rates on \nmortgages account for--the risk of repayment of that money.\n  So it is a terrible idea, the practical implications of which will be \nnot to stimulate the housing market but to undermine the housing \nmarket. There are initiatives here that might stimulate the economy; \nsome have to do with housing. The Senator from Georgia has a superb \nidea. But some are tangential to the housing issue but would have a \nsignificant impact on our economy. For example, we could begin the \nprocess of straightening out our health care system. That would \ncertainly help the economy. We could extend the dividend and capital \ngains rates. That would have a huge impact on our economy, if people \nknew they were going to have an extension of the capital gains rates. \nWe could address the issue of employing and attracting to America more \nsmart people to work in America, so they could be individual engines \nfor economic activity, by extending the H-1B program.\n  There are a lot of good ideas that could stimulate this economy. \nThere is absolutely no reason that the majority leader should try to \nuse his position as majority leader to shut down the opportunity of the \nminority to bring those ideas and amendments forward. Let's vote on \nthem. I can understand that the majority leader wants to move things \nalong, and he does not want to have his Members make any difficult \nvotes. That is his responsibility, I suppose to some degree, as leader. \nThat is not the way the Senate works. The Senate is designed to be a \nplace where you can put forward challenging ideas, debate them, and \nthen vote on them.\n  We can deal with this bill in a fairly prompt way, but we cannot deal \nwith it in a prompt way if those of us on our side of the aisle who \nbelieve we have some good ideas that maybe the majority leader does not \nlike are not allowed to bring those ideas forward as to how to \nstimulate this economy.\n  We went through this exercise on the Agriculture bill, and it did not \nwork. The leadership of the Senate and the majority leader finally \ndecided we better get to the amendment process after 2 weeks of \nbasically trying to shut down the amendment process.\n  There is no reason to go through this process again. Let's have an \nopen amendment process where we in the minority agree to a certain \nnumber of amendments, but we certainly are not going to agree to \npreclear those amendments with the majority leader because he does not \nhave that authority under the way the Senate works.\n  Madam President, I will have to oppose cloture on this bill at this \ntime, although I would certainly like to see us get to this bill and do \nsome serious consideration of how we stimulate this economy because I \nwould like to see us extend the capital gains rates, extend the \ndividend rates, bring more smart people into this country to energize \nour economy, and address our health care needs to energize our economy. \nThose are issues I would like to see debated and voted on as we move \nforward.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, what is the time agreement?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 11 minute 27 seconds for the minority \nand 8 minutes 18 seconds for the majority.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, my colleagues desire to do a colloquy. \nI am pleased to yield to them as long as there is some time left \nsomewhere along the way. I yield the floor, and I ask unanimous consent \nthat I be recognized after this colloquy concludes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n  Mr. CARPER. Madam President, I understand the time that has been \nallocated--I think 8 minutes left on our side--is leader time that has \nbeen allocated to Senator Dodd, the chairman of the Banking Committee. \nHe is not going to be here until after the vote to use that time. Our \nstaff has been good to say that the time might be made available to me. \nI wish to enter into a colloquy, if I may, with Senator Martinez, who \nis a former Secretary of HUD in a previous life and a valued member of \nthe Senate Banking Committee.\n  We are going to have a vote in a few minutes on whether to proceed to \na housing recovery package which has a number of positive elements in \nit. It is one that was largely put together by the Democratic side, but \nthere is a willingness on our side to certainly accept amendments \noffered by our Republican friends.\n  As it turns out, the administration's top three priorities, as \nSenator Martinez knows, in the housing recovery package that we might \ngo to at this time would be GSE regulatory reform for Fannie Mae, \nFreddie Mac, and the Federal Home Loan Banks, FHA modernization, and it \nwould also include the ability for State housing authorities to issue \nadditional taxes and revenue bonds that can be used for helping \nrefinance homes that are going or have gone into foreclosure. Those are \nthe top three proposals of the administration. The third one is \nactually in our Democratic proposal on housing recovery. The other two, \nChairman Dodd and Senator Shelby met, I am told last night, with the \nranking Republican and the chairman on the House side on FHA \nmodernization, and they have made good progress toward a final \nconsensus, maybe a good preconference agreement. On GSE reform, the \nHouse has passed by a wide margin legislation to provide for that \nregulatory reform and also to provide for the creation of an affordable \nhousing fund, something strongly pushed and supported by Senator Jack \nReed for a number of years.\n  There is a whole lot, frankly, that we have in common. We are going \nto vote in a few minutes on a motion to invoke cloture on the motion to \nproceed to the proposal that was brought to the floor by our Democratic \nleader. My fear is we are not going to get consent to proceed to the \nbill, which, on the face of it, is unfortunate because I believe there \nis a whole lot more agreement here than one might imagine.\n  I yield to my friend from Florida to add to this discussion and take \naway\n\n[[Page S1362]]\n\nwhatever he might wish. I actually believe there is more in common by \nfar than there is in disharmony.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Madam President, I appreciate the Senator's efforts to \nmove this process forward. He and I have been committed to the idea \nthat there are problems the American people are facing as it relates to \nhousing that are impacting the overall economy, and we need to act.\n  I agree with the ideas the Senator has put forward. There are a \nnumber of other good ideas out there. Senator Feinstein and myself have \ncosponsored a bill regarding mortgage brokers. The proposal by Senator \nIsakson from Georgia, while perhaps a modification might be appropriate \nin terms of the cost of it, I think is a great idea. The idea is that \nwe encourage families, through tax incentives, to buy homes, unoccupied \nhomes, foreclosed homes, to try to lower the inventory of unoccupied \nhomes; to do, frankly, part of what I don't believe is a terrific idea, \nwhich is to increase CDBG to deal with neighborhoods where there are \nforeclosures going on. I think a better idea is to put people in those \nhomes through tax incentives. These are debatable points. They are good \nideas that can be commonly shared.\n  The whole point is, we have to stick with it. This ought to not just \nbe a symbolic act today to say: Oh, gee, we tried to do something on \nhousing, and in a typical way, we each went to our respective corners \nand could not agree. We have to keep working on this issue. We are not \nthat far apart. The ideas are mutually understood. GSE reform has been \non the table a long time, and it has to be done. On FHA modernization, \nI know that Ranking Member Shelby, Chairman Dodd, and the House Members \nhave been working diligently to get to something on that. We are close \non that issue. That could be part of this package. Those things will \nhelp create more liquidity in the mortgage market, they will help put \nAmericans back in the housing business.\n  The news today on the mortgage and housing starts was not good news. \nI was fortunate when I was at HUD that the news only got better every \nmonth. This month's news on housing starts, on the price of homes \ndropping, issues such as these, is not encouraging. We have to act. We \nhave an obligation to act, not just make a political point.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CARPER. Reclaiming my time, Madam President, I say in conclusion \nthat the American people want us to get things done. They want us to \naddress the mortgage crisis. There is a way to do that that involves \nsome very good Democratic ideas and some very good Republican ideas. \nFrankly, there are a number of good ideas we share in common, and there \nis a whole lot more we share than we do not.\n  At the end of the day, I think Senator Isakson's tax credit idea \ncould be accepted in some form to go with some increase in CDBGs, \ncommunity development block grants. We could do both, maybe not as much \nof either as was originally proposed but a little of both. Let's see \nhow they work and then, after a year or so, see if there is one or the \nother that makes more sense to do additionally.\n  I think what is going to happen today, unfortunately, is we are going \nto have this vote on a motion to invoke cloture on the motion to \nproceed on the housing package. It is going to go down. My hope is that \nas soon as it goes down, if it does, my leader, Senator Reid, and the \nRepublican leader, Senator McConnell, will go through a finite list of \namendments, maybe five or so on a side. We are not interested in \nnongermane amendments. We are interested in amendments that speak \ndirectly to the housing crisis on our side and the Republican side, and \nwe ought to be able to define that list. Senator Isakson's idea is one. \nSenator Martinez has a couple of good ideas, one he shares with Senator \nFeinstein. Senator Specter has some ideas on bankruptcy provisions that \nI may not support, but they certainly deserve to be debated and heard. \nAnd we have some ideas on our side as well.\n  My hope is, again, if this goes down today, that it is just a hiccup \nand not a heart attack, that we are going to come back and actually go \nto work to develop a consensus package that I know is there. It is \nliterally there within our grasp. We can have not just a Democratic or \na Republican win or a win for the administration, but we are going to \nhave a win for the hundreds of thousands of people who are in danger of \nlosing their homes. We can do something about this in the next several \ndays, and we need to. I am going to join hands and arms with my \ncolleagues, Senator Martinez, Senator Dodd, Senator Shelby, and others \nwho care as passionately about this issue as we do, to join our leaders \nin making sure we do get the job done.\n  I yield back whatever time I have remaining. I thank my friend from \nAlabama for his graciousness in yielding time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, what is our time on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 8 minutes 8 seconds remaining. The \nmajority has 3 minutes 40 seconds.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I understand the pending business has \nbeen the legislation by Senator Feingold, Senator Reid, and Senator \nMenendez to require another report within 60 days involving the \nSecretary of Defense, Secretary of State, Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the Director \nof National Intelligence. All of them are supposed to drop the war on \nterrorism they are leading and have explained to us repeatedly and in \nmeticulous detail and write another report.\n  They keep asking for reports. They asked for a report by General \nPetraeus when we sent him to Iraq last summer. We voted overwhelmingly, \na bipartisan vote, to send him. We were worried at the time, I have to \nadmit, about how things were going in Iraq. I remember asking him: \nGeneral Petraeus, if things don't get better, if you believe we cannot \nbe successful, will you tell us? He said that he would. He also said he \nbelieved we could be successful if we utilized the plans and ideas and \nprograms he was going to execute and was executing. He went and he came \nback and gave us a report in September. GEN Jimmy Jones, a retired \nMarine general, and 12 other participants went to the region and \nreturned to give us a report, as did the Government Accountability \nOffice.\n  We heard all those reports, and we sent General Petraeus forward and \nwe said, continue on, because we were beginning by September to see \nsome substantial reduction in violence in the neighborhoods in Iraq. We \ndidn't know if it was permanent, how far it would go, but the trends \nwere beginning, for at least a few weeks prior to his report, to look \nconsiderably better.\n  As a result of all of that, we allowed General Petraeus to continue \nwith the plan as he explained to us because we evaluated that the \nstrategy he was implementing was working. Since then, we continue to \nsee the most miraculous, one must say, reduction in violence--60, 80, \n90 percent in some areas in the country, 60 percent nationwide \nreduction in violence. We have had circumstances where the local people \nhave joined in awakening groups, or citizens groups, and have turned \nagainst al-Qaida. Some of the people had been working with al-Qaida, \nfrankly, but they realized this was a violent, vicious, dominating \ngroup with whom they had no prospect of ever living peacefully.\n  General Conway, the Commandant of the Marine Corps, testified this \nmorning before the Armed Services Committee, of which I am a member, \nand he discussed that issue. The marines met with these local tribal \nleaders and made an arrangement, and they turned on al-Qaida, attacked \nthem and have killed them, and they have helped us kill them because \nthey do not agree with them anymore and they have learned the true \nnature of this group.\n  The violence is dropping, and Shia groups and councils and awakening \ngroups are forming in other areas of the country. In Al Anbar, a mostly \nSunni province, remarkable progress toward stability and a decline in \nviolence has been made. So why do we want to ask for another report?\n  I note that this bill, S. 2634, was dropped in the same day and by \nthe same people who authored the bill to demand a precipitous \nwithdrawal from Iraq. The Iraq Study Group, an independent group, said \nthat such a withdrawal would be a ``victory of historic proportions'' \nfor al-Qaida.\n\n[[Page S1363]]\n\n  I want to be frank: The people who are proposing this report, the \npeople who have called for the precipitous withdrawal from Iraq want us \nout of there and do not care about any of the consequences.\n  We are a great nation. We committed our military. We committed our \nNation. We committed our resources. We committed the lives of our \nmilitary by more than a three-fourths vote to this enterprise, and in \nrecent months we have had a most dramatic turn for the better. Why now \nwould we want to promote a precipitous withdrawal? Why now would we \ndemand more and more reports that, if read carefully, have no potential \nto lead to a constructive benefit toward the mission we have \nundertaken? I don't think it would do anything other than make it more \ndifficult for our military, more difficult for General Petraeus and our \nDefense Department to be successful.\n\n  So I urge my colleagues to oppose this. Let's be mature as a nation. \nLet's not snatch defeat from the jaws of victory. This matter is not \nover, don't get me wrong. I don't portend to suggest in any way that \nthese better numbers and downward trends in violence and progress made \npolitically is guaranteed to continue. We are going to have hiccups and \nproblems, I am certain, but it is certainly going in the right \ndirection today.\n  I would urge us not to destabilize that, not to pass resolutions that \ncan only be interpreted by our allies, by the Iraqis, by our own \nsoldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines that are there in Iraq as an \nambivalent attitude toward what they are doing, by placing their very \nlives at risk for this policy. Why in the world would we want to send \nsuch a message?\n  I think it would be a big mistake, and I ask my colleagues to join \nwith me in opposing this legislation.\n  I thank the Chair and would ask how much time is left on this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 27 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I yield back the remaining time, and, Madam President, \nI suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, the mortgage foreclosure crisis in \nMichigan is dire. Nearly 80,000 homes are expected to be lost to \nforeclosure by 2009. Michigan ranks third in the country in foreclosure \nrates, and fifth in the country in number of foreclosure filings. \nMichigan has seen an increase in the number of foreclosure filings of \n282 percent since 2005.\n  My State is not alone in this crisis, nor are homeowners facing \nforeclosure the only ones being affected. The entire housing industry, \nand by many accounts our entire economy, is being dragged down by \nmounting mortgage woes. It is urgent that we move forward on this bill \nto address these problems and provide immediate help across the Nation. \nWe need to keep families in their homes, and we need to keep this \ncrisis from further weighing down our economy.\n  Recently, I convened a series of roundtable meetings in a number of \nMichigan communities. Leaders from local and State government, as well \nas organizations who are in the trenches working with families facing \nforeclosure, came together to discuss practical ways to help homeowners \nand protect our economy from further damage. When I asked for their \nfeedback on this bill, they thought it would help address a number of \nthe problems they highlighted.\n  Across Michigan, there are communities that would like to \nrehabilitate abandoned and foreclosed properties so that surrounding \nproperty values do not continue to fall. But currently the funds do not \nexist to do that. This bill provides $4 billion in Federal block grants \nto areas with the highest foreclosure rates to help rehabilitate \nabandoned or foreclosed properties and prevent further damage to local \nhousing values.\n  Across Michigan, foreclosure prevention counselors are overwhelmed, \nand a lack of funds is tying the hands of local groups trying to help \nkeep families on track. This bill would provide $200 million for this \nmuch needed preforeclosure counseling.\n  There are also many homeowners who are facing the financial pressures \nof owing more on their mortgages than the current dollar value of their \nhouses, a situation known as being ``underwater.'' There is a critical \nneed for more affordable loans to help these families refinance and \nstay in their current homes. Most homeowners do not want to uproot \ntheir children and leave their community behind, even if the balance of \ntheir mortgage is greater than the current market value of their home.\n  This bill would help address this problem by authorizing States to \nissue $10 billion in new tax-exempt bonds to help homeowners refinance \nadjustable rate mortgages. States will have the flexibility to use the \nproceeds of these bonds to refinance mortgages. This is a key component \nto turning the current mortgage market around.\n  Ameliorating our foreclosure crisis will require a team effort among \nFederal, State, and local governments, community and neighborhood \norganizations, and lenders, brokers, and borrowers. This bill \nrecognizes that fact. It provides an opportunity to help keep \nstruggling families in their homes. It provides an opportunity to help \nrestore our housing markets so that families can own a home. It \nprovides an opportunity to help keep declining property values stable. \nWe need to take up this bill now, debate it, consider amendments, and \nthen pass it. To not do so would be to sit idly by while a multitude of \nAmericans needlessly suffer.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, momentarily we will be having a \nprocedural vote, a cloture vote on a motion to proceed to what has been \nstyled a housing bill. I will be urging my colleagues to oppose the \ncloture motion to proceed to the housing bill.\n  Having said that, it is my hope that at some point during the vote we \nwill be able to negotiate between the majority and the minority a \nprocess for fairly considering alternatives, and I have had some \ndiscussions with the majority leader to that effect.\n  In fact, I offered a consent earlier this afternoon that there be up \nto five amendments per side permitted, if we turn to the bill. It is \nstill my hope that at some point we will negotiate a process by which \nwe can have fair consideration of alternatives.\n  Now, my colleagues and I just completed a news conference at which we \nlaid out a comprehensive growth plan for America in a variety of \ndifferent areas that most Republicans believe would advance the \neconomic security of our country. Portions of that proposal might well \nbe offered as an amendment to the underlying bill, were we to be \npermitted to do that.\n  It is my hope that the majority leader and I will have further \ndiscussions after this vote about a process by which we might be able \nto turn to the bill that would be fair to both sides. After all, I know \nthere are some bipartisan discussions going on that will improve the \nbill. Senator Carper has been in discussion with Senator Martinez and \nothers on both sides of the aisle with suggestions that might have \nbipartisan support that are not a part of the current proposal upon \nwhich we will have the procedural vote shortly.\n  So until such time as we can get an agreement that is fair to both \nsides, and gives other Senators who have ideas an opportunity to offer \nthose ideas and have them voted on by the entire Senate, I urge my \ncolleagues to oppose cloture on the motion to proceed to the proposal \nas it stands right now.\n  Hopefully, at some time in the near future we will have a chance to \namend it, to modify it, to offer new suggestions to it to improve it, \nand maybe have the same kind of experience we had on the FISA earlier \nthis year where we came together on a bipartisan basis and passed \nsomething overwhelmingly.\n  We had a similar experience at the end of the stimulus package in the \nSenate. We came together at the end and passed a package \noverwhelmingly. There is no good reason we cannot have an amalgam of \nboth Democratic and Republican ideas added to this proposal that would \nstrengthen it, make it more bipartisan, make it more likely that it \nwould become law.\n  So for the short term, I would urge my Members to oppose cloture on \nthe\n\n[[Page S1364]]\n\nmotion to proceed. Hopefully, we will be able to work out some kind of \nprocess for handling this in a fair way.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. The reason the rules of the Senate are set up as they are \nis to give Senators the ability to protect themselves.\n  However, the motion to proceed has been abused. Everything that we \nhave tried to do, everything--we have had to file cloture on a motion \nto proceed--is unnecessary. I have stated publicly for the press, \neveryone who would listen to me, that this is a piece of legislation \nthat we should work on.\n  The Republicans, all Republicans, should understand they lose nothing \nby moving forward on the motion to proceed. If they find after that \nthat the Democrats are totally unreasonable, then we do not get cloture \non the bill. That is the procedure. Why waste all of this time, 30 \nhours? Why make us go through this process?\n  If cloture is not invoked, who knows if we will ever get back to the \nbill again. I will try. We will not go off it right away. I told my \ndistinguished Republican colleague that.\n  America is facing a foreclosure crisis, a dramatic economic slowdown. \nToday the Commerce Department declared such. Yet at a press conference \nthe President held today, he said America is not heading toward a \nrecession. Who agrees with that other than the President? Countless \neconomists disagree with that.\n  The American people know that whatever you call it--a slowdown, a \nslump, a downturn, or recession--people in every 1 of our 50 States are \nstruggling to make ends meet and looking to us to set things right \nagain.\n  The housing crisis is the eye of the economic storm. Here are the \nfacts: The number of homes being foreclosed upon across the country \nrose 57 percent in January, last month. Home prices experienced the \nsteepest drop in 20 years, sagging 9 percent in the final quarter of \n2007, and the worst had not come by then.\n  Foreclosures are expected to exceed 2 million in the coming years. \nNationwide, that would wipe out $223 billion in home equity. Some of \nthat is in neighboring homes. This does not include the lost value of \nhomes that undergo the actual foreclosure process.\n  In Nevada, the numbers are worse: 95 percent increase in foreclosures \nlast month, 61 percent in the Reno/Sparks area. The situation is bad \nand likely to get worse all over the country. But we have an \nopportunity today to make a responsible and necessary step to make \nthings better.\n  My friends on the other side of the aisle are aware of these \nchallenges. I think, and I respectfully say, it is a bad decision for \nRepublicans to follow again the advice of the respected leader to not \nvote for cloture on a motion to proceed.\n  I repeat, if we get on the bill and you find that you do not like \nwhat is going on, there are 49 of you. Do not vote for cloture on the \nbill. My friends on the other side of the aisle are aware of all of the \nchallenges we have. They read the same newspapers, attend the same \nhearings, live and visit the same neighborhoods around the country \nbecause all of the neighborhoods are the same, with rare exception.\n  They recognized the Nation's economic challenges by working with us \nto pass the Economic Stimulus Act of 2008. It did not have everything \nin it that I wanted passed. We passed something the President did not \nwant. That is good. It was a bipartisan effort. That plan was a decent \nfirst step, but it was only a start, and I said so at the time.\n  Secretary Paulson, whom I admire, deserves credit, too, for helping \nto lead the mortgage industry to voluntarily respond. These efforts \nwill help but, once again, they are just a step, a baby step. Less than \n3 percent of the homes at risk would avoid foreclosure under the \nadministration's plan; 97-plus percent would not.\n  This will help a little. I repeat, a baby step. Baby steps will not \nsolve this crisis. A less than 3-percent improvement will not solve the \ncrisis. We need more than baby steps, we need bolder steps. The bill \nnow before us is a bolder step.\n  It will make a real tangible difference to homeowners, neighborhoods, \nand our economy. More than 700,000 families will benefit from this \nbill; 80,000 vacant foreclosed homes will be put back to productive \nuse; 30,000 jobs and a $10 billion boost in economic activity will be \ncreated.\n  This bill could be a real bipartisan accomplishment. It would be a \nsign to the American people all across this country that we can help. I \nhope my colleagues will support this cloture motion.\n  One of my friends who is great at working both sides of the aisle--my \nfriend is a Democrat. He worked with a number of my friends on the \nother side of the aisle. And he said: Here are some of the amendments \nthey want to offer. Isakson wants to offer a piece of legislation which \nis a tax credit for housing purchases. I like it. I think it would be a \nnice addition to our bill, would improve the bill.\n  Appraiser oversight and independence: Senator Martinez, who was \nformerly the HUD Director and Cabinet officer, thinks there should be \nappraiser oversight and independence. I like it. That is a good idea. \nThat is something we should debate and see if it should be put on this \nbill and approved.\n\n  I was told that Senator Specter wants to make some changes on the \nhome mortgage bankruptcy provision. I do not agree with Senator \nSpecter, but that is something that is valid and should be able to be \noffered on this piece of legislation.\n  All I am saying to my friends is they are making a big mistake by \nobjecting to our proceeding to this bill. There is no reasonable, \nrational reason for doing that other than to stall. I think that would \nbe a shame.\n  I hope there would be an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote on this most \nimportant piece of legislation so that we can move forward on it and \nattempt to work something out on the amendment process. If we do not \nwork anything out, I repeat for the third time in the last 10 minutes, \nthey do not have to give us cloture on the bill. They have nothing to \nlose. There are 49 of them.\n  But I think they are sending the wrong message to the American people \ntoday, saying this bill we have, which calls for things the President \nsays he wants done: revenue bonds--he called for that in the State of \nthe Union--more money for mortgage counselors. That seems fairly \nreasonable to everybody. I think that is something we should do. The \nbankruptcy provision, which I think is such a step forward, the \nprovision that we have dealing with community block grants is important \nto bring houses that are in foreclosure back to be a productive part of \nwhat we are doing.\n  Everything we have called for in this piece of legislation is \nreasonable and fair and sound. And we should do it. I would certainly \nhope that my friends on the other side of the aisle will stop doing \nwhat they are doing. I think it sends a terribly bad message to the \nAmerican people: Republicans do not want to legislate on anything--\nanything, even the housing crisis.\n  I cannot imagine what they benefit from doing that other than slowing \ndown the process. It will prevent us from doing something later on in \nthe year. But we are going to continue to work on this legislation. If \nthey defeat cloture, we are going to keep talking about it and talking \nabout it because this is the eye of the storm. This is what is causing \nmost of our problems in the economy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If all time is yielded back, under the \nprevious order, the motion to proceed to S. 2634 is withdrawn.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/28/senate-section/article/S1364-1", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1364-S1376]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nNEW DIRECTION FOR ENERGY INDEPENDENCE, NATIONAL SECURITY, AND CONSUMER \nPROTECTION ACT AND THE RENEWABLE ENERGY AND ENERGY CONSERVATION TAX ACT \n                       OF 2007--MOTION TO PROCEED\n\n\n                             cloture motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I now move to proceed to H.R. 3221, the \nhousing stimulus legislation.\n  This motion is debatable; is that right, Madam Chair?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion is pending.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, everyone here within the sound of my voice \nshould understand a minute ago there was a big victory. The people on \nWall Street are high-fiving. They won again. The big banks won again. \nMortgage bankers won again.\n  There are a few losers out there, such as millions of consumers, \nmillions of people whose homes are going into foreclosure or about to \ngo into foreclosure. They lost. But there has been a victory. There has \nbeen a victory. Anyone within the sound of my voice who does not \nunderstand what took place should understand what took place.\n  I had one of my Democratic Senators walk over to me and say Well, \nthey are doing that because you filled the tree. That is wrong. It is \nnot true. In fact, it is quite the opposite. I said: What do my friends \nhave to lose by allowing us to proceed to legislate on this most \nimportant piece of legislation, housing stimulus? If, in fact, they do \nnot like what happens with the legislating aspect of this--there are 49 \nof them--they would not give us cloture on the bill. But why not \nattempt to legislate this?\n  I indicated I have been told there are Republicans who wish to offer \namendments. I, before this vote took place, said I think it is a good \nidea what they want to offer. One of them was by Johnny Isakson--a tax \ncredit for housing purchases, a pretty good idea. I may not agree on \nthe $5,000 number; maybe it would be $4,000. But I think it is a pretty \ngood idea he came up with.\n  I said Mel Martinez, who before coming to the Senate was a member of \nthe President's Cabinet as HUD Secretary, has an idea about appraisal \noversight and independence. I think it is a pretty good idea. He should \nbe able to offer that amendment.\n  I do not agree with what Senator Specter wants to do; that is, to \nchange the bankruptcy provision. But he should be able to offer that.\n  So any guise of not feeling that they are going to be treated fairly \nis a misdirection. Again, as has happened for such a long time since we \ntook the majority--I recognize we have a slim majority, and it makes it \nvery difficult to legislate, especially on the other side, when \nvirtually everything is stopped.\n  On the last stimulus package we had, we got something from the House \nthat had a rebate to individuals. We thought that should be changed, so \nwe added, out of the Finance Committee, a lot of good things in that \nlegislation. We added 21.5 million seniors, 250,000 disabled American \nveterans, and many of the things that are in the housing stimulus \npackage.\n  It was defeated, and there were editorials written--obviously, my \nRepublican friends pay no attention to them--that said it was the wrong \nthing to do, that the Republicans stopping our vision of what the \nstimulus package should be was wrong and not good for the country.\n  Well, I hope all those editorial writers understand what took place \nhere. This was a very narrow piece of legislation we have been trying \nto move forward on--very narrow. It had five provisions in it, one of \nwhich the President called for in his State of the Union Message--\nrevenue bonds--and the water has been carried over here by Senator John \nKerry.\n  We had a provision in this stimulus package that called for more \nmoney for counselors to deal with people who are losing their homes. \nThey are out of money again. I do not think it is too outlandish to \nhave mortgage counselors be able to sit down and talk to people about \ntheir homes.\n  We had a provision in here for CDBG moneys to go back to communities \nto work on homes that are being foreclosed upon. I think that is a step \nin the right direction.\n  We had a provision in this legislation that dealt with having these \ndocuments people deal with when they are buying a home more \ntransparent. That came from Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island--a very \nnice piece of legislation.\n  Finally, we had in this piece of legislation something that I think \nis extremely important; that is, a piece of legislation, which makes up \npart of this, which says that if you have a home that is being \nforeclosed upon, you should be able to go to bankruptcy and see if you \ncan work something out on that. The bankruptcy judge would be able to \nwork with you.\n  Right now it is against the law to do that. If you have a primary \nhome, and you want to buy a ranch to go play with on weekends or \nsomeplace on the beach, and you decide you run out of money later, you \ncan go in and work with the bankruptcy court to try to refinance and \nreadjust those loans--but not your primary residence. So my friend, \nSenator Durbin from Illinois, has been working on this for a long \ntime--it did not come about in the last week or two--saying people who \nare about to lose their primary residence should be able to have the \nauspices of the bankruptcy court to try to work something out. It is \nlimited in time and scope--a very good piece of legislation; not a \nshotgun, a rifle shot.\n  Georgetown University did a study, and they said Durbin's provision \nwould not raise the interest rates a fraction of a hundredth of a \npercent--nothing, it would not affect it at all.\n  So I am at a loss--well, that is not true because it is obvious why \nit is being done. The stall is still on. The stall is still on. There \nis no reason in the world we should not be moving forward to try to \nwork something out on\n\n[[Page S1366]]\n\na housing stimulus package. It is simply unfair what my colleagues have \ndone. At the last count, there was one Republican who voted to move \nforward on this legislation. There could be more, but I saw one.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I listened with a certain level of \nincredulity to my good friend the majority leader discussing the vote \nwe had a few moments ago. Of course, this was a measure not crafted by \nthe Banking Committee led by Senator Dodd and Senator Shelby. I am not \ncertain whether Senator Dodd was consulted. I am fairly confident \nSenator Shelby was not consulted.\n  We know there is widespread opposition to the so-called cram-down \nprovision, and we know that almost everybody in America, apparently, \nwith the exception of one study at Georgetown that I heard my good \nfriend the majority leader quote, believes it will drive up interest \nrates for all Americans in order to presumably benefit some Americans. \nThis is the kind of thing that happens when you have a hastily \nconcocted political exercise, which it strikes me we just went through.\n  Now, the way to legislate in a body such as the Senate is to come up \nwith a fair process for consideration. In fact, I offered it prior to \nthe vote, I say to my good friend the majority leader, that we would go \nto the measure, take up five amendments on each side, and have a normal \nlegislative process leading to actually making a law rather than trying \nto create an issue. So we are still very much interested in seeing what \nwe can do in this area.\n\n  The majority leader mentioned the Isakson amendment. There is a lot \nof support on this side of the aisle for the Isakson amendment. I know \nthere are conversations between Senator Carper and Senator Martinez \nthat could conceivably lead to a bipartisan proposal that would enjoy \nsupport on both sides of the aisle. The way to achieve something such \nas that is through the consultative process that we frequently engage \nin around here when we are serious about legislating. So I would \nreiterate to my good friend the majority leader that I am open to any \ndiscussions for a unanimous consent agreement that gives both sides an \nopportunity to have their ideas considered.\n  We all know the Nation's economy is slowing. We all believe there is \nan appropriate role for the Government to play in trying to lessen that \ndecline in the economy, and we are happy to try to work on a bipartisan \nbasis to achieve a result, and that opportunity is still before us. Now \nthat the box has been checked on the other side, maybe we can get \nserious now about trying to do something that will actually make a \ndifference. I stand ready to talk to my good friend the majority leader \nabout that at any time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Florida). The majority leader is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I don't know how to say this other than say \nit the way I feel. It is an insult to me to say I would bring a bill to \nthe floor without talking to my chairmen. One thing I pride myself on \nis that when I took this job, I gave every one of my ranking members \nthen, now my chairs, the absolute authority to run their committees, \nand I would not interfere with their committees.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Would the majority leader yield?\n  Mr. REID. No. I want the record to reflect I would never consider \nputting a piece of legislation on the floor without talking to my \nchairmen. I talked to Senator Dodd, I talked to Senator Leahy, I talked \nto Senator Baucus about what was going to be in this. So that is so \nfarfetched that it is hard for me to conceive of how my friend could \nsay that.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I didn't say it. I did not say it. That is why I was \ntrying to get the majority leader to yield. I said I don't know whether \nyou consulted with your chairmen. I am fairly confident you didn't \nconsult with the ranking member, so my remarks don't need to be \ncorrected since I didn't say it.\n  Mr. REID. Well, we will get the remarks and let the record speak for \nitself.\n  I would also say this: Yes, we have Georgetown, and we have a friend \nof mine whom I served in the House of Representatives with who is \nformer Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, a Republican, and a \ncard-carrying conservative--Jack Kemp--who thinks what we are doing is \nvery good; in fact, he has written about it. This isn't something we \nthrew together in 5 minutes. Most of this stuff was in the stimulus \npackage they voted down before.\n  So the economists support what we are doing. It will not increase the \nbankruptcy provision of my friend, the senior Senator from Illinois; it \nwill not increase the interest rates, this bankruptcy thing. We all \nknow that. This piece of legislation is so important.\n  When my friend, the Republican leader, said he wanted five \namendments--listen to the boundaries of the amendments--having to deal \nwith housing and the economy, well, that is pretty wide-ranging. I told \neverybody who was within the sound of my voice, if we wanted to offer \nfive amendments to this piece of legislation or any other piece of \nlegislation, the Republican leader, rightfully so, would like to see \nwhat that amendment would say. I said the same applies to the \nRepublicans. You can't have it both ways. If, in the process of trying \nto work something out it doesn't work out right, they have the ultimate \nbig hammer here, and that is cloture. Two steps: One that we haven't \nused very much, except in the last year since we have gotten the \nmajority, which is a motion to proceed and cloture on that. We didn't \nget that. It is too bad. But had we been able to do that, we would have \ngone immediately to legislating on some of the things that I think are \nimportant.\n  I am very troubled about the normal legislative process. We haven't \nbeen in the normal legislative process for some time now, and I am \nanxious to do everything I can to move forward on this piece of \nlegislation. It is obvious that my friends do not want to. I am sorry \nabout that. But anyone who said this has been a hastily concocted \npolitical exercise is wrong.\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Would my colleague from Nevada yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I wish to ask my colleague from Nevada: \nWouldn't it be true that the ambit the minority leader asked for would \nallow the other side to automatically have amendments on, say, renewing \nthe President's tax cuts, or undoing what happened with the estate tax, \nand repealing the entire estate tax; nothing to do with this housing \nbill? That is my first question.\n  My second question is: If the minority leader showed the majority \nleader five amendments that were within the confines of this \nlegislation--ideas such as the Isakson idea or the Martinez idea or \nothers such as that--that he would willingly go along and we would come \nto the floor and debate the amendments and move the bill forward but \nthat the parameters the minority leader has asked for would allow us to \ndebate the whole--everything but the kitchen sink and bring up all \nthese old saws that we have been through again; isn't that correct?\n  Mr. REID. I would say to my friend, I indicated I don't like what \nSenator Specter is trying to do with this bill. He has an absolute \nright to offer that, and he should be able to do that. What he wants to \ndo basically is have a Durbin line--basically strike the provision on \nbankruptcy. I don't like that. But it is in keeping with what this \nlegislation would be. The parameters I don't like have to do with \nhousing and the economy. Now, try that one on.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, asking another question, that could mean \nrenew the Bush tax cuts until 2025. That could be within the ambit of \nwhat the minority leader asked for; is that correct?\n  Mr. REID. That is true. I don't know how much more I can telegraph my \npunches. I said--you were present, Senator Durbin was present, and \nSenator Murray was present when we met with scores of press people \ntoday. They said: Are you going to allow amendments? I said: Yes, happy \nto have amendments. Talk about telegraphing my punches.\n  One of my Democratic colleagues--I will mention his name because he \nwould not care--Senator Carper from Delaware, he said: Here are some \namendments they might want to offer. How do you feel about that? Fine. \nI want to legislate to deal with the housing crisis. We have a housing \ncrisis. I have one in Nevada, you have one in Illinois, you have one in \nNew York, you\n\n[[Page S1367]]\n\nhave a real big one in Michigan, and California has 25 percent of all \nthe foreclosures in the country. Everyplace in America has a problem \nwith that.\n  We could stimulate the economy. I defy anyone to say that what we are \ndoing would not stimulate the economy.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, one more question to the leader: Has the \nminority leader shown the five amendments to us he wishes to offer, or \nhe just sort of wants a carte blanche, more or less?\n  Mr. REID. I am the one who suggested the amendments that I have heard \nthe Republicans want to offer. The answer is, no, I have not seen a \nsingle amendment. I didn't start talking about amendments this morning. \nWhen I moved to this piece of legislation, I told the distinguished \nRepublican leader, let's work something out on amendments. The original \nnumber of five came from me.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Is it a pretty fair assumption that what the minority \nleader is doing, maybe for himself, maybe for others in his caucus, is \nhe wants an opportunity to get off the housing debate and go on to the \nold saws we always hear from them on, such as the estate tax, Bush tax \ncuts, and other things not relevant to this bill? Would that be a \nreasonable assumption, given the minority leader's actions?\n  Mr. REID. Yes. I say to my friend, things that have done so much good \nfor our economy--so much good for our economy. We are upside down with \nred ink on everything.\n  So the answer is: Yes. We need more tax cuts, we need more money \nspent on wars around the country, around the world.\n  I don't know of anybody who thinks the economy is doing very well. \nEven today we had the President say things are not good, but we are not \nin a recession. I think the economists would totally disagree.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Would the majority leader yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. I will yield.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I would like to ask the majority leader to \nreflect on what has happened this week: the routine motion in the \nSenate the motion to proceed--in other words, to start considering a \nmeasure--we have tried to do that three times this week.\n  Is it not true that the Republican minority has engineered efforts to \nstop a vote on changing the policy on the war in Iraq, has stopped a \nvote on having accountability in a report on the war on terrorism; and \nthrough the Chair I would ask, now with this measure has stopped an \neffort to try to bring some relief to the 2.2 million Americans \nfrom States all over who face foreclosure on their mortgages?\n\n  I would ask the majority leader, reflecting on what has happened this \nweek, is this not a continuation of what we went through all last year \nwhen the Senate Republicans broke the record in the Senate with 62 \nfilibusters?\n  Mr. REID. In 1 year. They broke a 2-year record in 1 year, and this \nis ongoing.\n  This is an extremely perplexing situation in which we find ourselves. \nFor my friend, the distinguished Republican leader, to stand and say \nthat it was incredulous what I had done. Incredulous? I am trying to \nlegislate. I have a piece of legislation out here which has five \nprovisions in it. Everyone knows what those five provisions are. No \ntricks, no filling the tree, let's work something out on amendments, \nand that is incredulous?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, before the majority leader leaves and others \nleave, the majority whip, let me point out that just as these \npresentations were made, we had a long discussion, we had two caucuses, \nthe Senate Democratic caucuses--not unlike when the Republicans have \ntheir conference every week--to talk about the various provisions. In \nfact, I made the presentation briefly before the caucus 2 weeks ago \ninvolving these various ideas. There were a lot of other ideas. There \nwas an exclusive list in terms of what we could do in order to generate \na new level of optimism in our economy mostly related to the housing \ncrisis which is the epicenter of this problem.\n  So I want the record to reflect that as the chairman of the Senate \nBanking Committee, I know the chairman of the Finance Committee and the \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Leahy, were all involved \nin those discussions, as were others who had various other ideas as to \nwhether to include them in a package, other amendments. This obviously \nwas work in progress, but it is important that the record reflect that \nthere was an ongoing conversation about this.\n  Mr. REID. Will my friend yield for a question?\n  Mr. DODD. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. I think the Senator would acknowledge there were things I \nwanted to put in this bill and he said it is not the right time to do \nit. I accepted his jurisdiction of the Banking Committee, and I called \nhim and said, OK--I didn't say Mr. Chairman--I said OK, Chris, we will \nnot put them in there. We had full consultation.\n  I am very proud of my chairs. The three whom I talked about are some \nof the best legislators this country has ever had. Chris Dodd is \ncertainly one of those. I feel this Senate and this country are in good \nhands with Senator Dodd as chairman of that committee. I like his \nranking member. Senator Shelby and I served in the House together. He \nis a fine man. I say to my friend from Connecticut, to his credit--that \nis the Senator from Connecticut--he said: I don't have this thing or \ntwo worked out with Dick Shelby yet. I think it would be better if we \nnot do it. So I, harping on this--and perhaps it doesn't call for an \nanswer, but I admire and respect the work this Senator does in the \nForeign Relations Committee, in the Banking Committee now as chair. He \nis a top-notch Senator.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank the leader very much for that, and \nhe is absolutely correct. In fact, he raised an issue, and I said I \nhaven't talked with Senator Shelby and that is the reason he graciously \nacquiesced to my desire to keep a certain matter out of the committee \nproposal until we had an understanding. That is the way this body \nfunctions well, so you have to have that kind of relationship. You can \nmake two choices. You can propose things and throw them out there in \nthe hopes that something may happen, but usually they don't because you \nhaven't bothered to consult, or you can do it the other way, which is \nslower, more deliberate, more frustrating in some ways, but ultimately \nyou produce products people can support.\n  I wish to point out that in the last year, the Banking Committee \nmarked up some 17 pieces of legislation and had 35 hearings. Of those \n17 pieces of legislation, 7 of them have become law. There were only \ntwo negative votes cast against all those provisions because Richard \nShelby, the Senator from Alabama, the former chairman of the committee, \nand I worked those matters out in a way so our colleagues, almost \nunanimously in every case, were able to support us.\n  I intended to actually speak before the cloture vote and was unable \nto do so with the time constraints.\n  I want to express, if I can, over the next few minutes, my concerns \nabout where we are economically in this country, as chairman of the \nBanking Committee. Today we had, once again, the Chairman of the \nFederal Reserve Board in front of the Banking Committee. Chairman \nBernanke was before the committee reporting, as the law requires, on \nmonetary policy. The conversation was not limited to that, as you might \nimagine. It covered the housing issues, foreclosure issues, as well as \nother questions under the jurisdiction of the Federal Reserve Board, as \nwell as matters of concern to both Democrats and Republicans. Several \nweeks ago, we had Chairman Bernanke, Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson, \nas well as Christopher Cox, Chairman of the SEC, before the Committee \nto discuss with us a wide range of issues covering the economy of our \nNation.\n  We have had hearings on a number of issues affecting the very \nquestion before us. A lot of this data has already been laid out by \nothers, but it is worth repeating to give a sense of the magnitude of \nthe problem. It is not exaggeration or hyperbole to suggest that we are \nin perilous times economically. This is not a normal downturn or sort \nof a problem that might go away in the next 6 or 8 months in the \nabsence of us taking action.\n  Let me say, I am a great believer in market forces. Almost a year \nago,\n\n[[Page S1368]]\n\nwhen this problem first emerged, as the new chairman of the Banking \nCommittee, I convened the members of the committee along with the \nstakeholders involved in the housing crisis in the committee room of \nthe Banking Committee. Senator Richard Shelby, to his credit, was there \nas we listened to the stakeholders talking about what could be done \nabsent legislation being passed, absent new regulations being \nformulated, in order to keep people in their homes who are facing \nforeclosure, and to minimize the problem of a growing number of \neconomic dislocations as a result of this housing crisis.\n  We were urged back in May, absent any legislation, to let the \nmarketplace work to develop a solution. For this Member, this is the \nideal solution, when it can work. I don't believe you have to jump in \nwith bills or regulations if the market can, in fact, provide answers. \nSo we sat back and said, ``let the market work.''\n  To some extent, the market did work--it flushed out many of the bad \noperators. Unfortunately, what has not happened is that the \nstakeholders have not really done what I thought they were going to do, \nwhich is aggressively endeavor to help those people who are in trouble \nand facing delinquencies or are on the brink of foreclosure to keep \npeople in their homes. This was not about helping investors. It was the \nowner-occupied homes we were concerned about.\n  Regrettably, I am here to tell you that a year later the number of \npeople helped out by that request has been minimal. I will share the \nstatistics of how small a number we are talking about. While the \nSecretary of the Treasury, Hank Paulson, whom I respect, still pursues \nand persists as he did again today, that this Hope Now Alliance effort \nmay work, this Member is less than optimistic about that having watched \nthe process fail to work for the past year, as the problem got larger. \nToday, the situation continues to deteriorate, and it is not limited to \nhousing. That is the point I want to make at the outset.\n  There is a contagion effect that is spreading to other parts of the \neconomy. So while I am disappointed that cloture was not invoked within \nthe last hour, my hope is that the leaders would give us another \nopportunity in the coming days, before we go into that March recess, \nthe Easter/Passover recess, to actually be able to put something \ntogether to present to our colleagues that might enjoy the bipartisan \nsupport that this issue deserves. So I appeal to them this evening, in \naddition to talking about the problem, to give Senators Shelby, Baucus, \nLeahy, Specter, and Grassley, the ranking Republicans on the respective \ncommittees, a chance to pull some things together in the next several \ndays and present that to our colleagues to see if we cannot do \nsomething about this issue. I make that plea this evening, and I am \nprepared to do whatever I can to try to accommodate many various ideas. \nThat is not to suggest that everything will be adopted, but it is \nworthy of this body's time to address itself to this issue.\n  The statistics I am about to share with you, I think, make the case \nmore eloquently than anything I could say this evening about the \nperilous circumstances in which we are operating today. The economy \nslowed to a crawl at the end of last year. Economic growth was six-\ntenths of 1 percent. The data that we have received so far this year \nindicates the problem is going to get worse in 2008. The country lost \njobs in January. That is the first time in 4 years that happened. \nCredit card delinquencies are on the rise as consumers find themselves \nincreasingly unable to tap into the equity of their homes to help pay \ndown their credit cards and other bills.\n  To put that into perspective, the median income of Americans is \naround $48,000 a year, I believe. Consumer debt, revolving debt, on \naverage, is $9,300 and growing. Savings rates are negative. So in \naddition to the Federal deficit, we should talk about consumer debt in \nthis country, which is growing. People's ability to resolve that \ngrowing debt problem has been significantly affected as a result of the \nloss of value in homes.\n  Lastly, inflation increased by 4.1 percent last year, the largest \nincrease in 17 years, driven mainly by the rising cost of energy, food, \nand health care as well. Industrial production is flat, and we have \nbeen hemorrhaging jobs in the manufacturing sector. Our national \neconomy is clearly in deep trouble. I don't enjoy saying that. That \nworries me.\n  One of the things I admire about Ben Bernanke, Chairman of the \nFederal Reserve Bank, is that he has been very clear about the problem. \nWhile we may not like to hear it, I am sure others would like him to \npaint a rosy picture about all of this. I think he is doing a good job \nas Chairman of the Federal Reserve in laying out clearly to the \nadministration and Members of Congress the seriousness of this problem. \nHe is judicious in his choice of words. He doesn't engage in alarmist \nlanguage. If you listen carefully to what he is saying, it is not \nsubstantially different than what I am saying.\n  We are in perilous times economically, and we need to spend time on \nthese issues in this body. We are charged with that by the American \npeople. This issue demands our attention. I hope we can come back to it \nin the coming days.\n  The epicenter of this economic trouble is the housing crisis. In \nfact, the current housing market is the worst since the Great \nDepression. That is not hyperbole, Mr. President.\n  For example, this first chart is titled ``Annual Change in Home \nValue.'' It indicates what home values have done over the last 8 years, \nfrom 2000 to 2008. In 2000, home values increased by almost 5 percent; \nin 2001, another 7 or 8 percent; and then another 8 percent; and in \n2005 in excess of 10 percent; and then the price increases slowed in \n2006. Then, for the first time nationally--not regionally--in 2007 we \nsee declining values. In 2008, we expect to see an even deeper \ndecline--in excess of 10 percent.\n  Mr. President, this is the first time since the Great Depression that \nhome values have declined nationally. All of us are familiar with \nregional declines. We saw that in the late 1980s. But this is the first \ntime that we have seen an annual drop in home values on a national \nbasis. It is worthwhile to note that. It is a major concern. While many \nof us have experienced home price drops in our regions or local \nmarkets, 2007 was the first year since data has been kept that the U.S. \nhad an annual decline nationwide on housing prices.\n  Case-Shiller data, released earlier this week, showed a 20-percent \ndecline in home prices from the fourth quarter of 2006 to the fourth \nquarter of 2007, the steepest decline ever recorded.\n\n  Mr. President, these words I am using ought to put this in \nperspective and give some indication of how serious this is. These are \nthe steepest declines ever recorded by this data.\n  A recent Moody's report forecasts that home values will drop in 2008 \nby 10 to 15 percent.\n  In 2007, as a whole, single-family home sales fell 13 percent. New \nhome sales fell in excess of 40 percent--actually, 40.7 percent year \nover year in December, the weakest performance in 27 years. In January, \nhome sales fell to their lowest levels in 9 years.\n  The inventory for existing homes for sale jumped by 5.5 percent in \nJanuary alone and stands at over 4 million units, almost double the \nnumber in January of 2005. This is equal to over 10 months of supply. \nThe ongoing glut of unsold homes means that home prices will continue \nto fall into the future. These are record numbers, in the last number \nof years.\n  We have not seen the worst of it, unfortunately. There are over 1 \nmillion borrowers with subprime and other exotic mortgages who are over \n60 days delinquent. With about 1.8 million subprime ARMs, valued at \nabout $500 billion resetting to higher rates in the next 18 months, \nthere is no doubt that this problem is going to deepen.\n  As a result, I will put up the second chart of official data. This \nsays ``New Homes Entering into Foreclosure.'' These are important \nnumbers. Already, when I gave you the title of this, you began to see, \nobviously, what is happening in the fourth quarter of 2007. These \nnumbers begin in the second quarter of 2005. I know it is hard to see. \nThe first number is the second quarter of 2005. The numbers run from \nthen to the fourth quarter of 2007, just ending a few months ago. You \ncan get some idea of the homes entering foreclosure in this country. \nAgain, it is in record numbers.\n\n[[Page S1369]]\n\n  We are experiencing historic highs in both the rate of new \nforeclosures and the percentage of all loans in foreclosure, according \nto the Mortgage Bankers Association.\n  Mark Zandi, an economist at Moodys.com, estimates that 3 million \nloans will default between 2007 and mid-2009, of which 2 million will \nend in foreclosure sale. Over 23 percent of subprime loans are now 60 \ndays or more delinquent in foreclosure. Those are huge numbers.\n  In January alone, Mr. President, foreclosures were up 57 percent, and \nbank repossessions were up 90 percent from January 2007, according to \nRealtyTrac data. There are currently 1.4 million families in \nforeclosure.\n  The third chart I want to show you gives you some idea of the \nmagnitude of this in terms of dollars and cents. It is called \n``Foreclosures: Impacts on Families.'' At least 2.2 million families \nare losing their homes. That is a staggering number. We always see \nevery year that there are some foreclosures. Now we are talking about \nnumbers that are unprecedented. The loss in home equity in the \nneighborhoods is over $165 billion. There will be a net loss of home \nownership and wealth especially for African-American and Latinos \nfamilies. This is a significant problem.\n  The fourth chart says ``Adjustable Rate Mortgages Currently Scheduled \nto Have Interest Rate Reset.'' I think everybody knows what I am \ntalking about here the reset under what is called an ARM is an \nadjustable rate mortgage.\n  As an aside, ARMs can be a very attractive and valuable product for \ncertain consumers. Frankly, these mortgages were marketed to too many \npeople who, could not handle ARMs. I don't want ARMs to become a bad \nword, because they can be valuable for certain consumers in certain \neconomic categories. But for many people they are dangerous.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Will my friend yield for a unanimous consent request?\n  Mr. DODD. Certainly.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. I thank my friend. I was trying to figure out a speaking \norder because a number of Senators want to speak. I ask my friend about \nhow much longer he expects to go.\n  Mr. DODD. Another 10 minutes.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following \nthe Senator's remarks, he be followed by Senators Alexander for 5 \nminutes, Wyden and Smith for 10 minutes, followed by Senator Casey for \n5 minutes, and followed by Senator Salazar for 10 minutes, and Senator \nCasey following Senator Salazar for as much time as he may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, what happens under ARMs is that there is a \nteaser rate, which is very low. You lure people in with the teaser \nrate--and I am now talking about people who should not be in ARMs.\n  Then, after the teaser period ends, the rate rises to the much higher \nfully indexed rate. What happens, of course, at a teaser rate, many \npeople may be more than capable of meeting that obligation. Many \nmortgage brokers are marketing these products without being honest and \nforthright about what the fully indexed rate will be, and what the \nborrower's financial responsibility will be.\n  It is also important to state that borrowers have a responsibility as \nwell as lenders. But in too many cases, those borrowers were being \nlured into situations that the brokers fully well knew that the \nborrowers were never going to be able to meet.\n  What are we looking at in this chart is the number of loans facing an \ninterest rate reset, which means, when these higher rates kick in. We \ntalk about resets occurring along the way. This chart is specifically \ndesigned to describe the reset problem.\n  Adjustable rate mortgages are currently scheduled to have interest \nrate resets, and the dollar value of mortgages that will reset is in \nthe billions of dollars, to give some sense of the magnitude of the \nproblem. This problem will last far beyond 2008. As this chart shows, \neven after the current subprime wave washes over us, we will face \nserious problems with interest-only and option-ARM resets for the next \n4 years. In short, the problem is growing; not going away, but growing.\n  The crisis affects more than the families who will lose their homes. \nThere will be an increased demand for social services, police, fire, \nand other services that ameliorate the impact of increases in \nforeclosed and abandoned property. You don't have to have a Ph.D. in \nhousing to know the negative ripple effects on the community of \nabandoned and foreclosed properties that are sitting on the market. The \nvalue of neighboring homes, even if the neighbor is currently doing \neverything right, you don't have to be an expert in real estate to know \nthat if your next-door neighbor or people on your street have an \nabandoned property, that it causes the home that you have taken care \nof, that you have done everything right by, to decrease in value.\n  Beyond the obvious impact of the foreclosure problem, there is a \ndomino effect that is growing. Yet State and local governments have \nfewer resources, as we know, because as we have property foreclosed and \nnot paying taxes, we find again the property taxes which most \ncommunities rely on for social services, police, fire, and the like \nalso decline. That is what I want to show on this chart, the \nforeclosure impact on neighborhoods beyond the individual home.\n  Property values for each home within one-eighth mile of a foreclosed \nhouse dropped by an average of $5,000. This was a study done in \nChicago. I see my friend from Tennessee, Lamar Alexander. I was talking \nwith him about this a day or so ago. If you take a square block, which \nis roughly one-eighth of a square mile, when one foreclosure occurs in \nthat area, then the property value of every other home on that city \nblock, even though every other home is current in its mortgage \nobligations, taxes and the rest, the home values decline almost \nimmediately by $5,000. That is the study.\n  Again, it is bad enough to lose the one property, but what is \nhappening to everyone else in that neighborhood is they are also \nsuffering. That is what this number is designed to show.\n  The result of that is that somewhere between 44 and 50 million homes \nadjacent to subprime foreclosed property will lose value if the problem \npersists, and localities are going to lose--the estimates are somewhere \nfrom $4.5 billion and $5 billion in property taxes and other tax \nrevenues as a result of foreclosed properties. The effects go far \nbeyond the individual who is adversely affected by these issues.\n  Unfortunately, we are seeing the contagion spread beyond the mortgage \nmarkets to the capital markets as a whole, both in the United States \nand globally. Yet as the Federal Reserve chairman acknowledged at a \nBanking Committee hearing this morning, our country is in a worse \nposition to deal with the fallout of the housing and financial market \ncrisis we are experiencing than we were after the tech bubble burst \nthat put us into the recession of 2001.\n  Former Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Alan Blinder puts it like this:\n\n        . . . the mortgage foreclosure problem grows and new \n     strains in the financial system keep popping up like a not-\n     very-funny version of whack-a-mole.\n\n  That is from a New York Times story of last week.\n  Many economists call this a negative feedback loop. It works like \nthis: Homeowners, saddled with abusive mortgages that never should have \nbeen made and which they cannot afford, are forced into foreclosure at \nhistoric rates, forcing new homes to be sold into a marketplace already \nglutted with unsold homes. The rising supply pushes down home prices \nfurther, putting more borrowers under water and at risk, even borrowers \nwith prime mortgages. Homeowners who can afford to pay their mortgages \nare seeing the equity they have built over the years evaporate before \ntheir eyes. According to Martin Feldstein, the chairman of President \nReagan's Council of Economic Advisors, every 10-percent fall in home \nprices cuts household wealth by $2 trillion and household spending by \n$100 billion.\n  Let me repeat that. According to Martin Feldstein, every 10-percent \nfall in home prices--and we are watching that this year already and the \nestimates are for next year maybe as high as 15 percent--every 10-\npercent decline cuts household wealth by $2 trillion and household \nspending by $100 billion.\n\n[[Page S1370]]\n\n  So if Moody's current estimate is correct that home prices will drop \nby 10 to 15 percent this year, household spending will fall by $100 \nbillion to $150 billion, and household wealth will fall by $2 trillion \nto $3 trillion this year alone.\n  These losses do not stop with families who have lost their home \nequity. The securities backed by these loans, both subprime and \nincreasingly by other higher quality mortgages, get downgraded, as we \nknow, forcing banks and securities firms who own these securities to \nset aside billions of dollars against real or potential losses.\n  These write-downs, as they are called, and increased loss reserves \nreduce the ability of these institutions to lend any money, whether for \nmortgages or commercial loans, even to hire quality borrowers. Worse, \nthe uncertainty about what the future might bring and what the subprime \nmortgage-backed securities might be worth are forcing these banks to \nhoard their capital against potential future disaster.\n  As a result, as Paul Ashworth, an economist with Capital Economics, \nin London said:\n\n       Rather ominously, borrowing costs for even most \n     creditworthy of firms have started to rise.\n\n  As we know, homeowners who can still get mortgages have seen these \nrates rise. Banks are tightening their standards for both credit cards \nand commercial real estate loans, and home equity loans are being \npulled as home prices declined, forcing families to find alternative \nmeans of financing their children's education, home repairs, and other \nactivities.\n  Let me point out, we saw in this morning's newspapers that the \nCommonwealth of Pennsylvania--I see my good friend Bob Casey from \nPennsylvania--it was pointing out the difficulty that could occur this \nyear with student loans. The State of Michigan last week reported a \nvery similar situation.\n  So, once again, while we are talking about a housing crisis, we are \nalready getting stories that student loans may not be as available for \nthis year as they have been. This is now going beyond the issue of what \nhappens with someone who gets their property foreclosed. It now could \nvery well reach into the critical issue of student loans which are \nabsolutely essential for middle-income working families so their \nchildren have an opportunity for higher education. That is how serious \nthis problem is.\n  Businesses, universities, and public entities are finding it harder \nand harder and far more expensive to roll over their existing debt or \nto get credit at all. For example, we saw recently how the major Wall \nStreet houses, from Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs to Citigroup and \nMerrill Lynch, have refused to commit capital to the auction rate \nmarket, a market that was supposed to allow investors to sell their \ndebt each week via auction that sets interest rates. As a result, many \nauctions are failing, saddling high-quality entities with absurdly high \ninterest rates.\n  Two weeks ago, for instance, the Port Authority of New York and New \nJersey was forced to pay 20-percent interest on its debt because their \nauction failed. Student loan programs, I mentioned a moment ago, in \nMichigan and Pennsylvania have also shut down--shut down, Mr. \nPresident.\n  Since last August, we have seen this negative feedback loop continue \nits downward spiral despite repeated rate cuts and other actions taken \nby the Federal Reserve and international central bankers intended to \nstem this tide. The result is a crisis of confidence that has serious \nimplications for our country. Again, let me quote Professor Feldstein, \nwho served as President Reagan's top economic adviser:\n\n       The principal cause for concern today is the paralysis of \n     the credit markets. The collapse of confidence in credit \n     markets is now preventing that necessary extension of credit. \n     The decline of credit creation includes not only the banks \n     but also the bond markets, hedge funds, insurance companies \n     and mutual funds. Securitization, leveraged buyouts and \n     credit insurance have also atrophied.\n\n  The catalyst of this downward economic spiral is the housing crisis, \nand the face of this housing crisis is the historic increase in \nforeclosures. Therefore, in my view, any serious effort to address our \neconomic woes must include an effort to take on the foreclosure crisis. \nWe have to begin there. If we do not deal with that issue, then we are \nflirting around with disaster, in my view, and avoiding the central \nquestion. So we must do something to slow the tide of foreclosures \novercoming many of our citizens, and we need to give our local \nofficials the tools and resources to cope with the increases in \nforeclosed properties.\n  In doing so, we will help break the downward cycle that is pushing \nour economy toward a recession if we are not already in the middle of \none.\n  By acting, we can bring some certainty where today only uncertainty \nexists. We can help restore the confidence of consumers and investors \nthat is absolutely indispensable to economic progress in our Nation.\n  There are some steps we have taken in the housing sphere already. \nWorking closely with my friend, Senator Richard Shelby, the ranking \nmember of the Banking Committee, and the administration, we were able \nto pass the FHA reform legislation. We have started working with the \nHouse to resolve our differences. My hope is that within a few days, \nSenator Shelby and I will be able to present to you a package that has \nbeen passed by both Houses.\n  I am committed to work with Senator Shelby and the administration to \npass a government-sponsored enterprise regulatory reform bill so that \nFannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and the Federal Home Loan Banks can expand \ntheir efforts to help people stay in their homes.\n  The committee has held extensive oversight hearings on the problems \nthat plague the housing markets, including a hearing on January 31 to \nlook at the foreclosure issue. And there will be more hearings to come.\n  I do not contend that S. 2636 will solve all the problems. The bill, \nunfortunately, did not receive the necessary cloture votes. But it is a \nstart, and it will help in a number of ways that were talked about.\n  I see my colleagues are anxious to speak as well. We heard about the \nprovision on bankruptcy reform, which I support, about some tax \nprovisions that would have made some difference, and I will leave the \nrecord to describe what other proposals are included, including the \ncounseling provision that Senator Schumer, myself, and others have \nchampioned for a long time to help consumers, as well as community \ndevelopment block grants for cities to acquire and rehabilitate \nforeclosed properties.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may proceed \nfor 2 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, obviously we are not going to get to this \nbill tonight. My hope would have been that, at this hour, we would have \nbeen debating amendments and ideas included in that package. That did \nnot happen. That is no reason for this not to go forward in the future, \nhowever.\n  As I said at the outset of these remarks, I know all of my colleagues \ncare about this issue. This is one of those moments when we have \nnothing less than the highest obligations to deal with this crisis. We \nought to have enough ability to deal with this crisis, with the talent \nthat exists in this Chamber, putting aside the ideological debates that \ngo on here all the time. We will be indicted in the public's mind if we \ndo not step up and address this issue. Ultimately if we do create the \nopportunity and ability to step in and do what needs to be done to \naddress this situation, the blame will fall right here and the burden \nwill fall on the taxpayers of America. We will be indicted, and should \nbe, if we do not have the wisdom, the ability, the courage, the \nintestinal fortitude to step up to craft ideas that can make a \ndifference.\n  My final plea this evening is to the leaders--and I know the majority \nleader feels as passionately about this as I do--and that is to set \naside whatever else we are dealing with for a number of days to give \nthose of us, as he has, and the responsibility of the committees \ninvolved to bring together a collection of these ideas to this Chamber \nand then set aside the necessary time over several days to debate them \nthoroughly as to how we ought to proceed and to present the American \npublic with a series of notions and proposals that I think could make a \ndifference on this issue.\n\n[[Page S1371]]\n\n  I do not claim clairvoyance. I do not claim the result would be \nperfect. But I think the very act of acting has its benefits, putting \naside whether we do all the things the American people would like us to \ndo. The idea that the Senate, the Congress of the United States is \nstepping up to do something for the people who, at this very hour, are \nhanging by their collective fingernails wondering whether everything \nthey saved and put aside for their lives is going to be lost in the \ncoming days. There are millions and millions of people adversely \naffected.\n  It is not just the foreclosures. We are talking about 44 million to \n50 million homes being adversely affected because we did not have the \nintestinal fortitude, wisdom, and desire to step up and make a \ndifference, then we ought to be indicted.\n  So, Mr. President, I stand ready and prepared, as I know many others \ndo, to sit down and work out a series of proposals to bring up before \nwe depart here in 2 weeks for the Easter and Passover break to get this \njob done. And that is my offer this evening. I know I speak for Senator \nShelby and for the members of my committee, who care deeply about this \nissue as well, that we will do anything and everything we have to do to \nassist in this effort.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I stayed so that I could respond to not \njust the words but the spirit and the tone of the remarks of the \nSenator from Connecticut. He and Senator Shelby, and their committee, \nare in the best position to help make sure we do our job between now \nand the upcoming recess, and on behalf of the Republican leader, I wish \nto say that is our goal.\n  Looking back just to the end of last year, this Senate was able to \ntake up an energy bill, have a principled debate--including an argument \nabout taxes--and come to a result. And we took a step--increasing fuel \nefficiency standards for the first time in 30 years--that, according to \na top expert at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, will do more than \nanything else Congress could do to reduce our dependence on foreign \noil.\n  Then we took up the economic stimulus legislation, and it was a \nsmaller package than almost any of us would have preferred, because we \nhad different points of view, but we agreed on it. We had a vote that \nkept out $40 billion in additional spending which that side wanted and \nthis side largely didn't, but we came to a result, and the President \nsigned it into law.\n  We did the same thing on intelligence, with a very difficult issue, \nliberty versus security, and how do we balance that. We had a \nRockefeller-Bond proposal on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act \nthat finally got 68 votes, and we sent it to the House.\n  That is three straight. Now here comes housing. There is no reason we \ncan't have a result here. I think all that we are saying on this side \nis that while the Democratic proposal may be a good start, we think it \nneeds a lot of work. We do not, for example, want to put into law a \nproposal that many feel might turn home mortgages into junk bonds. We \nhave some ideas in addition to those which have been proposed that we \nwould like considered.\n  There seems to be no reason in the world why the majority leader \ncould not sit down with the Republican leader and say: Let's see if we \ncan agree on a limited number of amendments. And we respect the fact \nthat largely the Democratic side will want to pick its amendments, and \nwe hope you will respect the fact that largely we would like to pick \nour amendments. Now, there is some negotiation there. It can't all be \ndone out here tonight. But I think the point we would like to make is \nthat there are 49 Republican Senators. We want to be a part of this \nsolution, as we were in energy, as we were in with economic stimulus, \nas we were with intelligence, and we intend to be with housing as well. \nAnd we look to the chairman of the Banking Committee, Senator Dodd, and \nto the ranking member, Senator Shelby, and to Senators Grassley and \nBaucus on the Finance Committee to help us get to that position early \nnext week.\n  My colleagues will hear us on this side talking a lot about a pro-\ngrowth economic plan that goes beyond just housing--we believe in lower \ntaxes, and we want lower health care costs and lower energy costs, and \nwe want to implement the America COMPETES Act. We want a strong robust \neconomy, and housing is a part of it. So there are some larger issues \nwe might want to take up as part of the housing debate. Just which ones \nare appropriate ought to be something we could discuss and work out.\n  So I appreciate the spirit of the Senator's comments. Our spirit is \nthat we have 49 Members on this side of the aisle, and we would like to \nhave our ideas included. We don't like the idea of just sending a bill \nup and saying: OK, here it is, let's vote it up or down. The majority \nleader said that really wasn't his intention, so maybe there is a \nmisunderstanding, and maybe that can be cleared up over the weekend and \nwe can get back to doing our job on housing, as we have done with the \nenergy, economic stimulus, and intelligence bills.\n  So I thank the Senator for his excellent remarks and his spirit, and \nI look forward to working with him.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield for a minute, I \ndon't want to interrupt, because I know others want to be heard, but I \nlistened very carefully to what the majority leader said earlier, and \nhe did an eloquent job of explaining this himself, but I want the \nrecord to reflect this as well.\n  I think the only concern the majority leader had, and I say this \nrespectfully to my friend from Tennessee, was that he asked what these \nother amendments might be, which is a very legitimate request--not to \nsuggest he has the right to decide the outcome of them but merely what \nthey would be. That is the job of the majority leader, obviously. To \nsay we have five amendments and you have to wait until we get to them \nto tell you what they are obviously makes his job very difficult, if \nnot impossible.\n  Just as the leader laid out what the bill was and what we would be \noffering, I think, in fairness, in order to move this along--and I \ndon't want to get bogged down in this because this is how we can get \nlost in the weeds of all of this, but I think, in fairness to the \nmajority leader, he felt as though it was not right to be denied the \nright to know what the various amendments would be. Not to say he would \nagree with them--as he said, he doesn't agree with the amendment being \noffered by Senator Specter--but he has the right to offer it, and he \nwould respect that.\n  So if we are going to do this, it is important for the leaders--and I \nam not a leader here, but the leaders need to sit down and see how the \nplace operates and how it is going to function.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, we have other Senators wanting to \nspeak, and these will be my last comments. I don't disagree with that. \nI think we all know what needs to happen here. We don't want the \nmajority leader picking all our amendments.\n  Mr. DODD. Of course not.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. And you didn't say you wanted to. So apparently, \nsomehow, it didn't get through as clearly as it might have. Maybe we \ndidn't hear it well or maybe it wasn't said as clearly.\n  The Republican ideas, some of which we think are very strong, such as \nthe Isakson amendment, for example, which has a lot of appeal, we want \nto make sure those ideas are included in the debate, and when that \nright is respected, we think we can have a good bill.\n  So hopefully the majority leader and the Republican leader will have \na chance to discuss that, and the chairman of the Banking Committee and \nthe ranking member will help with that process as well.\n  Mr. DODD. We hope so. And let me just say for the record, as someone \nwho is familiar with the Isakson proposal, I think it has very \nmeritorious qualities to it, and I think that might enjoy some very \nstrong support.\n  Mr. President, I again yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n\n\n               Lewis And Clark Mount Hood Wilderness Area\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I was prepared to come to the floor tonight \nand ask unanimous consent that the\n\n[[Page S1372]]\n\nSenate proceed to take up and pass the Lewis and Clark Mount Hood \nwilderness legislation, and I am very pleased that my colleague from \nour State, Senator Smith, was prepared to join me this evening. We were \ngoing to tackle this issue which is so important to the people of our \nState in a bipartisan fashion.\n  Oregon's Mount Hood is a cherished State treasure. There is statewide \nconsensus in every corner of Oregon that this protection is essential, \nand Senator Smith and I have worked for a great many years trying to \nmove this legislation forward. It has passed the relevant Senate \ncommittee, the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, and the two of \nus had hoped tonight to pass this legislation by unanimous consent.\n  Regrettably, my colleague has been informed by the Senator from \nOklahoma that he would not let us go forward with this legislation \ntonight. I greatly regret this. The people of our State are waiting. \nThey have been waiting many years for this. They have understood that \nSenator Smith and I have tried to approach this not just in a \nbipartisan way but in the most inclusive way we possibly could, working \nwith environmental concerns, timber concerns, and the concerns of local \nofficials and scientists. We have had scores and scores of citizens' \ngroups involved in this effort.\n  Our constituents just don't understand how a piece of legislation \nthat has all of this consensus behind it and all of the energy and \npassion that Oregonians have brought to it, cannot pass tonight and be \ndone quickly so that this legislation could pass the Senate and go to \nthe other body where our colleagues, particularly Congressman \nBlumenauer and Congressman Walden, have also put in many hours, in a \nbipartisan way, to try to get this legislation enacted and sent to the \nPresident.\n  The reality is that the people of our State want this State icon \nprotected and not held hostage. I am very interested in working with \nour colleague from the State of Oklahoma. I want to try to address any \nconcerns he may have. I am perplexed as to what those are because we \ncan't get any specifics as to what they actually are.\n  I think that at this time I would like to yield to my colleague from \nthe State of Oregon for his remarks and perhaps just wrap it up briefly \nafterward. But I think it is unfortunate tonight, when both of Oregon's \nSenators wanted to pass this much needed legislation, that we couldn't \ngo forward when there is such strong bipartisan support.\n  Mr. President, with a reservation so I can wrap up briefly, let me \nyield to my colleague from Oregon, Senator Smith, for his remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, Senator Wyden. Many \nmay wonder why we are down here and talking about this piece of \nlegislation, and it is, in short, because Mount Hood is more than just \na mountain in our State, it is the icon of our State. It is a place of \nremarkable beauty. It is a place where a vast majority of our citizens \nwish to have the greatest legal protections for its preservation. For \nthis generation and for all time to come, obviously wilderness is the \nhighest form of legal protection for any piece of public land.\n  In the course of coming to this place, Senator Wyden and I have had \nmany meetings with constituents, received countless pieces of mail in \nsupport, and have appreciated the intensity of feeling about this from \na whole range of interests. This bill is the work of compromise. This \nbill does not shortchange a vital industry of our State, which \nobviously I am speaking of timber. Timber production is vital to our \ncountry. Timber production is vital to the economy and the jobs of \nthousands of Oregonians.\n  So we, Senator Wyden and I, have engaged in a lot of give-and-take. \nWe worked with our colleagues in the House, who have similar \nlegislation. We are anxious to get this to them so that this heartfelt \ndemand from our citizens of Oregon can be realized.\n  In saying all of this, I don't expect the citizens of Oregon to \nunderstand the arcane rules of the Senate. The fact is, they are rules \nbased upon honor and one's word, and it is a fact that Senator Coburn \nhas indicated to me his objection to this piece of legislation. So out \nof respect for him, out of honoring both the letter and the rules of \nthe Senate, we are not offering this even though we are disappointed \nthat we cannot offer this. We would not do that with him being absent \nfrom the Senate, but we do commit to him to continue working on any \nsubstantive objection he may have to try to resolve what those may be.\n  I would note that the Republican side of the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee voted unanimously for this piece of legislation. So \nthis is nothing that is extreme. This is something completely unique to \nOregon and certainly something within the range of values that \nOregonians feel toward the environment. I also note that the Bush \nadministration, as far as I know, is now on board with this piece of \nlegislation. So this has broad support.\n  It is still a work in progress, obviously, with our House colleagues, \nbut we do not offer it tonight out of respect for our colleague from \nOklahoma. We simply want to talk about it, to let the people of Oregon \nknow we are working on it, that we are on the job and anxious to get \nthis to a final result so that Mount Hood, which is definitional of the \nbeauty of our State and the values that we put on the environment, can \nenjoy the legal protection that comes with a wilderness designation.\n  Again, we have included the logging community, we have included the \nrecreation community, we have included the environmental community. \nThis is the work of compromise, which is the essential ingredient to \ngetting anything through the Senate.\n  So we will continue the effort. We will continue to work with our \ncolleague from Oklahoma. And I thank Senator Wyden for his passion on \nthis issue and the way he and I have worked together to resolve, it \nseems like 100 different little issues, to try and come to this point \nof compromise that does satisfy the demands of so large a swath of the \npeople of Oregon and provide this level of protection to an icon which \nis the beauty of Mount Hood.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I know colleagues are waiting. I am going to wrap up very \nbriefly. I commend my colleague from Oregon for an excellent statement. \nThe fact is, this legislation has been a labor of love for the people \nof Oregon. They have been involved in scores and scores of meetings in \ncommunities all across the State. And all they want to do is protect \nthese scenic areas as Lewis and Clark first saw them.\n  The fact is, it has taken years longer to pass this legislation \nthrough the Senate than it took Lewis and Clark to get to Oregon. And \nthat is why Senator Smith and I have indicated we hope to get any \nfurther concerns that my colleague, the Senator from Oklahoma, or any \nother Member of the Senate has, because I certainly do not think this \nis a partisan issue.\n  When you have legislation like this that seeks to protect almost \n126,000 acres and more than 79 miles of wild and scenic rivers on nine \nfree-flowing rivers, including some of the most pristine and treasured \nareas of our State, all of the people who are going to visit this area, \nOregonians and non-Oregonians alike, they are not going to see this as \nan exercise in partisan politics. They are going to see this as Lewis \nand Clerk saw this: in effect, protecting the very special parts of \nOregon that are a treasure to our State, that are a treasure for the \npeople of the country.\n  And as Senator Smith indicated, our doors are open. We want to \nproceed with this legislation in the Senate just as quickly as we \npossibly can. Our colleagues in the other body are waiting for it. That \nis what it is going to take to get the Senate and the other body to \nwork together, and get it sent to the President of the United States. I \nwish we were getting it done tonight. Senator Smith has indicated so as \nwell. I do not think there is any reason it did not get done tonight, \nfor all practical purposes. But we are going to continue to work in \ngood faith with all the Members of the Senate, and we hope to be back \non this floor very soon to see this critically needed legislation \nadvance and get passed by this body.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n\n                         Tribute to Myron Cope\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, thank you very much. I rise tonight to \nspeak\n\n[[Page S1373]]\n\nabout a distinguished Pennsylvanian whom we lost this week. I will be \nspeaking a little bit later about housing and the housing crisis in our \neconomy.\n  I wanted to speak first tonight about a man who is known all across \nour State and indeed beyond the State but especially in Pittsburgh. I \nspeak of Myron Cope who died this week at the age of 79. He was, in \nfact, a legendary Pittsburgher and the voice of the Pittsburgh Steelers \nfor an unprecedented 35 years.\n  He died yesterday at the age of 79 in a nursing home in Pittsburgh \nwhere he was being treated for respiratory problems and heart failure.\n  He is known for so much. He is probably best known for his quirky \ncatch phrases and creating the well-known, world-renowned ``terrible \ntowel'' of the Pittsburgh Steelers, which so many people know was a \nsymbol that was twirled at Steelers games as a good luck charm and has \ndeveloped into an international symbol of Pittsburgh Steeler pride.\n  Steeler's president, Art Rooney, said it best in a story yesterday \nwhen he said:\n\n       His memorable voice and unique broadcasting style became \n     synonymous with Steeler football. They say imitation is the \n     greatest form of flattery and no Pittsburgh broadcaster was \n     impersonated more than Myron.\n\n  Art Rooney said it well. Not many people know that Myron Cope was an \nannouncer by accident. He spent the first half of his professional \ncareer as one of the Nation's most widely read freelance sports \nwriters, writing for Sports Illustrated, the Saturday Evening Post, on \nsubjects and athletes as wide and as diverse as Muhammad Ali, Howard \nCossell, and Roberto Clemente, the legendary Pittsburgh Pirate baseball \nplayer.\n  The Associated Press did a story about Myron's passing. And it talked \nabout how he became so popular with the Steelers that they did not try \nto replace his unique perspective when he retired. Instead they \ndownsized from a three-man announcing team to a two-man booth because \nof his unique perspective.\n  I will not try to imitate his voice. Many do; I will not try it \nbecause I cannot do it well. But the Associated Press said this about \nMyron:\n\n       To Cope, an exceptional play rated a ``Yoi!'' A coach's \n     doublespeak was ``garganzola.''\n\n  That is Myron Cope's language for various things. We could go on and \non tonight about all of those terms that he came up with, ways he \ndescribed winning and losing and the aspects of a football game. But I \nwill leave it to others to try to imitate his voice.\n  But we are thinking of him tonight and thinking of his family and his \nlegions of fans.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Associated Press story by Alan \nRobinson be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         [From The Associated Press, Pittsburgh, Feb. 27, 2008]\n\n            Steelers' Former Radio Announcer Myron Cope Dies\n\n                  (By Alan Robinson, AP Sports Writer)\n\n       Myron Cope, the screechy-voiced announcer whose colorful \n     catch phrases and twirling Terrible Towel became symbols of \n     the Pittsburgh Steelers during an unrivaled 35 seasons in the \n     broadcast booth, has died. He was 79.\n       Cope died Wednesday morning at a nursing home in Mount \n     Lebanon, a Pittsburgh suburb, Joe Gordon, a former Steelers \n     executive and a longtime friend of Cope's, told The \n     Associated Press. Cope had been treated for respiratory \n     problems and heart failure in recent months, Gordon said.\n       Cope's tenure from 1970-2004 as the color analyst on the \n     Steelers' radio network is the longest in NFL history for a \n     broadcaster with a single team and led to his induction into \n     the National Radio Hall of Fame in 2005.\n       Even after retiring, Cope--a sports talk show host for 23 \n     years--continued to appear in numerous radio, TV and print \n     ads, emblematic of a local popularity that sometimes \n     surpassed that of the stars he covered.\n       Beyond Pittsburgh's three rivers, Cope is best known for \n     pioneering the Terrible Towel, the yellow cloth twirled by \n     fans as a good luck charm at Steelers games since the mid-\n     1970s. The towel is arguably the best-known fan symbol of any \n     major pro sports team, has raised millions of dollars for \n     charity and is displayed at the Pro Football Hall of Fame.\n       ``You were really part of it,'' Steelers owner Dan Rooney \n     told Cope in 2005. ``You were part of the team. The Terrible \n     Towel many times got us over the goal line.''\n       An announcer by accident, Cope spent the first half of his \n     professional career as one of the nation's most widely read \n     freelance sports writers, writing for Sports Illustrated and \n     the Saturday Evening Post on subjects that included Muhammad \n     Ali, Howard Cosell and Roberto Clemente. He was hired by the \n     Steelers at age 40, several years after he began doing TV \n     sports commentary on the whim of a station manager, mostly to \n     help increase attention and attendance as the Steelers moved \n     into Three Rivers Stadium.\n       Neither the Steelers nor Cope had any idea how much impact \n     he would make on a five-time Super Bowl champion franchise \n     that, within two years of his hiring, would begin a string of \n     home sellouts that continues to this day.\n       Cope became so popular that the Steelers didn't try to \n     replace his unique perspective and top-of-the-lungs vocal \n     histrionics when he retired, instead downsizing from a three-\n     man announcing team to a two-man booth.\n       ``He doesn't play, he doesn't put on a pair of pads, but \n     he's revered probably as much or more in Pittsburgh than \n     Franco (Harris), all the guys,'' running back Jerome Bettis \n     said. ``Everybody probably remembers Myron more than the \n     greatest players, and that's an incredible compliment.''\n       Cope and a rookie quarterback named Terry Bradshaw made \n     their Steelers debuts on Sept. 20, 1970.\n       Just as Pirates fans once did with longtime broadcaster Bob \n     Prince, Steelers fans began tuning in to hear what wacky \n     stunt or colorful phrase Cope would come up with next. With a \n     voice beyond imitation--a falsetto shrill that could pierce \n     even the din of a touchdown celebration--Cope was a man of \n     many words, some not in any dictionary.\n       To Cope, an exceptional play rated a ``Yoi!'' A coach's \n     doublespeak was ``garganzola.'' The despised rival to the \n     north was always the Cleve Brownies, never the Cleveland \n     Browns.\n       He gave four-time Super Bowl champion coach Chuck Noll the \n     only nickname that ever stuck, the Emperor Chaz. For years, \n     he laughed off the downriver and often downtrodden Cincinnati \n     Bengals as the Bungles, though never with a malice or \n     nastiness that would create longstanding anger.\n       Many visiting players who, perhaps upset by what Cope had \n     uttered during a broadcast, could only laugh when confronted \n     by a 5-foot-4 man they often dwarfed by more than a foot.\n       During the years, it seemed every Steelers player or \n     employee could tell an offbeat or humorous story about Cope.\n       He once jammed tight end Dave Smith, fully dressed in \n     uniform and pads, into a cab for a hectic ride to the airport \n     after Smith missed the team bus for an interview. He talked a \n     then-retired Frank Sinatra into attending a 1972 practice in \n     San Diego to make him an honorary general in Franco Harris's \n     Italian Army fan club. He took a wintertime river swim in \n     1977 to celebrate an unexpected win, and was sick for days.\n       Cope's biggest regret was not being on the air during \n     perhaps the most famous play in NFL history--Franco Harris's \n     famed Immaculate Reception against Oakland in 1972, during \n     the first postseason win in Steelers history.\n       Cope was on the field to grab guests for his postgame show \n     when Harris, on what seemingly was the last play of the \n     Steelers' season, grabbed the soaring rebound of a tipped \n     Terry Bradshaw pass after it deflected off either the \n     Raiders' Jack Tatum or the Steelers' Frenchy Fuqua and scored \n     a game-winning 60-yard touchdown. As a result, play-by-play \n     man Jack Fleming's voice is the only one heard on what has \n     been countless replays over the years.\n       ``He ran straight to me in the corner, and I'm yelling, \n     `C'mon Franco, c'mon on!,' '' said Cope, who, acting on a \n     fan's advice, tagged the play ``The Immaculate Reception'' \n     during a TV commentary that night.\n       Remarkably, Cope worked with only two play-by-play \n     announcers, Fleming and Bill Hillgrove, and two head coaches, \n     Noll and Bill Cowher, during his 35 seasons.\n       Cope began having health problems shortly before his \n     retirement, and they continued after he left the booth. They \n     included several bouts of pneumonia and bronchitis--he smoked \n     throughout his career--a concussion and a leg problem that \n     took months to properly diagnose. He also said he had a \n     cancerous growth removed from his throat.\n       ``Wherever I go, people sincerely ask me how my health is \n     and almost always, they say `Myron, you've given me so much \n     joy over the years,' '' said Cope, who also found the time to \n     write five sports books, none specifically about the \n     Steelers. ``People also tell me it's the end of an era, that \n     there will never be an announcer who lasts this long again \n     with a team.''\n       Among those longtime listeners was a Pittsburgh high school \n     star turned NFL player turned Steelers coach--Bill Cowher.\n       ``My dad would listen to his talk show and I would think, \n     `Why would you listen to that?' '' Cowher said. ``Then I \n     found myself listening to that. I (did) my show with him, and \n     he makes ME feel young.''\n\n  Mr. CASEY. In conclusion, I want to say that Myron Cope was a \nfamiliar voice to every Pittsburgher and football fan alike, and his \npersona will live on in the hearts of Pittsburghers and Steelers fans \nfor generations to come.\n  It is a sad day and really a sad week for Pittsburgh and for \nfootball. He will\n\n[[Page S1374]]\n\nbe dearly missed. And today we honor his legacy. Tomorrow I will be \nhonored to introduce a resolution honoring Myron Cope.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Menendez). The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I come to the floor of the Senate this \nevening to express my extreme disappointment that the Senate is not \nmoving forward today to address the housing crisis which is causing so \nmuch pain for people all over this country, from the Presiding \nOfficer's wonderful Sunshine State of Florida, to the western shores of \nCalifornia, to most of the States across the country.\n  We know there is a lot of pain because of the housing crisis that \nAmerica finds itself in today. To be sure, I am proud of the work that \nthis Chamber did a few weeks ago when we pushed through the economic \nstimulus package to provide tax rebates and to provide some incentives \nfor businesses to invest in equipment to make sure that we are keeping \nour economy from going into the ditch.\n  But let there be no doubt, let there be no doubt anywhere in America \ntoday that the housing market is in crisis and American home ownership \nis becoming a nightmare to the homeowners of America. And so it is, in \nmy view, incumbent upon this Chamber, incumbent upon the President of \nthe United States, incumbent upon us, to try to move forward, to try to \nease some of the pain and to make sure that what is the primary cause \nfor us being in the kind of economic instability that we find ourselves \nin today, is something that we address, and that is the housing crisis \nthat America faces.\n  On this chart, you will note that the statistics indicate what is \nhappening across America that is bringing so much pain to the people \nwho own homes in all of our States. This morning in one of our Finance \nCommittee meetings where we had a hearing, we heard from the real \nestate industry, including those who are owners of commercial real \nestate and those who build our homes across this country. Those who are \nbuilding our homes, the National Association of Home Builders, their \nvice president and a witness today at our Finance Committee hearing \nsaid what they are seeing in the housing market is the worst they have \nseen since the Great Depression.\n  Now, the Great Depression brought not only the economy of the United \nStates, but the economy of the world, basically, to its knees, flat on \nits face. And it took that ``greatest generation'' to stand up this \neconomy again.\n  So they are telling us, these people who build our homes in America, \nthat this is worse than anything that they have seen since that Great \nDepression. But Moody's, the economic group, in testimony that they \nprovided to one of our committees in the Senate not long ago, talked \nabout how we have not yet reached the trough, the bottom of the housing \ncrisis that we are going into. Yet we have a filibuster underway that \nis keeping us from moving forward and addressing this housing issue.\n  I do not get it. I do not understand it. If you look at where we are \ntoday in terms of what is projected to be the trough with respect to a \nnumber of these metrics that we have on this chart, the first of those \nis the decline in housing values across America.\n  What this chart shows is that it is projected that housing values \nwill decline, on average across America, by over 15 percent. Now, when \nyou talk about that kind of decline in home values, it is not just a \npain that is affecting those homeowners whose houses are in \nforeclosure, it is a pain that is being felt by the neighborhood, by \nthe communities, by millions of people who own homes. It is a \nsignificant decline in home value.\n  When you look at home sales projected, home sales will be down to a \nlevel of 40 percent across the country. So when we get down to the \nbottom of the trough in housing starts, there is no end to it. The blue \nline here shows what happened in the 1980s when we had a similar kind \nof drop in the housing industry, where housing starts went down to 55, \n58 percent in that decline.\n  The economists now project that it is going to be a 60-percent \ndecline with no end in sight. So we do have a housing crisis on our \nhands. We have a crisis, a housing crisis on our hands. It is important \nthat this Senate do something about it. So I would appeal to the \nRepublican leader, to our own leadership, that we figure out a way of \nmoving forward.\n  I believe that the legislation that Senator Reid introduced, the 2008 \nMortgage Foreclosure Act, was a very good step in the right direction, \nand we should have had an opportunity to move forward with that \nlegislation and to try to figure out ways of improving upon that \nlegislation.\n  I am still hopeful that as this day goes on, as Friday goes on, as we \ncome into next week, we will be able to pivot it over to address this \nvery substantive and real issue that is causing so much pain to the \npeople of America.\n  It is causing pain to the people of my State. When you look at this \nchart, produced by the Center for Responsible Lending, it tells you \nwhat is happening in my State of Colorado.\n  As to foreclosures which now are rampant across our State, 1 in 376 \nhomes in Colorado is in foreclosure. We have not seen the end of it. By \nthe time the teaser rates, the adjustable rate mortgages adjust \nthemselves over the next 2 years, there is a projection that there will \nbe 49,923 homes in foreclosure in the State of Colorado, 49,000 homes \nin foreclosure.\n  So, yes, people who are losing their homes obviously are going to go \nthrough a lot of pain. To go from a point where you are a homeowner to \na place where you are in the street, obviously, is going to create a \nhospital of pain to those families that are part of these 50,000 people \nwho are going to be affected by foreclosure.\n  This is not just a foreclosure issue. Because of what is happening, \nand every American homeowner is seeing this today, the pain spreads \nfrom those foreclosures to other homes in the area, and those people \nare also going to see significant declines in their values.\n  The spillover impact in the State of Colorado tells us that 748,652 \nhomes are going to have values that decline because of the foreclosure \nsituation. So this spillover impact is going to affect almost 40 \npercent of all of the homes in the State of Colorado. So it is a \nproblem that is causing pain to, let's say, 3 million of the people who \nlive in my State. So it is not just a foreclosure problem, but because \nof the spillover impact that we are going to see.\n  In my State of Colorado, when we look at the decrease in home values, \nwhen you accumulate that number, it is going to be a $3.2 billion \nimpact. This is much more than about just foreclosure. It also is about \nthe pain to homeowners who are seeing the price of their homes decline \nover time. It goes beyond those who are having their homes foreclosed \nupon and ending up in the streets. It goes beyond those people with the \npride of home ownership who are seeing the values of their homes \ndecline. It also goes to the industries and people who work in the home \nindustry.\n  This article which came out of the Rocky Mountain News talks about \nwhat is happening with construction in the State of Colorado and \nMetropolitan Denver. The headline says it all, ``Metro Home Building \nDrops 34 Percent in '07 Permits and May Cost Up to 10,000 Jobs.'' We \nhave hundreds of thousands of people who work in the home construction \nbusiness, not only in my State but throughout the Nation. Many of those \npeople who work in that industry are finding themselves today \nunemployed because of the housing crisis, a 34-percent drop in the \nnumber of housing starts, so there is lots of effects going on in our \nState.\n  My view is that Senator Reid did exactly what he should have done as \nour majority leader. He said we had moved forward, worked closely with \nthe President and the House of Representatives to pass an economic \nstimulus package which was significantly improved over what the \nPresident and the House of Representatives had proposed. He felt, \ncorrectly, that we should now pivot from that issue to working on some \nof the longer term economic issues affecting our Nation. Certainly one \nof those top priorities should be housing. I believe we also should \nmove on and deal with another aspect of a major national agenda, to \nmake sure we are putting more into developing a new energy future for \nAmerica. But today the issue is housing. That is what the majority \nleader attempted to pivot to today with the Foreclosure Prevention\n\n[[Page S1375]]\n\nAct of 2008. That legislation had probably the support of most of the \nMembers with respect to at least 90 percent of the substance included \nin the legislation, such as $10 billion over 3 years for mortgage \nrevenue bonds to help families refinance their homes, $10 billion over \n3 years. That was a bipartisan amendment that came out of the Finance \nCommittee, sponsored by Senator Kerry and Senator Smith, a bipartisan \namendment where I don't think there would have been people in this \nChamber who would have stood up and said no. We could have helped the \nfamilies of America deal with the housing crisis by providing them the \nrefinancing opportunities with that kind of investment.\n  There is $200 million for credit counseling. It seems to me that most \npeople have said the best thing to do is to get the homeowner and the \nfinancial institutions together, find out for the homeowner what the \noptions are, and then get them to do a modification of their loan so \nthey can stay in their home. That is what this legislation would have \nprovided, $200 million for credit counseling. I don't know who would \nhave disagreed with that concept. This legislation would have allowed \n$4 billion for community development block grants, CDBG grants, because \nthere are some places in our Nation where the number of foreclosures is \naffecting those communities in a very negative way. Just as in the \nCommonwealth of Pennsylvania, my good friend Senator Casey will know \nthose areas where you can drive down the street, and you can see homes \nthat are in foreclosure, block by block by block. What this investment \nwould have done, $4 billion in community development block grants, is \nhelped those communities, those neighborhoods that are suffering the \nmost.\n  This legislation also included other provisions that were good for \nthe business community. Through the leadership of Senator Conrad, an \namendment I helped cosponsor in the Finance Committee, we would have \nincluded in here a net operating loss carryback provision so that \nlosses from 2007, 2008, and 2009 could be carried back for 5 years. \nThat is an important provision for those who have been involved in the \nhome building industry or those who are in other industries who are \nsuffering the economic tough times we are in today. It would have given \nthose businesses a kind of shot in the arm to create a robustness and a \nnew future for them as they try to weather the difficult times.\n  In addition, the legislation would have required simplicity and \ntransparency in mortgage documents. It would be a furtherance of truth \nin disclosure documents so that consumers, in signing up for a loan, \nwould know exactly what it was they were signing up for. Those \nprovisions would have been relatively noncontroversial.\n  Then what is it that has been raised as a reason to oppose us moving \nto address the housing crisis here in the Senate? The provision that \nsays we should allow homeowners to modify their loans under very \nlimited conditions with respect to home ownership. There was a sense \nfrom some Members on the other side that maybe that was going too far, \nmaybe there were ways in which we could have worked to deal with that \nissue and some modifications that would address some of their concerns. \nBut as written, as proposed, we tried to put some rails around it. We \ntried to say that the only ones who could take advantage of that \nprovision were those who were home occupants. You had to be occupying \nthe home before you could avail yourself of those provisions. You had \nto meet certain strict financial conditions so that there would be a \nshowing of need before you could take advantage of that provision. You \nwould have to be approved by the bankruptcy court. At the end of the \nday, you would have had a modification of a loan that would probably \nhave been agreed to between the lender and the homeowner, if the \nhomeowner wanted to stay in the home.\n\n  I am not an expert in bankruptcy law. It seems to me that under \nchapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code, you can discharge almost any debt \nwith certain limitations that are set forth in the code. There are \nother provisions of the Bankruptcy Code--as I recall, chapter 13--that \nsay you can avail yourself of the bankruptcy court in order to modify \nyour debt. If you want to pay back your debt in some way but you don't \nhave the means, chapter 13 allows you to reorganize your debt by asking \nthe bankruptcy court to allow you to pay your debt over a longer period \nunder other terms that a bankruptcy court might impose with respect to \nthe repayment of the debt. But it is not a debt forgiveness. If you are \na homeowner today and you happen to own a vacation home and you have a \ndebt on the vacation home, you can go to the bankruptcy court and \nmodify your loan. If you happen to be a homeowner today and you own a \nrecreational vehicle or some kind of a yacht and you owe a debt against \nthat, you can go to the bankruptcy court and have the court modify your \nloan under a chapter 13 proceeding. You can do it with respect to any \nasset. But under the current Bankruptcy Code, you are not allowed to do \nthat with respect to your home. It makes no sense to me in particular \nbecause of the kinds of rails and constraints that we put around this \nlegislation as it was crafted.\n  I hope that we as a Senate, in addressing the pain that homeowners \nare feeling today, can move forward to provide a solution to help us \nweather these tough times. That is our duty and our responsibility. We \nas a Senate need to be judged by a very simple reality: Results matter. \nStalling or looking away from a problem and pretending it doesn't exist \ndoesn't work anymore. There needs to be a focus on dealing with the \nproblems the American people are carrying on their backs today. \nCertainly the housing crisis is one of those burdens they are carrying \nwith significant pain.\n  I hope the voices of the American public, the voices of those who are \nin home ownership, will rise so that tomorrow or on Monday we can \nfigure out a way of moving forward to putting together a solution on \nthe housing crisis that is affecting us in America today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I appreciate what the Senator from Colorado \noutlined for us, a great recitation of the challenges we have in the \nSenate on this issue of the housing crisis and our economy. It is \nimportant to point out where we are today. We are here tonight talking \nabout legislation which did not move forward today for one very simple \nreason: because the other side of the aisle chose to stop it, as they \nhave done on a number of fronts. I was thinking today about when we \nreflect upon the housing crisis that grips so many communities and \nfamilies, a couple of weeks ago we were debating a stimulus package and \na similar thing happened. We did get legislation passed and the \nPresident did sign it. That was largely a positive development. But \nwhat we didn't get done--because, again, the other side stopped us; \nthey blocked, obstructed our ability to put unemployment insurance and \nfood stamp assistance in there, which economists tell us are the best \nways to stimulate the economy.\n  Here we are again on housing, at a time when we had a piece of \nlegislation which would provide some light--in fact, I would argue \nsubstantial light--to the darkness that many families face with regard \nto foreclosure. It would provide some measure of relief to the pain \nfamilies feel when they lose their home. It would provide some help and \nassistance with the trauma, the economic trauma that the loss of a \nhouse can visit upon a family. That is what we are talking about, doing \nour best in the Senate to provide some help for families.\n  We want to do a couple of things with this legislation which we know \nis the Foreclosure Prevention Act of 2008. Our majority leader, Senator \nReid, and the members of the Democratic Caucus set it out fairly \nspecifically, a couple of basic things this legislation would have \ndone. First, it would have continued what we started in the end of last \nyear, foreclosure prevention counseling dollars to give money to \norganizations around the country that are certifiable experts at this, \norganizations such as La Raza, which the Presiding Officer knows. We \nknow also of the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now, \nknown by the acronym ACORN. They are headquartered in Philadelphia. \nThese are organizations which understand what a lender has to deal with \nbut, more importantly, deal\n\n[[Page S1376]]\n\nwith borrowers when they are borrowing money, when they are dealing \nwith the difficulty and the complexity of borrowing money. These \norganizations would have helped even more than they are helping now \nwith $200 million more of counseling money. That is not going to happen \nbecause of what the other side did. They blocked that money by blocking \nthis legislation.\n  One of the best vehicles on housing and on stimulating activity and \nalso providing some measure of relief is to say to our housing finance \nagencies across the country, organizations at the State level that are \nexpert at this, we are going to allow you to do what you do best, to \nget money into the system and to allow people to borrow money for the \ncost of a house. That won't happen now because of what the other side \nof the aisle did.\n  Another provision in this bill, as Senator Salazar mentioned in \ndetail, was the bankruptcy provision which simply says that if a \nbankruptcy judge can deal with your second house or with all kinds of \nmatters that come before that judge in bankruptcy, the bankruptcy judge \nought to be able to help you restructure your mortgage in bankruptcy so \nyou can dig yourself out of not just a foreclosure problem but can dig \nyourself out of bankruptcy. The other side said no to that.\n  Finally, they said no to communities across the country with regard \nto community development block grant money. They said no to them as \nwell. For billions of dollars which were in this bill, they said no to \nthose communities across the country. It is important to understand \nwhat they on the other side said no to today. We have to understand \nthat when we talk about this issue, it is not just a house and a \nfamily, as important as that is. We are talking about keeping families \nin their homes, helping them with their foreclosure problem, their \ncrisis that they could be in the middle of or about to enter into. We \nare also talking about communities, neighborhoods.\n  The chairman of the Banking Committee--I know the Presiding Officer \nis a member of the committee--outlined in detail what happens to a \ncommunity when one house goes down or a number of houses go down. We \nknow about the details.\n  What we should do is be very clear about our priorities: keeping \npeople in homes, helping communities, and stimulating the economy, but \nalso to make the record clear about why we are not moving forward. The \nother side stopped us, as they have done again and again.\n  Now we have to move forward. Now we have to figure out in a \nbipartisan way how best we can get some elements of this legislation to \ncontinue. We cannot sit back and say: Well, we are having a dispute \nhere and we can just let this die. We cannot.\n\n  We have to do everything we can now, as Senator Dodd said very well \ntonight, to move this forward, to make sure we are doing everything \npossible to keep people in their homes, to stimulate our economy, and \nto protect and nurture our communities and our neighborhoods. I think \nwe can do that, but we have a long way to go. I hope it is a bipartisan \neffort. We have to make that hope into a realty.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders).

Mr. President, while the Senate was in recess last \nweek, the senior Senator from Massachusetts became a little bit more \nsenior. On February 22, Senator Edward Kennedy celebrated his 76th \nbirthday.\n  Senator Kennedy has been a special friend over the years and I thank \nhim for his fellowship.\n  Everyone who knows us knows that Senator Kennedy and I could not have \ncome from more different economic and geographic backgrounds--he is the \nson of a wealthy New England family, while I am the son of the \nAppalachian coalfields. And people who know us know that over the \nyears, Senator Kennedy and I have had our political differences--at one \npoint, our political differences compelled us to challenge each other \nfor a Senate leadership position.\n  But those who know us both well, also know that we have many things \nin common. We share a love of history, of poetry, and of politics. \nForemost, we share a love and understanding of the Senate and the \nimportant role it is intended to play in the life of this Republic.\n  Maybe it was our mutual interests that formed the basis of our \nfriendship. Perhaps it was admiration. I certainly admire Senator \nKennedy's career and accomplishments for his State, as well as his keen \nintellect and fierce defense of his views and values. Senator Kennedy \nis a member of the Massachusetts Senate class that has included giants \nof the Senate such as John Quincy Adams, Daniel Webster, Charles \nSumner, Henry Cabot Lodge, and John F. Kennedy. Senator Edward Kennedy \nhas joined this august company for he, too, is a giant of the Senate.\n  Senator Kennedy is one of three Senators in the history of this \ninstitution to have cast more than 15,000 votes.\n  He is the third longest serving Senator in U.S. history.\n  But, more important than the quantity of his Senate service is the \nquality of his service. Senator Kennedy has been one of the most \neffective national legislators in the history of our Republic. His \nimprint is on a large stack of progressive legislation written during \nthe past four decades. The Occupational Safety and Health Act, OSHA; \nthe Voting Rights Act; the Age Discrimination Act; the Freedom of \nInformation Act; the Americans with Disabilities Act; health care \nreform; increases in the Federal minimum wage--these are but a few of \nSenator Kennedy's legislative monuments.\n  As his Senate record demonstrates, Senator Kennedy is a man of \nremarkable compassion, who has labored mightily on behalf of his fellow \ncitizens. A child of privilege, educated at Harvard and the University \nof Virginia, he could have taken an easier path in life. But, instead, \nSenator Kennedy has worked tirelessly in the Senate becoming a powerful \nvoice for the protection of our environment, the rights of American \nworkers, and women's equality. Senator Kennedy is the Senate's Mr. \nHealth Care. He is the Senate's Mr. Civil Rights. He is the Senate's \nMr. Human Rights.\n  What has really impressed me is that neither years of age nor years \nof political combat have diminished the idealism and energy of this \ntalented, imaginative, and intelligent man. Throughout his career, \nSenator Kennedy has believed in a simple premise: that our society's \ngreatness lies in its ability and willingness to provide for its less \nfortunate members. Whether striving to increase the minimum wage, \nensuring that all children have medical insurance, or securing better \naccess to higher education, Senator Kennedy has shown that he cares \ndeeply for those whose needs exceed their political clout. Unbowed by \npersonal setbacks, or by the terrible sorrows that have fallen upon his \nfamily, his spirit continues to soar, and he continues to work as hard \nas ever to make his dreams a reality.\n  I, personally, will always appreciate the support that Senator \nKennedy gave me during the years I served as the Senate Democratic \nleader. When times got tough, as they occasionally do for a Senate \nleader, I always knew that I could count on his assistance.\n  As the majority leader of the Senate during the incredibly productive \n100th Congress, I worked closely with Senator Kennedy, and he worked \nclosely with me. His tenure as Chairman of the Senate Committee on \nLabor and Human Resources during that Congress\n\n[[Page S1377]]\n\nwas extraordinary, both in the sheer volume of legislation that he \nsponsored and in the dedication that he displayed to improving the \neducation and health of all Americans. Happy birthday to my friend and \ncolleague, Senator Ted Kennedy. Because of you, so many millions of \nAmericans are much better off.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/28/senate-section/article/S1377-1", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1377]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       NATIONAL PEACE CORPS WEEK\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise to take a few minutes, during \nNational Peace Corps Week, to salute the dedication and accomplishments \nof the hundreds of thousands of Peace Corps volunteers who have served \nour Nation and the world since President John F. Kennedy had the wisdom \nand foresight to establish the Peace Corps in 1961.\n  I want to recognize in particular the 309 current Peace Corps \nvolunteers from Illinois who are today serving in every corner of the \nglobe, as well as the more than 7,000 Illinoisans who have served since \nthe Peace Corps' inception. These men and women come from big cities \nand small towns, urban centers and rural farming communities. Some are \nrecent college graduates who fit our most common image of a Peace Corps \nvolunteer, while others are older and bring to this new role a lifetime \nof skills and experience.\n  Diverse though their backgrounds might be, all Peace Corps volunteers \nshare a common desire to improve the lives of people less fortunate \nthan themselves, and to do so in a direct, hands-on fashion.\n  Americans are the most generous people in the world. We give from our \nwallets and we give of our time, donating both of these in large \nquantities on behalf of the poor, the hungry, and the disenfranchised. \nVolunteerism and altruism are among the most fundamental aspects of our \nnational character, and all Americans should be proud of our \ncontributions to meeting the world's development challenges.\n  Yet there is something different, something unique, about those of \nour fellow citizens who have chosen the Peace Corps path. They move to \nthe other side of the planet, with few to no amenities, and immerse \nthemselves in completely unfamiliar cultures and languages. That type \nof commitment changes the lives of the local communities in which the \nvolunteers live and work, to be sure. But it also affects profoundly \nthe volunteers themselves, who sacrifice material comforts and \nproximity to family and friends in exchange for the knowledge that they \nare having a positive impact.\n  Sometimes, a Peace Corps volunteer's sacrifice goes far beyond the \nmere material. This past December, 25-year-old Blythe Ann O'Sullivan of \nBloomingdale, IL, died while serving in Suriname. Blythe was a graduate \nof Bradley University in Peoria and was in her second year volunteering \nas a small business adviser at the time of her death. I join her \nfamily, friends, the Peace Corps community and all the people whose \nlives Blythe touched, not only in mourning her loss but also in \ncelebrating her memory.\n  I would also like to honor the many Illinois colleges and \nuniversities that turn out Peace Corps volunteers in large numbers. The \nUniversity of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign ranked 16th in the Nation \nlast year among large colleges and universities in the number of alumni \nvolunteers. Northwestern University ranked 12th among medium-sized \nschools, and the University of Chicago, I am proud to say, was first in \nthe country among smaller institutions. It is a testament to these \nuniversities, their faculties, and most of all their students that so \nmany Illinois alumni choose to join the Peace Corps and serve their \ncountry and humanity in this way.\n  You know, most people hear the words ``Peace Corps'' and picture \nyoung American men and women helping the people of some remote village \nto dig a latrine or a well, or learn English, or access better health \ncare. And of course, this sort of development work is the principal \nreason the Peace Corps was founded.\n  But Peace Corps volunteers also serve an equally important role as \ngoodwill ambassadors. They are often the first Americans their overseas \nfriends and neighbors have ever met, and first impressions count for a \nlot. Over the past several years, much of the world has questioned U.S. \nintentions and watched us warily until they've been sure of the real \nmeaning behind our words, the real goals behind our actions. The pure \naltruism of Peace Corps volunteers, living and working every day with \ncitizens the world over, goes a long way toward reassuring the world \nthat Americans are a good and giving people.\n  The Peace Corps and its volunteers cannot do this alone. It is \nimportant that Congress continue to support the Peace Corps to the \ngreatest possible extent. As a member of the Senate Appropriations \nsubcommittee on the State Department and Foreign Operations, I am proud \nthat Chairman Leahy was able to increase the Peace Corps' budget by $10 \nmillion for fiscal year 2008. And I am certain that together we will be \nable to continue supporting the Peace Corps to make it even more \neffective and to honor the dedication and sacrifice of the many \nthousands of volunteers who have served, are now serving, and will \nserve in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/28/senate-section/article/S1377-2", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1377-S1378]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     WHITE MOUNTAIN NATIONAL FOREST\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I wish to speak briefly about an important \nissue in my State that involves one of our country's great natural \ntreasures, the White Mountain National Forest. Encompassing nearly \n800,000 acres and drawing more than 6 million visitors each year, the \nWhite Mountain National Forest is not just a place for skiing, hiking, \nsnowmobiling, or timber harvesting it is a source of pride for New \nHampshire. And considering its relatively large footprint in our State, \nhow this special place is managed by the U.S. Forest Service matters a \nlot.\n  Fortunately, the Forest Service especially Forest Supervisor Tom \nWagner has done a great job in overseeing the White Mountain National \nForest. Starting in 1997 when the new forest management plan was being \ndeveloped, the agency made a concerted effort to reach out to the \npublic, welcomed outside comments, and was sensitive to the sometimes \ncompeting views of interested parties. This planning process was not an \neasy task. Forest management is about addressing multiple uses and \npriorities, and ultimately it should be about compromise. The White \nMountain National Forest has long been utilized for a variety of \npurposes, and any management plan should carefully strike a balance \namong them while also protecting the forest for future generations.\n  To come up with a balanced plan, Supervisor Wagner went out of his \nway to listen to public input and worked closely with government \nofficials, environmental organizations, businesses, and recreation \nclubs. I met with him during the planning process and was encouraged by \nhis outreach and evenhanded approach.\n  After years of hard work, Supervisor Wagner and the Forest Service \narrived at a forest management plan that achieved general consensus \namong the major stakeholders and was well received across New \nHampshire. I was pleased to support it when the final plan was released \nin 2005, including working with Senator Sununu on legislation \nimplementing its wilderness recommendations. Signed into law in \nDecember 2006, this bill designated nearly 35,000 acres of new \nwilderness in the White Mountain National Forest and was applauded by \nenvironmental groups from across the State. I should also note that \neven our State's logging industry, represented by the New Hampshire \nTimberland Owners Association, supported the wilderness measure out of \nthe spirit of compromise. Clearly, it was not in their business \ninterest to support more wilderness designation, but they did it anyway \nsince it was part of a balanced management plan that also included \nlimited timber harvesting.\n  Unfortunately, this balance is now under attack, years after the plan \nwas finalized and other elements have been implemented. A few \nenvironmental groups based outside New Hampshire have filed a lawsuit \nagainst two timber harvesting projects that were part of the 2005 \nForest Management Plan. Encompassing less than 1,200 acres, the \nprojects already have been subject to environmental review, would be \nvery limited in scope, and would be carried out over existing road \nsystems. By delaying these projects, this lawsuit is\n\n[[Page S1378]]\n\nnot only blocking an economic boost for the State and additional \nrevenues for local governments but also blocking the projects' \nenvironmental benefits since they would create habitats critical for \nwildlife management. Well respected environmental groups such as the \nSociety for Protection of New Hampshire Forests, Appalachian Mountain \nClub, and Audubon Society have come out against this legal challenge, \nand I support their efforts to maintain the consensus approach \nunderlying the 2005 Forest Management Plan.\n  The White Mountain National Forest can and should be accessible to a \nwide variety of users, and we have a carefully crafted plan to \naccommodate them. It is unfortunate that a few groups who had their \nchance to provide input during the planning process are resorting to \nlitigation to take apart the 2005 Forest Management Plan. Of course, \nthe Forest Service must follow the law and carry out certain \nenvironmental reviews, and I defer to the courts to resolve these legal \nquestions. However, I strongly believe that this lawsuit runs counter \nto New Hampshire's interests and undermines the good will among our \nState's major stakeholders which has been critical for advancing sound \nenvironmental policies. I therefore hope that this legal challenge is \nresolved as soon as possible and that we can all support the Forest \nService's management of the White Mountain National Forest, including \nits proposed timber harvesting projects.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/28/senate-section/article/S1378-1", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1378]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              GUN VIOLENCE\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, unfortunately, history will record February \n2008 as a month in which contained six separate high-profile multiple \nmurders by firearms occurred across the country. These shootings \noccurred in places normally considered safe, including Northern \nIllinois University, Louisiana Technical College, and a city council \nmeeting inside Kirkwood City Hall. It appears there are few places \nwhere the dangers of gun violence can not reach. However, there are \nsome actions we can take to help change this epidemic of gun violence.\n  In 1993, President Clinton signed the Brady bill into law. This law \nrequires a waiting period for handgun sales until records are available \nto instantly check criminal background of prospective gun purchasers. \nAfter the National Instant Check System, NICS, became operational in \n1998, the Justice Department maintained background check records on \napproved purchases for 6 months to ensure that felons and other \nprohibited buyers were not mistakenly approved. Under the Bush \nadministration, however, Attorney General John Ashcroft sought to \nrequire the destruction of the records of approved purchasers within 24 \nhours. In July 2002, the Government Accountability Office, GAO, issued \na report on the potential effects of next-day destruction of NICS \nbackground check records. They concluded that destroying these records \nwithin 24 hours would prevent the government from auditing the NICS \nsystem to ensure its accuracy and ``would have public safety \nimplications.'' Despite these GAO warnings, Attorney General Ashcroft \ndecided to implement the 24-hour record destruction provision.\n  The Brady bill only requires background checks for sales by licensed \ngun dealers. It does not require them for transfers between unlicensed \npersons. Approximately 40 percent of all gun sales involve those \ntransfers, such as at gun shows. Only 6 States require background \nchecks on all firearm sales. According to the ATF, almost one-third of \ntrafficked guns are acquired at gun shows and flea markets. These \ngatherings present the perfect opportunity for unlicensed sellers to \noffer large numbers of guns for sale with no questions asked. Those who \nwould not pass a background check in a licensed gun store are able to \npurchase as many guns as they wish at gun shows.\n  In 1994, President Clinton signed legislation into law that banned \nthe production of certain semiautomatic assault weapons and high-\ncapacity ammunition magazines. Among the banned items was a list of 19 \nspecific weapons as well as a number of other weapons incorporating \ncertain design characteristics such as pistol grips, folding stocks, \nbayonet mounts, and flash suppressors. The 1994 assault weapons ban \nprohibited the manufacture of semiautomatic weapons that incorporate at \nleast two of these military features and accept a detachable magazine. \nIn 2004, when the assault weapons ban expired, despite the overwhelming \nsupport of the law enforcement community, the ongoing threat of \nterrorism, and bipartisan support in the Senate. Sadly, the tragedies \nat both Virginia Tech and Northern Illinois University were inflicted \nby someone using previously banned high capacity ammunition magazines.\n  On average, 32 people are murdered in this country by firearms every \nday. By instituting such simple changes in current law, addressing the \ngun show loophole and passing a new assault weapons ban, we could help \nreduce the likelihood of such tragedies occurring.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/28/senate-section/article/S1378-2", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1378-S1379]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           21ST CENTURY COMMUNITY LEARNING CENTERS INITIATIVE\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, today I express my support for the 21st \nCentury Community Learning Centers, 21st CCLC, initiative, the only \nFederal funding source dedicated to supporting successful afterschool \nprograms around the country. This program is critical to our children's \nand our economy's success.\n  For many American families, it is necessary for both parents to work \noutside the home, and these families face true challenges in finding \naffordable childcare services. This is a problem not only for parents \nof infants and toddlers too young to go to school, but also for parents \nof school-age children who would otherwise be left unsupervised in \nthose critical hours between the end of the schoolday and the end of \nthe workday. In Maryland, 25 percent of children in grades K-12 are \nresponsible for taking care of themselves after school. Studies show \nthat millions of children around our Nation are left on their own after \nschool to devastating effects.\n  Researchers at Johns Hopkins University have concluded that two-\nthirds of the achievement gap between lower and higher income youth can \nbe explained by unequal access to out-of-school activities, especially \nduring the summer months. This unequal access creates a gap that begins \nin elementary school and accumulates over the years. It results in \nunequal placements in college preparatory tracks and increases the \nchance that children from low-income families will drop out of high \nschool.\n  The hours between 3 p.m. and 6 p.m. are the peak hours for juvenile \ncrime and experimentation with drugs, alcohol, cigarettes, and sex. \nTeens who do not participate in afterschool programs are nearly three \ntimes more likely to skip classes than teens who do participate. They \nare also three times more likely to engage in risky and self-\ndestructive behaviors.\n  Parents who have difficulty securing reliable afterschool care miss \nan average of 8 days of work per year, and studies have shown that \ndecreased worker productivity related to parental concerns about \nafterschool care costs businesses up to $300 billion each year.\n  Recognizing the benefits of quality afterschool activities, Congress \ncreated the 21st Century Community Learning Centers initiative, which \nprovides states with grant money to facilitate their efforts to provide \nchildren with quality afterschool social, academic, and other \nenrichment activities. The program's results have been dramatic.\n  In the 2004-2005 school year, 59 percent of regular attendees \nattained Federal proficiency levels or better in reading and language \narts and 54 percent of regular attendees attained Federal proficiency \nlevels or better in math. Teachers reported that a majority of \nparticipating students improved in every category of behavior. The \ncategories with the highest percentages of student improvement were \nacademic performance, completing homework to the teacher's \nsatisfaction, class participation, and turning in homework on time.\n  A study conducted in Maryland's Anne Arundel County school district \nrevealed that CCLC participants missed fewer days in school and \nachieved higher proficiency ratings in reading and math. Also, teachers \nperceived increases in students' overall achievement in school and \ntheir confidence in learning. Children attending\n\n[[Page S1379]]\n\n23 or more days of Maryland's After School Opportunity Fund Program \nshowed greater gains on such measures as commitment to education and \nacademic performance, and a reduction in delinquency.\n  According to a 2005 Manhattan Institute study, only one-third of \nAmerican high school graduates are prepared for college. Our students \nare falling further behind in math, science, engineering, and other \nareas critical for success in the 21st century economy. The hours \nbetween 3 and 6 p.m. do not need to be peak hours for juvenile crime \nand dangerous experimentation. The afterschool hours can be and must be \na time when our kids learn new skills, develop relationships with \ncaring adults, and prepare for the future.\n  One program in Marriotsville, MD, is doing just that. In a reversal \nof roles, tech savvy students at Marriotts Ridge High School offer \nafterschool instruction in Photoshop, game design, Web design, \nMicrosoft Office, and other programs to members of the community. The \nprincipal has raved about walking down his school's halls and seeing \nhis students conduct workshops for individuals ranging from middle-\nschoolers through senior citizens. How impressive that these students \nare given the opportunity to master this technology and then develop \nthe confidence and leadership necessary to teach it to others. What a \nbenefit to these students and to that Maryland community!\n  So I was extremely disappointed, as were many of my colleagues, to \nsee that President Bush's fiscal year 2009 budget proposal cuts funding \nfor 21st Century Community Learning Centers by $300 million next year. \nIf his proposal were enacted, 300,000 students nationwide would lose \naccess to afterschool programs. Maryland alone would lose one-third of \nits funding, which would translate to a loss of services for 5,000 \nchildren.\n  The President also wants to turn the grant program into a voucher \nprogram. Currently, States review programs in a thorough, competitive \nprocess and award multi-year funding to the best proposals. These long-\nterm grants allow programs to plan, grow, develop partnerships, and \nhire quality staff. Parents are able to choose among various programs \nfor their children. By contrast, a voucher program would give the money \nto parents rather than the States, eliminating the funding stability \nthat is so critical to developing high-quality programs.\n  The President's proposal is unwise in two respects. In the short \nterm, it would eliminate many parents' access to afterschool care. In \nthe long term, it would undermine the quality of those programs that \nsurvive. David Kass, the president of a national nonprofit anticrime \norganization called Fight Crime: Invest in Kids, has said, ``Law \nenforcement leaders across the country agree: this [proposal] threatens \npublic safety.''\n  Mr. President, I hope that my colleagues will reject the \nadministration's proposal and continue to support the 21st Century \nCommunity Learning Centers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/28/senate-section/article/S1379-1", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1379-S1381]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   JOHN SHATTUCK ON RESTORING THE RULE OF LAW IN U.S. FOREIGN POLICY\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I welcome this opportunity to commend to \nmy colleagues a very thoughtful and informational article in the \ncurrent issue of the American Prospect by former Assistant Secretary of \nState and Ambassador to the Czech Republic, John Shattuck, who \ncurrently serves as CEO of the Kennedy Library Foundation.\n  In his article, ``Healing Our Self-Inflicted Wounds,'' Mr. Shattuck \nmakes the point that in the past few years America has seriously \nwounded itself in the eyes of the wider world by failing to live up to \nour highest ideals. Our policies have made it more difficult to enlist \nthe support of our traditional allies in accomplishing our foreign \npolicy goals and have emboldened those who do not share our goals to \nwork harder to undermine them.\n  Mr. Shattuck lays out several key steps for the next President to \ntake to repair the damage done in the past 8 years and restore \nAmerica's credibility--and strength--in the world. I believe his \narticle will be of interest to all of us in Congress.\n  And I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From The American Prospect, Jan.-Feb. 2008]\n\n Healing Our Self-Inflicted Wounds--How the Next President Can Restore \n     the Rule of Law to U.S. Foreign Policy--and Rebuild American \n                         Credibility and Power\n\n                           (By John Shattuck)\n\n       There's a remarkable paradox in the relationship today \n     between the United States and the rest of the world. Despite \n     economic and military assets unparalleled in history, U.S. \n     global influence and standing have hit rock bottom.\n       As an economic superpower, the U.S. has a defense budget \n     that accounts for more than 40 percent of global military \n     spending. But this ``hard power'' does not necessarily \n     translate into real power. National-security failures abound, \n     from the catastrophic events in Iraq to the resurgence of \n     terrorist networks in Afghanistan and Pakistan, from the \n     growing threat of civil war throughout the Middle East to the \n     deepening uncertainties of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, \n     from the standoff with Iran to the genocide in Darfur.\n       The next president will have to address these crises by re-\n     establishing America's capacity to lead. Doing so will \n     involve working to regain international credibility and \n     respect by reshaping American foreign policy to direct the \n     use of power within a framework of the rule of law.\n\n\n                        THE SCALE OF THE PROBLEM\n\n       The United States may be strong economically and \n     militarily, but the rest of the world sees it as ineffective \n     and dangerous on the global stage. Less than a decade ago the \n     situation was quite different. A 1999 survey published by the \n     State Department Office of Research showed that large \n     majorities in France (62 percent), Germany (78 percent), \n     Indonesia (75 percent), Turkey (52 percent), among others, \n     held favorable opinions of the U.S.\n       This positive climate of opinion fostered an outpouring of \n     international support immediately following the September 11 \n     attacks. The U.S. was able to assemble a broad coalition with \n     U.N. approval to respond to the attacks and strike terrorist \n     strongholds in Afghanistan.\n       Six years later global support for U.S. leadership has \n     evaporated. In poll after poll, international opinion of the \n     U.S. has turned sour. A January 2007 BBC survey found that 52 \n     percent of the people polled in 18 countries around the world \n     had a ``mainly negative'' view of the U.S., with only 29 \n     percent having a ``mainly positive'' view. In nearly all the \n     countries that had strong support for the U.S. in 1999 a big \n     downward shift of opinion had occurred by the end of 2006. In \n     France it was down to 39 percent, in Germany down to 37 \n     percent, and in Indonesia down to 30 percent. A separate \n     survey conducted in 2006 by the Pew Research Center revealed \n     extremely hostile attitudes toward the U.S. throughout the \n     Arab and Muslim world: Egypt polled 70 percent negative, \n     Pakistan 73 percent, Jordan 85 percent, and Turkey 88 \n     percent.\n       A major factor driving this negative global opinion is the \n     way the U.S. has projected its power in the ``war on \n     terror.'' Four years after the Iraq invasion, U.S. military \n     presence in the Middle East was seen by 68 percent of those \n     polled by the BBC ``to provoke more conflict than it \n     prevents.'' Similarly, a poll published in April 2007 by the \n     Chicago Council on Global Affairs showed that in 13 of 15 \n     countries, including Argentina, France, Russia, Indonesia, \n     India, and Australia, a majority of people agreed that ``the \n     U.S. cannot be trusted to act responsibly in the world.''\n       The U.S. is now seen internationally to be a major violator \n     of human rights. The BBC poll showed that 67 percent of those \n     surveyed in 18 countries disapproved of the U.S. government's \n     handling of detainees in Guantanamo. A survey conducted in \n     June 2006 by coordinated polling organizations in Germany, \n     Great Britain, Poland, and India found that majorities or \n     pluralities in each country believed that the U.S. has \n     tortured terrorist detainees and disregarded international \n     treaties in its treatment of detainees, and that other \n     governments are wrong to cooperate with the U.S. in the \n     secret ``rendition'' of prisoners.\n       These global opinion trends have reduced the capacity of \n     the United States to carry out its foreign policy and protect \n     national security. The perception of a growing gap between \n     the values the U.S. professes and the way it acts--\n     particularly in regard to human rights and the rule of law--\n     has eroded U.S. power and influence around the world.\n       In his book, Soft Power: The Means to Success in World \n     Politics, Joseph Nye analyzes a nation's ``ability to get \n     what [it] wants through attraction rather than coercion.'' \n     Soft power derives from ``the attractiveness of a nation's \n     culture, political ideals, and policies. When [its] policies \n     are seen as legitimate in the eyes of others, [its] soft \n     power is enhanced.'' Today, American political ideals have \n     lost much of their global attraction because their appeal has \n     been undermined by U.S. policies and actions that lack \n     legitimacy in the eyes of the world. American foreign policy \n     will continue to fail until the U.S. regains the \n     international respect it has lost.\n       Fortunately, history shows that the capacity to lead can be \n     restored when U.S. values and policies are generally in \n     synch. During\n\n[[Page S1380]]\n\n     the first decade and a half of the Cold War, images of racism \n     and segregation in the United States undercut the ability of \n     the U.S. to project moral leadership. By the mid-1960s, \n     however, the civil-rights movement and the leadership of \n     Presidents Kennedy and Johnson had revived this vital \n     capacity.\n       Similarly, following the disaster in Vietnam, a number of \n     U.S. foreign-policy successes were achieved through \n     bipartisan presidential leadership. President Ford signed the \n     Helsinki Accords, which led to international recognition for \n     the cause of human rights inside the Soviet bloc. President \n     Carter mobilized democratic governments to press for the \n     release of political prisoners held by repressive \n     governments. President Reagan signed the Convention Against \n     Torture and sent it to the Senate, where it was subsequently \n     ratified. President George H.W. Bush joined with Western \n     European governments to nurture the fledgling democracies of \n     post-Cold War Central and Eastern Europe. President Clinton \n     worked with NATO to end the human-rights catastrophe in \n     Bosnia and prevent genocide in Kosovo. Each of these foreign-\n     policy successes was achieved by linking American interests \n     and values.\n       Three fundamental principles govern the exercise of soft \n     power through the promotion of human rights and the rule of \n     law. The first is practicing what you preach. The U.S. loses \n     credibility when it charges others with violations it is \n     committing itself. It reduces its ability to lead when it \n     acts precipitously without international authority or the \n     support of other nations. The second is obeying the law. \n     Human rights are defined and protected by the U.S. \n     Constitution and by conventions and treaties that have been \n     ratified and incorporated into U.S. domestic law. The U.S. \n     must adhere to these legal obligations if it is to project \n     itself to other countries as a champion of human rights and \n     the rule of law. The third is supporting international \n     institutions. The U.S. should lead the way in reshaping \n     existing international institutions and creating new ones, \n     not attacking them, acting unilaterally, or turning its back \n     whenever it disagrees with what they do.\n       The administration of President George W. Bush has \n     repeatedly violated each of these principles. It has opened \n     the U.S. to charges of hypocrisy by criticizing other \n     governments for acting outside the rule of law and committing \n     human-rights abuses it has committed itself. The annual \n     Country Reports on Human Rights Practices issued by the State \n     Department cover official actions such as ``torture and other \n     cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment,'' \n     ``detention without charge,'' ``denial of fair public \n     trial,'' and ``arbitrary interference with privacy, family, \n     home, or correspondence.'' These are the very practices in \n     which the Bush administration itself has systematically \n     engaged, compelling readers of the State Department Country \n     Reports to conclude that the U.S. does not practice what it \n     preaches. The 2006 report on Egypt, for example, criticizes \n     the fact that Egyptian police and security forces ``detained \n     hundreds of individuals without charge,'' that ``abuse of \n     prisoners and detainees by police, security personnel and \n     prison guards remained common,'' and that ``the [Egyptian] \n     Emergency Law empowers the government to place wiretaps--\n     without warrants.'' These same criticisms apply to the \n     United States.\n       The Bush administration has diminished a second source of \n     soft power by flaunting basic requirements of international \n     and domestic law. These include the Geneva Conventions, the \n     Convention Against Torture, and the International Convent on \n     Civil and Political Rights, and the Foreign Intelligence \n     Surveillance Act. The result has been the creation of ``law-\n     free zones'' in which foreign detainees in U.S. custody \n     overseas have been brutally abused, thousands of foreign \n     citizens have been held indefinitely as ``unlawful \n     combatants'' without being accorded the status of prisoners \n     of war, and repressive regimes around the world have \n     implicitly been given the green light to crack down on \n     political dissidents and religious and ethnic minorities in \n     the name of fighting terrorism.\n       The administration's history of disregard for the \n     established framework of international law was made clear by \n     a 2002 memorandum, prepared by the then-White House counsel, \n     Alberto Gonzales, proclaiming that ``terrorism renders \n     obsolete the Geneva Conventions' strict limitations on the \n     questioning of prisoners.'' No recent president had \n     questioned the basic rules of international humanitarian law \n     in times of war. The administrations of Lyndon B. Johnson, \n     Richard Nixon, and Gerald Ford during the Vietnam War, and \n     George H.W. Bush during the Gulf War, all adhered to the \n     Geneva requirements. The reasons were spelled out in a 2002 \n     memorandum by then-Secretary of State Colin Powell, \n     challenging the Gonzales memo. Powell warned that the White \n     House interpretation of the Geneva Conventions would \n     ``reverse over a century of U.S. policy and practice, \n     undermine the protections of the law of war for our troops, \n     and [provoke] negative international reaction, with immediate \n     adverse consequences for our conduct of foreign policy.''\n       A third source of soft power has been undermined by the \n     Bush administration's attacks on and disengagement from \n     international human-rights institutions. The U.S. has been a \n     world leader in building these institutions since the time \n     when Eleanor Roosevelt chaired the international committee \n     that drafted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The \n     current administration has renounced that leadership by \n     refusing to run for a seat on the new U.N. Human Rights \n     Council and by undermining efforts to shape the new \n     International Criminal Court (ICC). Both institutions are \n     flawed, but as a result of the administration's disengagement \n     the U.S. now has no influence over their future development.\n\n\n                     UNDERCUTTING NATIONAL SECURITY\n\n       The Bush administration's record on human rights and the \n     rule of law has undercut the capacity of the U.S. to achieve \n     important foreign-policy goals. The erosion of America's soft \n     power has made it more difficult for the U.S. to succeed in \n     preventing or containing threats of terrorism, genocide, and \n     nuclear proliferation. The denigration of American values has \n     made the U.S. ineffective in promoting human rights and \n     democracy. Indeed, the current administration's frequent \n     disregard of the rule of law has jeopardized five frequently \n     stated foreign-policy objectives.\n       The first is countering the threats posed by Iraq, Iran, \n     and Afghanistan. For more than a decade these countries have \n     topped the United States' list of dangers to international \n     security. Strategies to reduce the violence and terrorism in \n     Iraq and Afghanistan and to prevent Iran from exporting \n     terrorism and acquiring nuclear weapons require a mixture of \n     hard and soft power. But reports of CIA and U.S. military \n     torture and mistreatment of prisoners at Abu Ghraib and other \n     secret prisons in the region may have weakened the ability of \n     the U.S. to counter the deterioration of human-rights \n     conditions in Iraq and Afghanistan. Similarly, State \n     Department criticism of the Iranian regime's political \n     repression has been blunted by the U.S. record of detainee \n     abuse and illegal electronic surveillance. Years after the \n     U.S. military interventions, Iraq and Afghanistan remain \n     major exporters of terrorism and centers of human-rights \n     abuse. Iran is a major terrorist exporter and a human-rights \n     disaster.\n       A second major stated objective of U.S. foreign policy is \n     preventing genocide. The lesson of Rwanda was that the cost \n     of failing to stop genocide is not only a massive killing of \n     innocent civilians but also an ongoing humanitarian \n     catastrophe and long-term regional instability. Following the \n     Rwanda genocide, a doctrine of humanitarian intervention was \n     developed under U.S. leadership and invoked, with broad \n     international support and authority under the Genocide \n     Convention, to end the genocide in Bosnia in 1995, and then \n     to prevent a genocide in Kosovo in 1999. Today, that doctrine \n     is in shambles, undermined and discredited by the Bush \n     administration's intervention in Iraq. As a result, the U.S. \n     has been unable to mobilize support to stop the ongoing \n     genocide in Darfur and an entire region of Africa has been \n     destabilized.\n       Addressing the challenges posed by geopolitical rivals such \n     as China, Russia, and Cuba is a third long-standing concern \n     of U.S. foreign policy. The Bush record has made already-\n     complicated interactions with these countries even more \n     difficult. China is leading the way in effectively exploiting \n     the growing global perception that the U.S. is a human-rights \n     violator. For several years the Chinese government has \n     produced and publicized its own report on U.S. human-rights \n     failings in an attempt to counter U.S. criticism of China's \n     record. China's March 2007 report was particularly blunt: \n     ``We urge the U.S. government to acknowledge its own human \n     rights problems and stop interfering in other countries' \n     internal affairs under the pretext of human rights.'' Russian \n     President Vladimir Putin has been similarly direct in \n     rejecting recent U.S. criticism of the Russian government's \n     press censorship, and Cuba has been quick to point to the \n     U.S. record of detainee abuse at Guantanamo whenever Cuban \n     human-rights practices are challenged by the U.S. The Bush \n     administration has provided China, Russia, and Cuba with a \n     convenient excuse for cracking down on dissidents and \n     minorities under the guise of fighting terrorism within their \n     borders.\n       Creating and managing strategic alliances is a fourth major \n     U.S. foreign-policy objective. The Bush administration's \n     record on human rights and the rule of law has alienated \n     traditional democratic allies and complicated relations with \n     authoritarian countries. The Council of Europe, a \n     parliamentary assembly of elected representatives from across \n     the continent, has condemned European governments for \n     cooperating with the U.S. in running secret detention \n     centers, and has called for Europe to distance itself from \n     the Bush administration's tactics in the ``war on terror.'' \n     Negative European opinion about U.S. human-rights practices \n     has made it politically difficult for European leaders to \n     support U.S. positions on other issues. And by condoning \n     torture, prisoner abuse, secret detention, illegal \n     surveillance, and other violations of human rights, the \n     administration has also undercut its ability to promote \n     reform with authoritarian allies like Egypt, Saudi Arabia, \n     Morocco, and Uzbekistan.\n       Finally, holding accountable those who commit human-rights \n     crimes has been a bedrock objective of U.S. foreign policy \n     since the Nuremberg trials following World War II. The U.S. \n     has long been at the forefront of efforts to create a system \n     of international justice, most recently in the establishment \n     of the International Criminal Tribunals for the Former \n     Yugoslavia and Rwanda. By opposing the International Criminal \n     Court, the Bush administration has relinquished its \n     leadership on these issues. The indispensability of\n\n[[Page S1381]]\n\n     international justice to U.S. foreign policy is illustrated \n     by the administration's retreat in 2006 from outright \n     opposition to the ICC to reluctant acceptance of the U.N. \n     Security Council's referral of the Darfur genocide case to \n     ICC jurisdiction. But this begrudging exception unfortunately \n     proves the rule.\n\n\n                          REPAIRING THE DAMAGE\n\n       The next president must make repairing the damage to \n     American values and moral authority a top priority. Acting \n     within a framework of the rule of law and respect for human \n     rights will be essential to restoring America's international \n     leadership.\n       The U.S. must strengthen its alliances by demonstrating it \n     adheres to international norms in pursuing its national-\n     security objectives. The next president should immediately \n     announce that the U.S. will close the detention center at \n     Guantanamo and transfer detainees to the U.S. or \n     detainees' home countries. In addition, the president \n     should announce that the U.S. is bound by the Geneva \n     Conventions as a matter of law and policy. Restoring the \n     U.S. policy of providing individualized status hearings to \n     detainees would demonstrate respect for international \n     norms without restricting the government's capacity to \n     conduct lawful interrogations to obtain intelligence \n     information about terrorist activities. Fully applying the \n     Geneva Conventions also would not preclude the U.S. from \n     trying detainees in military commissions.\n       A second means of underscoring U.S. commitment to address \n     national-security threats within the rule of law would be to \n     provide assistance to other countries for counterterrorism \n     operations that comply with basic human-rights standards. \n     ``Fighting terror'' has become a convenient excuse for \n     repressive regimes to engage in further repression, often \n     inspiring further terrorism in an increasing cycle of \n     violence. To break this cycle, the U.S. should provide \n     assistance and training to foreign military and law \n     enforcement personnel in methods of fighting terrorism within \n     the rule of law.\n       The U.S. should take the lead in drafting a comprehensive \n     treaty defining and condemning terrorism within a framework \n     of human rights. Working toward a consensus on this global \n     issue would help counter the claim that differences in \n     cultural values, religious beliefs, political philosophies, \n     or justifiable ends make it impossible to define the crime of \n     terrorism.\n       The president should make clear that the U.S. is prepared \n     once again to be an active participant in strengthening the \n     system of international law it helped create over the last \n     half century. Important treaties have lingered for years in \n     the Senate and should now be ratified or renegotiated. Some \n     were signed by Republican presidents and once enjoyed \n     bipartisan support, but have been blocked for the last seven \n     years by the current administration and its Senate \n     supporters. The U.S. should also rejoin negotiations on such \n     critical issues as human rights, international justice, \n     climate change, and nonproliferation of weapons of mass \n     destruction. By doing so, the next president would \n     demonstrate that globalization can be made to work within the \n     rule of law.\n       The U.S. should support those seeking to promote the rule \n     of law, democracy, and human rights in their own countries. \n     Democracy and human-rights activists are the shock troops in \n     the struggle against terrorism, genocide, and nuclear \n     proliferation. But democracy can never be delivered through \n     the barrel of a gun. Assistance to those who are working to \n     build their own democratic societies must be carefully \n     planned and targeted, sustained over time, and based on a \n     thorough understanding of the unique circumstances and \n     profound differences among cultures, religions, and \n     countries. A new U.S. government must work within an \n     international framework, not unilaterally and preemptively, \n     to assist those struggling around the world to bring human \n     rights to their own societies.\n       Finally, the U.S. should join with other countries, \n     alliances, and international organizations to reassert \n     America's role in working to prevent or stop genocide and \n     crimes against humanity. The president should invoke the \n     doctrine of humanitarian intervention that was applied in \n     Bosnia and Kosovo in the 1990s to address the genocide in \n     Darfur. Extensive diplomatic and economic tools can be used \n     to head off an impending genocide, but international military \n     intervention remains available under international law if all \n     other avenues have been exhausted.\n       By recommitting the U.S. to a foreign policy conducted \n     within a framework of human rights and the rule of law, the \n     next president can restore America's moral leadership in the \n     world--and by so doing, enhance American power and security.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/28/senate-section/article/S1381-1", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1381]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        FAREWELL TO ALAN HOFFMAN\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to say farewell and thank you \nto my chief of staff, Alan Hoffman. As many of you know, I was \nfortunate enough to have had Alan leading my office from 1998 to 2003, \nand then had my fortunes upped when Alan made the tremendous personal \nsacrifice, at my request, to leave California and resume his position \nin 2006. While I am sorry to see him go, it is certainly understandable \nthat Alan is now returning to the west coast, rejoining his wife in \ntheir home in Santa Monica, and taking on a major position in the \nUniversity of California system.\n  I am indebted to Alan's invaluable leadership, wise counsel, and \nunwavering loyalty. The entire Biden family has come to respect and \ncare for Alan. We all recognized right away that Alan is a thoroughly \ndecent human being, and he quickly earned my trust. I never once \ndoubted the judgment Alan exercised as my chief of staff. Never once.\n  Alan arrived at my office in 1998 having served as an assistant U.S. \nattorney in Philadelphia after having worked in the White House and the \nDepartment of Justice. Actually, the first time I met Alan was supposed \nto be for a courtesy interview as he was being considered for a high-\nlevel position with Attorney General Reno. I was so impressed with his \nintellect, his temperament, his passion, and his values that I thought, \nI want this guy to work for me. I felt it was quite the coup when he \naccepted my offer.\n  Alan brought the smarts and experience to quickly grasp the salient \npoints of any issue, and a deft hand on how to advance policy \ninitiatives. I have benefited enormously from Alan's excellent \nsensibilities. He has sharp political sense, a keen sense of timing, a \nsense of what makes people tick, and a sense of humor. Alan has \ntremendous awe and respect for the work being done by the United States \nSenate, and yet, at the same time, he has an underlying sense of \nhumility. Alan never forgets that the work of the Congress is the \npeople's business.\n  Alan oversaw many proud legislative achievements during his tenure in \nmy office, ranging from improvements to port and rail security, to \npassage of the Violence Against Women Act of 2000 to championing \ncriminal justice reforms and strengthening the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. He \nhas continued to work, until his last hour on my staff, for policies \nthat further the well-being and security of all Americans. Alan's \nleadership and unwavering sense of justice have been the catalysts for \nalliances that have a real chance of remedying the disparity in \nsentences received by those convicted of crack cocaine, as opposed to \npowder cocaine, offenses.\n  Though young when he first arrived in 1998, Alan quickly proved able \nto manage my diverse staff, ranging from bookish lawyers, to foreign \npolicy specialists to caseworkers in my Delaware office. Alan \nmotivated, challenged, and inspired the staff. He always set the \nhighest example for all who worked with him and has earned their \nunqualified respect and admiration. And Alan provided the solid \nleadership and needed guidance to staff when the nation was attacked on \nSeptember 11, 2001, and again, when the Senate suffered the anthrax \nattack which forced my Judiciary Committee staff out of their Hart \nBuilding offices and landed Senator Carper's staff in our own \nconference room.\n  Alan has unlimited patience to hear all sides of an issue whether \nfrom staff, divergent interest groups, or constituents. He understands \ncomplexity and yet is always ready with a commonsense and principled \nrecommendation that was easily explainable to both people inside, and \nmore importantly, outside the beltway. Importantly, he is also a \ntrusted and respected ally to so many of my colleagues; they know they \ncan call Alan when I am not reachable and they can always count on him \nto follow through.\n  Mr. President, this is one of those moments when saying thank you \nsimply seems inadequate. Alan Hoffman left his then-fiancee, now wife, \na high-level position at the RAND Corporation, and a settled life in \nCalifornia to return to my office in 2006. That kind of loyalty, \ndedication, and sacrifice are rare.\n  I understand completely that Alan is ready to go home. I wish him and \nhis wife Lizzie all the best. I have no doubt that he will prove to be \njust as talented and invaluable in his new position. But the fact \nremains that Alan Hoffman will be deeply missed, and his work and \nleadership leave an enduring imprint both in Washington and in \nDelaware.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/28/senate-section/article/S1382-1", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1382]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S1382]]\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       A TRIBUTE TO SHANE STEWART\n\n Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I wish today to honor the service \nand sacrifice of CAPT Shane Stewart.\n  My wife Joan and I were deeply saddened to hear of the tragic death \nof CAPT Shane Stewart this past Saturday in Weld County, CO, as he was \nen route to render aid to a sick caller in the town of Ault.\n  It takes a person of great courage to become a firefighter. It takes \na strong, hard-working, and considerate individual, who like in many \nsmall communities across America, volunteer their time and effort, at \nsometimes great risk to themselves, to become a volunteer firefighter. \nIt takes a special someone who is willing to pay the ultimate price in \nprotecting the safety of others.\n  Captain Stewart was just this person. And unfortunately, Captain \nStewart paid the ultimate price on February 23. He was 33 years old. \nShane is the first firefighter killed in the line of duty in the Ault-\nPierce Fire Protection District.\n  The Colorado native was born in Sterling and grew up in Greeley. \nShane was employed by the Colorado Department of Transportation and \nconcurrently served as a volunteer firefighter when called to duty. \nVolunteer firefighters are the backbone of many of our small towns and \ncommunities. In fact there are a total of 15,000 firefighters in \nColorado with 9,450 being volunteers in their respective communities. \nShane joined the Ault-Pierce Fire Protection District as a volunteer \nfirefighter in August 2004.\n  Shane came from a family steeped in firefighting tradition. Shane's \nfather and brother are also volunteers with the 21-member department.\n  Captain Stewart was a father, brother, and a son. He is survived by \nhis wife Cyndee, sons Blake and Logan, parents Paul and Jeanette, and \nhis brother Sean. Shane was well liked by his peers and was someone you \nwould like to have as a friend and colleague.\n  The Ault-Pierce Fire Protection District lost a valuable member of \nits community, as did the State of Colorado. We are all forever \ngrateful for Captain Shane Stewart's service and dedication as a \nfirefighter. His service to all of us is highly commendable, and his \ncontributions will be remembered.\n  I extend my deepest sympathy to the family of CAPT Shane Stewart. May \nhis bravery and unwavering sense of duty serve as a role model for the \nfuture generation of firefighters.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/28/senate-section/article/S1382-2", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1382]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   HONORING DAVID WILLIAM SUMMERFIELD\n\n Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, today I honor the memory of David \nWilliam Summerfield, a husband, father, soldier, pilot, and a beloved \nmember of the Cumberland community. Dave died on February 21, piloting \na small plane from Charleston, WV, to Cumberland. Also lost was his \npassenger, Rob Kessel of Bel Air, MD.\n  Dave Summerfield's death has been a blow to the entire community and \nto all who knew him. A graduate of Allegany High School, Dave dedicated \nhimself to the service of our Nation by joining the U.S. Air Force in \n1951. During his distinguished military career, he was awarded the \nBronze Star Service Medal, Air Force Meritorious Service Medal, Air \nForce Commendation Medal, Air Force Outstanding Unit Award with V for \nValor, Vietnam Service Medal with four campaign stars, and RVN Honor \nMedal First Class with Gold Palm.\n  In 1972, he returned to his childhood home in Rawlings after retiring \nfrom the Air Force. There he and his wife, Jessie Marie, raised a \nfamily of five children and started an aviation business. His greatest \njoy in life was his family; his second greatest joy was flying.\n  Dave was a certified Airline Transport Pilot, ATP, the highest grade \nof pilot certification that the Federal Aviation Administration, FAA, \ncan bestow. He and Jessie Marie founded Summerfield Aviation, an FAA-\napproved pilot school, Air Charter and Aerial Photography Service \nlocated at the Cumberland Regional Airport. During his 35 years as a \npilot, he logged thousands of hours and provided flight instruction to \nhundreds of students. He was beloved by his students, many of whom \njoined the search for his plane when they learned it was missing.\n  He also understood the need to give back to the community. He served \nas a deacon and was on the board of directors of the Grace Bible \nFellowship in Short Gap, WV. He also was a member of the Calvary \nBaptist Church in Cresaptown. During the last year of his life, he led \na Bible study with prisoners at the Federal Correctional Institution in \nCumberland.\n  On a personal note, Dave's youngest son, Robin, is a valuable member \nof my staff, as my field representative for the western part of \nMaryland.\n  Mr. President, on behalf of the citizens of Maryland and members of \nthe U.S. Senate, I wish to extend our sincerest condolences to the \nfamily of Dave Summerfield.

Mr. President, it is with great pride that I \nrecognize Jeffrey Lane Miller of Hendersonville, NC. Mr. Miller is the \nfounder of HonorAir, an all-volunteer community group, which was \norganized to honor local World War II veterans by providing them with \nthe opportunity to visit their National World War II Memorial in \nWashington, DC, at no expense.\n  The National World War II Memorial, dedicated in 2004, honors the 16 \nmillion men and women who served in the Armed Forces of the United \nStates, the more than 400,000 who died, and all who supported the war \neffort from home. Thousands of WWII veterans pass away every year \nwithout having a chance or ability to visit the monument recognizing \ntheir service.\n  Jeff's passion and commitment to America's ``greatest generation'' \nhas galvanized the Henderson County community. Mr. Miller accomplished \nwhat was believed to be the impossible. He organized and obtained \nfunding for chartering commercial aircraft to fly veterans from North \nCarolina to Washington, DC. His unwavering dedication, with the help of \nmany in the community, has resulted in more than 630 World War II \nveterans participating in the Hendersonville HonorAir trips. Most of \nthese heroes otherwise would not have been able to visit their monument \ndue to physical or financial limitations.\n  In partnership with veterans advocates, Jeff created the Honor Flight \nNetwork. This network is in the process of honoring the service of \nWorld War II veterans from across the United States. As the result of \nJeff's inspiration, leadership, and tireless efforts, Honor Flight has \nbeen established throughout communities in more than 25 States.\n  Today I ask that the Senate join with me in recognizing the \nremarkable public service of Jeff Miller. Jeff has worked so hard to \nmake his dream, of recognizing World War II veterans, into reality. His \nselfless service has not only had a tremendous impact in his community \nbut throughout our great Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/28/senate-section/article/S1382-4", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1382-S1383]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE OZARK-ST. FRANCIS NATIONAL FORESTS\n\n Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, today I recognize one of the most \nbeloved heritages in my home State of Arkansas, our national forests. \nArkansas is blessed with two National Forest Systems, the Ouachita \nNational Forest and the Ozark-St. Francis National Forests. Last year, \nwe recognized the 100th Anniversary of the Ouachita National Forest \nwhich stretches from western Arkansas to southeastern Oklahoma. On \nMarch 6, 2008, the Ozark-St. Francis National Forests will take their \nturn and celebrate their centennial anniversary.\n  For the last 100 years, the Ozark-St. Francis National Forests have \nprotected our Nation's timber resources while also providing Americans \nwith numerous outdoor and recreational opportunities. What is unique is \nthat they are two completely separate and distinct forests but are \nmanaged together.\n  In 1908, President Theodore Roosevelt set aside lands that spanned \nthe Ozark Mountains and named it the Ozark National Forest. His goal \nwas to conserve and safeguard the hardwood\n\n[[Page S1383]]\n\ntimberlands in our State, and it was one of the first efforts in our \ncountry's history to protect our Nation's valuable forests.\n  Today, the Ozark National Forest contains a little more than 1.2 \nmillion acres and runs across northern Arkansas to the Oklahoma border. \nIt is a diverse forest that harbors more than 500 different types of \ntrees and other woody plants. Moreover, it is home to the tallest \nmountain in the State of Arkansas, Mount Magazine, outside Paris, AR, \nand includes a living underground cave system, Blanchard Spring Caves, \nnear Mountain View, AR.\n  A little more than 50 years after President Roosevelt created the \nOzark National Forest, President Dwight D. Eisenhower issued a \nproclamation to set aside 22,000 additional acres in Arkansas. Named \nthe St. Francis National Forest, it is one of the smallest forests in \nthe National Forest System. The St. Francis Forest begins in the hilly \nCrowley's Ridge section of eastern Arkansas and runs along the St. \nFrancis River to the Mississippi River in the delta flatlands.\n  Each forest has its own unique character, geography, and topography, \nbut together, they form the Ozark-St. Francis National Forests.\n  The headquarters is located in Russellville, AR, at the Henry R. Koen \nForest Service Office Building. The building is named for the man who \nsupervised the Ozark National Forest from 1922-1939. The Henry R. Koen \nBuilding is a landmark in and of itself. Built by the Civilian \nConservation Corps, a New Deal work relief program during the Great \nDepression, it was dedicated in 1939. In April 1979, the building was \nnamed in Mr. Koen's honor after legislation was introduced in Congress \nby my predecessor, Senator Dale Bumpers.\n  As we celebrate this milestone, I also want the forest supervisors in \nArkansas to know that I am continuing to fight for them in the U.S. \nSenate. They oversee some of the largest national forests in the South. \nTraditionally, our forest management and conservation programs have \nbeen highly productive, efficient, and profitable, benefitting \ntaxpayers, local economies, and the region. However, with limited \nresources, our forest supervisors face considerable challenges in \naccessing and managing all of the forests.\n  Earlier this year, I sent a letter with the entire Arkansas \nCongressional delegation to the Bush administration to express our \nsupport for greater resources for our State's national forests. \nCurrently, our forest supervisors are only able to implement one half \nof their total forest management plan. Furthermore, damage from recent \ntornadoes has compounded the need for resources to access salvageable \ntimber in the most efficient and timely manner possible.\n  It is my belief that additional investment in Arkansas's national \nforests will allow Arkansans to continue enjoying them for another 100 \nyears and beyond.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/28/senate-section/article/S1383-1", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1383]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  REPORT OF AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND THE KINGDOM OF \n                   DENMARK ON SOCIAL SECURITY--PM 39\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Finance:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Pursuant to section 233(e)(1) of the Social Security Act, as amended \nby the Social Security Amendments of 1977 (Public Law 95-216, 42 U.S.C. \n433(e)(1)), I transmit herewith the Agreement Between the United States \nof America and the Kingdom of Denmark on Social Security, which \nconsists of two separate instruments: a principal agreement and an \nadministrative arrangement. The agreement was signed at Copenhagen on \nJune 13, 2007.\n  The United States-Denmark Agreement is similar in objective to the \nsocial security agreements already in force with Australia, Austria, \nBelgium, Canada, Chile, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, \nItaly, Japan, Korea, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, \nSpain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. Such bilateral \nagreements provide for limited coordination between the United States \nand foreign social security systems to eliminate dual social security \ncoverage and taxation, and to help prevent the loss of benefit \nprotection that can occur when workers divide their careers between two \ncountries. The United States-Denmark Agreement contains all provisions \nmandated by section 233 and other provisions that I deem appropriate to \ncarry out the purposes of section 233, pursuant to section 233(c)(4).\n  I also transmit for the information of the Congress a report prepared \nby the Social Security Administration explaining the key points of the \nAgreement, along with a paragraph-by-paragraph explanation of the \nprovisions of the principal agreement and the related administrative \narrangement. Attached to this report is the report required by section \n233(e)(1) of the Social Security Act, which describes the effect of the \nAgreement on income and expenditures of the U.S. Social Security \nprogram and the number of individuals affected by the Agreement.\n  I commend to the Congress the United States-Denmark Social Security \nAgreement and related documents.\n                                                      George W.

A bill to designate the facility of the United States Postal \nService located at 10799 West Alameda Avenue in Lakewood, Colorado, as \nthe ``Felix Sparks Post Office Building''; to the Committee on Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, today I introduced legislation to \ndesignate the U.S. Postal Service facility located at 10799 West \nAlameda Avenue in Lakewood, CO, as the ``Felix Sparks Post Office \nBuilding.'' This facility will bear the name of a great American, \nBrigadier General Felix Sparks. Sadly, Brigadier General Sparks passed \naway in September of last year, but this honor will serve as a lasting \ntribute to his life and service to his country, State, and community.\n  Brigadier General Felix Sparks led an exemplary life. His long and \ndistinguished military and civilian career took him from the European \ntheater of World War II to the chambers of the Colorado Supreme Court. \nGeneral Sparks' enduring leadership, honesty and integrity serve as an \ninspiration to us all. I am honored to take this time to speak about \nGeneral Sparks and to introduce this necessary piece of legislation.\n  Growing up in Arizona, the son of a rail worker, BG Sparks joined the \nU.S. Army during the Great Depression. After serving in Northern \nAfrica, he went on to lead the Colorado-based 157th regiment in Italy, \nliberating the Nazi concentration camp at Dachau. During his military \nservice, BG Sparks was awarded two Purple Hearts, two Silver Stars, the \nLegion of Merit, the Combat Infantry Badge, a Commendation Medal, eight \nbattle stars on his European/African Middle Eastern Campaign Medal, and \nthe Croix de Guerre with the Silver Gilt Star.\n  Although Brigadier General Sparks' passion was practicing law, it \npaled in comparison when he was called to serve. As a liberator, \ndecorated military officer, District Attorney for Delta, Colorado \nSupreme Court Justice, Commanding General of the Colorado Army National \nGuard, State Water Board member and University of Colorado graduate, BG \nSparks' sense of duty prevailed.\n  As a lasting tribute to this incredible man, I cannot think of a more \nappropriate honor than to have this Lakewood Post Office bear the name \nof Felix Sparks. A post office is the point in every community that \nbrings all people together, and there is no better way to symbolize the \nvirtues BG Sparks demonstrated through his public and private life. I \nencourage the Senate to pass this legislation in recognition of BG \nFelix Sparks.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2673\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. FELIX SPARKS POST OFFICE BUILDING.\n\n       (a) Designation.--The facility of the United States Postal \n     Service located at 10799 West Alameda Avenue in Lakewood, \n     Colorado, shall be known and designated as the ``Felix Sparks \n     Post Office Building''.\n       (b) References.--Any reference in a law, map, regulation, \n     document, paper, or other record of the United States to the \n     facility referred to in subsection (a) shall be deemed to be \n     a reference to the ``Felix Sparks Post Office Building''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SALAZAR:\n  S. 2680. A bill to amend the Reclamation Projects Authorization and \nAdjustment Act of 1992 to require the Secretary of the Interior to take \ncertain actions to address environmental problems associated with the \nLeadville Mine Drainage Tunnel in the State of Colorado, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Leadville Mine \nDrainage Tunnel Environmental Improvement Act of 2008. This legislation \nwill direct the Bureau of Reclamation to take action to eliminate the \ngrave environmental threat posed by a collapse of part of the Leadville \nMine Drainage Tunnel, or LMDT. Leadville sits at the headwaters of the \nArkansas River, and thus the effluent into the river there is of \nparamount importance to millions of people.\n  The LMDT is just over 2 miles long, and was constructed during the \n1940s and 1950s by the U.S. Department of the Interior's Bureau of \nMines to drain flooded mines in the Leadville mining district of Lake \nCounty in central Colorado. In 1959, the Bureau of Reclamation took \n``full custody, accountability, and future responsibility'' of\n\n[[Page S1387]]\n\nthe LMDT to obtain water rights and under the condition that the Bureau \nwould not spend its own funds to maintain or repair the Tunnel. In the \nearly 1990s, however, litigation compelled the Bureau to take \nresponsibility for the quality of the water discharged by the Tunnel. \nThe Bureau constructed a water treatment plant, and Congress authorized \nthe Bureau under P.L. 102-575 to treat the water discharged from the \nLMDT.\n  In 1995, however, a major collapse of a segment of the tunnel was \ndetected. Since that time, mine water has pooled behind the blockage. \nToday the Environmental Protection Agency estimates that close to 1 \nbillion gallons of water contaminated with toxic levels of cadmium, \nzinc, and manganese, has collected. The citizens of Leadville, Lake \nCounty, and the area downstream of the LMDT are deeply worried that the \nbuilding pressure from this voluminous quantity of water will cause the \nblockage to burst and flood the town, resulting in a public health and \nenvironmental disaster. This winter's heavy snowfall has some concerned \nthat spring snowmelt will further balloon the quantity of toxic water \nand exacerbate the risk. Under intense scrutiny, this week the EPA and \nthe Bureau have partnered to begin pumping some of the water to the \ntreatment plant and I appreciate their response. But these actions are \nonly a small piece of the puzzle in making sure the LMDT never becomes \na disaster.\n  In recent years the Federal Government's implementation of a long-\nterm fix for the mine has been jammed up as badly as the mine tunnel \nitself. My bill focuses on making sure the long term solution for the \nLMDT moves forward as expeditiously as possible. My bill gives the \nSecretary of the Interior and the Bureau of Reclamation clear authority \nand responsibility to maintain the LMDT in a manner that protects human \nhealth and the environment. For many years the Bureau has maintained \nthat it is not responsible for changed conditions within the LMDT. My \nbill eliminates any ambiguity on this point, and compels the Bureau to \nact.\n  Specifically, the legislation directs the Bureau to participate in \nthe long-term remedy for the LMDT that has already been approved by the \nEPA, the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, and has \nbeen vetted through public meetings. The bill also authorizes the \nnecessary funds for implementation of the long-term remedy. The long-\nterm solution for the LMDT, specified under the fully approved and \nvetted EPA superfund Record of Decision, is much more extensive than \nthe pumping and water treatment activity now underway. It will involve \nconstruction of a bulkhead in the tunnel to isolate the contaminated \npool, backfilling the tunnel, as well as several other actions.\n  My bill also directs the Secretary of the Interior, in cooperation \nwith the State and the EPA, to conduct a study to determine whether any \nblockages in the LMDT have affected, or are affecting, water quality \nand aquatic life in the Arkansas River in the vicinity downstream of \nthe LMDT. We must ensure that the problems with the LMDT blockage do \nnot impact the water quality of the Arkansas River, which is the \nlifeblood of so many communities. This study will help improve our \nunderstanding of the conditions of the headwaters near the LMDT.\n  For too long the inaction on fixing the LMDT has been a case study in \nFederal paralysis, with the citizens of Leadville and Lake County \ncaught in the middle. This legislation will establish the conditions \nand authority necessary to make the long-term fix at the Leadville Mine \nDrainage Tunnel a reality as soon as possible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/28/senate-section/article/S1387-1", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1387]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 463--CONGRATULATING VIVIAN STRINGER ON WINNING 800 \n                  GAMES IN WOMEN'S COLLEGE BASKETBALL\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ submitted the following resolution; which was referred \nto the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenate proceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 5264, which was \nreceived from the House.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 5264) to extend the Andean Trade Preference \n     Act, and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, today, the Senate takes the important step \nof extending the Andean Trade Preferences Act for 10 months. This \nfollows\n\n[[Page S1389]]\n\naction in the House yesterday on the same bill. We can now ensure \ncontinuation of this important program before it expires tomorrow.\n  I would have preferred a longer term extension of ATPA. But a 10-\nmonth extension is a sound compromise. It is good for America. And it \nis good for our Andean neighbors.\n  In recent weeks, we have had a lively debate over the value of this \npreference program. Opponents point to one-sided benefits. They warn \nagainst risky investments.\n  Proponents say that our Andean preferences complement drug \neradication efforts. We say that they create jobs in both developing \ncountries and here at home.\n  Today, as in the past, I support ATPA. ATPA is an investment in \nmutual prosperity and regional stability. It is good foreign policy. \nATPA is a boon to the developing economies of Peru, Colombia, Bolivia, \nand Ecuador. It brings economic development where poverty persists. It \nencourages alternative crops where illegal drugs plague the landscape. \nIt creates jobs where there have long been too few. And it can provide \na platform for more comprehensive engagement, such as the free-trade \nagreements that Peru and Colombia have negotiated with the United \nStates.\n  The economic benefits of ATPA are mutual. Flower exports from \nColombia and Ecuador employ Andean agriculture workers in their \ncountries. And they also create transportation and retail jobs here at \nhome.\n  The United States sells its cotton to Andean buyers, who make it into \nfabric and apparel. And that creates jobs for American farmers and \nskilled Andean labor. It is precisely this mutual prosperity that has \nearned the Andean Trade Preferences Act the broad support it commands, \neven from sectors that have traditionally been wary of trade.\n  But as important, we must recognize that ATPA benefits are neither \nhandouts nor freebies. To benefit from preferences, each ATPA partner \nmust meet strict eligibility criteria. Beneficiaries must afford \ninternationally recognized worker rights. They must protect and enforce \nintellectual property rights. They must cooperate in counternarcotics \nefforts. And they must ensure the integrity of U.S. investments by, \namong other things, honoring contracts with U.S. investors and abiding \nby investment decisions made by arbitral panels.\n  These eligibility requirements are not optional. If a country does \nnot comply, it should not receive ATPA benefits. Actions have \nconsequences. The U.S. will notice and take into account actions in \nATPA countries that unfairly hurt U.S. interests. Ecuador, in \nparticular, has taken actions in recent years that call into question \nits intention to abide by the ATPA conditions related to investment. \nThese developments are, at best, discouraging. At worst, they might be \ndisqualifying.\n  In the next few months, I will work with Senator Grassley and others \nto closely monitor whether our ATPA beneficiary countries meet these \neligibility criteria. And I will work to monitor whether the \nadministration is doing enough to enforce them.\n  ATPA is good policy. But, as with most policies, hard work can make \nit better. As in the past, I will continue to work with opponents and \nsupporters to ensure that all of the elements of the program are \nupheld. I will work to see that not just the trade benefits, but the \neligibility requirements as well, are upheld. When everyone is playing \nby the rules, we will have a comprehensive program that is as good for \nthe United States as it is for Peru, Colombia, Bolivia, and Ecuador.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, this week the House passed a 10 month \nextension of our unilateral trade preferences for Colombia, Peru, \nEcuador, and Bolivia, and today it is the Senate's turn to consider the \nissue. I want to take a moment to explain why I have decided to agree \nto support this 10 month extension.\n  As my colleagues know, I have been critical of the operation of these \ntrade preferences for quite some time. Last year, reported developments \nin Ecuador and Bolivia led me to question the commitment of their \nrespective Governments to upholding the democratic rule of law, \nhonoring contracts and other legal obligations, protecting civic \nfreedoms such as freedom of the press, and fully partnering with us in \nthe fight against traffic in illicit narcotics. In that context, I have \nquestioned why we should renew these particular trade preferences, \nwhich we provide in addition to the broad preferences that we give to \ndeveloping countries under our separate Generalized System of \nPreferences program.\n  More generally, I have questioned why we should continue to extend \nunilateral trade preferences when our farmers and manufacturers deserve \nto enjoy reciprocal trade benefits. I realize that we advance our \nnational interest by fostering the creation of legitimate economic \nopportunities in the four Andean beneficiary countries. There need to \nbe viable alternatives in the region if we are going to succeed in the \nfight against illicit narcotics. And the Andean trade preferences have \nbeen a good start. But I continue to question how unilateral trade \npreferences provide a basis for truly sustainable economic development \nover the long term.\n  On the other hand, a permanent, reciprocal, open trading relationship \nwould appropriately address each of those questions. That is what we \nshould be aiming for. Not only would it provide a level playing field \nfor both sides, it would facilitate the establishment of strong long-\nterm economic relationships through mutually beneficial trade and \ninvestment. That is one of the reasons why implementation of our trade \npromotion agreement with Colombia is my top priority on the trade \nagenda this year.\n  On balance, I have concluded that this 10 month extension of Andean \ntrade preferences will allow us to accomplish a number of things. It \nwill allow for the smooth entry into force of our trade agreement with \nPeru. It will avoid economic disruption in Colombia as we strive to \nimplement our trade agreement with that critical ally. And it will \nextend an opportunity for Ecuador and Bolivia to engage us in a deeper \ndialogue on the direction they want to see our bilateral economic and \npolitical relationships take going forward. But let me be clear. \nToday's extension should not be interpreted as a sign that Andean trade \npreferences are a de facto perpetuity. They are not. I intend to \ncontinue my oversight of this program in advance of its expiration at \nthe end of the year. Whether this program is again extended, or in what \nform, or for which countries, remains an open question.\n  In the meantime, I will continue monitoring a number of important \nconcerns. For example, the Government of Ecuador has indicated that the \nU.S. lease to the Eloy Alfaro airfield will not be renewed when it \nexpires in 2009. That is, of course, Ecuador's sovereign right. But we \nshould not wait until the lease expires to discuss how our cooperative \nefforts to combat traffic in illicit narcotics can be augmented in \norder to offset the loss of this access. I am also concerned about \nexpanded cultivation of coca leaf. Just this past Saturday, the New \nYork Times reported on how the rollback of restrictions on coca growing \nsince President Morales took office in Bolivia has contributed to \nsurging drug use in Argentina and Brazil. We need to focus on \ncultivation just as much as on eradication in the fight against drugs.\n  With respect to investment disputes, it is essential that legal \nobligations be fully honored. That includes honoring arbitral awards \nonce they become final. It also includes honoring contracts and the \nmutual settlement of claims involving prior disputes. Separately, I am \ndisappointed that we haven't been able to fully resolve some of our \ndifferences in agricultural trade. For example, with respect to beef, \nColombia and Peru comply with the standards of the World Organization \nfor Animal Health, which sets benchmark standards for the World Trade \nOrganization, by permitting the importation of all U.S. beef. In \ncontrast, Ecuador and Bolivia continue to reject these international \nstandards. Ecuador restricts U.S. beef imports to only boneless beef \nfrom cattle under 30 months of age, while Bolivia prohibits imports of \nall U.S. beef. In addition, Ecuador committed to phase out its \nagricultural price-band system by 2001 as part of its World Trade \nOrganization accession package, but the Government has yet to do so. \nEcuador's price-band inhibits U.S. exports of wheat, rice, barley, \ncorn, soybeans, poultry, pork, and powdered milk to Ecuador. Such \nfailures to\n\n[[Page S1390]]\n\nlive up to existing trade obligations undermine the case some make for \nan extension of trade preferences. I would also expect all four Andean \nbeneficiary countries to actively support efforts to conclude an \nambitious agreement in the Doha Development Round negotiations of the \nWorld Trade Organization. Finally, I will continue to assess our \nrespective bilateral relations on a political level, as well as monitor \nthe status of protections extended to civic freedoms such as freedom of \nthe press.\n  In closing, I want to make clear that I am very much interested in \nstrengthening our relations with each of the four Andean beneficiary \ncountries. But it takes cooperation on all sides to make that happen. \nColombia and Peru have certainly demonstrated a reciprocal interest in \nstronger relations. I hope to see a similar demonstration on the part \nof Ecuador and Bolivia in the months to come with actions that are \ncommensurate with words. I am also going to call upon the \nadministration to review conditions in Ecuador and Bolivia in order to \nhelp me evaluate the concerns that I have identified and determine \nwhether changes are warranted if the program is to be extended beyond \nthe end of this year.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise today regarding the extension of the \nAndean Trade Preference Act, ATPA. This program, which has been in \nplace for approaching two decades, has broadened economic opportunities \nin Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru as an alternative to illegal \ndrug production and trafficking. With the current extension of this \nprogram expiring tomorrow, it is important that Congress is acting this \nweek to extend the program for an additional 10 months. The extension \nshould allow necessary time for passage of the U.S.-Colombia FTA, \nimplementation of the Peru FTA, and continued commerce for Andean \nproducers and U.S. consumers and importers.\n  However, this extension does not minimize the continued need for the \ntimely advancement of the U.S.-Colombia Free Trade Agreement, FTA, \nwhich would deepen our two nation's important relationship, broaden \nmarket opportunities for U.S. producers and companies, and provide \nlonger term certainty for Colombian exporters and workers that short-\nterm ATPA extensions do not provide. We must do all that we can to \nmaintain and improve our Nation's global competitiveness and relations \nthroughout the world, and the U.S.-Colombia FTA is a much needed step \nin the right direction for providing economic opportunities for \nAmericans through reciprocal trade treatment for U.S. products. For \nexample, the U.S.-Colombia FTA would provide immediate duty-free access \nfor fresh potatoes and almost all processed potatoes. Currently, \nColombia's WTO tariff bindings on potatoes and potato products range \nfrom 70 to 102 percent and applied tariff rates range from 5 to 20 \npercent. This is just one example of the areas where the U.S. stands to \ngain improved access into one of the region's fastest growing markets \nthrough this agreement.\n  Additionally, as with all trade preferences and agreements, the \nrequirements must be fully enforced. The U.S. is providing special \ntrade preferences to these countries through this program, and with \nthat comes a responsibility to comply with the standards and \nobligations set forth in ATPA. Our ATPA partner countries must treat \nU.S. investors consistently with current ATPA eligibility.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG.
