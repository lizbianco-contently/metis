Mr. President, my wife Joan and I were horrified at the \nviolence and bloodshed at Virginia Tech on Monday.\n  I was already preparing to come to the floor today to speak on \nanother tragedy. Today marks the eighth anniversary of the Columbine \nmurders. Next Thursday, it will be 7 months since the shooting at \nPlatte Canyon High School in Bailey, CO. April has become a month of \nawful memories, a month of terrible reminders of the presence of evil \nand the ability of lost souls to stray far into the darkness.\n  I stood on this floor in April 1999 to express my shock and dismay at \nwhat had happened in Littleton. I offered my condolences to all those \nwho lost loved ones, and to those whose loved ones have been wounded, \nhurt, and terrified. Today I remember them again, but I also must add \nsympathy and support for those at Virginia Tech.\n  Words cannot adequately convey the deep sense of loss all of us are \nfeeling over this tragedy. But words--these words, and the words of our \nprayers--are what we have to offer.\n  Yet again, America is in shock.\n\n[[Page S4790]]\n\n  There are far too many of my colleagues who have had this \nexperience--who have watched as news of school violence spread across \nour country. This week's tragedy was in Virginia, but it is obviously \nof nationwide concern.\n  Thirty-two lives, most of them young and from the best and brightest \nin our society, ended Monday by savage violence. Last year, one lost \nlife in Bailey; thirteen lives lost in 1999 at Columbine in Littleton; \nand there are others lost around this Nation, and around the world, in \nsimilar tragedies: Dawson College in Montreal, Gutenberg School in \nErfurt, Germany.\n  These are wounds, scars, that will not be removed, and for those who \nbear the worst of this burden my wife and I offer all our compassion, \nour sympathy and our prayers.\n  Our Nation continues to grieve with the families and friends of those \nkilled and the injured students and teachers. Although we know \nexhaustive details of what happened at Columbine, and are learning more \nfrom Blacksburg, we are still attempting to understand why. People are \ntrying to cope with the terror that keeps thrusting itself into our \nlives. It has become obvious at this point that there are no easy \nanswers. We need to examine the problems facing our youth, but it is \ncritical that we take time to carefully consider the solutions being \noffered.\n  In the coming months there will be time, and there will be a need, \nfor us to commit ourselves to finding a way to attempt to prevent this \nfrom happening again. We must ask ourselves how this could happen, and \nwhat can be done to prevent it. There is, I am sure, no simple \nsolution. But we must pledge ourselves to doing what we can. After \nColumbine, the Nation took a serious look at school safety. But \nBailey--and the murders in Pennsylvania last year at Nickel Mines Amish \nSchool--showed us that it is not always troubled students. Virginia \nTech showed us it is not just grade schools or high schools. We need to \nthink about ways to provide a better, more secure future.\n  Watching the aftermath in Blacksburg, I am reminded of the healing \nColorado undertook 8 Aprils ago. I remember the memorial service held \nthe weekend after the Columbine murders. Tens of thousands of people \nattended the memorial service. Among those gathered in sorrow, Joan and \nI witnessed a strong belief in God. We prayed together and searched for \nanswers. I hope the students, faculty and families of Virginia Tech can \nfind their way to face this terrible time.\n  Again, I offer my deepest sympathy to those who are suffering. And I \nwant to let my colleagues from Virginia, and their constituents, know \nthe people of Colorado will be thinking of you today as we mark the \neighth anniversary of Columbine.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/20/senate-section/article/S4790-1", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4790]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will proceed to consideration of S. 761, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 761) to invest in innovation and education to \n     improve the competitiveness of the United States in the \n     global economy.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, sometime last year, word was received that \nSenators Bingaman and Alexander had an idea. The idea was to do \nsomething about our country's educational slide the wrong way. I spoke \nto them on several occasions. They wanted to see what we could do to \nincrease our competitiveness internationally. Their suggestion was, \nfirst, let's do a study and find out how bad it is; is it as bad as we \nthink it is. These two fine Senators got other Senators to join with \nthem in the idea. They received a study from the National Academy of \nSciences to find out where we were internationally with our science \nprograms. The information was not good. As a result of that, we have \nthe legislation now before the Senate.\n  This legislation is not the know-all and cure-all, but it is \ncertainly a major step forward, if we can do this, and there is no \nreason we cannot.\n  I am happy and pleased to speak about the America COMPETES \nlegislation. America COMPETES comes from the words ``creating \nopportunities to meaningfully promote excellence in technology, \neducation, and science,'' COMPETES. This is something we should do and \nare doing on a bipartisan basis. The bill is sponsored by both leaders \nand 50 Senators. That is a step in the right direction. Frankly, this \nis the way we used to do legislation here. There was so much that was \ndone on a bipartisan basis. If we are able to complete this \nlegislation, it will allow us to move forward on other meaningful \nlegislation dealing with this subject generally.\n  The bill is the result clearly of a truly bipartisan effort. This \nlegislation has been in the making for 2 years. I said last year. Time \nflies by. It was the year before last that these two Senators came to \nme to talk about this subject. They asked the National Academy to make \nrecommendations on steps we should take as a nation to maintain our \ncompetitive advantage. The result was the Augustine report, ``Rising \nAbove the Gathering Storm.'' The report warned that the Nation's \ntraditional advantages are eroding at a time when many other nations \nare gathering strength and that decisive action is needed now.\n  We faced a challenge such as this before, one that occurred when I \nwas in high school. In 1957, when the Soviets launched Sputnik, there \nwas panic and concern. That panic and concern came about from our \ninability to do what they were doing to maintain our technological \nsuperiority. The Soviet Union clearly was ahead of us. Our great \ncountry responded to these threats quickly. The following year Congress \npassed, on a bipartisan basis, the National Defense Education Act, the \nsole purpose of which was to keep the United States ahead of the Soviet \nUnion, to increase investment in math and science education. As a \nresult of that bipartisan legislation, our country trained a whole new \ngeneration of engineers and scientists and ensured our preeminence in \ntechnology innovation for a generation.\n  The fact is, Federal investment in the basic sciences and research \nhas long been a critical component of America's competitive dominance \nglobally. Some economists have estimated that more than half of the \ncountry's economic growth since World War II has been a result of that \ntechnological innovation and dominance. Today, sadly, our position of \ndominance has been lost. We can debate where we are, but our dominance \nis not there--strong, of course, but dominant, no. We are challenged by \nemerging countries such as India and China where national investment in \nbasic research, math, and science education continues to grow at a far \ngreater pace than in the United States.\n\n  The Augustine panel cited many examples, but some statistics are \nstriking. Consider that in 2005, more than 600,000 engineers graduated \nfrom institutions of higher education in China, 600,000; 350,000 in \nIndia; in the United States, 70,000--70,000 in the United States, \n600,000 in China, and 350,000 in India. We can't keep up at that rate. \nChina's population is more than the United States, of course, yet they \ngraduate eight times the number of engineers even though they are only \nthree times larger than the United States. The report also found that \nAmerican 12th graders, seniors in high school, performed below the \nnational average for 21 countries on a general knowledge of math and \nscience.\n  Another study cited in the report had American 15-year-olds rank 24th \nout of 40 countries on a math assessment. I am embarrassed to tell the \nSenate and everyone within the sound of my voice Nevada students ranked \n43rd out of 50 States in the Nation on math assessment.\n\n[[Page S4791]]\n\n  As other countries become more competitive, it is clear we must \nrefocus our energies on enhancing the Federal commitment to funding \nbasic research in education.\n  My mind goes back to Paul Simon. The three of us had the opportunity \nto serve with him. Of course, Senator Alexander served with him in \ndifferent capacities when he was part of the Cabinet. He was a \nwonderful man, uneducated himself, no college education, wrote more \nthan 20 books. He was a newspaper publisher when he was 19 years old. \nHe knew that education was important, even though he was uneducated. He \nwrote a book called ``The Tongue-Tied American,'' about our declining \nknowledge of languages and how it was hurting us internationally. I \njoined with him in legislation to give summer workshop programs \nsponsored by the Federal Government where we could pay math and science \nteachers on an elementary and secondary level so they could make more \nmoney than other teachers to keep up with math and science and keep \nthem in the classroom. Paul Simon has passed away, but I am sure he is \nsmiling on us today as a result of our trying to move forward on \nsomething that was his vision many years ago.\n  The America COMPETES Act addresses concerns of Paul Simon and the \nNational Science Foundation. It is in effect a downpayment, a very \nmodest first step in ensuring that America retains its competitive \nedge.\n  I extend my appreciation to Senators Bingaman and Alexander for \nauthorizing the academy study. This study, along with a number of \nrecent reports and books, brought a much needed sense of urgency to \nthis issue. There are also chairmen and ranking members of committees \nwho have expressed an interest in and support of what we are doing. \nSenators Inouye, Stevens, Kennedy, Enzi, Lieberman, Ensign, Mikulski, \nHutchison, and Nelson of Florida have been instrumental in crafting \nthis legislation. This legislation will double the Federal investment \nfor the National Science Foundation over the next 4 years and for the \nOffice of Science at the Department of Energy over the next decade. I \npersonally think it should be more than five. I am happy if we can do \nthis. I hope we can. I am confident we can.\n  The bill provides grants to States in order to better align \nelementary and secondary school curriculum with the knowledge and \nskills needed for the global economy. Nevada has a program recognizing \nwhere we are in the overall scheme. It is called a P-16 Council.\n\n  This Federal legislation we have introduced and are considering now \nwill also strengthen our math and science teaching workforce--that was \nPaul Simon's dream--by recruiting and training teachers to teach in \nhigh-need schools and help improve math instruction at the elementary \nand middle school level, through Math Now grants.\n  I suggest to the two authors and the two managers of this bill we go \nback and look at the idea Senator Simon had--and I joined with him--\nthat we have summer workshop programs sponsored by the Federal \nGovernment for elementary and secondary teachers so they can update \ntheir math and science skills, get paid for doing that, and stay \nteaching. We have such a shortage of math and science teachers.\n  On the high school level, we have far fewer physics teachers than we \nhave schools. Of course, the other reason for doing this is, with the \ncollective bargaining agreements--I support them, and we have them in \nmany of our schools, in most of our school districts--it makes it very \ndifficult to pay math or science teachers more than you can pay a PE \nteacher. This summer workshop program would allow that to take place.\n  So I hope that is something Senator Alexander and Senator Bingaman \nwill look at and see if we can come up with that. It is not only \nimportant to produce these math and science teachers but to keep them \nin the schools also.\n  America COMPETES will expand important advanced placement and \ninternational baccalaureate, IB, programs by increasing the number of \nmath, science, and foreign languages AP and IB courses and preparing \nmore teachers to teach these challenging courses. This is essential for \nall States. But take, again, Nevada, where only 6 percent of 12th \ngraders took the AP calculus exam and only 7 percent took the AP \nscience exam.\n  If signed into law, our bill will do much of what the Augustine \nReport recommended, but the truth is, in years to come we will have to \ndo even more.\n  Although we make new and significant investments in research, we \nstill must address our tax structure and make sure we do as much as \npossible to encourage investment in research and development.\n  In 1844, this Congress was approached by an individual who said he \nhad a great idea. He could not raise the money in the private sector, \nbut he had an idea that would revolutionize the communications of this \ncountry, and in 1844 Congress appropriated $40,000 for a man to build a \ntelegraph line between Washington, DC, and Baltimore, MD.\nIt revolutionized--revolutionized--the communication industry, the \ntelegraph.\n  The Federal Government is going to have to understand there are times \nwhen we have to advance moneys for research and development that cannot \ncome from the private sector. I hope we will look to do it. We should \nstart by finally making the R tax credit permanent.\n  We must also do more in education. The bill strengthens educational \nopportunities in science, technology, engineering, math, and critical \nforeign languages, but this, again, is a first step--but it is a big \nfirst step.\n  As an example, we must take a very hard look at our high schools. As \nBill Gates has said, and often, our high schools were designed for a \n20th century economy and often do not address the needs of the 21st \ncentury workforce.\n  Bill Gates and Melinda Gates now are giving money to schools, school \ndistricts, but they have a lot of strings on it. For example, recently \nthey gave money to a New York school district, with this proviso: You \ncan only use this money if you are going to make your schools smaller.\n  Nevada, again--we have high schools in Nevada that have more than \n5,000 students. How in the world can students learn well--and try to \nmake that basketball team--with 5,000 students? Some of the schools are \nnot that big now, but we have many schools in southern Nevada that have \nover 3,000 students. So the Gates recognize this. We have to recognize \nthis also as part of our problem. The average school in America is \nabout 50 years old.\n  We should also realize that unless our most basic commitments to \nAmerica's students are met--by properly funding title I and No Child \nLeft Behind and making a college education accessible and affordable--\nthese efforts alone in this bill cannot prepare our students for the \nglobal economy.\n  The American COMPETES Act is a tremendously important step in \nmaintaining this Nation's competitive advantage. I look forward to \ndoing whatever I can to make this legislation a reality.\n  I express my appreciation to the Republican leader for joining in \nthis legislation. This is something he and I have talked about now for \n3 months since we have assumed our roles in this 110th Congress. We are \ngoing to work to make sure this legislation goes forward.\n  I say to everyone within the sound of my voice, for this legislation \nthere is going to be no cloture motion filed.\n  We are either going to do this or not do it. This is something we \nneed to do. We need to prove we can do things on a bipartisan basis. \nAnd if we cannot do this, Mr. President, we are in real trouble.\n  So I hope we can move forward on this legislation. I hope it sets a \nfoundation for the first of many items we can do on a bipartisan basis \nto move this country forward.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I thank my good friend, the majority \nleader, for his remarks and indicate that even though this is a Reid-\nMcConnell bill, the true inspirations for this measure being on the \nSenate floor right now are Senator Alexander from Tennessee and Senator \nBingaman from New Mexico.\n  They made an extraordinary contribution in pulling together a \ndisparate group of Senators from different committees to produce an \nextremely important piece of legislation.\n\n[[Page S4792]]\n\n  The America COMPETES Act is vitally important legislation that this \nSenate must pass to ensure America retains its competitive edge in the \nglobal economy of the 21st century.\n  This bill, sponsored by my good friend and counterpart on the other \nside of the aisle, Senator Reid, also enjoys broad bipartisan support, \nas I just indicated. Our two parties' cooperation shows how we can and \nshould work together to accomplish important things for the American \npeople.\n  The story of this bill began 2 years ago, when Senators Alexander and \nBingaman, from the Energy Committee, with then-Chairman Pete Domenici's \nblessing, asked the National Academy of Sciences a simple question: \nWhat are the top 10 actions that policymakers in Washington could take \nto keep America in the lead in science and technology for the 21st \ncentury?\n  That was the question. The National Academies turned to leaders of \nbusiness, government, and academia for an answer, including three Nobel \nprize winners and a university president who is now the Secretary of \nDefense.\n  The respected former CEO of Lockheed Martin, Norm Augustine, headed \nthe panel and produced the report we have all heard so much about, \ntitled ``Rising Above the Gathering Storm.''\n  Mr. Augustine summed up the problem we face when he wrote in that \nreport:\n\n       In the five decades since I began working in the aerospace \n     industry, I have never seen American business and academic \n     leaders as concerned about this nation's future prosperity as \n     they are today.\n\n  However, his report also specifically recommended to us how we attack \nthis problem, and maintain America's lead in science and innovation.\n  Additional recommendations were made by the Council on \nCompetitiveness and by the President in his American Competitiveness \nInitiative.\n  The good news is, boosting the number of rocket scientists--along \nwith mathematicians, engineers, and computer designers--is not rocket \nscience. We currently have the greatest scientific and technological \nenterprise in the world.\n  We have the finest system of colleges and universities anywhere. But \nin many ways we have become complacent, while other countries are \ncatching up.\n  They see by investing in science and technology and in the education \nof their citizens, they can attract jobs and create wealth. We must \nmake the same investment in our future if we are to maintain our \nleadership through this century and beyond in the global marketplace.\n  This bill, S. 761, will help maintain and improve the competitive \nedge of the United States over the next century by increasing our \ninvestment in basic research, strengthening educational opportunities \nin science, technology, engineering, and math at all educational \nlevels, and encouraging young people to pursue careers in those fields.\n  From my home State of Kentucky, that means scholarships for future \nmath and science teachers. It means increased research and development \nat our State universities, which could lead to new discoveries, new \nhigh-tech companies, and, of course, new jobs.\n  This fall, Kentucky will open the Academy of Mathematics and Science \nin Kentucky at Western Kentucky University, located in Bowling Green. \nThanks to the leadership of Dr. Julia Roberts, director of the Center \nfor Gifted Studies at WKU, the academy will bring together talented \nhigh-school students from all over the Commonwealth to study advanced \nmath and science year-round--year-round--for college credit.\n  This bill will provide Federal support to advanced academies such as \nthe Kentucky Academy throughout the Nation. A good friend of mine at \nthe University of Kentucky, its president, Lee Todd, has also been \nworking for decades to highlight the importance of math, science, and \nengineering in keeping Kentucky competitive. In a letter he recently \nsent me, President Todd wrote:\n\n       The National Academies' report ``Rising Above the Gathering \n     Storm'' has the wrong title. The ``storm'' is not gathering--\n     it is already here. . . . We are putting our economic future \n     at risk. We must do better.\n\n  Now, President Todd knows what he is talking about. Prior to assuming \nthe presidency of one of the State's flagship institutions of higher \nlearning, he was a highly regarded engineer and successful \nentrepreneur. He has built technology companies that compete in the \nglobal economy, and he understands the challenges we face.\n  The America COMPETES Act will make it easier for leaders like him to \ncreate more opportunities for technical learning and careers. I want to \ncommend him for all the hard work he has done, and I ask unanimous \nconsent his entire letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                          Office of the President,\n\n\n                                       University of Kentucky,\n\n                                     Lexington, KY, March 8, 2007.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McConnell: The ``America COMPETES Act'' \n     provides the visionary investment in education and research \n     America needs, and we appreciate your continued leadership in \n     support of the act. If we are serious about competing in the \n     global economy, we have to pursue bold policy change.\n       The National Academies' report ``Rising above the Gathering \n     Storm'' has the wrong title. The ``storm'' is not gathering--\n     it is already here. America is not producing enough \n     engineers, scientists, and mathematicians to maintain our \n     role as a world leader in technological advance. We are \n     putting our economic future at risk. We must do better.\n       The same is true for Kentucky. If we want to recruit and \n     retain knowledge-based businesses, we have to change the way \n     we teach our kids. We must inspire a lot more of them to seek \n     technical careers, and they need to have the skills necessary \n     to fill high-paying jobs and create new ones. That is why I \n     am leading a statewide Task Force on Science, Technology, \n     Engineering, and Math (STEM). We will soon announce \n     recommendations that have much in common with the ``America \n     COMPETES Act.'' Tinkering with Kentucky's current structure \n     will not be enough if we want real and lasting change in math \n     and science education. The time has come for fundamental \n     change.\n       A second initiative the Task Force will share with the \n     ``America COMPETES Act'' is recognition of the vital role \n     energy education and research play in our future economic and \n     homeland security. Kentucky is well positioned to provide \n     solutions to America's need for energy independence.\n       Senator McConnell, I want our state to be a national leader \n     in producing STEM graduates and solving America's energy \n     problems. For too long, we have been willing to wait and \n     watch as other states make tough choices that result in \n     progress for them and leftovers for us. Kentucky has that \n     opportunity to lead right now if we are willing to take \n     action. I am ready to work with you in any way I can to move \n     Kentucky and America forward.\n       Thank you again for your leadership in math and science and \n     your strong and consistent support for the University of \n     Kentucky.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Lee T. Todd, Jr.,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Finally, Mr. President, I especially want to commend, \nonce again, as I did at the outset of my remarks, my good friend from \nthe neighboring State of Tennessee, Senator Alexander, for his \nextraordinary leadership in building the case for this legislation, \nhelping to craft its various components, and shepherding it through \neach stage of the process to this point.\n  It was Senator Alexander who, 2 years ago, along with Senator \nBingaman, asked the National Academy of Sciences the question that led \nto their recommendations, and sparked this entire process.\n  Their inquiry led to the release of the Academy's report, which made \nplain for all that the leadership of the United States in science and \ntechnology is eroding, with serious consequences for our workers, our \njobs, our economy, and our very way of life.\n  Three different committees contributed titles to this bill--the \nEnergy, Commerce and HELP Committees--so I also want to thank those \ncommittees' leaders--Senators Inouye and Stevens, Senators Domenici and \nBingaman, and Senators Kennedy and Enzi--for their cooperation and hard \nwork on this important bipartisan bill.\n  In a sign of how cooperative their efforts have been, this bill was \nactually assembled last year when Republicans held the majority, but it \nwas created in such a bipartisan fashion that we are bringing the very \nsame bill up today under a Democratic majority.\n  That is a credit to the Republican leaders of these three committees, \nwho worked closely with their Democratic counterparts every step of the \nway to craft this important legislation.\n\n[[Page S4793]]\n\n  I also want to recognize the efforts of my friend and predecessor as \nRepublican leader, Senator Bill Frist of Tennessee. Senator Frist \ninvested a great deal of time and energy last year to bring these three \ncommittees together, and he was the primary sponsor of the bill last \nyear, along with Senator Reid.\n  America has led the world in innovation for over a century. From the \nlight bulb, to the airplane, to the integrated circuit, America has \ngiven the world the tools to live happier, easier, and more productive \nlives.\n  Now the rest of the world is beginning to catch up. Nations such as \nChina and India are seeing the benefits of brainpower and what it can \ndo to remake their economies.\n  The America COMPETES Act is the best way to keep more of the jobs of \nthe 21st century right here in America, and the best way to ensure that \nour children have the skills to keep America at the forefront of \ninnovation and discovery.\n  Once again, I thank all of my colleagues for working on this \ncomprehensive, bipartisan solution to reinvigorate scientific \nexploration and invention at home. This bill is an investment in our \nchildren, our schools, and in the future of America.\n  It is a bill this Senate can pass and the President can sign into \nlaw. With my colleagues' support, I hope to see exactly that in the \nvery near future.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, first I thank Senator Reid and Senator \nMcConnell for their fine statements and their willingness to be the \nlead in bringing this bill to the floor. It is bipartisan legislation. \nIt is legislation that was developed in the last Congress. We were not \nable to complete action on it there, so we are trying to do so at this \ntime.\n  It does represent the work of three committees over the past year. \nThose are the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, the Commerce, \nScience and Transportation Committee and, of course, the Health, \nEducation, Labor and Pensions Committee. I am fortunate to serve on two \nof those committees.\n  The chairman and ranking member of each of the three committees are \ncosponsoring this bill. In fact, we now have 57 Members of the Senate \nwho are cosponsoring this legislation, with Senators Reid and McConnell \nas the lead sponsors.\n  This bill reflects a deep undercurrent of anxiety in this country. It \nwas highlighted recently by the very best-selling book by Tom Friedman \ncalled ``The World Is Flat.'' It is also highlighted by the report to \nwhich Senator McConnell just referred, the ``Rising Above the Gathering \nStorm'' report issued by the National Academies of Science and \nEngineering. Both of these publications highlight a strengthening, \nworldwide, of the effort in science and technology.\n  Although we in the United States are still a world leader in these \nareas, other nations are clearly catching up. Without effort and \nintervention now, and attention to this issue now, I fear we may lose \nour edge in high technology areas that are critical to our future \neconomy. The high technology competition has been an ongoing effort and \ncontinues and will continue indefinitely.\n  In the 1980s, during the Cold War, we were about to lose our \nsemiconductor leadership to Japan. Motivated then by national security \nconcerns, the U.S. Government worked with industry to help preserve our \ndomestic chip-making capability. Along with Secretary of Defense Caspar \nWeinberger and Dr. Bob Noyce, Gordon Moore from Intel, and others, we \nwere able to launch a public-private partnership called Sematech. This \npartnership developed early phase technologies designed to keep our \nsemiconductor industry competitive.\n  Sematech was a success. It kept our industry competitive through the \n1990s and even today. But the issue we are faced with here in 2007 is \neven more troubling. India and China and other countries from the \nformer Soviet Union now represent nearly 3 billion new capitalists who \nare coming at us in a competitive way through the Internet where, in \none click, anyone in this country can order a product from anywhere in \nthe world and have that delivered to his or her doorstep. Not only can \nthese countries and entrepreneurs in these countries manufacture at a \nfraction of the cost that oftentimes is required here in the United \nStates, but in coordination with their Governments they are climbing up \nthe value chain by developing the professional talents in areas such as \nresearch and engineering and in telemedicine and in finance--in a whole \nvariety of areas.\n  We have taken for granted that our Nation would never be displaced in \nmany of these areas. These are areas that represent part of the pillars \nof our national identity. Many Americans have grown up assuming the \nUnited States would always be the leader in high technology, but that \nis not a foregone conclusion. It is not the simple box fan that is \nbeing made in China today that concerns people. It is the sophisticated \ncode from Beijing for enterprise server software or state-of-the-art \nlocomotives and turbines designed in Bangalore when they used to be \ndesigned in this country.\n  The data paints a disturbing picture about the trends with which we \nare faced. Right now the United States invests about 2.7 percent of its \ngross domestic product in research and development. That is not bad. It \nputs us No. 5 in the world in the percentage of our gross domestic \nproduct invested in research and development. Yet we are still behind \nKorea. We are still behind Japan. Both those countries invest over 3 \npercent of their gross domestic product in research and development.\n  However, the issue is not to look at the static snapshot that says \ntoday we are fifth in this level of effort, but to look at the change \nin the rate of commitment over time.\n  Let me do that with a chart here. I have several charts I want to \nbriefly take people through, to make the case for what we are up \nagainst. This is the Emerging Economies Rapidly Increasing Research and \nDevelopment Investments chart. The top line with the orange dots upon \nit shows the United States and shows we are investing more than other \nnations. But the bottom line, which, of course, is rising rapidly, is \nfast-growing economies. Those economies are specifically China, \nIreland, Israel, Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan. So clearly we have \na circumstance where the rate of change is not favorable to us. In \nfact, during this same timeframe, China's research and development per \nGDP grew from .6 percent to 1.4 percent. That is still well behind us, \nthe United States, but it doubled in slightly more than a half dozen \nyears, at a 7-percent annual growth rate.\n  The trend line on the chart is self-evident. We need to begin to \nfocus again on this area if we are going to maintain our ability to \ncompete in biotechnology, in semiconductors, in flat panel displays. In \nsome of those areas, particularly flat panel displays, the reality is \nwe no longer compete effectively.\n  Let me move to a second chart. This second chart shows the widening \ntrade deficit in certain advanced technologies, in areas such as \nsemiconductors, pharmaceuticals, and telecommunications. As the \nsophistication of the imports we bring into this country increases, so \nwill the sophistication of the research and development that is needed \nto support this type of manufacturing. You can see this orange line \nhere, which represents the trade balance in advanced technology. You \ncan see that up until somewhere around 2000, or the late 1990s, we had \na very positive balance of trade with regard to advanced technology \nproducts. Since then, the line has been going down and going down \nrapidly. This is a concern which all of us should focus on, and this \nlegislation is designed to address this concern head on.\n  The third chart shows the average science literacy score of 15-year-\nold students by country. This is very hard to read. Unfortunately, the \nlettering is too small. But the main point can be understood. These, of \ncourse, are the future scientists and engineers in the world, young \npeople on whom we depend to become future scientists and engineers and \ninnovators. Obviously, we are concerned that the United States ranks \nway down here on the chart compared to 15-year-old students in all of \nthese countries above us: Japan, South Korea, Australia, Netherlands, \nCzech Republic, New Zealand, Canada, Switzerland, France, Belgium, \nSweden, Ireland, Hungary--you can follow on down. We come in right \nbehind Iceland. We need to do better. I think\n\n[[Page S4794]]\n\neveryone in this country who is concerned about the future of our \neconomy and the future of our children knows we need to do better by \nthose children and provide a better opportunity for them to compete in \nthis world.\n\n  Let me move to the fourth chart. If we look further up the pipeline \nof future innovators, the news is not that much better. This chart \nshows the fraction of United States undergraduates who receive science \nand engineering degrees, so you can see that at least three times more \ncollege students graduate with science and engineering degrees in China \neach year than in the United States. This is not a favorable trend \neither. Obviously, there are more people in China. But our ability to \ncompete in the world, to a substantial extent, is going to depend on \nhow many people we can train and equip to compete in this science and \ncompetition.\n  The fifth chart I have here relates to trained scientists and \nengineers. This shows that China now produces almost as many Ph.D.'s as \nthe United States. Again, the trend is the disturbing part of this \nchart. It is not that China is producing nearly as many doctoral \ndegrees in the natural sciences and math and engineering as is the \nUnited States today. That is a fact but one that does not cause great \nconcern. The concern is that we were dominant in this area and have \nbeen for a very long time. Now that has changed very dramatically. \nUniversities in these other countries are first-class universities and \npeople need to focus on that. Universities such as Tsinghua, in China, \nare very high quality. If they turn out a Ph.D. in engineering or \nscience or the natural sciences in these schools, those individuals are \nworld-class scientists in their fields.\n  There is a 1995 quote by Alan Greenspan that sums up the importance \nof investment in research and development and education:\n\n       Had the innovations of recent decades, especially in \n     information technologies, not come to fruition, productivity \n     growth would have continued to languish at the rate of the \n     preceding 20 years.\n\n  Much of the prosperity we have enjoyed and have come to expect has \nbeen the result of the focus we have had on science and engineering in \nour history.\n  The final chart I have here is one from ``The Economist.'' It is \nbased on the 2006 work that was done by three individuals at the \nFederal Reserve. It deals with this broad category of so-called \nintangible assets, assets such as research and development, information \ntechnology, even finance.\n  Basically what it says is, as a percentage of gross domestic product, \nthere is a very large amount of our gross domestic product that is tied \nto these so-called intangible assets. They now account for nearly 11 \npercent of our gross domestic product--that is $3.1 trillion in 2003. \nIn other words, growth that is attributed to such areas is absolutely \ncrucial to our overall economy--again, another reason why we need to be \nconcerned about this issue.\n  With this background, let me briefly talk about what is in the bill \nbefore I defer to my colleague here, Senator Alexander. In the Energy \nand Natural Resources Committee, the portion of the bill that was \ndeveloped out of that committee, we do several things. First, we create \na director for math and science education in the Department of Energy \nwhose job it is to coordinate math and science education, \ndepartmentwide. The director would report to the Under Secretary for \nScience in the Department of Energy.\n  Next, we would significantly increase funding for the Department of \nEnergy's Office of Science to match the multiyear funding profile of \nthe President's advanced competitiveness initiative which he presented \nto us here this year.\n  Third, the bill proposes to create an Advanced Research Projects \nAgency for Energy, to translate basic research that is carried out in \nthe Office of Science into solutions for critical problems facing the \napplied energy programs in the Department.\n  Examples of such problems would include hydrogen fuel storage using \nnew materials or applying nanoscience to a new generation of solid-\nstate lights.\n  The bill will also address broader themes related to math and science \neducation. According to the National Academy of Sciences, the technical \nbuilding blocks of our Nation's economic strength have been eroding for \na time. We need to produce students who are prepared to meet the \nchallenges of the 21st century. That means more attention to math and \nscience education.\n  America COMPETES contains a number of important provisions to improve \nK-12 math and science education, strengthen science and math skills of \nour teaching workforce. I know Senator Reid talked eloquently about \nthat need and, of course, the commitment our former colleague, Paul \nSimon, had to progress in that area.\n  First, it provides incentives for universities to systematically \nchange the way they prepare teachers to teach math and science. The \nlegislation provides grants to universities to integrate the teacher \npreparation programs with rich content subject matter in math and \nscience, develop bachelor's degree programs in math and science with \nconcurrent teacher certification, as well as master's degree programs \nin math and science for people who are currently teaching in our \nschools.\n  Second, to make these programs attractive to students who are \ninclined to study these subjects--math, science, and engineering--the \nlegislation significantly expands the National Science Foundation \nscholarships for students to become math and science teachers.\n  The legislation significantly expands opportunities for teachers to \nstrengthen their math and science skills. The bill increases training \nfor teachers to become qualified to teach advanced placement courses \nand international baccalaureate courses in math and science. The bill \nprovides significant training opportunities for teachers at both the \nNational Science Foundation, as well as our National Laboratories, and \nthere I think some of the summer programs Senator Reid was talking \nabout are intended to take place at our universities, at our \nlaboratories. Clearly, he is right in saying we need to provide the \nfinancial wherewithal so that teachers can take advantage of these \nprograms and can upgrade their knowledge and then give that knowledge \nto their students the next school year.\n  Further, the legislation provides grants to States to promote better \nalignment of elementary and secondary education with the knowledge and \nskills needed for success in postsecondary education and in the 21st \ncentury workforce.\n  The bill significantly increases funding for the National Science \nFoundation, essentially doubling that budget in 5 years, while ensuring \nthat the math and science education programs that are in the National \nScience Foundation increase at the same rate as the overall budget \nincreases.\n  The bill helps manufacturers by increasing funding for the National \nInstitute of Standards and Technology, or NIST, by 33 percent over 4 \nyears.\n  As I have said many times, this America COMPETES bill is only an \nauthorization bill. The hard part, obviously, is going to be providing \nthe funds to carry out the programs in this bill to meet these \nauthorization targets we have set.\n  In this regard, we were successful just a month or so ago, with \nSenator Alexander's good help, in adopting an amendment in the Senate \nwhich was an amendment to the budget resolution. It was adopted 71 to 1 \nto provide $1 billion in additional leeway or additional opportunity to \nmeet the President's request in the areas of funding for the Department \nof Energy's Office of Science, the National Science Foundation, and \nNIST. Because of that amendment to the budget resolution, virtually all \nof the authorization we are calling for in this legislation will be \npermitted to be appropriated this year, and that is very good news.\n  This bill is a good bill. It is bipartisan. Like most bipartisan \nbills, it is the product of much negotiation. Many competing views, \nmany competing interests have had a chance to be heard.\n  I am proud of the way this bill has come together. Our staffs deserve \ngreat credit for the hard work they have put into this legislation.\n  I particularly commend Senator Alexander. He is the person who got \nthis initiative started and came to me initially and said: Let's do \nthis letter to the National Academies and see if they will do a study \nand tell us what are the most important things we can do in this \ncountry to keep this country competitive in world markets. That is what\n\n[[Page S4795]]\n\nthen led to the Augustine Commission report and, of course, that \ncombined with the other reports that came forward--and there were \nseveral other very useful reports--that have gotten us to this point. \nSenator Alexander deserves particular credit for the success we have \nhad so far.\n  I hope all colleagues will look seriously at this legislation and \nwill support the effort to move ahead with it. This is authorizing \nlegislation. In doing the appropriations bills that will come to the \nfloor later this year, we still will have an opportunity to debate the \nspecific funding levels for some of these programs. This sets out a \nframework for progress which can be very beneficial to this country and \na framework which is long overdue.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the legislation.\n  I yield the floor. I know my colleague from Tennessee wishes to speak \nat this time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Mexico. No \none in the Senate on either side of the aisle has been more consistent \nor more effective in advancing our Nation's position in science and \ntechnology. He is also a delight to work with. It is rare to have a \nchance to work across the aisle in the way we have the last couple of \nyears, not only on this legislation, but Senator Bingaman, for example, \nnoticed that we were losing our edge in world-class computing. He saw \nthat because of a visit to Japan. He came to me, and we worked together \nto try to restore that edge. He constantly is doing that in a quiet and \neffective way. It is a pleasure to work with him.\n  I also thank the majority leader, Senator Reid, and the Republican \nleader, Senator McConnell. Senator Bingaman and I went to see the \nmajority leader 2 years ago when he was the minority leader. We asked \nhim to do exactly what he has done. He and Senator Frist did. They \ncreated an environment in which this bill had a chance to succeed. Then \nSenator McConnell stepped right up, following Senator Frist's \ntremendous help and leadership in this effort, and it is fairly \nremarkable that we worked so evenly together in the last Republican \nSenate on this bill that the legislation was introduced in the \nDemocratic Senate in the same way because we worked together on it and, \nhopefully, that has produced a better result.\n  I begin my remarks with a story. Last August, a group of Senators \nwent to China. We were led by two of our most distinguished Members, \nSenator Stevens and Senator Inouye, the two leaders of the Commerce \nCommittee and two of the major contributors to this legislation. Those \ntwo Senators were very well received in China. Senator Inouye, of \ncourse, is a Congressional Medal of Honor winner from World War II, and \nSenator Stevens was a Flying Tiger. He flew the first cargo plane into \nBeijing toward the end of World War II. So he was very well received in \nChina.\n  As a result, we had a chance to meet with the senior leaders of China \nin a way most Americans had not to that time. We spent an hour with \nPresident Hu. We spent another hour with the No. 2 leader in China, Mr. \nWu, who is chairman of the National People's Congress.\n  We talked about the issues one would expect an American delegation of \na dozen Senators would talk about with the leaders of China. We talked \nabout their military posture. We talked about North Korea. We talked \nabout Iraq. We talked about Iran. But, Mr. President--I can still see \nthis--in both of the meetings we had, one with Mr. Hu, the second with \nMr. Wu, there was one subject about which those two leaders of China \nwere most animated, and that was the subject we are discussing today: \nhow to develop China's brain power advantage so they can create more \ngood, new jobs in China. That was the subject they really wanted to \ntalk about.\n  President Hu had gone to the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the \nChinese Academy of Engineering just a month earlier in July. He \nassembled them in the Great Hall of the people. He outlined a new 15-\nyear plan to make China a technology leader in the world.\n  In his speech, President Hu said China must ``promote a huge leap \nforward in science and technology. We shall put strengthening \nindependent innovation capability at the core of economic structure \nadjustment.''\n  Anyone who follows China knows that when their leaders talk about \nleaps forward, it is a pretty big deal. President Hu's new plan appears \nmore likely to succeed and includes reforming China's universities and \nmassively investing in new research.\n  We regularly see stories of how Chinese-born academicians, some of \nour most distinguished faculty members at our major universities, are \nnow accepting invitations to go back to China, their homeland, and \ncreate great universities there. There are a lot of people here--one-\nhalf of the Nobel Prize winners in physics who are American are \nimmigrants or the sons and daughters of immigrants.\n  So China is serious about this plan. Mr. Hu said:\n\n       We all bear the time-honored mission to provide strong \n     scientific support for the construction of a well-off society \n     by improving our independent innovation capability and \n     building an innovative country. I hope that our scientists \n     and technicians will strive hard to make our brilliant \n     achievements and constantly contribute to our country and our \n     people.\n\n  Those are the leaders of China. They know what to do.\n  The United States has a remarkable position. As Senator Bingaman \nsaid, Senator Reid said, and Senator McConnell said, we don't want to \ntake it for granted because we can't. But let's stop and think about \nwhere we are. This huge brain power advantage we have in the United \nStates of America has given us a situation in which we produce about 30 \npercent of the gross national product in the world in for about 5 \npercent of the people. About 30 percent of all the dollars, volume in \nthe world this year is being produced in this country, a country that \nonly includes 5 percent of the people. How does that happen? The United \nStates has a number of advantages: its location, its resources, the \ngreat diversity we have here, the fact we have turned all that \ndiversity into one country. But when we look at all of our advantages--\nand I should quickly put the great entrepreneurial engine we have here, \nthe fact that if you want to come to a big country and start from \nscratch and create a company--and I have had the privilege to help do \nthat in the private sector--this is the place to do it. But when you \nlook at our major advantage, it is our brainpower.\n  No other country has had the broad system of education we have had. \nNo other country has the large number of great research universities \nthe United States of America has. No other country has the great \nNational Laboratories we have. As a result, over the last century, \nespecially since World War II, no other country has come close to \nturning its brainpower advantage into jobs, into dollars, into a high \nstandard of living for a large number of people, and the rest of the \nworld sees that. They see it on television. They see it on the \nInternet. They see it because more than half a million students from \naround the world, many of the brightest men and women in the world, \ncome here to our universities, and they see what we have been able to \ndo, and they say: Why can't we do this at home in China? Why can't we \ndo this at home in India? Why can't we do this in Ireland? And they are \ndoing it. We are glad they are doing it. We want them to have a high \nstandard of living, too. The more money they make, the more goods they \ncan buy from the United States of America. So we encourage that \nactivity.\n  It also spreads our democracy, our ideals. We go to Thailand or some \nother country, and we find the Minister of Agriculture is a graduate of \nthe University of Tennessee. He has learned here. He goes there and \nteaches about agriculture, and he promotes our ideas. Our higher \neducation system has probably been the most effective foreign aid we \nhave ever invested in, just those half million students who go there.\n  However, we are at risk of losing our brainpower advantage. If we \nlose our brainpower advantage, we lose our advantage and our standard \nof living. In other words, in plain English, we don't have as much \nmoney in our pockets, we don't have as many good jobs, and our families \ndon't have the kind of prosperity many have come to take for granted. \nThat is what this piece of legislation is about.\n\n[[Page S4796]]\n\n  We talk a lot about outsourcing jobs, about growing new jobs. Well, \nthis is the way to keep good new jobs in the United States and to grow \nthem. When a graduate of a university, such as the student at the \nUniversity of Maryland--I think he dropped out, actually--a foreign \nstudent--creates Google, that creates thousands and thousands of new \njobs in the United States, as Thomas Edison did years ago, as Bill \nGates did more recently, and as thousands of entrepreneurs do every \nday. It takes the brainpower advantage to create the job and it takes \nthe brainpower advantage to work at the facility or the plant that has \nthe jobs.\n  That is why, toward the end of a long Budget Committee hearing 2 \nyears ago, I was getting a little depressed listening to what I heard \nabout the numbers. According to the budget 2 years ago, and the budget \nlast year, and the budget this year, we are on an unsustainable course \nin terms of being able to pay for Medicare and Medicaid. So the \nquestion came to me: Well, if we are going to squeeze out everything \nelse in order to pay for Medicare and Medicaid and other programs, the \nwar in Iraq, then how are we going to invest in this great engine of \nbrainpower that creates the money that pays all the bills? I struggled \nwith this as the Governor of Tennessee. I was trying to raise our \nstandard of living in Tennessee. We were the third poorest State 25 \nyears ago when I became Governor, based on family incomes. We already \nhad low taxes. We had a right-to-work law. We needed to change some \nrules about the usury limit in banking. We needed to add a new four-\nlane highway system. All those were progrowth. But the most progrowth \naction I discovered we could take was to improve our colleges and our \nuniversities and our research facilities. That is progrowth.\n  As a result of better schools, better colleges, and better \nuniversities, combined with our other advantages, we moved ahead in our \nState. Better schools meant better jobs. Better colleges and \nuniversities mean better jobs. More research means better jobs. So we \nare talking today about better jobs--progrowth.\n  We better realize as well that we have some pretty big bills to pay. \nLast year, we spent $237 billion on debt, $378 billion on Medicare, \n$545 billion on Social Security, $70 billion or more on hurricanes, and \nwe are spending about $4 billion a week on Iraq. What this legislation \ndoes is authorizes $4 billion a year over the next 4 years. As Senator \nBingaman said, we made room for it in the budget this year to create \nand encourage and continue to push ahead this brainpower engine that \ncreates the money to pay for all these necessary and urgent needs we \nhave, these priorities we have. This is a progrowth piece of \nlegislation.\n  I would say this may be the most important piece of legislation the \nCongress considers in this 2-year session. If it is not the most \nimportant piece of legislation, there is certainly no more important \nsubject to most American families than: How do I keep money in my \npocket to pay my bills? How do we keep our jobs from going to India and \nChina? How do we keep our economic advantage? How do we come close to \ncontinuing to be the country that produces 30 percent of all the money \nin the world for only 5 percent of the people? That is why, at the end \nof that Budget Committee hearing I mentioned a little earlier, I \nliterally walked down the street to the National Academy of Sciences \nand asked them, on behalf of Senator Bingaman and myself, with the \napproval of Senator Domenici, the chairman of our committee, and with \nthe endorsement of Representatives Boehlert and Gordon in the House of \nRepresentatives--I said: Most ideas in Washington fail for lack of the \nidea. You are here at the end of a long day in the National Academies. \nYou are supposed to be our advisers. So let me ask you a question: Why \ndon't you tell us the 10 most important things we can do, in priority \norder, to keep our brainpower advantage? I said to them: I am merely \none Senator, but I will bet if you do that, we will do it. We will take \nyour advice.\n  The National Academy of Sciences and of Engineering and the Institute \nof Medicine formed an immediate group. They asked Norm Augustine, the \nformer chief executive officer of Lockheed Martin and a member of the \nNational Academy of Engineering, to chair the group. He turned to 21 \ndistinguished Americans who know a lot about the world and our country, \nCraig Barrett, chairman of the board of Intel; Steven Chu, cowinner of \nthe Nobel prize in physics and Director of Lawrence Berkeley National \nLaboratory; Robert Gates, who was then head of Texas A and now is the \nSecretary of Defense, and a number of others; the former head of MIT, \nPeter O'Donnell, a Texas businessman who has worked on AP courses, and \nthey did this report: ``Rising Above The Gathering Storm.'' They didn't \nmake 10 recommendations, they made 20, and they made them in priority \norder. Their priorities began with K-12 education. They went next to \nengineering and research. They went next to higher education. They went \nnext to incentives for innovation.\n  At that point, we formed a bipartisan group of Senators and began to \nhave what we called ``homework sessions'' with the various agencies of \nthe Federal Government that had jurisdiction over these programs and \nthe areas where the programs would fit. We also recognized that Senator \nLieberman, Senator Ensign, and others had been working hard with the \nCouncil on Competitiveness, and they had similar recommendations. We \nalso acknowledged that Senators Hutchison, Bond, and Mikulski had for \nmany years been advocating various aspects of these programs, so we \ntried to integrate all of this into a whole. That produced a long piece \nof legislation that had to make its way through five different \ncommittees, but it attracted 70 sponsors last year--35 Democrats, 35 \nRepublicans. The Republican leader, Senator Frist, and the Democratic \nleader, Senator Reid, were the principal sponsors of the bill.\n  Senator Bingaman has done a good job of outlining most of the \nprovisions of the bill, so I will, in a few minutes, put those into the \nrecord, but there is no other piece of legislation during the past 2 \nyears that was so broadly recommended by disinterested groups outside \nof the Senate and the House, that has been worked on by so many \nSenators here, and that has moved forward in the way this has. Making \nthis even more remarkable is not only was it introduced by the \nDemocratic and Republican leaders, it has been brought directly to the \nfloor for debate. So what we hope is our colleagues will carefully read \nthe bill, bring their amendments to the floor, and maybe we can operate \nin an old-fashioned way here. Maybe we can consider the amendments, or \nthe improvements, debate them, vote on them, go to the next amendment, \nand then after we have finished with that, have a vote on whether to \npass the bill, which I believe we will. I think we have a good chance \nof doing that.\n  Mr. President, I wish to now insert into the Record a few items that \nare important for our colleagues and those who are following this \ndebate, so I ask unanimous consent that following my remarks a ``Dear \nColleague'' letter of April 10, written by Senator Reid and Senator \nMcConnell to all of our colleagues, signed by the chairmen and \nDemocratic and Republican leaders of the three major committees which \ncontributed to this, and which produced 50 cosponsors--we hope there \nwill be more by next week--be printed in the Record.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a two-page \nsummary of the America COMPETES Act be printed in the Record.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a list of \nthe cosponsors of the America COMPETES Act, the 50 cosponsors, as it \nstands today, be printed in the Record.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 3.)\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Finally, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a \nsection-by-section analysis of the America COMPETES Act be printed in \nthe Record.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n[[Page S4797]]\n\n  (See exhibit 4.)\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, we will have plenty of time to debate \nthis next week, so I will reserve most of my comments until then, but \nlet me reiterate some of the major provisions that are here. As Senator \nBingaman said, this is only an authorization bill. It is permission to \nestablish programs, but it is backed up by an amendment to the Budget \nAct which creates room in the appropriations bill to pay for these \nprograms.\n  Here is what we intend to do: Double funding for the National Science \nFoundation; set the Department of Energy's Office of Science on track \nto double its funding; strengthen the skills of thousands of math and \nscience teachers by establishing training and education programs at \nsummer institutes hosted by the national laboratories; and by \nincreasing support for teacher institutes for programs at the National \nScience Foundation.\n  These are the kinds of programs that Senator Reid, the majority \nleader, was talking about.\n  Expand the teacher scholarship programs at NSF; help establish \nacademies for math and science in the various States.\n  North Carolina has had one for a long time, and 20 years ago, when I \nwas Governor, I went to see if Tennessee could create one. We decided \nwe didn't have the money to do it, so we created a summer Governor's \nschool, which turned out to be a good idea, where outstanding students \nfrom math and science could go to the University of Tennessee for 4 \nweeks in the summer. The faculty loves it, the students love it, and \nthey participate in the Oak Ridge Laboratory. They go back fired up \ninto their classrooms, and the teachers are fired up as well. Our \nGovernor Bredesen wants to create a summer school for math and science, \nand he has started on a modest basis, but this will help him expand \nthat.\n  We will expand advanced placement in international baccalaureate \nprograms by increasing the number of teachers who are trained to teach \nmath, science, and foreign languages. This would allow thousands of new \nstudents to take these courses. The AP courses, as we call them, are a \ngood track to college, and college is a good track to success. Those \nstudents are the ones who will help create the jobs to keep our high \nstandard of living. But we have a lot of students, many of them lower \nincome, who don't take these courses and who easily could. So we will \nhelp pay for their tests, and we will train more teachers so they can \nbe taught, and we will see that three or four times more students will \nbe able to do this.\n  These programs weren't picked out of thin air. This group of \ndistinguished Nobel laureates, university presidents, and business \nleaders spent their summer 2 years ago reviewing many programs. For \nexample, the AP program comes from a Texas program which has been \nsuccessful for 10 years. They picked the 20 best ideas in priority \norder from among hundreds of ideas. This is not merely a group of \nSenators and Congressmen picking our best friend's favorite program. We \nall have one of those. This is the National Academies of Sciences and \nEngineering and the Institute of Medicine reviewing hundreds of \nprograms with a distinguished panel in answering our question exactly \nwhat do we need to do to keep our brainpower advantage, and they say \nhere are the first 20 things you ought to do.\n  Not in this legislation are other provisions that were part of this \nreport and that were acted on in the last Congress. One was the \ntemporary extension of the research and development tax credit. It \nshould be made permanent. Another are several provisions for attracting \nand keeping in this country talented professionals from overseas. These \n500,000 foreign students who are here include some of the brightest \nstudents from China, some of the brightest students from India, some of \nthe brightest from around the world. They are going to create jobs \nsomewhere. We would like for them to stay and create jobs here, yet our \narchaic immigration laws prevent that. They require these students to \nswear they are going home before they come. They make it hard for them \nto stay once they get here.\n  So the Senate, last year, in debating the immigration bill, adopted \nthree of the provisions from this report. One, for example, pins a \ngreen card on any foreign student who gets a graduate degree in math, \nscience, engineering and technology so that person can stay here and \ncreate jobs for us here.\n  I am hopeful when we get to the immigration legislation within a few \nweeks that we will do at least that much to change our archaic \nimmigration laws and allow those students to stay here and create jobs \nfor us. We talk a lot about outsourcing jobs. This would be insourcing \nbrain power, and we would be smart to do it.\n  I particularly thank our staffs, and we will do this specifically by \nname next week. This is a complex bill with many different parts, as \nthe section-by-section analysis shows. They have worked evenly to try \nto make this a well-crafted bill. We have more work to do.\n  I conclude by again thanking the Democratic and Republican leaders, \nSenator Bingaman, Senator Domenici, especially, who was chairman of our \ncommittee last year, Stevens and Inouye, Enzi and Kennedy, Ensign and \nLieberman, Bond, Hutchison, Chambliss, Murkowski, and Mikulski--all of \nthese Senators made major contributions. I am sure they will be on the \nSenate floor next week to address this legislation and to support it.\n  We are talking about keeping our brain power advantage so we keep our \njobs. We are talking about a country that has grown accustomed to 30 \npercent of all of the money in the world being produced each year with \njust 5 percent of the people, and we are saying, unless we take at \nleast these steps, that won't continue.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 10, 2007.\n       Dear Colleague: We are writing to invite you to cosponsor \n     the America COMPETES Act; a bipartisan bill to help America \n     maintain its edge in science, technology, engineering, and \n     mathematics in an increasingly competitive global economy. An \n     earlier version of this bill was introduced in the final days \n     of the 109th Congress as S. 3936.\n       The America COMPETES Act is based upon recommendations from \n     both the national Academies' ``Rising Above the Gathering \n     Storm'' report and the Council on Competitiveness' ``Innovate \n     America'' report. It contains revised versions of the \n     legislation approved by both the Senate Energy and Commerce \n     Committees [from the 109th Congress] in response to those \n     recommendations: S. 2197, the PACE-Energy bill, and S. 2802 \n     the American Innovation and Competitiveness bill, which were \n     reported without opposition to the Senate floor. The bill \n     also includes provisions developed by the bipartisan \n     leadership of the HELP Committee to improve science, \n     technology, engineering, mathematics, and critical foreign \n     language skills.\n       The competitiveness package would significantly increase \n     the federal investment in basic research, foster and \n     innovative infrastructure, improve the teaching of math, \n     science, engineering and technology to our children, and \n     encourage the brightest minds to pursue careers in these \n     fields. Among other provisions, the bill would: Double the \n     investment in basic research at the national Science \n     Foundation (NSF), the National Institutes of Standards and \n     Technology (NIST), and the Department of Energy's Office of \n     Science (DOE-SC) over five to ten years; Improve teacher \n     training in math and science, through summer institutes \n     hosted by the NSF and the DOE-SC and grants to increase \n     university degree programs that combine math and science \n     study with concurrent teacher certification; and Increase \n     support for Advanced Placement programs to expand access for \n     low income students to take and succeed in college \n     preparatory courses.\n       This bill alone will not secure American leadership in the \n     decades to come. But it is a critical first step toward \n     protecting our competitive position in the world. We hope you \n     will join us in this effort and cosponsor this bipartisan \n     legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n         Harry Reid, Majority Leader; Jeff Bingaman, Chairman, \n           Committee on Energy and Natural Resources; Daniel K. \n           Inouy, Chairman, Committee on Commerce, Science, and \n           Transportation; Edward M. Kennedy, Chairman, Committee \n           on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions; Joseph I. \n           Lieberman, U.S. Senator; Barbara A. Mikulski, U.S. \n           Senator; Bill Nelson, U.S. Senator; Mitch McConnell, \n           Republican Leader; Pete V. Domenici, Ranking Member, \n           Committee on Energy and Natural Resources; Ted Stevens, \n           Vice-Chairman, Committee on Commerce, Science, and \n           Transportation; Michael B. Enzi, Ranking Member, \n           Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions; \n           John Ensign, U.S. Senator; Lamar Alexander, U.S. \n           Senator; Kay Bailey Hutchison, U.S. Senator.\n\n[[Page S4798]]\n\n           \n                                  ____\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n                Summary of the ``America Competes Act''\n\n       The ``America COMPETES Act'' is a bipartisan legislative \n     response to recommendations contained in the National \n     Academies' ``Rising Above the Gathering Storm'' report and \n     the Council on Competitiveness' ``Innovate America'' report. \n     The bill is similar to the ``National Competitiveness \n     Investment Act'' that Senators Frist, Reid, Stevens, Inouye, \n     Domenici, Bingaman, Enzi, Kennedy, Ensign, Lieberman, \n     Alexander, Mikulski, Hutchison, and others introduced in \n     September 2006. Several sections of the bill are derived from \n     proposals contained in the ``American Innovation and \n     Competitiveness Act of 2006'' (S. 2802), approved without \n     opposition by the Senate Commerce Committee, and the \n     ``Protecting America's Competitive Edge Through Energy Act of \n     2006'' (S. 2197) approved without opposition by the Senate \n     Energy Committee last year. Accordingly, the America COMPETES \n     Act focuses on three primary areas of importance to \n     maintaining and improving United States' innovation in the \n     21st century: (1) Increasing research investment, (2) \n     strengthening educational opportunities in science, \n     technology, engineering, and mathematics from elementary \n     through graduate school, and (3) developing an innovation \n     infrastructure. More specifically, the America COMPETES Act \n     would:\n\n\n                    Increase Research Investment by:\n\n       Doubling funding for the National Science Foundation (NSF) \n     from approximately $5.6 billion in Fiscal Year 2006 to $11.2 \n     billion in Fiscal Year 2011.\n       Setting the Department of Energy's Office of Science on \n     track to double in funding over 10 years, increasing from \n     $3.6 billion in Fiscal Year 2006 to over $5.2 billion in \n     Fiscal Year 2011.\n       Establishing the Innovation Acceleration Research Program \n     to direct federal agencies funding research in science and \n     technology to set as a goal dedicating approximately 8 \n     percent of their Research and Development (R) budgets \n     toward high-risk frontier research.\n       Authorizing the National Institute of Standards and \n     Technology (NIST) from approximately $703 million in Fiscal \n     Year 2008 to approximately $937 million in Fiscal Year 2011 \n     and requiring NIST to set aside no less than 8 percent of its \n     annual funding for high-risk, high-reward innovation \n     acceleration research.\n       Directing NASA to increase funding for basic research and \n     fully participate in interagency activities to foster \n     competitiveness and innovation, using the full extent of \n     existing budget authority.\n       Coordinating ocean and atmospheric research and education \n     at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and \n     other agencies to promote U.S. leadership in these important \n     fields.\n\n\n     Strengthen Educational Opportunities in Science, Technology, \n      Engineering, Mathematics, and Critical Foreign Languages by:\n\n       Authorizing competitive grants to States to promote better \n     alignment of elementary and secondary education with the \n     knowledge and skills needed for success in postsecondary \n     education, the 21st century workforce, and the Armed Forces, \n     and grants to support the establishment or improvement of \n     statewide P-16 education longitudinal data systems.\n       Strengthening the skills of thousands of math and science \n     teachers by establishing training and education programs at \n     summer institutes hosted at the National Laboratories and by \n     increasing support for the Teacher Institutes for the 21st \n     Century program at NSF.\n       Expanding the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program at \n     NSF to recruit and train individuals to become math and \n     science teachers in high-need local educational agencies.\n       Assisting States in establishing or expanding statewide \n     specialty schools in math and science that students from \n     across the state would be eligible to attend and providing \n     expert assistance in teaching from National Laboratories' \n     staff at those schools.\n       Facilitating the expansion of Advanced Placement (AP) and \n     International Baccalaureate (IB) programs by increasing the \n     number of teachers prepared to teach AP/IB and pre-AP/IB \n     math, science, and foreign language courses in high need \n     schools, thereby increasing the number of courses available \n     and students who take and pass AP and IB exams.\n       Developing and implementing programs for bachelor's degrees \n     in math, science, engineering, and critical foreign languages \n     with concurrent teaching credentials and part-time master's \n     in education programs for math, science, and critical foreign \n     language teachers to enhance both content knowledge and \n     teaching skills.\n       Creating partnerships between National Laboratories and \n     local high-need high schools to establish centers of \n     excellence in math and science education.\n       Expanding existing NSF graduate research fellowship and \n     traineeship programs, requiring NSF to work with institutions \n     of higher education to facilitate the development of \n     professional science master's degree programs, and expanding \n     NSF's science, mathematics, engineering and technology talent \n     program.\n       Providing Math Now grants to improve math instruction in \n     the elementary and middle grades and provide targeted help to \n     struggling students so that all students can master grade-\n     level mathematics standards.\n       Expanding programs to increase the number of students from \n     elementary school through postsecondary education who study \n     critical foreign languages and become proficient.\n\n\n                Develop an Innovation Infrastructure by:\n\n       Establishing a President's Council on Innovation and \n     Competitiveness to develop a comprehensive agenda to promote \n     innovation and competitiveness in the public and private \n     sectors.\n       Requiring the National Academy of Sciences to conduct a \n     study to identify forms of risk that create barriers to \n     innovation.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                               Exhibit 3\n\n

He claimed again that \nhis new escalation strategy is working, that the signs of success are \neverywhere, and that victory is imminent. He also, once again, attacked \nthose of us with the courage to ask the tough questions and tell the \ntruth about Iraq.\n  In an effort to shift attention from this administration's failed \npolicies--and I say that in the plural--the President and his allies \nhave repeatedly questioned whether I and my fellow Democrats support \nour troops. No one wants us to succeed in Iraq more than Democrats. We \nhave proven that time and time again since this war started more than 4 \nyears ago. We take a backseat to no one in supporting our troops, and \nwe will never abandon our troops in a time of war.\n  Given the White House spin machine that has been working overtime in \nan effort to defend its failed policies, it is important for me to \nrepeat what I said yesterday afternoon in this Chamber: The longer we \ncontinue down the President's path, the further we will be from \nresponsibly ending this war. I said it yesterday, I say it again: The \nlonger we continue down the President's path, the further we will be \nfrom responsibly ending this war. But there is still a chance to change \ncourse, and we must change course.\n  Partisans who launched attacks on my comments are the same ones who \ncontinue to support the failed strategy that hurts our troops. Is this \nadministration supporting the troops when it sends our brave men and \nwomen into battle without the necessary body armor; with vehicles that \nare not properly armored? I ask, is the administration supporting the \ntroops when it fails to provide them the health care they have earned \nwhen they come home?\n  Our responsibilities end with these troops--never. They don't end \nwhen they leave Iraq. They don't end when they get back home. We have \nto continue to help them. That is what we have done.\n  Is the administration supporting the troops by threatening to delay \ntheir funding unless Congress continues to rubberstamp its failed \npolicy?\n  I believe supporting our troops means giving them the funding they \nneed and a strategy they deserve. It means stopping the partisan \nattacks. And it means spending time working together on a bipartisan \nbasis to develop an effective strategy to successfully end this war.\n  I wish some of my detractors felt the same. An effective strategy is \nexactly what we are offering the President and our troops--no more, no \nless. Let's all understand, changing course in Iraq will increase \nAmerica's security by bringing this war to a responsible end and \npermitting our troops to more effectively fight terror all over the \nworld. This is precisely the strategy President Bush is vowing to veto.\n  We heard the same old story from the President today because his \nstrategy calls for more of the same. It is a failed strategy for our \ntroops in Iraq. It is a failed strategy for our security at home. It is \ndangerous that the President refuses to recognize the reality on the \nground in Iraq.\n  For those who claim we are on the right path in Iraq, I ask them to \nlook at this week's newspapers. I am only going to mention now a few \nthings we find in this week's news.\n  The White House announced additional National Guard troops would be \nsent to Iraq; many, if not most, without the necessary training and \nequipment. The White House extended tours in Iraq for all active Army \ntroops from 12 to 15 months. A week after the Iraqi Parliament was \nbombed in the Green Zone, which is the most secure part of Baghdad, \nalmost 200 Iraqis lost their lives in that city on Wednesday. The \nbombings continue today. They will continue tomorrow. We are losing \nabout four American troops every day this month.\n  I went to the White House this Wednesday with Speaker Pelosi to meet \nwith the President and talk about a bipartisan way to craft an \neffective strategy in Iraq. We did so because we believe, as do the \nAmerican people, that the lives of too many of our soldiers and too \nmany Iraqis are on the line. The President refused to work with us.\n  How has the President responded? He has chosen to repeat his \ninflexible veto threats and continued to attack those who questioned \nhis failed policies. Meanwhile, our troops and our national security \nare suffering.\n  It is painfully clear to me, the American people, bipartisan \nmajorities in both the House and the Senate, military experts all over \nthis country, and the Iraq Study Group, that the only way to succeed is \nto give our troops the strategy their sacrifices deserve. These groups \nall know there is no military solution in Iraq.\n  General Petraeus, the commander on the ground, has said so himself: \n20 percent can be won militarily; 80 percent has to be won through our \ndiplomatic efforts, politics, and economics.\n  I repeat, the only way to succeed lies through a comprehensive \npolitical, diplomatic, and economic strategy--so says the commander on \nthe ground there, General Petraeus. Unfortunately, the only one to whom \nthis is not obvious is our President.\n  The longer we continue down the President's path, the further we will \nbe from success. But there is still a chance to change course, and we \nmust change course. That is what we are offering the President in the \nsupplemental we passed in both bodies with bipartisan support. We are \noffering a reasonable and attainable timeline to reduce combat missions \nand refocus our efforts on the real threats to our security. We are \noffering action, not just words.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I wanted to say to my friend \nand\n\n[[Page S4804]]\n\nmy colleague and our leader that the President of the United States, \nwhen he was Governor of Texas, had a reputation as someone who reached \nout as a uniter, bringing together the two parties in a bipartisan way. \nSince the President has been elected President and has served in that \ncapacity, he has chosen to change, for what reason I do not know \nbecause the country yearns for bipartisanship. That was clearly one of \nthe messages that came out of last year's election, the 2006 election, \nthat the people of this country are tired of the partisan bickering, \nand they want us to come together. Yet, as the majority leader was just \nrecounting, there has been occasion after occasion where it seems, \nunnecessarily, that the White House has gone out of its way to attack \nsomeone simply because they were a member of the other party.\n\n  I want to give the Senate an example. Because I had been twice \nbefore, over a 6-year period, to visit the President of Syria, \nimmediately upon the Iraq study commission report that recommended that \nwe open up to Syria, this Senator from Florida decided that I was going \nto go back, hoping that there might be some encounter in that \nconversation with the President of Syria that might crack the door a \nlittle bit. I did that in the week before Christmas.\n  The White House chose to attack me for having made that trip--\nhowever, very conveniently not attacking any Republican Senator who \nhappened to follow, as did two Democratic Senators and one Republican \nSenator in a week or two after I made that trip.\n  So, too, it is noteworthy that the White House chose to attack \nSpeaker  Nancy Pelosi in her visit with President Assad while being \nmute about the congressional delegation that had just visited President \nAssad 4 days earlier, which included my good personal friends, the \nCongressman from Virginia, Frank Wolf, and the Congressman from \nPennsylvania, Joe Pitts. \n  When we are facing an issue of war and peace, as we are now, we have \nto come together. The person at the top has to set the standard and the \natmosphere. These kind of attacks that become personal, as they were \nagainst Speaker Pelosi, are not going to do anybody any good.\n  Mr. REID. Will my friend yield?\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I will certainly yield.\n  Mr. REID. I certainly appreciate the Senator being here on the floor \nthis afternoon. The Senator comes from the fourth most populous State, \nbut soon to be the third, a State large in area with lots and lots of \npeople moving there--thousands of people every month. It is a State \nthat this good man has represented in so many different ways.\n  We first served together in the House of Representatives. If there \nwere ever a person who served in Congress who served as a moderate, it \nwould be the Senator from Florida. He is a person who is always looking \nfor consensus, always trying to work things out, understanding that the \nart of legislation is compromise.\n  I so appreciate his brief statement today, and I apologize for \ninterrupting it. I would just go back to more than 6 years ago when \nPresident Bush was elected. I, too, was so enthused about his coming \nhere. He told me: I want to be a uniter, not a divider. I have been \nstunned by what has been going on. It started with Social Security; \nMedicare; the recent flap with the Attorney General, the Katrina \nsituation, wiretaps, stem cells, Terry Schiavo, energy--on and on, with \nall these things that we, with rare exception, with a little bit of \npatience, with a President willing to work with us, could have done on \na bipartisan basis. On the war, we have to resolve that on a bipartisan \nbasis. This legislative body is reaching out. That is what we are \ndoing.\n  I say to my friend, I appreciate very much not only his statement \ntoday but who he is, who he represents, and how he represents the \npeople of Florida. We need more Bill Nelsons in this Congress of the \nUnited States.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I am grateful to the leader. I believed it was \nnecessary. Partisanship has gotten out of control around here. I was so \nencouraged, the day that we were sworn in when the two leaders, the \nDemocratic leader and the Republican leader, convened us in a private \nmeeting in the Old Senate Chamber. There was a wonderful spirit. It \nclearly was, in large part, as a message from the American people that \nthey were tired of the partisan bickering. That was clearly one of the \nmessages from the election.\n  We started off in this mutual camaraderie of how we can make a body \nlike this function that cannot pass anything unless we have 60 votes \nout of 100 Senators in order to shut off debate. That means we have to \nhave coming together. As the Good Book says, ``Come, let us reason \ntogether.''\n  It is harder and harder to do that in a poisonous, partisan \natmosphere. But it has to be set at the top.\n  I cannot tell the White House what to do. I can sure recommend. But \nthere is something that I can do; that is, I am responsible for myself \nand my actions and how I treat others, treat others in this Chamber.\n  There is an age-old principle, and it has to be: Treat others as you \nwant to be treated. I will put that in the old English, which might be \na little bit more familiar: Do unto others as you would have them do \nunto you.\n  If we had a little bit more of that, we could sure get some things \ndone around here. Typically, what happens in these 51-to-49 votes, \nthere is not that much difference that we couldn't have 10 votes on \nthat side of the aisle or 10 votes on this side of the aisle go one way \nor another in reaching a mutual consensus. Yet over and over it has \nbeen avoided.\n  I felt compelled to say these things.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/20/senate-section/article/S4804-1", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4804-S4805]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           THE NATIONAL GUARD\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I want to share another idea, \nand this has nothing to do with these weighty matters, but it certainly \nhas to do with some weighty matters about whether the National Guard of \nthis country has the proper equipment.\n  There was a General Accounting Office report from last summer that \nshowed that the National Guard is woefully inadequate in its equipment. \nIt pointed out in that GAO study that my State of Florida had only 53 \npercent of the equipment that it ought to have. It said the State of \nNew Mexico National Guard had only 33 percent.\n  What is happening is what you would expect: As the National Guard \nunits in America are activated to go over to Iraq and Afghanistan, they \ntake their equipment with them, and so often it is worn out or it has \nto stay for others to use, and they come back and they do not have the \nequipment; or it is like the 11 helicopters of the National Guard in \nFlorida--a year from now, they are planning to take those helicopters \nfrom the Florida Guard and send them over to the Middle East. Can you \nimagine if that occurs and the Florida National Guard is faced with a \nmajor hurricane and they do not have any helicopters? Hurricanes are \nindiscriminate in the way they come in and tear up everything over a \nlarge swath of property, so that in a big one you cannot traverse the \nroads because everything is suddenly on top of them. So often you have \nto have helicopters to get supplies and personnel in to people who are \nhurting.\n  That is one example. That is a year from now if they take the \nhelicopters from the Florida National Guard because they need them over \nin the Middle East. But let me tell you the condition of it today. The \nFlorida National Guard--and I am quoting their own figures--is short \n500 humvees. They are short 600 trucks, and this is either a 5-ton \ntruck or a deuce and a half, 2\\1/2\\-ton truck--600 short. They are \nshort 500 long-haul trailers, they are short 20 wreckers, and they are \nshort 4,400 night-vision goggles. What do all of those shortages have \nto do with anything? It has to do--if the big one comes and the big one \nis a category 4 or 5 hurricane hitting a densely urbanized part of \nFlorida direct from the water, the Florida Guard is going to need every \nbit of equipment it can get to respond to that emergency.\n  Let me give you another example. The report 6 months ago was that \nFidel Castro was going to be dead within 6 months. Looks like that may \nhave changed, at least by the more recent reports. But what happens and \nwhat will be the political condition in Cuba when he does pass away? Is \nthe then caretaker government going to be in sufficient control, or is \nchaos going to\n\n[[Page S4805]]\n\nerupt and suddenly a mass outmigration of thousands and thousands of \npeople trying to get to the United States? That is also when you need \nthe National Guard.\n  Now, I have talked with the Coast Guard and the Navy, and they have a \nplan whereby they have an entire sentry line of ships that they line \nup, which I have questions on and we will talking about on another \noccasion, about that plan, because they have only modeled it if 10,000 \nwere to flee. What happens if 100,000 flee? They are not prepared for \nthat, and everybody in authority with that plan will tell you they are \nnot prepared for it. But whatever it is, if it occurs, which we hope \nand pray that it will not, the National Guard is going to be a major \ncomponent of trying to restore order and keep order. Their equipment \nhas been depleted.\n  Now, if we end up having the typical category 1, 2, and 3 hurricanes, \nwhich are severe hurricanes, the Florida National Guard tells me they \nhave adequate equipment, they certainly have the personnel, and they \nare the best trained in the country, they know how to handle \nhurricanes, and they are the best of the best. But if they do not have \nthe equipment--they tell me they do for up to a category 3--but if the \nbig one hits, then they are going to have to rely on getting equipment \nfrom other National Guards around the country. So what is the lag time \non that? And when they reach out to another Guard--for example, the \nPennsylvania National Guard with which they have a compact to share \nequipment--is the Pennsylvania Guard going to have sufficient equipment \nthat they can lend to Florida in an emergency?\n  These are serious questions which need to be answered before the \nhurricane season and before any kind of potential outmigration from the \nisland of Cuba so that we have preparations, they are adequately \nequipped to go along with the experts and expertise of the trained \npersonnel and all of the emergency responders who would respond to that \nkind of an event.\n  I am going to continue to sound the alarm until we get some response. \nI do not believe the Florida Guard has the equipment for a category 5 \nhurricane coming right up Tampa Bay or hitting directly from the east \ncoast from the Atlantic, in a high urbanized area such as the Dade-\nBroward line. So I am going to continue to ask this question, as \nuncomfortable as it will make some people, until somebody will respond.\n  I think one potential solution is that there be an agreement which \nwould be cut with the Active-Duty--correct that--with the Army Reserves \nlocated in Florida that have equipment that there will be an immediate \nlending of that equipment and/or personnel to the Florida National \nGuard in the case of a major, catastrophic hurricane hit.\n  When a hurricane hits, it is a matter of life and death. As time goes \non, as expert as our emergency responders are--and they are expert \nbecause they have been through a lot and they are quite experienced and \nwell trained--the ability over time to get those supplies in, even \nsupplies that have been prepositioned closer to where the hurricane is \ngoing to hit, the ability to get that transported in is critical in \nthose first days because there is no power.\n  You wonder, night-vision goggles--what does that have to do with it, \nthat the Florida Guard is 4,400 pairs of night-vision goggles short? It \nis because, in the aftermath of a hurricane, there is no electricity. \nEverything is dark at night. As troops are moving through all of that \ndebris, they have to be able to see. That is what those night-vision \ngoggles are for.\n  So this Senator will continue to sound the alarm. We will get the \nanswers. And the good Lord willing, despite the warnings from La Nina \nin the Pacific that this is going to be a terribly active hurricane \nseason in the Atlantic, the good Lord willing, we will not have that \nactive hit on the mainland of the United States, but we better be \nprepared.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida.

Mr. President, I rise in recognition of Cover the Uninsured \nWeek, which is being held this year from April 23 to 29. As many of us \nknow, this nonpartisan initiative was created to focus the Nation's \nattention on one of the most serious challenges facing our health care \nsystem--ensuring access to quality, affordable coverage.\n  Since the first annual Cover the Uninsured Week was observed 5 years \nago, the health care crisis has, unfortunately, worsened. At last \ncount, nearly 46 million Americans lacked coverage, including 400,000 \nin my home State of Nevada. More than 100,000 of these uninsured \nNevadans are children. The context for these numbers, which are \nstaggering in themselves, is even more troubling. For too many, premium \ncosts are escalating faster than they can manage while benefits are \ndeteriorating. Being a hard-working American is also no longer a ticket \nto health coverage, as shown by the fact that 8 out of 10 uninsured \npeople either work or are in working families. Even when they can find \ngood health insurance, many families must shortchange other basic needs \nto afford out-of-pocket expenses or forgo necessary care altogether.\n  Every year we update these statistics and findings about the \nuninsured, but the same themes still ring true. The goal should be to \nensure that all Americans can access and afford the health care they \nneed, regardless of their income, age, employment, or health status. \nSadly, we as a nation continue to fall short.\n  Cover the Uninsured Week is an opportunity to reflect on more than \njust this current state of affairs. It is also a time to call for a new \ndirection on health care in America. Whether one is a Democrat or \nRepublican, a Member of Congress or the State legislatures, we must all \nwork together to heed the voices of the American people who are \ncounting on us. So in honor of this year's Cover the Uninsured Week, \nlet us all renew our commitment to improving our health care system. I \nlook forward to a strong debate in the Senate on these vital issues, \nincluding the next step of updating the State Children's Health \nInsurance Program to better meet the needs of the Nation's children and \nfamilies.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/20/senate-section/article/S4805-3", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4805-S4807]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         VIRGINIA TECH TRAGEDY\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I have one other short comment I would \nlike to make, and then I will yield the floor or note the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The Governor of Virginia has asked our country to take a moment of \nsilence to remember the tragedy this week at Virginia Tech at noon \ntoday. It is also a good time for us to think about our \nresponsibilities in the U.S. Congress. There is hardly any way we can \nexpress our grief to these families and to that university for what \nthey have been through this week. It is of such a scale that it is hard \nto imagine. We want them to know we have been thinking about them, and \nwe would like to do whatever we can to help them and to help make sure \nnothing like this happens again.\n  So while Virginia Tech and the Commonwealth of Virginia are reviewing \ntheir responsibilities in light of the tragedy this week at Virginia \nTech, we in the Federal Government ought to be reviewing our \nresponsibilities too. Our focus should be on whether Federal laws or \nregulations unwisely restrict or limit how universities are able to \ndeal with students who have mental health problems or who otherwise \nexhibit behavior about which parents, authorities, or other third \nparties should know.\n  Generally, and many Americans do not know this, under Federal law \nuniversities cannot tell parents about\n\n[[Page S4806]]\n\ntheir child's problems or their grades without their student's consent. \nAt least one professor at Virginia Tech who was tutoring the shooter \nhas been quoted as saying that she felt that Federal laws prevented her \nfrom going to his parents or to others about her concerns. Therefore, I \nam sending a letter today to Senator Kennedy and to Senator Enzi, the \nchairman and the ranking member of the Health, Education, Labor and \nPensions Committee on which I serve. I am writing them to request that \nour committee ask the Secretary of Education, Margaret Spellings, to \nconduct a review of Federal laws, regulations, and relevant State laws \nthat limit the ability of universities to tell parents or other third \nparties about a student's problem without the student's consent.\n  I would hope that Secretary Spellings could review not only the laws \nand the rules, but also the implementation of these rules on campus. I \nam a former president of a university. I understand it may very well be \nthat faculty members, and perhaps even some administrators, are unaware \nof the rules, or at least uncertain about how to apply them.\n  My hope would be that Secretary Spellings could complete her review \nwithin 120 days, and after that our committee might hold a hearing or \nroundtable to determine whether there is action we need to take.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record at this point a \ncopy of my letters to Senator Kennedy and Senator Enzi and an article \nfrom the New York Times dated April 19 entitled, ``Laws Limit Options \nWhen a Student Is Mentally Ill,'' which describes very well the \nsituation in which many university faculty members find themselves.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     Hon. Edward M. Kennedy,\n     Chairman, Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and \n         Pensions, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Michael B.

They \n     cannot release any information in a student's medical record \n     without consent. And they cannot put students on involuntary \n     medical leave, just because they develop a serious mental \n     illness. Nor is knowing when to worry about student behavior, \n     and what action to take, always so clear.\n       ``They can't really kick someone out because they're \n     writing papers about weird topics, even if they seem \n     withdrawn and hostile,'' said Dr. Richard Kadison, chief of \n     mental health services at Harvard University. ``Most state \n     laws are pretty clear: you can only bring students to \n     hospitals if there is imminent risk to themselves or someone \n     else, so universities are in a bit of a bind that way.'' But, \n     he said, some schools do mandate limited amounts of treatment \n     in certain circumstances.\n       ``At the University of Missouri, if someone makes a suicide \n     attempt, they mandate four counseling sessions, for \n     example,'' said Dr. Kadison, an author of ``College of the \n     Overwhelmed: The Campus Mental Health Crisis and What To Do \n     About It.''\n       Universities can find themselves in a double bind. On the \n     one hand, they may be liable if they fail to prevent a \n     suicide or murder. After the death in 2000 of Elizabeth H. \n     Shin, a student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology \n     who had written several suicide notes and used the university \n     counseling service before setting herself on fire, the \n     Massachusetts Superior Court allowed her parents, who had not \n     been told of her deterioration, to sue administrators for \n     $27.7 million. The case was settled for an undisclosed \n     amount.\n       On the other hand, universities may be held liable if they \n     do take action to remove a potentially suicidal student. In \n     August, the City University of New York agreed to pay $65,000 \n     to a student who sued after being barred from her dormitory \n     room at Hunter College because she was hospitalized after a \n     suicide attempt.\n       Also last year, George Washington University reached a \n     confidential settlement in a case charging that it had \n     violated antidiscrimination laws by suspending Jordan Nott, a \n     student who had sought hospitalization for depression.\n       ``This is a very, very difficult and gray area, when you \n     take action to remove the student from the campus \n     environment, versus when you encourage the student to use the \n     resources available on campus,'' said Ada Meloy, director of \n     legal and regulatory affairs at the American Council on \n     Education. ``In an emergency, you can share certain \n     information, but it's not clear what's an emergency.''\n       Ms. Meloy estimated that situations complicated enough to \n     involve a university's lawyers arise, on average, about twice \n     a semester at large universities.\n       While shootings like the one at Virginia Tech are extremely \n     rare, suicides, threats and serious mental-health problems \n     are not. Last year, the American College Health Association's \n     National College Health Assessment, covering nearly 95,000 \n     students at 117 campuses, found that 9 percent of students \n     had seriously considered suicide in the previous year, and 1 \n     in 100 had attempted it.\n       So mental health experts emphasize that, whatever a \n     college's concerns about liability, the goal of campus \n     policies should be to maximize the likelihood that those who \n     need mental-health treatment will get it.\n       ``What we really need to do is encourage students to seek \n     mental health treatment if they need it, to remove any \n     barriers to their getting help, destigmatize it, and make it \n     safe, so they know there won't be negative consequences,'' \n     said Karen Bower, a lawyer at the Bazelon Center for Mental \n     Health Law in Washington, who represented Mr. Nott.\n       With the Virginia Tech killings, many universities are \n     planning to remind faculty members of their protocols. \n     ``We're actually going to go ahead and have the counseling \n     service here do a session for all our instructors and faculty \n     on what to look for, what the procedures are, and what the \n     counseling center can do,'' said Shannon Miller, chairwoman \n     of the English department at Temple University.\n       At Harvard, Dr. Kadison said, dormitory resident assistants \n     watch for signs of trouble, and are usually the first to \n     become aware of worrisome behavior--and to call a dean.\n       ``The dean might insist that they get an evaluation to make \n     sure they're healthy enough to live in a dorm,'' he said. \n     ``If it's not thought that they're in any immediate danger, \n     they can take or not take the recommendation.''\n       Last month, Virginia passed a law, the first in the nation, \n     prohibiting public colleges and universities from expelling \n     or punishing students solely for attempting suicide or \n     seeking mental-health treatment for suicidal thoughts.\n       ``In one sense, the new law doesn't cover new territory, \n     because discrimination against people with mental health \n     problems is already prohibited,'' said Dana L. Fleming, a \n     lawyer in Manchester, N.H., who is an expert on education \n     law. ``But in another sense, it's groundbreaking since it's \n     the first time we've seen states focus on student suicides \n     and come up with some code of conduct for schools.''\n       College counseling services nationwide are seeing more use. \n     ``We're seeing more students in our service consistently \n     every year,'' said Alejandro Martinez, director for \n     counseling and psychological services at Stanford University, \n     which sees about 10 percent of the student body each year. \n     ``Certainly more students are experiencing mental illness, \n     including depression. But there's also been a cultural \n     shift,'' Mr. Martinez said, ``in that more students are \n     willing to get help.''\n       College officials say that a growing number of students \n     arrive on campus with a history of mental-health problems and \n     a prescription for psychotropic drugs. But screening for such \n     problems would be illegal, admissions officers say.\n\n[[Page S4807]]\n\n       ``We're restricted by the disabilities act from asking,'' \n     said Rick Shaw, Stanford's admissions director. ``We do ask a \n     question, as most institutions do, about whether a student \n     has been suspended or expelled from school, and if they have \n     been, we ask them to write an explanation of it.''\n       Federal laws also restrict what universities can reveal. \n     Generally, the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, \n     FERPA, passed in 1974, makes it illegal to disclose a \n     student's records to family members without the student's \n     authorization.\n       ``Colleges can disclose a student's private records if they \n     believe there's a health and safety emergency, but that \n     health and safety exception hasn't been much tested in the \n     courts, so it's left to be figured out case by case,'' Ms. \n     Fleming said.\n       And the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act \n     prohibits the release of medical records. ``The interaction \n     of all these laws does not make things easy,'' she said.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, on Monday America was devastated by the \ndeadliest shooting rampage in our Nation's history. A gunman using two \nsemi-automatic handguns, shot and killed 32 students and teachers and \ninjured several dozen others before turning one of his guns on himself. \nWitnesses described scenes of chaos and grief, with students jumping \nfrom second-story windows to escape gunfire, while others heroically \nblocked their classroom doors to shield them from the gunman.\n  Many of us watched this tragedy unfold on the news, finding it \ndifficult to grasp the true magnitude of it. Parents and grandparents \nacross America were thinking about the horror of one's child being \ncaught in the middle of such chaos. There is little that could be worse \nfor a parent than sending a child off to college, only to lose them to \na senseless act of gun violence.\n  I express condolences to the family, friends, and community touched \nby the tragedy at Virginia Tech. I know I reflect the feelings of the \npeople of Michigan when I say that our thoughts and prayers are with \nthem in this hour of pain and grief.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, today I express my sympathy and I know \nthe sympathy of all of the Members of the Senate and the people of the \nUnited States of America on the tragic losses this week at Virginia \nTech.\n  None of us can understand what happened in Blacksburg, VA, but all of \nus recognize the profound tragedy and the loss of youth in its prime.\n  I learned this week that one of those losses was a Georgian by the \nname of Christopher James ``Jamie'' Bishop, and I, from the floor of \nthe Senate, send to Pine Mountain, GA, my sympathy on the tragic loss \nof Jamie.\n  Jamie, who was passionate about his art and an avid amateur \nphotographer, grew up in Pine Mountain, GA, and was valedictorian of \nHarris County High School. He received his bachelor's degree in German \nfrom my alma mater, the University of Georgia, and was a Fulbright \nscholar at Christian-Albrechts-University in Kiel, Germany. He returned \nto the University of Georgia to earn his master's degree in German \nlinguistics.\n  Jamie, who was known for wearing his hair in a ponytail, had been a \nGerman instructor at Virginia Tech since 2005. His wife, Stefanie \nHofer, is an assistant professor of German there. By all accounts, \nJamie was an intelligent, clever and passionate individual.\n  I am very proud as a Georgian to have known of his accomplishments, \nand I send his wife Stefanie and his parents Michael and Jeri my \nprayers and my hopes that they will accept our sympathy as they endure \nthe heartbreak of the loss of Jamie.\n  To the families of all of those professors, employees, and students \nwho lost their lives or were hurt in Blacksburg, VA, I extend my \nsympathy and my deepest prayers that we will find reconciliations out \nof tragedy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/20/senate-section/article/S4807-1", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4807]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ARMY AVIATION ASSOCIATION OF AMERICA\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS.

Mr. President, I wish to make a few remarks regarding \ncommemoration of World Health Day by the World Health Organization, \nWHO. On Saturday, April 7, 2007, WHO again commemorated its 1948 \nfounding with the annual World Health Day. This year's theme is \ninternational health security.\n  In the words of WHO, ``Threats to health know no borders.''\n  Globalization, characterized by increased mobility of populations and \nthe emergence of new, highly contagious diseases, make us increasingly \nvulnerable to pandemics and other health crises. Diseases such as \nhighly pathogenic avian influenza, or ``bird flu,'' severe acute \nrespiratory syndrome, or ``SARS,'' have entered our public health and \nsecurity vocabulary. They are worthy of serious study, focus, and \naction. The spread of these and other virulent diseases and the \npotentially cataclysmic impact of a pandemic on countries around the \nworld and here in the United States reminds us all of the critical need \nfor adequate preparedness and continued awareness of threats to the \nhealth and well-being of Americans and people around the world.\n  We need a strategy to handle a pandemic flu outbreak, one that \nincludes a multilayered and multinational approach to detecting and \nisolating viruses before they can spread. At my request, the Government \nAccountability Office has undertaken several investigations into how \nbest to prepare for a possible pandemic flu outbreak. The first line of \nprotection should be to deploy overseas public health specialists and \nveterinarians to detect a virus in its early stages. We need to provide \nmore international assistance to countries least able to defend \nthemselves. At the same time, DHS should develop sophisticated response \nplans to maintain critical services, such as water, power, \ntransportation, and medical and financial services, in the event a \npandemic forces the Nation to adopt a quarantine strategy.\n  The U.S. Centers for Disease Control, CDC, has established a global \ndisease protection program, and DHS has created a new Office of Health \nAffairs that will bring together medical readiness and biological \ndefense activities, including BioWatch. However, I remain concerned \nabout the level of coordination between these and other domestic actors \nregarding pandemic planning. As chairman of the Subcommittee on \nGovernment Management, the Federal Workforce and the District of \nColumbia under the Committee on Homeland Security and Government \nAffairs, I hope to address this and other issues related to pandemic \nplanning and response so that the United States is prepared for any \nnatural or manmade attack, including a pandemic flu.\n  The mutation of avian influenza, a zoonotic disease that originated \nin birds but has since been transmitted to humans, is a high-profile \nreminder that we cannot cease our efforts to prepare for and respond to \nhealth crises. Since the H5N1 strain of bird flu was first detected in \n1997, the threat has not abated. Of the 291 confirmed cases of bird flu \nreported to the WHO since that time, more than half, 171, have resulted \nin death. While these numbers may not seem large or significant, they \nare a warning signal that avian flu has mutated and continues to \nspread. As it does, it adapts and can become even more deadly. In our \ninterdependent and highly mobile world, we are never immune and, as \nsuch, we cannot be complacent.\n  For example, my home State of Hawaii lies at the crossroads between \nAsia and the continental United States. Nearly 2 million people visit \nHawaii every year from Asia. Given the large number of confirmed cases \nof avian influenza in Asia, it is easy to understand why Hawaii \ncontinues to take bird flu and pandemic planning very seriously. \nUnfortunately, this disease shows no signs of abating. According to the \nWorld Health Organization, just this month, the Cambodian Ministry of \nHealth confirmed the country's seventh case of human infection with the \nH5N1 avian influenza virus. It is the first case to be confirmed in \nhumans in Cambodia in 2007. On April 7, avian flu claimed the life of a \n74th victim in Indonesia, while on April 11, Egypt confirmed the death \nof a l5-year-old girl in Cairo, its 14th victim from avian flu.\n  But we must also remember that pandemic flu is not the only risk to \nhuman health. To coincide with World Health Day 2007, the WHO released \na report entitled ``Invest in Health, Build a Safer Future.'' In it, \nthe WHO lists eight key issues linked to international health security. \nHighly contagious diseases is certainly one of those issues, but also \nincluded are the threat of chemical, radioactive, and biological terror \nthreats, the threat of public health dangers on economic stability, and \nbuilding health security, to include a framework for collaboration laid \nout by the International Health Regulations, IHRs, and a number of \nsurveillance networks that can provide an early-warning and response \nsystem.\n  I commend the WHO for its ongoing efforts to raise awareness of the \nneed to work toward international health security and to continue to \naddress the threat of highly contagious disease, chemical, biological, \nand radiological terrorism, and the economic impact of pandemic \ndisease. Global health is no longer just a matter of ensuring the \nvitality, economic stability, and environments of the United States and \ncountries around the world. It is about security. It is about homeland \nsecurity. In commemorating World Health Day 2007, WHO Director General \nMargaret Chan put a fine point on this notion by stating that, ``A \nforeign agent that invades a sovereign territory, evades detection, \nkills civilians and disrupts the economy is a security threat by most \ndefinitions . . . . The best defense against emerging and epidemic-\nprone diseases is not passive barriers at borders, airports and \nseaports. It is proactive risk management that seeks to detect an \noutbreak early and stop it at its source.'' Through a continuing focus \non an all-hazards approach, a more comprehensive approach to defending \nour homeland, we can help mitigate the universal vulnerability the \nUnited States and other countries face against large-scale health \ncatastrophes.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/20/senate-section/article/S4809-1", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4809]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S4809]]\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                          WINNING THE MASTERS\n\n\n                         Zach Johnson's Triumph\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, recently, in a magnificent display \nof talent, skill, and old-fashioned Iowa grit, Zach Johnson won the \nMaster's Golf Tournament in Augusta, GA.\n  The new Master's champ had this to say: ``I'm Zach Johnson and I'm \nfrom Cedar Rapids, IA. I'm a normal guy.''\n  Well, Zach Johnson may be a normal guy. But he clearly has an \nextraordinary ability to play the game of golf.\n  You might say that Zach Johnson is an overnight success that was a \nlifetime in the making. His golfing career has progressed steadily from \nhis childhood on courses in Cedar Rapids, to college play at Drake \nUniversity in Des Moines, followed by professional play in the Prairie \nGold Tour, the Nationwide Tour, the PGA Tour, the U.S. Ryder Cup team, \nand, now, champion of Master's.\n  Obviously, there are many qualities that go into winning such a \nchallenging tournament against the world's top players. It takes talent \nand skill. But it also takes intelligence and character. Zach Johnson \nis abundantly endowed in all of these departments.\n  Of course, Iowans are ecstatic about Zach's victory. And more than \none Iowan has noted that his performance reflected the values we hold \ndear in the Hawkeye State. He was persistent and relentless. He didn't \ngo for a flashy style of play; it was just steady-as-she-goes, day \nafter day, tee after tee. He refused to yield. He met every challenge. \nOh, and his strong putting skills didn't hurt, either.\n  For the record, I would note that Zach Johnson won not only one of \nthe most difficult golf tournaments in the world, but also quite \npossibly one of the most difficult of all Master's tournaments in \nhistory.

      \n\n[Pages S4811-S4815]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. AKAKA (for himself, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Leahy, and Mr. \n        Schumer):\n  S. 1176. A bill to require enhanced disclosure to consumers regarding \nthe consequences of making only minimum required payments in the \nrepayment of credit card debt, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, today, I am introducing the Credit Card \nMinimum Payment Warning Act. I thank Senators Durbin, Leahy, and \nSchumer for cosponsoring this legislation.\n  Too many consumers in our country are burdened by significant credit \ncard debt. Revolving debt, mostly comprised of credit card debt, has \nrisen from $54 billion in 1980 to more than $883 billion in 2007.\n  We must make consumers more aware of the long-term effects of their \nfinancial decisions, particularly in managing credit card debt. While \nit is relatively easy to obtain credit, especially on college campuses, \nnot enough is being done to ensure that credit is properly managed. \nCurrently, credit card statements fail to include vital information \nthat would allow individuals to make fully informed financial \ndecisions. Additional disclosure is needed to ensure that consumers \ncompletely understand the implications of their credit card use and the \ncosts of only making the minimum payments.\n  The Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 \nincluded a requirement that credit card issuers provide information to \nconsumers about the consequences of only making the minimum monthly \npayment. However, this requirement fails to provide the detailed \ninformation on billing statements that consumers need to know to make \ninformed decisions. The bankruptcy law allows credit card issuers a \nchoice between disclosure statements. The first option included in the \nbankruptcy bill would require a standard ``Minimum Payment Warning.'' \nThe generic warning would state that it would take 88 months to pay off \na balance of $1,000 for bank card holders or 24 months to pay off a \nbalance of $300 for retail card holders. This first option also \nincludes a requirement that a toll-free number be established that \nwould provide an estimate of the time it would take to pay off the \ncustomer's balance. The Federal Reserve Board is required to establish \nthe table that would estimate the approximate number of months it would \ntake to pay off a variety of account balances.\n  There is a second option that the law permits. The second option \nallows the credit card issuer to provide a general minimum payment \nwarning and provide a toll-free number that consumers could call for \nthe actual number of months to repay the outstanding balance.\n  The options available under the Bankruptcy Reform law are woefully \ninadequate. They do not require issuers to provide their customers with \nthe total amount they would pay in interest and principal if they chose \nto pay off their balance at the minimum rate. Since the average \nhousehold with debt carries a balance of approximately $10,000 to \n$12,000 in revolving debt, a warning based on a balance of $1,000 will \nnot be helpful. The minimum payment warning included in the first \noption underestimates the costs of paying a balance off at the minimum \npayment. If a family has a credit card debt of $10,000, and the \ninterest rate is a modest 12.4 percent, it would take more than ten and \na half years to pay off the balance while making minimum monthly \npayments of four percent.\n  My legislation would make it very clear what costs consumers will \nincur if they make only the minimum payments on their credit cards. If \nthe Credit Card Minimum Payment Warning Act is enacted, the \npersonalized information consumers would receive for their accounts \nwould help them make informed choices about their payments toward \nreducing outstanding debt.\n  My bill requires a minimum payment warning notification on monthly \nstatements stating that making the minimum payment will increase the \namount of interest that will be paid and extend the amount of time it \nwill take to repay the outstanding balance. The legislation also \nrequires companies to inform consumers of how many years and months it \nwill take to repay their entire balance if they make only minimum \npayments. In addition, the total cost in interest and principal, if the \nconsumer pays only the minimum payment, would have to be disclosed. \nThese provisions will make individuals much more aware of the true \ncosts of their credit card debt. The bill also requires that credit \ncard companies provide useful information so that people can develop \nstrategies to free themselves of credit card debt. Consumers would have \nto be provided with the amount they need to pay to eliminate their \noutstanding balance within 36 months.\n  Finally, the legislation requires that creditors establish a toll-\nfree number so that consumers can access trustworthy credit counselors. \nIn order to ensure that consumers are referred only to trustworthy \ncredit counseling organizations, these agencies would have to be \napproved by the Federal Trade Commission and the Federal Reserve Board \nas having met comprehensive quality standards. These standards are \nnecessary because certain credit counseling agencies have abused their \nnonprofit, tax-exempt status and taken advantage of people seeking \nassistance in managing their debt.\n  In a report on customized minimum payment disclosures released in \nApril 2006, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that \nconsumers who typically carry credit balances found customized \ndisclosures very useful and would prefer to receive them in their \nbilling statements.\n  We must provide consumers with detailed personalized information to \nassist them in making better informed choices about their credit card \nuse and repayment. Our bill makes clear the adverse consequences of \nuninformed choices, such as making only minimum payments, and provides \nopportunities to locate assistance to better manage credit card debt.\n  My bill is necessary to improve credit card disclosures so that \nconsumers are provided relevant and useful information that hopefully \nwill bring about positive behavior change among consumers. Consumers \nwith lower debt levels will be better able to purchase a home, pay for \ntheir child's education, or retire comfortably on their own terms.\n  I will ask that a letter of support from the Consumer Federation of \nAmerica, the Center for Responsible Lending, Consumer Action, Consumers \nUnion, Demos, the National Association of Consumer Advocates, U.S. \nPublic Interest Research Group, the National Council of La Raza, and \nthe National Consumer Law Center be printed in the Record.\n  I will also ask that the text of the Credit Card Minimum Payment \nWarning Act be printed in the Record.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation that will \nempower consumers by providing them with detailed personalized \ninformation to assist them in making informed choices about their \ncredit card use and repayment. This bill makes clear the adverse \nconsequences of uninformed choices such as making only minimum payments \nand provides opportunities to locate assistance to reduce credit card \ndebt.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the aforementioned \nmaterials be printed in the Record.\n\n[[Page S4812]]\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                   April 17, 2007.\n     Hon. Daniel K. Akaka,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, D.C. 20510\n       Dear Senator Akaka: The undersigned national consumer and \n     civil rights organizations write to strongly support the \n     Credit Card Minimum Payment Warning Act. The Act would \n     require credit card issuers to disclose more information to \n     consumers about the costs associated with paying their bills \n     at ever-declining minimum payment rates. The Act provides a \n     personalized ``price tag'' so consumers can understand the \n     real costs of credit card debt and avoid financial problems \n     in the future.\n       Undisputed evidence links the rise in bankruptcy in recent \n     years to the increase in consumer credit outstanding. These \n     numbers have moved in lockstep for more than 20 years. \n     Revolving credit, for example (most of which is credit card \n     debt) ballooned from $214 billion in January 1990 to $873 \n     billion currently. As family debt increases, debt service \n     payments on items such as interest and late fees take an \n     ever-increasing piece of their budget. For some families, \n     this contributes to the collapse of their budget. Bankruptcy \n     becomes the only way out.\n       Credit card issuers have exacerbated the financial problems \n     that many families have faced by lowering minimum payment \n     amounts. This decline in the typical minimum payment is a \n     significant reason for the rise in consumer bankruptcies in \n     recent years. A low minimum payment often barely covers \n     interest obligations. It convinces many borrowers that they \n     are financially sound as long as they can meet all of their \n     minimum payment obligations. However, those who cannot afford \n     to make these payments often carry so much debt that \n     bankruptcy is usually the only viable option.\n       This bill will provide consumers several crucial pieces of \n     information on their monthly credit card statement: A \n     ``minimum payment warning'' that paying at the minimum rate \n     will increase the amount of interest that is owed and the \n     time it will take to repay the balance; The number of years \n     and months that it will take the consumer to pay off the \n     balance at the minimum rate; The total costs in interest and \n     principal if the consumer pays at the minimum rate; The \n     monthly payment that would be required to pay the balance off \n     in 3 years.\n       The bill also requires that credit card companies provide a \n     toll-free number that consumers can call to receive \n     information about credit counseling and debt management \n     assistance. In order to assure that consumers are referred to \n     honest, legitimate non-profit credit counselors, the bill \n     requires the Federal Reserve to screen these agencies to \n     ensure that they meet rigorous quality standards.\n       Our groups commend you for offering this very important and \n     long-overdue piece of legislation. It provides the kind of \n     personalized, timely disclosure information that will help \n     debt-choked families make informed decisions and, with the \n     help of additional protections against abusive credit card \n     lending, start to work their way back to financial health.\n       For more information, please contact Travis Plunkett at the \n     Consumer Federation of America at 202-387-6121.\n           Sincerely,\n         Travis B.

A bill to strengthen data protection and safeguards, require \ndata breach notification, and further prevent identity theft; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Identity \nTheft\n\n[[Page S4813]]\n\nPrevention Act of 2007 with my colleagues Senator Stevens and Senator \nPryor to protect Americans from identity theft.\n  The recent breaches of security that led to the loss of sensitive \npersonal information remind all of us how vulnerable we are to thieves \nstealing our identity for criminal purposes. Identity theft is a \ngrowing threat to our personal security that must be met with new \ntactics and new laws in the information age.\n  We in the Congress and every consumer in America have seen the \nevolution of identity theft. The moment of greatest awareness was in \nFebruary 2005 when ChoicePoint notified more than 145,000 people that \ntheir personal data had been accessed by unauthorized persons who used \nsome of the information for identity theft. ChoicePoint was required to \nmake these contacts under the California notification law, but this \nincident had nationwide effects. Since then, a number of data brokers, \nbanks, universities and other entities that hold personal information \nhave notified individuals that their personal information may have been \ncompromised. The last major breach was made public in January 2007, \nwhen T.J. Maxx announced it had discovered a breach in the security of \nits customer payment data. As a result of hacker activity starting in \n2005, information on more than 45 million credit and debit cards had \nbeen stolen.\n  The need to address this problem is long overdue. Every business that \ncollects and stores sensitive personal information must ensure that the \ninformation is safeguarded. If a security breach occurs and the \ninformation could be used for identity theft, every affected consumer \nneeds to be notified as soon as possible so they can best protect \nthemselves and their families. The Identity Theft Prevention Act \nprovides the Federal Trade Commission new enforcement tools to ensure \nbusinesses that hold a consumer's sensitive personal information use \nvigorous safeguards to prevent breaches from happening. The Act also \nrequires businesses to appropriately notify consumers if their \ninformation is improperly released and could lead to identity theft. In \naddition, the Identity Theft Prevention Act provides consumers the \nability to place a security freeze on their credit reports, so if they \nchoose, they can eliminate the worry and the impact of an identity \nthief opening new lines of credit from stolen information.\n  Americans have demanded better protection for their sensitive \npersonal information, and it is imperative that we respond to these \ndemands effectively and expeditiously. I look forward to working with \nthe other Members of the Senate to move this legislation forward.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CASEY:\n  S. 1179. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to extend \nthe financing for Superfund for purposes of cleanup activities with \nrespect to those Superfund sites for which removal and remedial action \nis estimated to cost more than $50,000,000, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, this Sunday we will celebrate Earth Day, a \nday when we should reaffirm our commitment to a clean, safe, and \nhealthy environment for our children and future generations.\n  We have made a considerable amount of progress since Senator Gaylord \nNelson established the first Earth Day thirty-seven years ago. We \nimplemented the Clean Water Act and the Clean Air Act, both landmark \nbills that have made our beautiful country a cleaner place to live. We \nno longer have rivers so massively polluted they actually catch fire \nand burn. We no longer have unchecked amounts of toxic pollutants being \npumped into the air we breathe. We should be proud of these \naccomplishments because they show us that we can pass meaningful and \neffective laws to protect the environment and public health without \nsacrificing our economy and economic productivity.\n  We still have serious threats to the safety and health of our \nenvironment. Obviously global climate change tops that list of threats. \nNo other single issue has the potential to devastate our future and \nchange the entire world so completely. We have an opportunity, if we \nget smart and take serious actions, to stop the cataclysmic changes \nthat are just around the corner for this planet. The time to act is \nnow. And I mean right now. Every year that we delay enacting a strong \nbill that forces us to make mandatory reductions to our carbon \nemissions the cost goes up. We simply cannot afford to wait. We cannot \nafford the cost of tackling an ever increasing carbon problem in future \nyears. And we certainly cannot afford the long-term implications of \nclimate change like rising sea levels that will displace large centers \nof population, droughts that will dramatically reduce fresh drinking \nwater, and major storms like those that have hit the Gulf Coast and \nAtlantic seaboard over the past few years.\n  Climate change is certainly the most pressing environmental issue \nfacing us today. But we should not forget about other important issues \nfacing our constituents. Reducing mercury and other air pollutants, \nreducing pollution of our rivers and streams, preserving open space and \nstopping urban sprawl, increasing investments in renewable and \nalternative energy sources, establishing higher fuel efficiency \nstandards, and reducing the number of unremediated Superfund sites \ncontinue to be top priorities for me.\n  For this reason and in honor of Earth Day, today I am introducing the \nSuperfund Equity and Megasite Remediation Act of 2007. This legislation \nreinstates the polluter-pays tax that funds clean up of Superfund \nsites. In addition, my bill ramps up the tax for limited 5-year period \nin order to create a fund to clean up megasites, which cost more than \n$50 million each to remediate.\n  I know that Senator Boxer, the Chairman of the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee, has been a long-time advocate for reinstating the \npolluter-pays principle in federal hazardous waste cleanup law. I look \nforward to working with her and all of my colleagues on the Environment \nCommittee and the Finance Committee to make sure that we have a \nSuperfund program that cleans up the polluted sites that blight our \ncommunities and prevent development and reuse, and does so in a way \nthat polluters foot the bill, and not taxpayers. I urge all of my \ncolleagues to join me in support of this bill, and do the right thing \nfor our local towns on Earth Day.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. LANDRIEU:\n  S. 1180. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to extend \nthe placed-in-service date requirement for low-income housing credit \nbuildings in the Gulf Opportunity Zone, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, as the gulf coast recovers from Katrina \nand Rita, rebuilding our housing remains the key to our recovery. I \nhave talked about this issue on this floor before. We need housing so \nthat our citizens have a place to live while they rebuild our \nbusinesses, restore our infrastructure, and renew our communities. \nCongress and the President responded by making billions of dollars \navailable to us and we are grateful for this assistance.\n  I am proud to say that this assistance is working. Every time I go \nhome I see signs of improvement. They are often small: a gas station or \na store reopening on a corner; children playing on a street where no \none lived only a few months before. I wish I could say that these signs \nare everywhere, but they are not. Some parts of New Orleans are doing \nwell, some are not. We knew from the start that recovery would take \nlonger in some areas than in others; and we all knew that nothing would \nhappen overnight.\n  America has never rebuilt a city of 500,000 people before. Our \nexperience in Louisiana and in the Gulf has taught us some valuable \nlessons about postcatastrophe rebuilding and recovery. We have learned \nabout the shortcomings of government programs at FEMA, the Small \nBusiness Administration, and other agencies. In responding to Katrina \nthey used the systems that worked great for smaller disasters, but were \nwoefully inadequate for larger ones. For future megacatastrophes we now \nunderstand that it may take government programs several months to ramp \nup before they are in a position to distribute assistance.\n  One of the key lessons we have learned from this catastrophe has been \nthe affect of such massive destruction\n\n[[Page S4814]]\n\nand displacement on the supply and the costs of labor and building \nmaterials, and the impact these have on how long it takes to rebuild. \nNew Orleans, for example, is about half the population it used to be. \nWe do not have enough workers in building and contracting to meet the \nhuge demand we have for this work. As a result, it may take several \nmonths to get building started. Developers are also having difficulty \ngetting insurance and the infrastructure in many areas is still heavily \ndamaged.\n  This timing delay means that Congress will have to reexamine the \npolicies that we have enacted to help rebuild the Gulf region in order \nto ensure that they are meeting the new kinds of disaster recovery \nchallenges Katrina and Rita have posed. The Gulf Opportunity Zone Act \nof 2005 was one of the major pieces of legislation that we passed. The \nGO Zone Act provided important tax incentives to encourage investment \nin businesses and housing in the Gulf.\n  To help ensure that we can rebuild our housing, GO Zone Act increased \nthe state's allocation of Low Income Housing Tax Credits, LIHTC. These \ncredits finance affordable and mixed income housing. Under the GO Zone \nAct, any housing developed with these tax credits must be built and \noperating by December 31, 2008. The statute refers to this as the \n``placed in service'' date. This date is consistent with the normal \nLIHTC program guidelines that require tax credit housing developments \nto be placed in service within 2 years of allocation.\n  The Louisiana Housing Finance Agency, LHFA, reports that there was a \ngreat demand for these GO Zone credits. For the credits allocated in \n2006, the LHFA received 266 applications from developers for more than \n$253 million. But it only funded 102 projects with $56.9 million in tax \ncredits.\n  For 2007 and 2008, however, the State received far fewer \napplications. The reason for this is because of the placed-in-service \ndate. Because of the labor shortage, increased costs, and lack of \ninsurance that we are facing in the Gulf, developers are not sure \nwhether they can get their projects placed in service by the end of \n2008. Yet there is still a huge need for the housing that these credits \nwill fund.\n  The placed-in-service date is also raising new concerns. I have heard \nfrom a number of organizations that already received tax credit \nallocations before 2006 who are concerned that they will not be able to \nget their developments placed in service by the end of 2008. The LHFA \nestimates that 65 percent of the affordable housing units under \ndevelopment in New Orleans, roughly 11,050 units, will not make the \ndeadline to be available for rent by the end of 2008. In the \nsurrounding parishes, home sales prices have literally hit the roof \nmeaning working and middle-income families cannot reasonably justify \nliving in the area that they still call home, 19 months since the \nstorm. Again, the culprit is the shortages and increased costs that I \nmentioned before. Some developers have even told me that they face \nlosing credits that had been allocated to them before the storm because \nbuilding has been delayed in the region. Since Katrina, rental prices \nhave increased by 39 percent.\n  Today, I am introducing legislation that will help to ensure that \nthese housing tax credits are available so that we can continue the \nroad to recovery. The Workforce Housing for the GO Zone Act of 2007 \nwill extend the placed-in-service date for the GO Zone Low Income \nHousing Tax Credit by an additional 2 years. This will allow developers \nto make full use of the credits that are available to build affordable \nhousing in the Gulf Coast.\n  Another critical provision lets GO Zone low-income housing projects \nreceive additional federally subsidized loans without losing tax \ncredits. The Low Income Housing Tax Credit provisions included in this \nbill further assist our people to return home. These credits are \ncompetitively awarded to qualified developers and subject to constant \noversight by the State housing authority to make sure that only quality \naffordable housing is being constructed. The citizens of the gulf coast \nare ready to go back home, and this legislation helps get them there.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the legislation be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1180\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Quinebaug and Shetucket Rivers Valley \nNational Heritage Corridor Act of 1994 to increase the authorization of \nappropriations and modify the date on which the authority of the \nSecretary of the Interior terminates under the Act; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, today I join with my colleagues, Senators \nLieberman, Kerry, and Kennedy, to introduce the Quinebaug and Shetucket \nRivers Valley National Heritage Corridor Amendments Act of 2007. \nRepresentatives Courtney and Neal have introduced a companion bill in \nthe House.\n  The Quinebaug and Shetucket Rivers Valley National Heritage Corridor, \nor QSHC, was established in 1994 as the fifth National Heritage \nCorridor. National Heritage Areas are designated by Congress to \npreserve distinctive landscapes of historic, cultural, natural, and \nrecreational resources. The QSHC is commonly known as ``The Last Green \nValley,'' a rare rural landscape in the populous Northeast. In fact, \nthe Valley stands out in night images from space for its absence of \nlights. It contains aboriginal and colonial archaeological sites, mills \nand mill villages that preserve the history of the early industrial \nrevolution, and traditional farming communities. The QSHC non-profit \nmanagement entity has restored architecturally and historically \nimportant buildings, developed interpretive projects, and developed \nconservation and open space plans. It has consistently leveraged an \naverage of $19 for every $1 of appropriated Federal money.\n  The QSHC has developed a plan to become a self-sustaining entity by \n2015, as laid out in ``The Trail to 2015: A Sustainability Plan for the \nLast Green Valley.'' The plan calls for replacing Federal funds with \nfees for services, private and corporate support, and income from a \npermanent fund. In the interim, Federal funds are necessary for \ncapacity-building, awareness programs, and ongoing education of land-\nuse decision-makers.\n  The Quinebaug and Shetucket Rivers Valley National Heritage Corridor \nhas created a collaboration of 35 municipalities dedicated to \npreserving a unique slice of our American heritage. With an extension \nof its authorization, this preserve can exist in perpetuity. I urge my \ncolleagues to support reauthorization of the QSHC.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/20/senate-section/article/S4815-1", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4815-S4816]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 162--COMMEMORATING AND ACKNOWLEDGING THE DEDICATION \nAND SACRIFICE MADE BY THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO HAVE LOST THEIR LIVES WHILE \n                  SERVING AS LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY (for himself, Mr. Specter, Mr. Biden, Mr. Grassley, Mr. \nCornyn, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Reid, Mr. Durbin, and Mr. Menendez) submitted \nthe following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on the \nJudiciary:\n\n                              S. Res. 162\n\n       Whereas the well-being of all citizens of the United States \n     is preserved and enhanced as a direct result of the vigilance \n     and dedication of law enforcement personnel;\n       Whereas more than 900,000 men and women, at great risk to \n     their personal safety, presently serve their fellow citizens \n     as guardians of the peace;\n       Whereas peace officers are on the front lines in preserving \n     the right of the children of the United States to receive an \n     education in a crime-free environment, a right that is all \n     too often threatened by the insidious fear caused by violence \n     in schools;\n       Whereas 147 peace officers across the United States were \n     killed in the line of duty during 2006, which is below the \n     decade-long annual average of 167 deaths;\n       Whereas a number of factors contributed to this reduction \n     in deaths, including--\n       (1) better equipment and increased use of bullet-resistant \n     vests;\n       (2) improved training;\n       (3) longer prison terms for violent offenders; and\n       (4) advanced emergency medical care;\n\n       Whereas every other day, 1 out of every 16 peace officers \n     is assaulted, 1 out of every 56 peace officers is injured, \n     and 1 out of every 5,500 peace officers is killed in the line \n     of duty somewhere in the United States; and\n       Whereas on May 15, 2007, more than 20,000 peace officers \n     are expected to gather in Washington, D.C., to join with the \n     families of their recently fallen comrades to honor those \n     comrades and all others who went before them: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes May 15, 2007, as ``Peace Officers Memorial \n     Day'', in honor of the Federal, State, and local officers \n     that have been killed or disabled in the line of duty; and\n       (2) calls on the people of the United States to observe \n     that day with appropriate ceremonies and respect.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am proud to submit today a bipartisan \nresolution to designate May 15, 2007, as National Peace Officers \nMemorial Day. Joining me in the submission of this resolution are \nSenators Specter, Reid, Biden, Grassley, Cornyn, and Stabenow. I thank \nthem for their leadership in recognizing the sacrifices\n\n[[Page S4816]]\n\nthat law enforcement officers make each day for the American people.\n  This is now the eleventh year running that I have been involved in \nthe submission of this resolution to keep alive in the memory of all \nAmericans the sacrifice and commitment of those law enforcement \nofficers who lost their lives serving their communities. For many years \nI submitted this worthy resolution with my old friend and our former \ncolleague Senator Campbell, a former deputy sheriff who was a true \nleader on this issue. Both Senator Campbell, and I, as a former \nprosecutor, witnessed firsthand the risks faced by law enforcement \nofficers every day while they serve and protect our communities.\n  I also want to thank each of our Nation's law enforcement officers \nfor their commitment to the safety and protection of their fellow \ncitizens. They are the real-life heroes; too many of whom too often \nmake the ultimate sacrifice. It is important to support and respect our \nState and local police officers and all of our first responders, and to \nrecognize their role in upholding the rule of law and keeping our \nNation's citizens safe and secure.\n  Currently, more than 870,000 men and women who guard our communities \ndo so at great risk. After the hijacked planes hit the World Trade \nCenter in New York City on September 11, 2001, 72 peace officers died \nwhile trying to ensure that their fellow citizens in those buildings \ngot to safety. That act of terrorism resulted in the highest number of \npeace officers ever killed in a single incident in the history of our \ncountry, and is a tragic reminder of how important it is for the \nCongress to provide all of the resources necessary to protect officers \nin the line of duty.\n  Since the first recorded police death in 1792, there have been more \nthan 17,900 law enforcement officers who have made the ultimate \nsacrifice. We are fortunate in Vermont that we rank as the State with \nthe fewest officer deaths in history, with 19 recorded; however, that \nis 19 deaths too many. In 2006, 147 law enforcement officers died while \nserving in the line of duty, well below the decade-long average of 165 \ndeaths annually, and a drop from 2005 when 156 officers were killed. A \nnumber of factors contributed to this reduction, including better \nequipment and the increased use of bullet-resistant vests, improved \ntraining and advanced emergency medical care. I hope as the 110th \nCongress moves forward that all Senators can work together to ensure \nthat all of our law enforcement officers have the full support and \nresources of the Federal Government.\n  I am proud of the work I have been involved in to help make it safer \non the beat for our officers. Back in 1998, Senator Campbell and I \nauthored the Bulletproof Vest Grant Partnership Act in response to the \ntragic Carl Drega shootout on the Vermont-New Hampshire border, in \nwhich two state troopers who lacked bulletproof vests were killed. \nSince then, we have successfully reauthorized this program three more \ntimes: in the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act of 2000, in the \nState Justice Institute Reauthorization Act of 2004, and most recently \nas part of the Violence Against Women and Department of Justice \nReauthorization Act of 2005. It is now authorized at $50 million per \nyear through fiscal year 2009 to help State, tribal and local \njurisdictions purchase armor vests for use by law enforcement officers. \nI have already begun to work with my colleagues to make sure that the \nBulletproof Vest Partnership grant program is fully funded this year. \nBulletproof vests have saved the lives of thousands of officers and are \na fundamental line of defense that no officer should be without. I know \nI am not alone in calling for the Senate to fully fund the Bulletproof \nVest Partnership program and I truly hope my colleagues will agree that \nit is critical that we provide the funding authorized for this program. \nHundreds of thousands of police officers are counting on us.\n  I am also pleased to join with Senator Reed and others to introduce \nthe Equity in Law Enforcement Act, which will provide parity in Federal \nbenefits for law enforcement officers working in private educational \ninstitutions and for our Nation's rail carriers. Among these benefits \nare access to grants under the Bulletproof Vest Partnership, and \nsurvivor benefits. All of the men and women who serve our society as \nlaw enforcement officers should be equally entitled to all of the \nbenefits the Federal Government provides, no matter where they serve.\n  National Peace Officers Memorial Day will provide the people of the \nUnited States, in their communities, in their State Capitals, and in \nthe Nation's Capitol, with the opportunity to honor and reflect on the \nextraordinary service and sacrifice given year after year by our police \nforces. During the week of May 8-15, more than 20,000 peace officers \nare expected to gather in Washington to join with the families of their \nfallen comrades. I hope all Senators will join me in honoring their \nservice by passing this important bipartisan resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/20/senate-section/article/S4816-1", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4816-S4817]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 163--DESIGNATING THE THIRD WEEK OF APRIL 2007, AS \n            ``NATIONAL SHAKEN BABY SYNDROME AWARENESS WEEK''\n\n  Mr. DODD (for himself, Mr. Alexander, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Durbin, Ms. \nCantwell, Mr. Coleman, Mr. Levin, Mr. Bayh, Mr. Bennett, Mr. Schumer, \nMr. Domenici, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Salazar, and Mr. Lieberman) \nsubmitted the following resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S. Res. 163\n\n       Whereas the month of April has been designated ``National \n     Child Abuse Prevention Month'' as an annual tradition that \n     was initiated in 1979 by former President Jimmy Carter;\n       Whereas the most recent National Child Abuse and Neglect \n     Data System figures reveal that almost 900,000 children were \n     victims of abuse and neglect in the United States in 2005, \n     causing unspeakable pain and suffering to our most vulnerable \n     citizens;\n       Whereas among the children who are victims of abuse and \n     neglect, more than 4 children die in the United States each \n     day;\n       Whereas children aged 1 year or younger accounted for \n     approximately 42 percent of all child abuse and neglect \n     fatalities in 2005, and children aged 3 years or younger \n     accounted for approximately 77 percent of all child abuse and \n     neglect fatalities in 2005;\n       Whereas abusive head trauma, including the trauma known as \n     ``Shaken Baby Syndrome'', is recognized as the leading cause \n     of death of physically abused children;\n       Whereas Shaken Baby Syndrome can result in loss of vision, \n     brain damage, paralysis, seizures, or death;\n       Whereas a 2003 report in the Journal of the American \n     Medical Association estimated that, in the United States, an \n     average of 300 children will die each year, and 600 to 1,200 \n     more will be injured, of whom \\2/3\\ will be babies or infants \n     under 1 year in age, as a result of Shaken Baby Syndrome, \n     with many cases resulting in severe and permanent \n     disabilities;\n       Whereas medical professionals believe that thousands of \n     additional cases of Shaken Baby Syndrome and other forms of \n     abusive head trauma are being misdiagnosed or are not \n     detected;\n       Whereas Shaken Baby Syndrome often results in permanent, \n     irreparable brain damage or death to an infant and may result \n     in extraordinary costs for the provision of medical care to \n     the infant in just the first few years of life of the infant;\n       Whereas the most effective solution for ending Shaken Baby \n     Syndrome is to prevent the abuse, and it is clear that the \n     minimal costs of education and prevention programs may \n     prevent enormous medical and disability costs and \n     immeasurable amounts of grief for many families;\n       Whereas prevention programs have demonstrated that \n     educating new parents about the danger of shaking young \n     children and how they can help protect their child from \n     injury can bring about a significant reduction in the number \n     of cases of Shaken Baby Syndrome;\n       Whereas education programs have been shown to raise \n     awareness and provide critically important information about \n     Shaken Baby Syndrome to parents, caregivers, daycare workers, \n     child protection employees, law enforcement personnel, health \n     care professionals, and legal representatives;\n       Whereas ``National Shaken Baby Syndrome Awareness Week'' \n     and efforts to prevent child abuse, including Shaken Baby \n     Syndrome, are supported by groups across the United States, \n     including those formed by parents and relatives of children \n     who have been killed or injured by shaking, whose mission is \n     to educate the general public and professionals about Shaken \n     Baby Syndrome and to increase support for victims and the \n     families of the victims in the health care and criminal \n     justice systems;\n       Whereas Congress previously designated the third week of \n     April 2001 as ``National Shaken Baby Syndrome Awareness Week \n     2001''; and\n       Whereas Congress strongly supports efforts to protect \n     children from abuse and neglect: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the third week of April 2007 as ``National \n     Shaken Baby Syndrome Awareness Week'';\n\n[[Page S4817]]\n\n       (2) commends those hospitals, child care councils, schools, \n     community groups, and other organizations that are--\n       (A) working to increase awareness of the danger of shaking \n     young children; and\n       (B) educating parents and caregivers on how they can help \n     protect children from injuries caused by abusive shaking; and\n       (C) helping families cope effectively with the challenges \n     of child-rearing and other stresses in their lives; and\n       (3) encourages the citizens of the United States to--\n       (A) remember the victims of Shaken Baby Syndrome; and\n       (B) participate in educational programs to help prevent \n     Shaken Baby Syndrome.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/20/senate-section/article/S4817-1", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4817]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 164--DESIGNATING THE WEEK BEGINNING APRIL 22, 2007, \n                     AS ``WEEK OF THE YOUNG CHILD''\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR (for himself, Mr. Alexander, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Burr, Mr. \nLevin, Mr. Coleman, Mr. Cochran, Ms. Collins, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Corker, \nMrs. Murray, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Conrad, and Mrs. Lincoln) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S. Res. 164\n\n       Whereas there are 20,000,000 children under the age of 5 in \n     the United States;\n       Whereas numerous studies, including the Abecedarian Study, \n     the Study of the Chicago Child-Parent Center, and the High/\n     Scope Perry Preschool Study, indicate that low income \n     children who have enrolled in quality, comprehensive early \n     childhood education programs--\n       (1) improve their cognitive, language, physical, social, \n     and emotional development; and\n       (2) are less likely to--\n       (A) be placed in special education;\n       (B) drop out of school; or\n       (C) engage in juvenile delinquency;\n       Whereas the enrollment rates of children under the age of 5 \n     in early childhood education programs have steadily increased \n     since 1965 with--\n       (1) the creation of the Head Start program carried out \n     under the Head Start Act (42 U.S.C. 9831 et seq.);\n       (2) the establishment of the Early Head Start program \n     carried out under the Head Start Act (42 U.S.C. 9831 et \n     seq.); and\n       (3) the enactment of the Child Care and Development Block \n     Grant Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 9858 et seq.);\n       Whereas many children eligible for, and in need of, quality \n     early childhood education services are not served;\n       Whereas only about one-half of all preschoolers who are \n     eligible to participate in Head Start programs have the \n     opportunity to do so;\n       Whereas less than 5 percent of all eligible babies and \n     toddlers in the United States receive the opportunity to \n     participate in Early Head Start;\n       Whereas only about 1 out of every 7 eligible children \n     receives assistance under section 658C of the Child Care and \n     Development Block Grant Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 9858a) to--\n       (1) enable the parents of the child to continue working; \n     and\n       (2) provide the child with safe and nurturing early \n     childhood care and education;\n       Whereas, although State and local governments have \n     responded to the numerous benefits of early childhood \n     education by making significant investments in programs and \n     classrooms, there remains--\n       (1) a large unmet need for those services; and\n       (2) a need to improve the quality of those programs;\n       Whereas, according to numerous studies on the impact of \n     investments in high-quality early childhood education, the \n     programs reduce--\n       (1) the occurrence of students failing to complete \n     secondary school; and\n       (2) future costs relating to special education and juvenile \n     crime; and\n       Whereas economist and Nobel Laureate, James Heckman, and \n     Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve \n     System, Ben S.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 163, \nsubmitted earlier today.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report the \nresolution by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 163) designating the third week of \n     April 2007 as ``National Shaken Baby Syndrome Awareness \n     Week''.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, along with Senators Alexander, Bayh, \nBennett, Boxer, Cantwell, Clinton, Coleman, Domenici, Durbin, Hatch, \nLevin, Lieberman, Salazar, and Schumer, I am in support of our \nresolution to proclaim the third week of April of 2007 as ``National \nShaken Baby Syndrome Awareness Week.'' The Senate has passed similar \nresolutions each year since 2001, and we strongly support continued \nawareness of one of the most devastating forms of child abuse in this \ncountry, abuse that results in the severe injury, lifelong disability, \nor death of hundreds of children each year.\n  In recognition of the need to eliminate child abuse and to raise \nawareness about the issue, the month of April has again been designated \n``National Child Abuse Prevention Month,'' an annual tradition that was \ninitiated in 1979 by former President Jimmy Carter. As we focus on \nchild abuse prevention this month, awareness and prevention of Shaken \nBaby Syndrome is an important component of these efforts.\n  I would like to recognize the many groups, including those formed by \nparents and relatives who have been killed or injured by shaking, who \nsupport this effort to increase awareness of one of the most \ndevastating forms of child abuse. These supporters include the American \nAcademy of Pediatrics, the American Association of Neurological \nSurgeons, the American Psychological Association, The Arc of the United \nStates, the Association of Maternal and Child Health Programs, the \nAssociation of University Centers on Disabilities, the Brain Injury \nAssociation of America, the Center for Child Protection and Family \nSupport, the Child Welfare League of America, Children's Healthcare is \na Legal Duty, the Congress of Neurological Surgeons, the Cynthia Gibbs \nFoundation, Don't Shake Jake, Easter Seals, Epilepsy Foundation of \nAmerica, Family Voices, the Hannah Rose Foundation, the Kierra Harrison \nFoundation, the National Association of Children's Hospitals, the \nNational Association of Child Care Resource & Referral Agencies, the \nNational Center for Learning Disabilities, the National Child Abuse \nCoalition, the National Crime Prevention Council, the National Exchange \nClub Foundation, the National Family Partnership, the National Respite \nCoalition, the National Shaken Baby Coalition, Parents Anonymous, \nPrevent Child Abuse, the Shaken Baby Alliance, the Shaken Baby \nAssociation, Shaken Baby Prevention Inc., Shaken Baby Syndrome \nPrevention Plus, the SKIPPER Initiative, United Cerebral Palsy, A Voice \nfor Gabbi, and many other groups.\n  I urge the Senate to adopt this resolution designating the third week \nof April 2007 as ``National Shaken Baby Syndrome Awareness Week,'' and \nto take part in the many local and national activities and events \nrecognizing the month of April as National Child Abuse Prevention \nMonth.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be \nagreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motions to reconsider be laid \nupon the table, and that any statements relating thereto be printed in \nthe Record.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 163) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 163\n\n       Whereas the month of April has been designated ``National \n     Child Abuse Prevention Month'' as an annual tradition that \n     was initiated in 1979 by former President Jimmy Carter;\n       Whereas the most recent National Child Abuse and Neglect \n     Data System figures reveal that almost 900,000 children were \n     victims of abuse and neglect in the United States in 2005, \n     causing unspeakable pain and suffering to our most vulnerable \n     citizens;\n       Whereas among the children who are victims of abuse and \n     neglect, more than 4 children die in the United States each \n     day;\n       Whereas children aged 1 year or younger accounted for \n     approximately 42 percent of all child abuse and neglect \n     fatalities in 2005, and children aged 3 years or younger \n     accounted for approximately 77 percent of all child abuse and \n     neglect fatalities in 2005;\n       Whereas abusive head trauma, including the trauma known as \n     ``Shaken Baby Syndrome'', is recognized as the leading cause \n     of death of physically abused children;\n       Whereas Shaken Baby Syndrome can result in loss of vision, \n     brain damage, paralysis, seizures, or death;\n       Whereas a 2003 report in the Journal of the American \n     Medical Association estimated that, in the United States, an \n     average of 300 children will die each year, and 600 to 1,200 \n     more will be injured, of whom \\2/3\\ will be babies or infants \n     under 1 year in age, as a result of Shaken Baby Syndrome, \n     with many cases resulting in severe and permanent \n     disabilities;\n       Whereas medical professionals believe that thousands of \n     additional cases of Shaken Baby Syndrome and other forms of \n     abusive head trauma are being misdiagnosed or are not \n     detected;\n       Whereas Shaken Baby Syndrome often results in permanent, \n     irreparable brain damage or death to an infant and may result \n     in extraordinary costs for the provision of medical care to \n     the infant in just the first few years of life of the infant;\n       Whereas the most effective solution for ending Shaken Baby \n     Syndrome is to prevent the abuse, and it is clear that the \n     minimal costs of education and prevention programs may \n     prevent enormous medical and disability costs and \n     immeasurable amounts of grief for many families;\n       Whereas prevention programs have demonstrated that \n     educating new parents about the danger of shaking young \n     children and how they can help protect their child from \n     injury can bring about a significant reduction in the number \n     of cases of Shaken Baby Syndrome;\n       Whereas education programs have been shown to raise \n     awareness and provide critically important information about \n     Shaken Baby Syndrome to parents, caregivers, daycare workers, \n     child protection employees, law enforcement personnel, health \n     care professionals, and legal representatives;\n       Whereas ``National Shaken Baby Syndrome Awareness Week'' \n     and efforts to prevent child abuse, including Shaken Baby \n     Syndrome, are supported by groups across the United States, \n     including those formed by parents and relatives of children \n     who have been killed or injured by shaking, whose mission is \n     to educate the general public and professionals about Shaken \n     Baby Syndrome and to increase support for victims and the \n     families of the victims in the health care and criminal \n     justice systems;\n       Whereas Congress previously designated the third week of \n     April 2001 as ``National Shaken Baby Syndrome Awareness Week \n     2001'';

Res. 164\n\n       Whereas there are 20,000,000 children under the age of 5 in \n     the United States;\n       Whereas numerous studies, including the Abecedarian Study, \n     the Study of the Chicago Child-Parent Center, and the High/\n     Scope Perry Preschool Study, indicate that low income \n     children who have enrolled in quality, comprehensive early \n     childhood education programs--\n       (1) improve their cognitive, language, physical, social, \n     and emotional development; and\n       (2) are less likely to--\n       (A) be placed in special education;\n       (B) drop out of school; or\n       (C) engage in juvenile delinquency;\n       Whereas the enrollment rates of children under the age of 5 \n     in early childhood education programs have steadily increased \n     since 1965 with--\n       (1) the creation of the Head Start program carried out \n     under the Head Start Act (42 U.S.C. 9831 et seq.);\n       (2) the establishment of the Early Head Start program \n     carried out under the Head Start Act (42 U.S.C. 9831 et \n     seq.); and\n       (3) the enactment of the Child Care and Development Block \n     Grant Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 9858 et seq.);\n       Whereas many children eligible for, and in need of, quality \n     early childhood education services are not served;\n       Whereas only about one-half of all preschoolers who are \n     eligible to participate in Head Start programs have the \n     opportunity to do so;\n       Whereas less than 5 percent of all eligible babies and \n     toddlers in the United States receive the opportunity to \n     participate in Early Head Start;\n       Whereas only about 1 out of every 7 eligible children \n     receives assistance under section 658C of the Child Care and \n     Development Block Grant Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 9858a) to--\n       (1) enable the parents of the child to continue working; \n     and\n       (2) provide the child with safe and nurturing early \n     childhood care and education;\n       Whereas, although State and local governments have \n     responded to the numerous benefits of early childhood \n     education by making significant investments in programs and \n     classrooms, there remains--\n       (1) a large unmet need for those services; and\n       (2) a need to improve the quality of those programs;\n       Whereas, according to numerous studies on the impact of \n     investments in high-quality early childhood education, the \n     programs reduce--\n       (1) the occurrence of students failing to complete \n     secondary school; and\n       (2) future costs relating to special education and juvenile \n     crime; and\n       Whereas economist and Nobel Laureate, James Heckman, and \n     Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve \n     System, Ben S.
