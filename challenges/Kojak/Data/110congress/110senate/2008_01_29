We have all seen the \npress today. Everyone knows the Senate is going to put their mark on \nthe stimulus package. We feel what will be done will be very \nstimulative to the economy. It includes, as I understand it, some 20 \nmillion seniors who were left out of what has taken place in the House. \nThere will be unemployment benefits. A number of States are in very \ndifficult shape in that regard. They have some other things dealing \nwith the business package, and I am told that advocacy groups like very \nmuch what is in the Senate package. But we will work through this and \ntry to get something done very quickly so that, if there are changes \nmade, we can do a very quick conference and get it to the President. \nThat is an important issue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/29/senate-section/article/S403-8", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S403-S404]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  FISA\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I want everyone--especially my Republican \ncolleagues and especially the people in the White House--to listen to \nwhat I am going to say. FISA, if we don't do something on it today, \nwill expire. It will be out of business. The House is going out of \nsession tonight, so unless we get to them the 30-day extension we have \ntried to move forward five or six times, unless we have an extension of \n18 months, a year, 2 weeks, whatever the Republicans think is \nappropriate--if they think nothing is appropriate--then the full brunt \nof this law expiring is on their shoulders because it is virtually \nlegislatively impossible to get anything done today. Remember, the \nHouse has already done what they are going to do. If we took what the \nIntelligence Committee passed, which is likely not going to happen, we \nwould have to have a conference with the House. They are going out of \nsession tonight. They are out of town on Wednesday and Thursday and \nFriday. So unless we do something today, the bill is not going to be \nenacted and the legislation we passed last August will expire.\n  Now, the orders that have been sought and accomplished during the \ntime since last August will still be in effect, and, of course, there \nwill be an opportunity under the old FISA law to\n\n[[Page S404]]\n\nwork on an emergency basis for new things they want to do.\n  We want to maintain the ability to go after the bad people. We \nbelieve there is a necessity for intercepting telephone conversations \nbetween people who are trying to do bad things. We think it should be \nwithin the constitutional framework, and we believe that is what the \nIntelligence Committee and the Judiciary Committee have done. But I \nagain say, without getting into any details, unless we do something \ntoday, unless someone can explain to me how we can pass something here \nin a matter of a few hours, how we can have a conference with the House \nin a matter of a few hours and then bring those two conference reports \nto the House and the Senate in a few hours--I say that is legislatively \nimpossible.\n  So I am saying again to my Republican colleagues: Agree to some \nextension of time or the burden of this legislation not passing is on \nyour shoulders because we have had no attempt to legislate. We have not \nhad the opportunity to offer amendments, let alone vote on them.\n  Our goal is to provide the intelligence community with all of the \nlegal tools it needs, while protecting the privacy of law-abiding \nAmericans. So I would hope that in the next hour or so, we can work \nsomething out before the House leaves town or nothing will have been \naccomplished.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/29/senate-section/article/S404-1", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S404]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, we have known we needed to get the FISA \nlaw extended for 6 months--6 months. I have also heard it suggested \nthat somehow, little or no harm would be done if the law were allowed \nto expire. Well, that is simply incorrect. The ability to go after new \ntargets would be eliminated with the expiration of this bill in 3 days. \nSo here we are with 3 days to go, and I gather from listening to my \ngood friend on the other side, the very real possibility is that there \nis at least some willingness on the part of some on the other side to \njust let the law expire.\n  Now, contrary to what some are saying, the expiration of this \nimportant antiterrorist tool has serious consequences; that is, if we \ndon't get this job done, the notion that somehow it doesn't make any \ndifference is certainly not true. Let me say again: Once it expires, \nintelligence officials will no longer be able to gather intelligence on \nnew--new--foreign terrorist targets. The terrorists are not going to \nstop planning new attacks just because we stop monitoring their \nactivities. Our enemies are watching. They know our intelligence \ncapabilities will be degraded once the Protect America Act expires. \nThat is why we need to reauthorize FISA in such a way that we retain \nits full--its full--terror-fighting force. The Senate Intelligence \nCommittee's version does just that. That is the Rockefeller-Bond \nbipartisan proposal that came out of committee 13 to 2. Senate \nRepublicans stand ready to finish that good work the committee did and \nthe administration began.\n  We have proposed a list of several amendments to our colleagues on \nthe other side that could receive votes. I know those discussions are \nongoing, and hopefully we can begin to have some votes. But we do not \nhave the time to rebuild amendment by amendment a Judiciary Committee \nversion that a bipartisan majority of the Senate has already defeated. \nIt wouldn't become law even if we passed it.\n  Now, Republicans are ready to provide a short-term extension of the \nProtect America Act to keep the Senate focused on the importance of \nthis critical terror-fighting tool. But after 10 months of waiting, we \ndo not need--and the country cannot afford--another month of delay.\n  We await the response of our Democratic colleagues to our amendment \nproposal, and those discussions, as I indicated, are going forward, and \nwe look forward to finishing the job in a way that allows our \nintelligence professionals to keep us safe from harm.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we understand the implication of the \nlegislation that is now in effect and will expire Thursday. We \nunderstand that. We understand there are new targets our intelligence \nofficials may want to go after. We understand that. But I repeat: Using \nthe words of my friend, the Republican leader, once it expires, if it \nexpires, it is on the shoulders of the White House and the Republicans \nin the Senate. We have attempted to work through this, and we have been \nwilling to extend this law for an extended period of time. We have been \nwilling to extend the law for a limited period of time.\n  I think what this all boils down to is that we should extend the law \nfor a long period of time because the only issue--there are other \nissues, of course, but the main issue is whether there will be \nretroactive immunity for the phone companies. That is what it all boils \ndown to--whether there is going to be retroactive immunity to the phone \ncompanies. Some of us don't think that is appropriate; others think it \nis appropriate.\n  So why don't we extend this law for an extended period of time? That \nway, the new targets could be sought if, in fact, they are out there--\nand we all believe there are some, and that is necessary to be done--\nand then set up a time. We will agree to a time and have a debate on \nthe immunity provisions and see if the Senate and the House are willing \nto give retroactive immunity. In the bill my distinguished colleague, \nthe Republican leader, talked about that came from the Intelligence \nCommittee, that is in that bill. That is in their bill that came from \ncommittee. What the House has done doesn't have it in there. So why \ndon't we have a debate on that issue and just extend the law? We will \nextend it until there is a new President. We are fine--we are happy to \ndo that--so that we get off this: We can't do the targets. Why don't we \njust extend it for a period of time, and then our side will agree to \ntry to work out something legislatively so that we can have a real nice \ndebate on retroactive immunity.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, will the majority leader yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I would like to ask the Senator if he \ncould recap for me two votes that I think are significant. There was a \nvote taken as to whether the Judiciary Committee version would be \naccepted. A cloture vote was taken, if I am not mistaken, and it was \ndefeated. If I am not mistaken, that was last week. And if I am not \nmistaken as well, yesterday, when Senator McConnell offered a cloture \nmotion to promote his point of view, there were only 48 votes in \nsupport of it out of the 60 that were necessary--4 from our side of the \naisle, 44 from the Republican side.\n  It seems to me we need to put our heads together to work this out. \nExtending this law so that there is no damage or hazard to our country \nis a reasonable way to do this. We now have reached a point where \namendments may be considered and voted on, and then we will be in a \nspot where we can pass a version in the Senate, send it to conference, \nand work out our differences. But I can't understand how the President \nand the Republican leader can come to the floor and blame us for the \nexpiration of the law if we are offering an extension of the law and \nthey keep refusing.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to my friend, the distinguished \nSenator from Illinois, I personally have been to the floor and offered \non many occasions to extend the time. We could all see the train wreck \ncoming, and we believed that it was necessary to extend this law.\n  I don't know--I say very positively to my friend from Illinois and \neveryone who can hear me--I don't know if we can work anything out on \nthese amendments. I don't know. On the title I aspect of it, one \nSenator has six amendments. I am sure--he has always been a reasonable \nperson--he wouldn't have to offer that many. He has always been very \ngood about time agreements. But there are 10 or 12 amendments to title \nI. Then there are three we have with title II dealing with some form of \nimmunity.\n  But I repeat to my friend, Democrats believe the program should \ncontinue.\n\n[[Page S405]]\n\nWe are willing to say, OK, let it continue as it is now in effect. A \nlot of people don't like that. We are saying go ahead and let it \ncontinue. Certainly, there could be a significant majority of \nSenators--Democrats and Republicans--who will support that. And the \nissue is immunity.\n  I reverse the question and ask my friend from Illinois, should we not \nhave a nice debate on immunity and find out how the Congress feels \nabout what the President feels is important? That is how this country \nhas worked for all these years. So extend this and do it until we have \na new President--Democrat or Republican, man or woman, whoever it might \nbe--and in the meantime have a decision made as to whether there should \nbe retroactive immunity.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. I will, but let my friend from Illinois answer that \nquestion first.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I say to the majority leader, it appears \nnow that the Senate has to work its will. When the Judiciary Committee \nproposal was suggested, it didn't pass. When the Senator from Kentucky \noffered his cloture motion for his side, it didn't even have a majority \nvote. It had 48 votes in support, let alone the 60 that were required. \nI don't think we can expect to impose our will on this body. The Senate \nhas to work its will. We could have considered a lot of amendments in \nthe time we have lost so far in debate.\n  I say to the majority leader, how can we be held responsible for this \nlaw expiring if it is the Republicans who opposed extending the law? \nYou have offered repeatedly to let them extend the law. They have said \nno.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to my friend, let's extend it for any \nperiod of time, although I think that for each day it should be a \nlonger period of time.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Will the majority leader yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. I will after I have yielded to the Senator from North \nDakota. If anyone thinks we are going to come to an immediate agreement \non all these amendments, we have overused the term ``run the traps,'' \nbut the Republicans are not going to agree to all of the amendments the \nDemocrats want to offer. I will respond to my friend from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this is a complicated and certainly an \nimportant issue. It seems to me that it takes two sides to compromise. \nOne of the things I am curious about, as I listened to this and to the \nSenator from Kentucky, the minority leader said we are ready to move \nforward. He said he is disappointed in the delays. Isn't it the case, \nhowever, that last week, when the cloture motion was filed by the \nSenator from Kentucky, they decided at that point to block everything \nelse and stop everything from happening until this week? It seems to me \nthis delay has occurred because the other side has blocked the ability \nto offer amendments. Had we offered amendments, we would have probably \nbeen done with that at this point.\n  I say that there is not anyone in the Senate I am aware of--no one--\nwho doesn't believe we ought to extend this FISA law. Nobody is in that \nposition. Isn't that the reason for the delay and the reason we have \nnot moved forward--that we were blocked when the Senator from Kentucky \nfiled his cloture motion?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to my friend, you were at the meeting \nwith me just from 9 to shortly before the hour of 10 o'clock. A person \nwho is heavily involved in this legislation, the distinguished Senator \nfrom Wisconsin, Russ Feingold, said this legislation should be \nextended. He has, on many occasions, voiced his opinion on what is \nwrong with the way we passed this legislation in August, and he has \nbeen very strong in his comments about how this law could be improved. \nEvery Democrat in our caucus believes this law should be extended. I \ndon't like to speak for everybody, but Senator Feingold believes the \nlaw should be extended because it is the right thing to do. I cannot \nimagine why we have had all the difficulty we have had in extending \nthis law. On a number of occasions, we have said if the law expires, it \nis not our fault.\n  Now I am happy to yield to my friend from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank my good friend.\n  Mr. President, he indicated that the principal issue we are sparring \nover is the question of immunity from litigation for communications \ncompanies that cooperated in protecting our country. I am sure the \nmajority leader knows that yesterday my side offered to his side a vote \non the Dodd-Feingold amendment related to that issue, and a vote on the \nSpecter-Whitehouse amendment related to that issue, and that package \nwas rejected.\n  Mr. REID. Yes. I say to my friends, there are also other amendments. \nWe talked about title I, and there are a number of amendments. I think \nwe can reduce those on that side to maybe eight. They would all be \nshort time limits. They would also make sure the record reflects that \nwe believe they should be majority votes, not 60-vote margins.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Is the majority leader yielding the floor?\n  Mr. REID. Yes, I am happy to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, this is the kind of discussion, of \ncourse, that the Senate is witnessing that typically occurs between the \nmajority leader and myself and managers of the amendments. To sum it \nup, this is the kind of legislative finger-pointing that turns the \npublic off. But it is the way in which we go forward.\n  We had discussions yesterday about voting on the very issues the \nmajority leader just indicated are the key issues relating to this \nbill. Hopefully, during the course of the day, we will be able to come \ntogether and have the votes on the key amendments and move forward.\n  The President, of course, is not going to sign a lengthy extension or \na 30-day extension. Any hope that we will extend existing law without \ndealing with the retroactive liability issue is a waste of energy and \ntime. That isn't going to happen. So we are going to focus on this bill \nand, hopefully, find a way to go forward and let the Senate work its \nwill.\n  If the House chooses to leave tonight, I find that a highly \nirresponsible act--right before the expiration of this very important \nlaw. There isn't anything more important that we are doing right now, \nwith the possible exception of trying to figure out a way of going \nforward to stimulate our economy and prevent an extensive slowdown, \nthan getting the homeland protected.\n  A key ingredient in securing that protection, we know, is getting \nthis FISA law right and getting it passed--not some kind of short-term \nextension. The terrorists are not going to take a vacation for a few \nweeks or for 6 months or next year; they are going to be around for a \nwhile. We need to get this right and do it now, and today is a good day \nto get started.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if this law is so good and we are able to, \nin the words of the Republican leader, ``get new targets,'' why don't \nwe extend the law? I don't understand why we are not doing that.\n  I tell everyone again that it is legislatively impossible to do \nanything as it relates to this legislation, as far as passing it today. \nIt is impossible. We have a number of amendments that have to be \nhandled. It is going to take a matter of quite a few hours. We can do \nit in 1 day, I think. Remember, we have to have everybody agree to \nthat, all 100 Senators. Then the House has to agree to what we do or we \nhave to agree to what they do or work out a compromise in conference. \nThat cannot be done tonight. This is the last day we have to legislate. \nIf we don't legislate today, we are going to move on to something else \nin a few minutes, because there is no agreement on FISA--to extend it. \nI think that is unfortunate. Having said it so many times already--and \nI am tired of hearing myself say it--if the law expires, Democrats have \nno blame whatsoever.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, let me wrap it up for myself by saying \nthat we will be staying on this bill. We will not leave this bill.\n  Secondly, this is a bipartisan compromise that came out of the \nIntelligence Committee by a vote of 13 to 2, the Rockefeller-Bond \nbipartisan bill, which is supported by the President of the United \nStates. That is the Senate at its best--a bipartisan bill. The \nPresident is willing to sign it. Our effort\n\n[[Page S406]]\n\nhere is to get it to him for his signature. He awaits our action.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this bill is not a bipartisan bill. The bill \nthat came out of the Intelligence Committee is bipartisan, but \nunderstand it was concurrently referred to the Intelligence Committee \nand the Judiciary Committee. They both have jurisdiction over this \nlegislation. We cannot pick and choose what the President likes. We \nhave a situation here where the Judiciary Committee is entitled to be \nheard.

Mr. President, I wish to talk about the very important \nissue relating to foreign intelligence surveillance. I want to talk \nabout it not in the sense of who gets to be blamed if something \nhappens. I believe that on something of this magnitude, the American \npeople are pretty tired of the blame game: We would have done this, but \nif you didn't do that, we blame you; and if this happens, you get to \nblame us. I think the time of blame-casting has well passed. The fact \nis that the laws that grant the Government the authority to use the \nresources we have in order to stay informed of what our enemies are \nseeking to do to us are outdated and need to be modernized and put up \nto date with our current technology. We are fighting a modern war \nagainst a modern enemy. The tools we have to fight that war are out of \ndate. One of the only ways we are able to expose and stop terrorist \nplots before they unfold is through the provisions accorded under FISA.\n  Some of my colleagues have expressed an understandable concern about \nthe current FISA reauthorization, and whether it would improperly \ninvade the civil liberties of our citizens. After 2 years of public \ndebate on the broad issues of FISA, and after reviewing the current \nlegislation, I believe those concerns are unwarranted.\n  This issue transcends the stance of either political party or any \npartisan interest. Those who oppose this are sincere in their concern; \nthey just happen to be wrong. Needless hurdles will be created for our \nGovernment in the obtaining and utilizing of valuable intelligence to \nkeep America safe. So I want to see us address this issue head on and \ncome together and send the President a bill that he can and will sign.\n  The President spoke about this last night in his State of the Union \nMessage. He wants to get this matter resolved, and he wants a bill on \nhis desk. We owe it to the military and the intelligence community to \nequip them with the tools they need to protect our citizens and carry \nout their duties effectively.\n  Throughout our history, Americans have always been concerned about \nthe proper balance between security and freedom. Those concerned about \nthe power of Government and trampling on the rights of free citizens \nare right to insist on maintaining the individual liberties granted to \nus by the Constitution, especially during a time of crisis. The bill we \nare considering is precisely concerned with maintaining and keeping a \nproper balance of those protections.\n  This is a bipartisan bill. It was reported out of the Intelligence \nCommittee by a vote of 13 to 2. It is a modern update that is designed \nto keep our technological edge and to effectively implement the goals \nof the original FISA law passed in 1978. This bill is the product of \nthe careful consideration of Members of both sides of the aisle on the \nIntelligence Committee--those best informed about these matters, who \nhave the most knowledge about the means and methods by which we gather \nintelligence. Those Members recognize a need to modernize the way our \nintelligence is collected and the need to share information that is \nvital to terrorist communications, whether these communications be on a \ncell phone, by e-mail, or in person. This bill is for the American \nintelligence services to be able to timely develop intelligence without \nhaving to wait for a court order. In other words, if a terrorist group \nsuch as al-Qaida calls a sleeper cell within our borders, this would \nensure that our Government can protect our citizens, the specific \nprocedure for surveillance, and it ensures that the independent FISA \nCourt is fully informed of every step in the process.\n  The bill also has a provision to protect those who have assisted us \nand the intelligence community in gathering information that was \nabsolutely vital to our national security. Fortunately, we have had \nfull cooperation from a number of telecommunications companies in \nproviding our intelligence officials with accessing and obtaining \ninformation from foreign terrorists.\n  As we look at this issue--and the majority leader says this issue is \nthe big sticking point, so let me talk about that specifically, that \nthis retroactive immunity for telecommunications companies allows bad \nactors to get off the hook--who is it we are giving immunity to and why \nshould it be retroactive? This has already been noted a number of \ntimes, but I think it bears repeating.\n  Retroactive immunity is necessary not only to protect companies that \ncooperated in good faith at the request of our President during the \ntime of the most serious domestic crisis our country has ever faced, \nbut it was done to ensure our national secrets regarding intelligence \nmethods remained classified and are not disclosed in public through the \ncivil court process. In other words, it is not just about providing \nimmunity to those who helped at the time it was needed, but it is also \nto ensure that as we go forward, we are not going to have an O.J. \nSimpson-type trial, with television cameras blaring with information \nbeing disclosed. We know things do not keep. We know our enemies are \ncapable of getting the information because it will be in the New York \nTimes. The fact is, we want to keep our methods and sources secret and \nconfidential, and this is a very important part of this immunity idea.\n  If you want accountability for the executive branch, we have a \nconstitutional system of checks and balances, and leaving aside the \nPresident's authority under article II, we are exercising congressional \noversight in passing S. 2248, and we, along with the FISA Court, are \ncertainly going to be able to pay close attention to how we select \nintelligence going forward.\n  As far as letting bad actors off the hook is concerned, S. 2248 \nprovides retroactive immunity from civil litigation if a series of \nconditions are met. The assistance was provided in connection with \nintelligence activity authorized by the President between September 11, \n2001, and January 17, 2007, and was designed to detect or prevent \nterrorist attacks against the United States.\n  What is wrong with that? The assistance was also to be provided in \nresponse to a written request, a directive from the Attorney General or \nother intelligence community head indicating the activity had been \nauthorized by the President and determined to be legal.\n  To me, it is a good idea to give these folks the kind of immunity \nthat will allow them to continue to cooperate, that will say to them: \nThe next time there is a vital emergency where your cooperation is \nneeded, we didn't stick you with the bill, we didn't allow the courts \nto go wild. We protected you because you protected America. To me, that \nseems only fair and only right.\n  I hope we can get through the partisan morass that always seems to \nentangle us. I hope we can find a way we can pull together something of \nthis magnitude and importance, which is about the national security of \nour country--it is about the intelligence needs of our intelligence \ncommunity--and that we can come together in a timely fashion, craft \nthis bill, take the bill the Senate Intelligence Committee passed on a \nbipartisan 13-to-2 vote, put\n\n[[Page S407]]\n\nit up for a vote, let's take the amendments that are available, move it \nforward, get a vote, and get a bill to the President that he can sign.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, last night the President spoke to the \nNation in his State of the Union Address. It is one of the great \ntraditions of American Government. One of the most interesting parts of \nthis spectator sport is to watch and see who stands up on which issue \nwhen the President talks or who is sitting by whom. It is well watched \nacross our country, and it is a sign of respect to the Presidency as an \ninstitution.\n  The President was in a good mood. It was his eighth such address. He \nwas reflective, but he was decisive. He looked ahead. He talked about \nthe issues facing our country. He did his job, and he challenged us to \ndo ours.\n  The President devoted a good deal of time to the progress of the war \nin Iraq, and we devoted a good deal of time today to making sure we \nhave a strong system of intelligence to protect ourselves from \nterrorists. So I wish to comment on what the President talked about at \nhome, because a great deal of what President Bush said last night was \nthat as important as our role is in the world, as important as the \nlong-term fight against terrorism is, we have work to do at home, and \nwe need to roll up our sleeves and get busy.\n  This is a Presidential year. Many of the pundits are saying, some \npoliticians even: The Congress will get nothing done. We Republicans \nbelieve there is no excuse for taking a year off, given the number of \nserious issues facing our country. Let me mention a few the President \ndiscussed last night.\n  To begin with, the American economy. The President acknowledged that \nas strong as our economy is, 52 quarters of growing jobs, it has taken \na downward turn, and we need to take appropriate action to help it \ncontinue to produce more jobs. That means steps that are temporary, \ntargeted, and that grow the economy and not the Government.\n\n  The President has agreed with the Speaker of the House and the \nRepublican leader of the House on a simple package that is aimed to do \nthat: rebates for individuals, most of whom pay taxes, and incentives \nto small businesses to create new jobs. It is a simple idea.\n  Speaking as one Senator, I do not believe we can afford to let this \neconomic growth package, which should pass the House today, become a \nChristmas tree in the Senate for everyone's favorite idea for spending \ntaxpayers' dollars.\n  I have some ideas. I think every Member of the Senate has some ideas. \nBut maybe we should recognize the American people would like to see us \nact and act promptly and act decisively.\n  Someone has said the Senate wishes to speak on the issue. I know very \nwell none of us is guilty, usually, of having an unexpressed thought. \nWe love to speak. But one way for us to speak is to say to the House of \nRepresentatives: Madam Speaker, and to the House itself, we agree with \nyou. We think your package is simple, temporary, targeted, and a good \nidea. And to the President: Mr. President, each of us might have \nwritten the package a little differently, but we agree with you and we \nare ready to pass it before the end of next week.\n  I would like to write it differently, but I like the idea that it \ngoes mostly to taxpayers, that it is family friendly, that it gives \nincentives to small business, and that it temporarily helps with \nhousing.\n  I believe it is important for our Government, particularly at this \nmoment, to send a strong message that we will take the action \nappropriate to keep the economy strong and that we are capable of \nfunctioning as a Government and working in bipartisan ways to deal with \nreal issues.\n  The American people are tired of petty politics. They are tired of \nplaypen politics on the Senate floor. They do not believe they elected \nus to stick our fingers in the eyes of the Democrats or the Democrats \nto stick their fingers in our eyes. We have a good example of our \nleadership working together with the President, and as one Senator, my \nrecommendation is we support what the President and the House of \nRepresentatives is about to do.\n  The President said we should get to work this year to make sure every \nAmerican can have access to health care insurance. At our Republican \nconference last week, that was the first item on our agenda, and I \nbelieve it is fair for me to say virtually every single Republican \nSenator believes every American should be insured and is ready to go to \nwork this year to help make that possible.\n  The President talked about his plan, which he talked about last year, \nto redo our Tax Code so dollars would be available to American families \nto buy at least a basic health care policy that they wouldn't lose when \nthey change jobs.\n  We have had a number of Senators on this side--Senator Burr, Senator \nCorker, Senator Coburn, for example, Senator Bennett who has authored a \nbill with Senator Wyden, which has significant bipartisan support. We \nare all ready to go to work this year. We believe we should start this \nyear to help make sure every American is insured.\n  Runaway Federal spending. The President talked about controlling \nentitlement spending. This is an issue that is beginning to get the \ncountry's attention, and it should have the country's attention. It \ncertainly has mine.\n  What do we mean by entitlement spending? We mean 40 percent of the \nbudget is Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, and it goes up \nautomatically every year. Over the next 10 years, the annual growth of \nSocial Security is predicted to be about 6 percent, according to the \nCongressional Budget Office, Medicare about 7.2 percent, Medicaid about \n8 percent. Entitlement spending and interest on the debt is 60 percent \nof every dollar we spend. Another 20 percent is defense, the war and \nother necessary actions to defend ourselves, and 19 percent is \neverything else.\n  The ``everything else'' was flat last year. The Congressional Budget \nOffice says the ``everything else''--that is, parks and roads and many \nof the items Americans believe Government ought to be doing--that is \ngoing to go up about 2 percent annually over the next 10 years, \naccording to the Congressional Budget Office. Our defense goes up 3 \npercent annually, and entitlement spending goes up 7 or 8 percent.\n  Senator Gregg and Senator Bond have pointed out to us--they are the \nheads of our Budget Committee--that we pretty soon are going to be \nfaced with an absolutely impossible situation that will require massive \ncuts in benefits, massive tax increases that the net worth even of this \ngreat country will not be able to pay, and that every year we wait, we \nrisk another problem. The President said do something about it. He \nchallenged us to do it, and Senator Gregg and Senator Bond have a \nproposal to do that. We should act on it this year.\n  That is not all there is to holding down spending. The President \nmentioned earmarks. There are too many earmarks. They are not as \ntransparent as they ought to be. That is a smaller part of the budget. \nIt is our constitutional responsibility to deal with earmarks, but we \nshould do that ourselves. We should begin that this year.\n  We could pass a 2-year budget plan, such as Senator Domenici and \nSenator Lieberman and Senator Feingold at various times have proposed, \nand Senator Sessions, Senator Isakson. That would give us oversight to \nrepeal rules and regulations every other year. So there are three ways \nto get a handle on Federal spending.\n\n  Senator Hutchison and Senator Bingaman have been leaders, as well as \nothers here, on keeping good jobs from going overseas. We passed the \nAmerica COMPETES Act last year, and the President challenged us to fund \nit this year. He is right about that.\n  Finally, President Bush mentioned something that is close to my \nheart. He called it the Pell grants for kids. I remember being in a \nvisit with him a couple years ago, and he said to me: We have to do \nsomething about inner-city children who cannot afford to go to\n\n[[Page S408]]\n\ngood schools. Why don't we have Pell grants for kids? I said: Mr. \nPresident, I had a hearing on that idea last month. He looked at me and \nsaid: I thought it was my idea. I said: Mr. President, it is your idea. \nAny idea the President has is his idea, but he had it before anyone \nsuggested it to him.\n  The idea is very simple. We take this brilliant idea that Congress \nhas invented over the last 50 years of giving money directly to college \nstudents which they can spend at any institution of education of their \nchoice--public, private, nonprofit, Catholic, Jewish, the University of \nTennessee, Notre Dame, National Auto Diesel College. As long as it is \naccredited, they can go there, and it especially helps those with less \nmoney. Let's try that with the poorest children.\n  Sixteen years ago, when I was Education Secretary, the first \nPresident Bush proposed a GI bill for kids. Much the same idea. It was \nthe largest provision in his budget, half a billion dollars that year, \nto give poor kids access to some of the same educational opportunities \nothers had.\n  I proposed, in a Pell grants for kids version, that we give every \nchild, the middle- and low-income children--that is 60 percent of them \nall $500 for afterschool programs or other programs. The President has \nadvanced the idea.\n  President Bush has painted a strong agenda for America this year. He \nhas said let's give a boost to the economy, let's begin to give every \nAmerican health insurance, let's control entitlement spending, let's \nfund programs to keep good jobs here, and let's give poor children an \nopportunity to go to more of the better schools. He has challenged us \nto go to work. We are ready to go to work. We are ready to get results, \nwhich means working across the aisle in a bipartisan way.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, may I inquire how much time remains on our \nside?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is 11 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I appreciate that, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/29/senate-section/article/S408-1", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S408-S409]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             BIPARTISANSHIP\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, when I came to Washington about 5 years \nago, a colleague of mine said: Welcome to Washington, DC. It is about 8 \nsquare miles of logic-free environment, where perception is reality.\n  I always chuckled when he would say that, and I have repeated it \nmyself a few times to audiences back home in Texas because I think it, \nunfortunately, has a grain of truth to it. One reason I think people \nchuckle at that, and maybe groan a little bit inside when Washington is \ndescribed that way, is because we send out such contradictory messages \nat the same time.\n  The Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Republican \nleader, Mr. Boehner, and the President of the United States have come \ntogether and said: We have come up with a bipartisan package to \nstimulate our economy; to make sure, if it is possible, that we avoid a \nrecession that puts many Americans out of work and hurts them in an \neconomic and personal way.\n  That was a very welcome message that I heard and the public heard, \nand I think it was a hopeful one. I, for one, hoped it would signal \nsome kind of new period of cooperation in light of the fact that, \nfrankly, what we had been doing was not working very well, as evidenced \nby one of the historic lows in congressional approval ratings as a \nresult of the dysfunction in the Senate, and Congress as a whole, last \nyear.\n  By that I mean you will recall we didn't pass but 1 of the 12 \nappropriations bills on a timely basis by the end of the fiscal year \nlast year, so we had to roll everything into a big Omnibus \nappropriations bill. Some say ``ominous'' appropriations bill, and I \nthink that is an apt description. It was chock full of earmarks and \nthings that people hadn't had adequate time to scrutinize, much less to \ndebate and shine the sunlight of public scrutiny on. So I would hope we \nwould learn from the dysfunction of last year and we would look to the \nexample of bipartisan cooperation as evidenced by the House of \nRepresentatives and the White House on the economic stimulus.\n  Of course, it wasn't limited just to appropriations last year. We saw \nbasically a standstill, after 36 votes on Iraq, on nonbinding \nresolutions calling for unilateral withdrawal. Finally, we passed, at \nthe very end of last year, a $70 billion emergency appropriations so \nthat our troops in Afghanistan and Iraq would get the support we owe \nthem as a moral obligation, as a sign of our commitment to support the \ntroops, to protect our national security interests. But it took us a \nlong time and a lot of hot air to finally get there.\n  Then, of course, there was the alternative minimum tax, which, true \nto form, people said: Well, let's tax the rich. Originally, it was \ndesigned to tax 155 taxpayers. Last year, it affected 6 million people. \nAnd if we hadn't acted, which we finally did at the end of last year, \nit would have affected 23 million middle American taxpayers. Thank \ngoodness we were finally able to get the work done, that was our \nresponsibility, but not, frankly, in good form last year.\n  So it is with some hope that we find ourselves learning from that \nexperience last year and the low approval ratings that they brought. My \nhope was this early sign of bipartisan cooperation on the economic \nstimulus package would sort of start a new trend. Unfortunately, on a \nmatter that really is fundamental to our responsibility--I think our \nfirst responsibility: to keep America and Americans safe--we find \nourselves falling back into the old bad habits of dysfunction once \nagain.\n  What I mean by that is, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act is \nvital to our national security. It is vital that we continue to be able \nto listen to foreign terrorists who are communicating with each other, \nplotting and planning future terrorist attacks on our homeland and on \nour troops in Iraq and Afghanistan and around the world. Rather than \npass legislation that would address that, we passed a patch in October \nfor 6 months, which expired in December. So we passed another 1-month \nextension. And now we find ourselves with our backs up against the wall \nwith this Protect America Act extension expiring February 1. And I was \ndiscouraged to hear the majority leader say this morning that it was \nimpossible to pass a reauthorization of the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Act.\n  What he suggested is that we need another patch for 1 month, or a \nshort period of time, without addressing the primary issues that need \nto be voted on. The Senator from Florida, Mr. Martinez, talked about \nthe civil liability immunity for the telecoms that may have cooperated \nwith the United States Government at the highest levels based on a \nrequest from the President of the United States, the Commander in \nChief, during a time of war, and the certification by the Attorney \nGeneral that what they were being asked to do was legal and, in fact, \nnecessary for us to protect ourselves against another attack, such as \nthe one we suffered in Washington and in New York on September 11, \n2001.\n  We know if this law expires without our addressing all aspects of the \nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Act, our intelligence officials will \nbe literally blind and deaf to the important intelligence that will \nallow us to detect and deter future attacks against American citizens. \nIn fact, last summer the Director of National Intelligence told us we \nwere missing about two-thirds of the communications between foreign \nterrorists that were necessary to protect our country. That is why we \npassed the Protect America Act. So why in the world we would get bogged \ndown in the same sort of bickering and partisan divide rather than come \ntogether to solve this in a bipartisan fashion, frankly, escapes me.\n  As was pointed out earlier, this very same legislation passed in the \nIntelligence Committee by a vote of 13 to 2. That is a bipartisan \nsupermajority, sponsored by the chairman, the Democrat, Senator \nRockefeller, and the vice chairman, Senator Bond, a Republican. So with \nthat kind of bipartisan support for a product that the Director of \nNational Intelligence and the leadership of our defense community tell \nus they need in order to continue to protect America against attacks, \nwhy is it impossible for us to pass this legislation? I don't know of \nany other explanation than just downright stubbornness. And, frankly, \nit is the kind that represents a sort of reminder of the bad habits of \nthe past that I had hoped we would have learned from and change.\n\n[[Page S409]]\n\n  Frankly, if the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over \nand over again and expecting a different outcome, what is happening on \nFISA is insane because we are resorting to the same old bad habits and \nnot reaching out and solving this problem, which is very real and very \nurgent.\n  Let me say a word about the economy. I mentioned the economic \nstimulus package that was negotiated between the Democrat Speaker of \nthe House and the Republican leader and the representative of the \nPresident, Secretary Paulson. I find myself in agreement with the \nremarks made earlier by Mr. Alexander, the Senator from Tennessee. \nWhile there are parts of that agreement that I, frankly, don't like all \nthat much, given the nature of the legislative process, I think it \nrepresents a compromise. And looking at some of the proposals coming \nout of the Senate, to add additional costly programs to grow the size \nof Government, which invariably will either raise taxes or will send \nthe IOU down to our children and grandchildren to pay by way of \nexpanding the deficit, I am beginning to think the bipartisan package \nout of the House of Representatives represents a better alternative \nthan I have seen so far discussed here in the Senate.\n  The last thing we should be doing is using this national challenge to \nour economy--a great risk of seeing people put out of work and seeing \nthem suffer economically--and taking chances on growing the size of \nGovernment or raising taxes or passing the debt down to our children by \ngrowing the size of Government and expanding the size of this package \nin order to satisfy an individual or group of Senators' desire to add \npet projects on to that stimulus package. So I hope we will act in a \nbipartisan fashion to support the House-negotiated legislation, a \nbipartisan package, just like the Intelligence Committee product is a \nbipartisan package, and just like we acted at the end of last year, \nafter a lot of dilly-dallying and a lot of delay, to finally pass, in a \nbipartisan way, legislation that appropriated emergency funding for our \ntroops, that protected middle-class taxpayers from a tax they were \nnever intended to pay in the first place--the alternative minimum tax--\nand the other business that we finally did after so many months of \ndelay at the end of last year.\n  My hope, Mr. President, is that we will not punish those who \ncooperate with the United States Government in a time of war to help us \nlisten to the conversations of foreign terrorists by refusing to pass \nthis important piece of legislation because it sends the wrong message \nthat if you don't cooperate, you can basically make America blind and \ndeaf to our enemies. That is a danger to all of us.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I have listened with great interest this \nmorning. It has been fascinating for me to see a party block access to \nmaking progress in the Congress and then several days later come and \ncomplain that progress hasn't been made. That is a Byzantine approach \nto legislating.\n  I do agree, however, that we don't want bad habits to exist here. And \neven though I am honored to serve in this place, I have often called \nthis the place of 100 bad habits, which would include myself, of \ncourse. It is hard to get things done in this place, but I am not \nsuggesting one side or the other side is all wrong.\n  I am reminded of Ogden Nash's poem:\n\n       He drinks because she scolds, he thinks. She scolds because \n     he drinks, she thinks. Neither will admit what is really \n     true: He is a drunk; she is a shrew.\n\n  I understand both sides bear responsibility for difficulty from time \nto time, but let me say this: On this issue of FISA, it strains \ncredibility for a party that says: You may not move; we will block you. \nWe insist that we get 60 votes on every amendment. Every amendment has \nto have 60 votes, otherwise we filibuster. If that is the case, we \ndon't make progress. And I don't think you can say: Well, we are going \nto object to progress, and then we will complain that progress isn't \nmade. That makes no sense to me.\n  I don't know of anybody in this Chamber who doesn't want the FISA \namendments to be extended and resolved. Let's do that and get it done. \nLet's have a little cooperation. But cooperation takes two parties, and \nit is long past the time to do that. As I have said, we have had a lot \nof bad habits in this legislation.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, would the Senator entertain a question?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Let me ask unanimous consent that my time be extended, \nhowever, for the minute or so the Senator wishes to inquire.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BOND. I would just ask my good friend if he doesn't agree the \nIntelligence Committee bills have to pass with 60 votes? I believe the \nProtect America Act passed with 60 votes. The leader said in December \nit made sense to have all votes at 60-vote margins, and would he not \nexpect that the Senate Intelligence Committee bill, which I support, \nwill have to get 60 votes? And if so, does it not make sense to have 60 \nvotes to pass all amendments?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, it certainly does not make sense. In fact, \nexactly the opposite. That is nonsense, to bring a bill to the floor \nand say: Look, regular order would be to bring up amendments. If a \nmajority of the Senators agree with them, those amendments are \napproved. But we don't like regular order. Let's decide every amendment \nthat shall be brought up shall have to have 60 votes. Why? Because if \nnot, they will filibuster every amendment and then complain nothing is \ngetting done. No, it does not make sense, I would say to my friend.\n  Now, I didn't come to talk about that, but let me talk a moment about \nthis issue of the economy. This is a discussion about starting the \nengine, or getting the engine working on this ship of state so that we \nmove the country forward. It is about jobs and expanding opportunities \nfor the American people because when the economy contracts, people run \ninto trouble.\n  They are the ones who get laid off, the folks who are working in \nplants and working at the bottom for minimum wage. They are the ones \nwho lose ground during an economic contraction.\n  Well, it used to be on the old automobiles, when you started an \nengine, you had to crank it. And then we went from a crank to a \nstarter, so you push a button or turn a key. Well, some people think \nour economy is simple as that. It is not, of course. A large component \nof our economy is people's confidence. If they are confident in the \nfuture, they do the things that represent that confidence--they make \nthat purchase, they buy a washer and dryer if they need it, they buy a \ncar, they take a trip. In doing so, because they are confident about \nthe future, they expand the economy. If they lack confidence in the \nfuture, they do exactly the opposite--they defer the purchase of that \npiece of equipment for their home, they defer the purchase of the car, \nthey defer the trip--and the economy contracts.\n  We have a problem with this economy for a lot of reasons. I have \ndescribed some of them on the floor of the Senate recently. But the \nFederal Reserve Board recognized that problem and took a very bold \naction--three-quarters of a percent interest rate cut--and likely will \ndo more in the next couple of days. The impression is that we also \nshould do something called a stimulus package; that is, stimulus with \nrespect to fiscal policy. I do not object to that. In fact, I think we \nprobably have to do that because a whole lot of what is going on in the \nmarket these days is about psychology.\n  I have indicated this before. I have called the field of economics \npsychology pumped up by helium. I think that is a pretty adequate \ndescription of what it is. People think it is science. It is not. It is \na circumstance in which we know very little about the way this economy \nworks. We do have more stabilizers in the economy than we did decades \nago, so we have been able to even out a bit some of the recessions and \nthe downturns. All of that has been helpful. We may be in a recession \nnow. No one knows. We probably will not know that until we see it in \nthe rearview mirror. But if we do a stimulus package on fiscal policy--\nand I think that is a reasonable thing to do--I do\n\n[[Page S410]]\n\nnot think it is going to have a significant impact on the economy. \nSuggesting 1 percent of our GDP as a stimulus--it is not going to have \na dramatic impact. But psychologically, I think we must do a stimulus.\n  Let me say that I do think what the Finance Committee chairman is \ntalking about makes a lot of sense. If you are going to do a stimulus \npackage and you are going to provide some kind of rebate, make sure you \ninclude senior citizens, many of whom are living on lower incomes. They \nare the ones who are going to spend it. They are the ones who are going \nto contribute to additional purchasing power in the economy. So you \nshould not leave out the millions of senior citizens if you are going \nto do a stimulus package. I support including senior citizens in that \nstimulus package.\n  You know, the President and a couple of my colleagues just said: \nWell, you cannot change it. The House did it. The President wants it. \nYou cannot change it. They come here, and they always suggest that this \nis like a loose thread on a cheap sweater: you pull the head of the \nthread, and the arms fall off. That is not the case at all.\n  The House did its version of a stimulus package. We should do ours. \nWe have some better ideas. But we ought to get it done quickly, and we \nought to resolve it with the House and send it to the President. \nExtending unemployment benefits is something we always do in an \neconomic downturn, and we should do it again, in my judgment.\n  But let me say that in a stimulus package that is brought to the \nfloor of the Senate that does not have a cap on who is going to get the \nrebates makes no sense at all. And there is talk about that, that we \nwill get a stimulus package and have no cap on the rebate. We are going \nto send Bill Gates a $500 check to see if we can stimulate the economy \na little bit. That makes no sense. You have to have a cap. This ought \nto go to middle income and lower income families. They are ones who \nwill spend it and the ones who will be able to give a jump-start to \nthis economy, to the extent the stimulus package actually does that. \nBut as I said, psychologically I think we have a responsibility to use \nfiscal policy to do something in this general direction.\n  Now, the Senator from Connecticut just came to the floor, and he has \nbeen working on something I am very interested in; that is, \ninfrastructure investment. If we just do a short-term stimulus of 1 \npercent of the economy and that is all, we are not going to give this \neconomy the kind of boost or give the investment to this country that \nit needs. We need a second step, and the second step ought to be the \nbig step, and we ought to take a look at what is going on in the \ninfrastructure of this country.\n  My colleague has a bill, the Dodd-Hagel bill, that I think makes a \nlot of sense. We had a meeting on that on Friday, a rather lengthy \nmeeting with a lot of people. Here is the situation.\n  Infrastructure investment is job creating. When you invest in \ninfrastructure, you create jobs and you create a better country. Fly \ninto Bagram Air Base and then get in a vehicle, drive to Kabul, take a \nlook at the road, and ask yourself about infrastructure in a country \nsuch as Afghanistan. Fly into Tegucigalpa and then drive in a car to \nJuticalpa in Honduras, take a look at the road, and ask yourself about \ninfrastructure investment. Or go to Haiti and land at Port-au-Prince, \ntravel across the island to Jacmel, and consider for a moment what \ninfrastructure means to a country. The fact is, you fly over Nicaragua \nand look down, and you do not see many roads because they do not have \nmuch of an infrastructure.\n  Then fly from any of those countries back to our country, come into \nan airport, get in a vehicle and drive down the road, and then think \nabout infrastructure and what we have built over a long period of time \nthat makes us proud of this country and allows this country to expand \nand grow and create opportunity. Then take a look at what has happened \nrecently. This country stopped investing in infrastructure in any \nsignificant way. Our infrastructure is crumbling, in desperate \ndisrepair. Big bridges fall down, and highways are crumbling. The fact \nis, we have schools that are in shameful condition in this country, \nwater programs that are desperately needed for water treatment that are \nwaiting for money to do it.\n\n  Now, when the Federal Government buys this highlighter pen for me--at \nmy office, we have a supply of highlighter pens--this is expensed. Now, \nanybody who takes accounting understands you expense something on day \none. But the fact is, when we spend $200 million building a piece of \nhighway or invest $500 million in an airport, we expense that as well. \nNo other enterprise that I am aware of in this country--none--will do \nwhat the Federal Government does and say: When you spend on \ninfrastructure something that will last 50 and 100 years for this \ncountry, you have to expense it on the first day. We need a capital \nbudget. We need an infrastructure investment bank. We need a whole \nseries of things that represents a second step so that we can in the \nlonger term invest in and expand opportunities in this country through \ninfrastructure investment.\n  It is about jobs; it is about having pride in your country; it is \nabout investing in your country in the kinds of things that allow \neconomic progress. I don't want people to come out here and say: Let's \ndo this stimulus and, boy, that will fix things. This is putting a \nlittle patch on something here; it is not going to fix things. It is \nsomething we should do, but if we do not do something much bolder, do \nsomething with much greater consequence in the longer term, that \ninvests in this country's future, we will have missed a very \nsubstantial opportunity.\n  In the New York Times this morning, there is an op-ed piece by Bob \nHerbert that talks about the catastrophe in New Orleans. He talks about \nthe bridge collapse in Minneapolis, the underground steam pipe in \nmidtown Manhattan that blows up, the manhole cover that is blown out of \nthe streets here in Washington, DC. He talks about South Carolina, \nwhere there is a long stretch of grievously neglected rural schools \nthat has been dubbed ``the corridor of shame.'' You know, I have been \nin those kinds of schools. I have been in schools where kids were going \nto school in parts of the building that were condemned that were 100 \nyears old, where sewer gas was coming up back through some of the rooms \nand they could no longer use those rooms. We have all seen those \nthings. This country has to do better. And we can do better if we put \ntogether the kinds of infrastructure investment banks and the capital \nbudget, and advance this country's interests by building this country.\n  I want to make one final point. We were told this morning that the \nPresident is going to ask for another $70 billion for Iraq and \nAfghanistan. That is on top of the $196 billion he asked for last year \nin this fiscal year that we are in now. That is $16 billion a month, $4 \nbillion a week. He wants another $70 billion. That will take us well \nover two-thirds of a trillion dollars. I ask the question: Is it not \ntime we started investing some at home? It is not time we started \ntaking care of things here at home? The sky is the limit for these \nkinds of investments.\n  This morning, my colleagues were talking about fiscal responsibility. \nNot one penny of the war costs has been paid for. The President has \ninsisted that we send soldiers to war and we spend this money and \ncharge it to future generations. They will fight the war and come back \nand inherit this debt. That is not fiscally responsible either. How \nabout suggesting there is a priority here at home for investing in this \ncountry, expanding opportunity in this country, and taking care of \nthings that have been too long neglected?\n  So I wanted to say that in the context of this discussion we will \nhave about the stimulus program. It is important, but what is much more \nimportant is for ourselves to have a longer view of investing in this \ncountry and expanding opportunity in this country by making this the \nkind of place we are proud of.\n  The folks who came before us did that. They had some real vision. \nDwight Eisenhower said: Let's build an interstate from coast to coast. \nThat would not happen under some of the folks who exist in this Chamber \nthese days. It just would not. But what a boon to this country, to \nconnect America with interstate highways. So we can do a lot better, \nand must if we are interested in the long-term well-being of this \ncountry.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Connecticut.\n\n[[Page S411]]\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, first of all, let me thank my colleague, \nSenator Dorgan, for his statement this morning. I wish to follow with \nvery similar remarks. He and I have been good friends for a long time \nand have worked together on a lot of issues over the years. I just want \nto underscore what he said this morning about the importance of the \nstimulus package and the importance of additional ideas that will allow \nus to get moving again.\n  I am grateful to hear about the article this morning that was very \ngracious in talking about the bill that Senator Chuck Hagel and I have \nworked on, along with others, including former Senators Warren Rudman \nand Bob Kerrey, the Center for Strategic and International Studies, \nJohn Hamry, Felix Rohatyn, Bernard Schwartz and other leaders. I am \ndelighted that the Chamber of Commerce as well as major labor unions \nhave endorsed this bill which we spent 2\\1/2\\ years putting together, \nincluding spending a lot of time with people in the investment \ncommunity about ways in which we can attract private capital to public \ninfrastructure. So I appreciate immensely Senator Dorgan hosting the \nmeeting last Friday that brought a lot of these people together.\n  Our plan here, I say to him, is to talk with our leaders, the \nDemocratic leader as well as, I hope, Senator McConnell, the Republican \nleader. This ought to be a major issue. If we can bring the Chamber of \nCommerce and organized labor together around a bill, this is a vehicle \nwhich ought to deserve the attention of this body.\n  I know there is a growing interest in the House as well about it for \nall of the reasons Senator Dorgan has mentioned. The economic \nimplications are huge, and the necessity grows by the hour. But it even \ngoes beyond economic terms because there is symbolism in a nation \nbuilding and working.\n  In talking to Bob Herbert yesterday, I mentioned that even during the \nCivil War, President Lincoln insisted that the work on the Capitol, the \nvery building which we are in here this morning, would continue; that \nit was important, despite that there were obvious demands to provide \nthe resources to prevail in the great conflict between North and South, \nthat the country see that this project, to build a national capitol \nrepresenting the entire country, would go forward. Obviously, there \nwere jobs that were important in that construction. But more important \nthan the jobs, even, was the symbolism of a nation at work.\n\n  So I am looking forward to the opportunity to take this idea of a \nmajor infrastructure proposal and hopefully attract some broad-based \nattention to it.\n  My colleague Ron Wyden from Oregon has a proposal as well. We are \nhoping to bring them together. He has a little different perspective \nbut one that I think can be added to our proposal.\n  I wish to focus my talk this morning about the stimulus package and \neconomic issues. I know the FISA bill is going to come up again. I have \nsome strong feelings, as my colleagues know, about the retroactive \nimmunity in that bill. But I was stunned last evening as I sat and \nlistened to the State of the Union. I have been to a lot of them over \nthe years. Last night, when the Presiding Officer and I walked he asked \nme how many. When I said the number, it stunned me in a way, how many I \nhave been involved in. I was elected to the House in 1974 and went to \nmy first one in January of 1975, with Gerald Ford giving his State of \nthe Union. I have been to every one since. I have not missed one over \nthe last three decades.\n  There have been some great ones and others less than great. Last \nevening, put aside whether you like the rhetoric or not, what surprised \nme is that here we are in a nation where, by everyone's estimation, we \nare either in a recession or about to enter one, we have economic data \nthat indicate this country is in deeper trouble economically than we \nhave been in in years, and there was hardly any reference to our \neconomic problems whatsoever other than a paragraph or so about a \nstimulus package.\n  So the elephant in the room, if you do not mind using that animal \nanalogy, the elephant in the room in the State of the Union was, of \ncourse, the state of the union is in tough shape economically. We are \nin desperate shape in many ways.\n  What is beyond ironic is that we would have a President of the United \nStates talking about the condition of our union, and here is a major \nproblem that is the subject of headlines every day across the Nation, \nand there are hardly any references to it at all. So we were gathered \nlast evening to talk about where we are and what we need to do in the \ncoming days, and there is hardly a passing reference to the economic \ncondition our country is in.\n  The President called this a period of ``economic uncertainty.'' I \nthink those were the words he used. While I agree we are certainly in \nan uncertain period, to put it mildly, what we know with some certainty \nis that the current economic situation is more than merely a slowdown \nor a downturn; it is even more than a mere recession or near recession. \nInstead, I think it is a crisis of confidence among consumers and \ninvestors. Consumers are fearful of borrowing and spending, investors \nare fearful of lending. Financial transactions which generate new \nbusinesses and new jobs are shrinking in number and size by the hour in \nthis country.\n  The incoming economic data shows how serious this problem is. \nYesterday the Commerce Department reported that the sale of new homes \nfell again in December, reaching a 12-year low. Retail sales were down \nand unemployment was up significantly in December. Credit card \ndelinquencies are on the rise, as consumers find themselves \nincreasingly unable to tap the equity in their homes to help pay down \ncredit card and other bills. Lastly, inflation increased by 4.1 percent \nlast year, the largest increase in 17 years. This is what the President \ncalled a period of ``economic uncertainty.''\n  You have record numbers and statistics pointing to the difficulty our \nNation is in economically, and we hardly heard any mention of it at all \nlast night. The inflation that we are experiencing, is driven mainly by \nthe rising cost of energy--oil is at $100 a barrel--and there was \nhardly a reference to that last evening. It costs $100 for a barrel of \noil, and I do not recall a word being spoken, except about energy \nindependence and to try to get there.\n  Food and health care costs have gone up as well. Industrial \nproduction is falling. And we have been hemorrhaging jobs in the \nmanufacturing sector. Our economy is clearly facing more than \nuncertainty; it is facing significant challenges to our Nation's future \neconomic growth and prosperity.\n  The most important step we could take right now is, of course, to act \nto restore consumer and investor confidence. Unlike past recessions and \nslowdowns, the epicenter of this economic crisis is the housing crisis; \nand the epicenter of the housing crisis is the foreclosure crisis. \nHousing starts are at their lowest level in more than a quarter of a \ncentury. Home prices declined last year nationwide by 6 percent, and \nare expected to decline again this year. This would be the first time \nsince the Great Depression that the country will have had two \nconsecutive years where home prices have dropped and the President \ncalls this a period of ``economic uncertainty.''\n  This crisis stems above all from the virtual collapse, as I said a \nmoment ago, of the housing market. That collapse was triggered by what \nSecretary Paulson has rightly and properly called--and I commend him \nfor it--``bad lending practices.'' Those are his words, not mine. These \nare lending practices that no sensible banker would ever engage in. \nReckless, careless, and sometimes unscrupulous actors in the mortgage \nlending industry essentially allowed loans to be made that they knew \nhard-working, law-abiding borrowers would never, ever be able to repay \nwhen the fully indexed price kicked in. And they engaged in practices \nthat the Federal Reserve and the Bush administration did absolutely \nnothing to effectively stop.\n  As a result, foreclosures are at record levels, the value of people's \nhomes is declining, and the tax base for State and local governments is \nshrinking.\n  A year ago, I chaired the first Housing hearing in the Congress on \nthe subject of predatory lending. I talked then about the possibility \nthat more than 2 million Americans would lose their homes as a result \nof such lending practices. I know there were those who scoffed when I \nmentioned the number\n\n[[Page S412]]\n\nof 2 million almost a year ago, but no one is scoffing now. Today, \nforeclosure rates are at record levels. Estimates are that foreclosures \nwill continue to climb for most of this year, dip briefly, and then \nbegin to rise again when interest rate resets kick in.\n  The catalyst of the current economic crisis is, as I said a moment \nago, the housing crisis. And the face of the housing crisis is the \nforeclosure crisis. Therefore, in my view, any short-term stimulus \npackage should include measures that will address the causes and \nsymptoms of the foreclosure crisis head on, as well as trying to \nprovide some immediate relief for those who are dealing directly with \nthis problem.\n  I want to indicate at the outset I am very supportive of the work \ndone by Speaker Pelosi in the House along with John Boehner, the \nRepublican leader, and other Members over there who have worked on \nthis. I thank them for what they have done to formulate outlines of a \nstimulus package that the administration could support. Senator Baucus, \nmy good friend from Montana and the chairman of the Finance Committee, \nSenator Harkin, Senator Kennedy and others have expressed some \nimportant views regarding unemployment insurance, food stamps, low-\nincome energy assistance, and other important programs.\n  We may not accommodate all of those priority programs, but they bring \nup a good point; and that is, historically you want to make sure \nresources get into the hands of the people who are feeling the pinch. \nFor people who still have choices, there may be less than the desired \nimpact by providing a tax break for people in that category, as opposed \nto those who are at the low-income levels, who are tremendously \nstrapped, that they are provided some relief. So I am confident when \nthe Senate works its will, there will be some additions to the stimulus \npackage, I think, in the unemployment area, certainly, and possibly in \nlow-income energy assistance, and in some food stamp areas as well.\n  In addition to the problems in our housing market, we also have \ntremendous challenges and opportunities with respect to our Nation's \naging infrastructure.\n  In the short term we need to include funding for States and \nlocalities to start projects that are already ready to go, including \nexisting highway and transit maintenance projects and other \ninfrastructure projects that can be done quickly. There are a long list \nof highway and transit projects that are important to creating jobs \ntoday and to strengthening our Nation's economic future. These projects \nwill boost employment in the construction and manufacturing sectors, \nwhich are those that have been hardest hit in the recent economic \ndownturn. I intend to work for and support an immediate investment in \ntransit, highway and other infrastructure projects.\n  In the long term we need to renew and reinvent our infrastructure. \nThis is no small task, but it is critically important to putting people \nto work and modernizing the economy for future generations. As I said, \nI have worked with my colleague, Senator Hagel, in introducing \nlegislation to authorize a National Infrastructure Bank to address some \nof these challenges, and I look forward to working with him and others \nin this Chamber to do that.\n  I do not want to overload the stimulus and I realize it is important \nwe act quickly or the value of the package gets lost. Even if it does \nnot include all the things I wish to see in it, it is important we move \nexpeditiously or the value of the timing of it, I think, could be lost \non us altogether. It is important we consider some of those suggestions \nthat are being made on a temporary basis. I look forward to working \nwith our colleagues to try to add some additions to the stimulus \npackage. But, hopefully, we can do it in a timely fashion.\n  Specifically, with respect to housing, because this is an area where, \nagain, if we are just dealing with people's problems and not the \nproblem that caused the problems, then I think we are missing a \ncritical point. I want to pick up on some of the things Byron Dorgan \ntalked about a moment ago. Let me add that I am pleased to note there \nwere elements in the proposed House package that address the housing \nmarket issues; namely, a temporary increase in the conforming loan \nlimits for the GSEs, and also for the FHA program.\n  I think we ought to be talking about jumbo loans in this area. One of \nthe concerns in the current crisis is that of market liquidity. If you \nwant to get liquidity into this market, then you have to have loan \nlimits that can reach amounts that truly make a difference, even if for \nonly 12 months.\n  So my hope is the administration--however this will work--will set \nthose loan limits to create the desired impact that we are trying to \nreach, and that is, injecting liquidity into the housing market. \nIncreasing these loan limits will help restore confidence and liquidity \ninto the housing market, where interest rates have skyrocketed for \nnonconforming loans due to the current problems. These steps will also \nallow millions of middle-class Americans who live in areas of the \ncountry where the value of an average house is far above the existing \nconforming loan limits to participate and reap the benefits from having \na conforming loan. So I would urge these additional loan limits to deal \nwith the problems in the jumbo loan market, at least for a year, be \nconsidered.\n  I have supported both of these measures and have also worked very \nclosely with my ranking member on the Banking Committee, Senator \nShelby, to draft and pass a more broad FHA modernization bill. That \nlegislation passed this body 93 to 1. We spent a lot of time drafting \nthat bill, and getting strong bipartisan support for it back at the end \nof last year. I want to acknowledge the assistance of the majority \nleader, Senator Reid, and Senator Schumer of New York who were very \nhelpful in getting that legislation adopted on the floor with the kind \nof overwhelming numbers I mentioned a moment ago.\n  I remain dedicated to making this happen. I have spoken with Chairman \nBarney Frank of the House as late as last evening. We had breakfast \ntogether a week ago to talk about how this bill can get done as part of \nthis stimulus package. These are good and needed steps, but we must, I \nthink, go farther. I think this is where Senator Dorgan's remarks come \nin. If we limit it to a short-term stimulus package, and assume that is \ngoing to achieve the desired results, I think you are missing the point \nand that explains why we have had some negative reaction to the short-\nterm program.\n  It has to be followed on--whether you call it a second or third \ntranche or effort here--but we need to follow the short-term effort \nwith some longer term decisions and proposals that can go a long way to \nrestoring that sense of confidence and optimism beyond the short-term \ninjection of confidence that is needed if we are going to see our \neconomy improve and opportunities improve in this century.\n  The work of the President and the Congress to right our Nation's \neconomic ship will not end with the enactment of a stimulus package. On \nthe contrary, it will have barely begun.\n  There are other important measures we can and should take to address \nthe problems in the housing market, and I want to briefly address two \nof them, if I can.\n  In the short term, we need to increase funding for the community \ndevelopment block grant, CDBG, program. The CDBG program has been a \nvery successful program all across the country for many years, and in \nmy view, it can do an awful lot to assist in foreclosure mitigation. It \nis a tried and true program. We should use it to direct, I would \nsuggest, some $10 billion to local governments to renovate and resell \nthe foreclosed and abandoned homes that are decimating many \ncommunities.\n  The mayor of Bridgeport, CT, was in my office last week. He was a \nnewly elected mayor last fall. He told me in the city of Bridgeport--\nwhich is a city of a little less than 100,000--he is looking at 6,000 \nforeclosed homes in his city. That is 6,000 homes in a city of less \nthan 100,000 residents. Needless to say, even for those homes that are \ncurrent with their mortgage and in no danger of foreclosure, the value \nof those homes, and every home, in that city will be adversely \naffected. Even if there were only 1,000 foreclosed homes it would be a \nhuge number. Imagine if it is six times that in one city in my State, \nwhich is the most affluent State in many ways in the country, what it \nmust be like in many other cities throughout my State and the country \nas a whole.\n\n[[Page S413]]\n\n  I do not know the numbers in Hartford and Waterbury and other cities, \nand smaller cities, but 6,000 foreclosures in Bridgeport is a huge \nnumber. These are not speculator homes. This is not Las Vegas or \nFlorida or Arizona. These are single-family homes that people are \nliving in, and the idea that 6,000 people and families in that city \nwould be adversely affected ought to cause all of us great pause to ask \nwhat can we do creatively and imaginatively to help out.\n  The CDBG program has been very useful over the years in providing \nmayors and county supervisors and others across the country some help \nin this area. I think it would be a smart short-term effort.\n\n  Foreclosed and abandoned homes are devastating--again, I am preaching \nto the choir as we all know this--to communities around the country. \nThey lead to a cycle of disinvestment and crime in neighborhoods. All \nof the commensurate problems that emerge with abandoned properties \nhardly need to be articulated again this morning. We all understand it. \nThe property values and property tax bases all suffer, thereby leading \nto service cuts and further disinvestment. So CDBG money could provide, \nI think, some very valuable resources for these communities. Again, we \nare talking about $10 billion. It is not insignificant, but if we think \nabout the potential good it could do, I think it would be a worthwhile \ninvestment.\n  Let me mention another idea. I want to thank the American Enterprise \nInstitute and the Center for American Progress that wrote an op-ed \npiece on this idea. It is an idea that comes out of both conservative \nand liberal to moderate think tanks about what to do about foreclosed \nproperties, where you have people living in their homes. This is about \na need for a temporary apparatus to mitigate foreclosures.\n  I am working with a proposal to create what is called the \nHomeownership Preservation Corporation, which was tried actually in the \n1930s and worked rather well under similar circumstances. Very \nbasically, this proposal would allow for the purchase of very \ndistressed mortgages either in default or about to go in default. These \nare single-family homes with people living in them. Again, it is not \nhousing speculators that we are talking about here.\n  What you have already going on is, there are people actually going \nout buying some of these loans in the hopes they will restore it and \nsell it at some point down the road. The Homeownership Preservation \nCorporation idea would allow us, in effect, to form a corporation to do \nthis: buy them at discounted rates, so the lender gets a haircut, but \nthere is still someone paying the note. You get a fixed rate deal, so \nthe homeowner stays in it under terms they can afford to stay in, so \nyou do not have your neighborhoods deteriorating. If it works as well \nas it could work, I think you actually have a program that has little \nor no cost to it. What you have done is stabilized these neighborhoods \nand allowed people to stay in their homes. While everyone suffers to \nsome degree, it also allows us to preserve people's ability to remain \nin these neighborhoods, remain in their homes.\n  As I said, this was done during the Great Depression very \nsuccessfully back a number of years ago, at little or no cost to the \nGovernment. Under this concept, no one gets bailed out. Everyone shares \nin the pain of the housing bust. But at the same time, a market-based \nmechanism is established that can restore confidence to lenders and \ninvestors, and give innocent homeowners a chance to save their homes.\n  In the longer term and this is the last point I want to make, we need \nto end predatory lending practices. I introduced a bill in the fall \nthat will crack down on these practices. Again, there will be ideas \nthat our colleagues will bring to this debate. I do not claim we have \ncaptured all the wisdom in this area. But clearly we want to send a \nmessage that some of these practices cannot go on any longer. My hope \nis we will get some strong support again from across the political \ndivides in the country. Fifteen of our colleagues have already \ncosponsored the bill, and others are welcome to do the same.\n  In addition to the problems in our housing market, we also have \ntremendous challenges and opportunities with respect to our Nation's \naging infrastructure.\n  Again, I thank the Chamber of Commerce and I thank the labor unions \nwho are supporting my bill. I thank Byron Dorgan, people such as Felix \nRohatyn, Bernard Schwartz, CSIS, and others for spending the last 2\\1/\n2\\ years with Warren Rudman, Chuck Hagel, myself, and Bob Kerrey in \nputting together this proposal of an infrastructure bank.\n  Again, the estimates are that we need $1.5 trillion just to bring our \ninfrastructure up to current levels. Our infrastructure is declining \nand deteriorating literally as we speak. The definition of \ninfrastructure has changed as well. It is not just the physical \ninfrastructure but human infrastructure as well. The FAA system is in \ndeep need of modernization, or we are going to face some tragedies if \nwe don't understand how important that piece is. There are a wide \nvariety of issues that need to be addressed with infrastructure. \nThroughout history I think we have all understood the value, \neconomically, to our country that has come from investing in \ninfrastructure. Bob Herbert's article this morning very generously \ntalks about the bill Chuck Hagel and I have introduced. He talks \nhistorically about the great canal systems in the Midwest that opened \nup opportunities for New York, and obviously, the interstate highway \nsystem under the Eisenhower administration, and the incredible economic \nexpansion that occurred as a result of those investments. The rural \nelectrification programs that brought electrification to rural areas in \nthe country made a huge difference to people and to our nation.\n\n  So we invite our colleagues to look at these ideas on how we can \nexpand our efforts to meet our infrastructure needs. It really is an \nissue that demands the attention of this body. So I offer that idea as \nwell.\n  In conclusion, I think the package the President and House leaders \nhave laid out is a good one. I think it can be expanded on, and it \naddresses some of the critical areas. More needs to be done. If we \ndon't follow up on the stimulus package with some of these other ideas, \nI think we will have missed a significant not only opportunity, but I \nthink an important moment in our history to restore that confidence and \noptimism people are looking for.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/29/senate-section/article/S413-1", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S413]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     EXTENSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. DODD.

Mr. President, I rise in morning business to discuss a \nrecent trip I made about 2 weeks ago to Iraq. It was a trip I made, as \nI have every year since I have been in the Senate, to visit Iraq, to \nvisit firsthand with Georgia troops on duty, Georgia troops who are \nthere standing guard for America, as well as to interact with the Iraqi \nGovernment--the Kurds, the Sunnis, the Shias--and rank-and-file Iraqi \npeople to measure the progress of our effort in Iraq but, more \nimportantly, the progress of the Iraqis themselves.\n  I am delighted to be able to come and give a very unbiased and, \nhopefully, unvarnished and very plain recitation of the remarkable \nchanges that have taken place in that country. We all know a year ago \nin this body we had serious debate over the fate of our effort in Iraq. \nThere were calls for us to withdraw. There were declarations that we \nhad lost. There were other challenges that were brought forward. But \nfinally, though difficult, the decision by the President to commit to \nan increase of troops for the surge and follow the anti-insurgency plan \nof General Petraeus and put General Petraeus in charge finally became a \nreality.\n  About midyear on the ground in Iraq the deployment was complete and \nthey began exercising the plan.\n  Let me try and give an idea of what Iraq today is like compared to \nIraq 1 year ago. When I landed at the Baghdad Airport, for the first \ntime I drove\n\n[[Page S414]]\n\nby car--by armored vehicle--into downtown Baghdad. Every year before we \nhad to fly in on Apache helicopters because of the ground fire and the \ndanger. We arrived in Baghdad in the Green Zone and spent the night. On \nevery trip before to Iraq, they took us out to Kuwait City to a \nSheraton Hotel when darkness fell in Baghdad because it was so dark. \nTwice during the course of the visit we got outside of the Green Zone \nand into a Chevy Suburban in one case, and into an MRAP in another \ncase, and went out on two excursions. I would like to talk about them \nfor a second.\n  The first was in an MRAP. I have to pause here and pay great tribute \nto Senator Biden. About 18 months ago, Senator Biden led the charge in \nthis body for us to fund the MRAPs to try and do away with the tragic \nloss of life that was taking place through IEDs on the ground and on \nthe roads in Iraq and in Baghdad.\n  There is no question in this body that the most strident voice in \nfavor of that funding and that commitment was the Senator from \nDelaware. Today, the soldiers of the United States of America and of \nIraq and of our coalition partners ride in the new MRAP vehicles, which \nare remarkable. General Petraeus told me at the dinner I had with him \nthat in the first five hits where an IED exploded under an MRAP, there \nwas not a single scratch of an American serviceman. I know a week ago \nwe lost our first serviceman in an MRAP, but that serviceman was the \ngunner above the turret at the time he was hit. It has a 100-percent \nrecord in terms of those inside of the MRAP when moving the troops. It \nis a marvelous transformation and a great testament to this body, \nRepublican and Democrat alike, to rise to the occasion to see to it \nthat when our men and women are threatened, if there is a technique, if \nthere is a technology, if there is engineering sufficient to bring \nabout a new product, we will do it, and we will fund it. We did it on \nthe MRAP, and today our soldiers are safer and our efforts stronger.\n  I rode in one of those MRAPs to a neighborhood known as Gazaria. \nGazaria was the neighborhood that was completely destroyed 2\\1/2\\ years \nago. I went to a market that had about 20 shops, of which about half \nwere open, and traveled with a squad headed by a lieutenant colonel who \nwas making microgrants and microloans and measuring the progress of \nprevious loans that had been made to Iraqis who were reopening their \nstores. Senator Cornyn, Senator Coburn, and myself stood in a bakery \nand ate an Iraqi-type of flatbread and drank tea in a market that had \nbeen totally destroyed and unoccupied for 2\\1/2\\ years. We went to an \nauto repair shop where two brothers had reopened the shop and were \nbeginning to do repairs and had bought a generator to provide them with \nreliable, continuous electricity. These are microloans made by the \nUnited States of America to the Iraqi people to reinvest in themselves, \nreinvigorate their enterprises, reinvigorate their employment.\n  Was it dangerous? Sure. We had on bulletproof vests, we had on \nhelmets, and we traveled in MRAPs. But heretofore you could never have \ngone into downtown Baghdad as we did on this trip. Twice we ran into \nlocal Iraqis: once two Sunnis who joined the awakening movement and the \nCLCs who were taking up arms to guard the secured market to see to it \nthat no terrorist or insurgent could come in and do damage, and then \ntwice to refugee families who over 2 years ago had left Baghdad and \nGazaria with no intention of ever returning, but now, because of its \nrelative security, they returned.\n  The second trip was made by Chevy Suburban--not by armored tank or \nnot by MRAP--and we left the Green Zone and went through Baghdad to the \ngovernment building where we met with Sunni, Shia, and Kurdish leaders. \nFor the first time in my annual trips back there, the talk was \nsubstantive and the inference on the part of the leadership was that \nthings were getting ready to get better. As all of us know, on \ndebaathification and reconciliation, things have started to happen.\n  As the President acknowledged in his speech last night, they will be \nhappening in terms of sharing the oil revenues and eventually a \nhydrocarbon law for the entire country.\n  My point in bringing this story to the Senate and telling it \nfirsthand is the progress the President described last night is real. \nIt is tangible. Things are changing in Iraq, and they are changing for \nthe better for the Iraqis and for us. We have brought back two groups, \nand as the President said, we will bring back five more without \nreplacing them this year. Our troop level will be going down. We are \ngoing from a combat confrontation to an oversight role in terms of \nhelping and providing logistics to the Iraqis.\n  Have the Iraqis responded? Think about this: Remember about 6 months \nago when the Prime Minister of Great Britain said they were pulling the \nBritish troops out of Basra, and the American press wrote about another \nfailure: One of our partners was leaving, so what were we going to do. \nNobody has written about Basra since then because here is what \nhappened: All the Brits who left were replaced by Iraqis--not by \nAmericans, not by coalition forces. Have you read about damage or \nproblems in Basra? No, you haven't because the army has performed \nmagnificently--the Iraqi Army.\n  Today we read of reports in Mosul, and we mourn the tragedy of the \nloss of U.S. soldiers, but in that big attack going on against one of \nthe last strongholds left of the insurgents of al-Qaida, the spear of \nthat attack, the point of that attack was all Iraqi soldiers. I had the \nprivilege to meet with Iraqi generals who, for the first time, see \nthemselves energized, see themselves fully capable of assuming the role \nthat we have taken for so long: for us to move to oversight and for \nthem to move to the point of the spear.\n  The practical matter is, whatever mistakes may have been made in the \npast, whatever differences we may have had, the young men and women of \nthe United States of America have performed magnificently. General \nPetraeus has lived up to every single promise of hope we had for him.\n  In the name and in the memory of the tragic loss of life in Iraq, \nGeorgia soldiers such as Diego Rincon, LTG Noah Harris, SGT Mike \nStokely, and the other 119, the sacrifice they have made has not been \nin vain, and we are on the doorstep, hopefully, of building and of \nhelping to have created a democracy that will last and endure in the \nMiddle East. Hopefully, it will be the first step of many to accomplish \nthe hope of peace, freedom, and liberty that we in this country so \noften take for granted but the rest of the world cherishes.\n  So the President was right last night in his State of the Union \nspeech. We have made great progress. There is work left to be done, but \nthere is light at the end of the tunnel, and it is not a locomotive. It \nis the light of hope, liberty, and peace and freedom because of the \nsacrifice and the endurance of the fine young men and women in the U.S. \nmilitary serving in harm's way today in Iraq.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey).

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/29/senate-section/article/S414-1", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S414-S415]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              THE ECONOMY\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, last night I listened intently to \nPresident Bush's State of the Union speech, and, frankly, I had a hard \ntime understanding what country the President was talking about and \nwhat reality he was talking about. Certainly, if the State of the Union \nrefers to what is happening to the shrinking middle class of this \ncountry and how we as a people are doing, the President had almost \nnothing to say that rang true. In fact, last night's speech just \nreminds many of us how far removed from the reality of ordinary life \nthis President is and how little he and his administration know about \nwhat is going on in the lives of millions and millions of people in \ncities and towns across this country.\n  In my view, the President's speech was lacking not just for what he \nsaid but, perhaps more importantly, for what he didn't say. Somehow, \nPresident Bush forgot to mention some of the results of his failed \neconomic policies and how they have impacted the lives of ordinary \npeople. So let me take\n\n[[Page S415]]\n\na moment, therefore, to review the record the President refused to talk \nabout last night.\n  Since George W. Bush took office in 2001, nearly 5 million Americans \nhave slipped out of the middle class and into poverty. These are mostly \nlow-income working people whose wages have not kept up with inflation. \nThese are people all across the country who are trying to make it on $6 \nor $7 an hour without any health insurance, desperately trying to keep \ntheir families above water. These are, by the way, parents and kids in \nPennsylvania and in Vermont who are now flocking to emergency food \nbanks because they simply don't have the income to buy the food they \nneed in the United States of America in 2008. It might have been a sign \nof decency on the part of the President to at least recognize that \nreality which is impacting so many of our people, and the reality that \nhunger in America is actually going up.\n  Since George W. Bush has been in office, median household income for \nworking-age Americans has declined by almost $2,500. That is a lot of \nmoney. Also, overall median household income has gone down by nearly \n$1,000. This is the shrinking middle class, and maybe as people are \nworking longer hours for lower wages, maybe as people are working 50 or \n60 hours a week trying to bring in enough money for their families to \npay the bills, maybe the President might have said a few words to them \nthat he understands the reality they are experiencing. Maybe he might \nhave said to the young people of our country that he is concerned if we \ndon't turn around our economy, for the first time in the modern history \nof this country their generation will have a lower standard of living \nthan their parents; maybe just a few words to those young people so \nthey know he knows what is going on in their lives.\n  But I didn't hear that. I didn't hear that at all.\n  Mr. President, since George W. Bush has been in office, 8.6 million \nAmericans have lost their health insurance, and we are now up to 47 \nmillion Americans without any health insurance whatsoever. Meanwhile, \nhealth insurance premiums have increased during Bush's tenure by 78 \npercent--a huge increase in the cost of health care.\n  Last night, while the President gave us his usual rhetoric about all \nof the virtues of free market health care, he somehow forgot to tell us \nwhy we spend almost twice as much per capita on health care as any \nother nation, and why we are the only major country on Earth without a \nnational health care program guaranteeing health care to all people. \nThe President didn't even tell us why he vetoed legislation that would \nexpand health insurance to millions more children; just the usual \nrhetoric about free market health care, which is failing us every \nsingle day.\n  During his remarks last night, somehow President Bush neglected to \nmention that 3 million workers, since he has been in office, have lost \ntheir pensions--the promises that were made to them for their \nretirement years--and about half of American workers in the private \nsector have no pension coverage whatsoever. I didn't hear much from the \nPresident about that.\n  What I did hear is the President's rhetoric about ``Social Security \nreform,'' which are code words for the privatization of Social \nSecurity. At a time when seniors are facing more and more insecurity \nthan they have seen for a very long time, privatizing Social Security \nis the last thing this country needs.\n  Last night, President Bush once again pushed for more unfettered free \ntrade agreements, despite the fact that since he has been in office the \nannual trade deficit has more than doubled, and over 3 million \nmanufacturing jobs--good-paying jobs--in this country have been lost. \nIt astounds me that, despite the horrendous record of these unfettered \ntrade agreements--NAFTA, CAFTA, and permanent normal trade relations--\nwe have a President who says: Look, we have failed year after year, we \nhave lost millions of good-paying jobs, our trade deficit is soaring, \nand do you know what the answer is? We need more of this failed trade \npolicy. In my own small State of Vermont, never one of the great \nmanufacturing States in this country, we have lost, since the President \nhas been President, 10,000 manufacturing jobs--25 percent of the total \nor one out of four manufacturing jobs. And President Bush says we need \nmore outsourcing; we need corporations to throw more American workers \nout on the street so they can run to China and pay people 50 cents an \nhour there, and then bring the products back into this country.\n  Last night, President Bush did say a word about gas prices going up. \nBut he did forget to tell us that since he has been President the price \nof gas at the pump, and home heating oil, has more than doubled. For \nwhatever reason, he also forgot to tell us that, year after year, while \nAmericans are paying outrageous prices for oil and gas, the oil \ncompanies are enjoying record-breaking profits. I didn't hear him \nmention anything about that, not one word.\n  A couple of years ago, for example, ExxonMobil--which has enjoyed \nhuge profits while Americans are paying $3.15 for a gallon of gas at \nthe pump--gave a $398 million retirement package for its former CEO, \nMr. Lee Raymond. And our people are paying $3.15 for a gallon of gas. \nThe President forgot to talk about that.\n  Also, I found it interesting that President Bush neglected to discuss \nthat for the first time since the Great Depression the personal savings \nrate in this country is below zero. This means that because of the dire \neconomic conditions facing so many of our people, we as a people are \nactually spending more money than we are earning. In fact, today, \nmillions of Americans are buying their groceries with credit cards. \nThey don't have the cash to buy the food they need. They are going into \ndebt to buy groceries. And our friends in the credit card industry are \nthen charging them 25 or 30 percent interest rates for the groceries \nthey are buying on credit.\n  For some reason, last night in his State of the Union Address, the \nPresident also neglected to mention that home foreclosures are the \nhighest on record, turning the American dream of homeownership into an \nAmerican nightmare for millions of our fellow citizens.\n  The reason I am raising these issues is because if we as a Senate, as \na government, do not talk about and discuss the reality of life in this \ncountry for the vast majority of the people, if we do not understand \nwhat is going on in the cities and towns across our Nation, then it \nwill be virtually impossible for us to formulate the public policies we \nneed to transform our economy so that it begins to work well for all of \nthe people and not just the wealthiest people on top.\n  Also, we do not do this enough. It is important to take a look at \nwhat is going on in our country compared to what is going on in many \nother industrialized nations. Very often, I hear people on the Senate \nfloor say we are the wealthiest and the greatest Nation in the world. \nWe are all of these things.\n  Let's look at some of the facts as they apply to the lives of \nordinary people. What country in the industrialized world has, by far, \nthe highest rate of childhood poverty, where one out of five children \nare living in poverty? Is it France, Germany, or the U.K.? No. It is \nthe United States of America. One out of five children in this country \nlive in poverty. And shock of all shocks, we end up having the highest \nrate of incarceration--putting people behind bars--of any other country \non Earth. If you think there is not a correlation between those two \nfactors, I would strongly disagree with you.\n  Unfortunately, the U.S. today has the highest infant mortality rate \nof any major country on Earth, the highest overall poverty rate, the \nlargest gap between the rich and the poor, and we are the only major \ncountry in the world not to provide health care to all of their its \npeople as a right of citizenship.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I come to the floor to speak about a piece \nof legislation that has been introduced by our colleague, Senator Jim \nInhofe, of Oklahoma, S. 2551. It is entitled the Nuclear Waste Policy \nAmendments Act of 2008.\n  The reason I do this is multiple in the issue of nuclear energy today \nand the management of the waste stream that flows from not only current \nnuclear reactors operating in our energy portfolio, but, of course, the \ngrowth of generating capability through nuclear reaction as it relates \nto all that is going on out there from the creation of the Energy \nPolicy Act of 2005, the 30-plus reactors that are on the drawing boards \ntoday, and the opportunity to see new reactors built in our country to \nsupplement and build our energy base, and the issue of how we handle \nthe waste.\n  As most Senators know, Yucca Mountain, a permanent deep geologic \nrepository in Nevada, has become increasingly controversial over the \nyears largely because of the delegation from Nevada and the antinuclear \nfolks, but also the reality of reprocessing and still finding a \npermanent repository for nuclear waste. I strongly support Yucca \nMountain. I believe we need a deep geologic repository, whether it is \nfor the current waste that is in storage at most of our reactors or \nwhether it is for the refined waste that would come from a reprocessing \nstream. So for a few moments today I thought I would share with fellow \nSenators a legacy that most don't realize but I find extremely \nimportant in this overall debate of a nuclear renaissance and Congress \ngetting real and honest about how we handle a waste stream, instead of \nthe political football that some would like it to be and, therefore, \ncreate the uncertainty that results from that.\n  In my State of Idaho, I have a national laboratory. The State of \nIdaho hosts one of our Nation's premier energy laboratories, known as \nthe INL, Idaho National Laboratory. It started in 1949. It started for \nthe sole purpose of a national reactor testing site, where reactors \nwould be built and tested before they went into commercial use or, at \nthis time and place, mostly military use and for national security \npurposes. So a site that was started in 1949 actually saw by 1951 the \nlighting of the first light bulb ever lit in America by nuclear \nreaction. That site today is now a museum, so dedicated by President \nLyndon Johnson. Many people have come to see the first reactor ever \nbuilt to light the first light bulb ever lit by nuclear reaction in \nthis country.\n  Since that time, 52 test reactors have been built onsite at the Idaho \nNational Laboratory. Idaho is also, therefore, the home of something \nelse--the legacy of nuclear reactors. Three hundred metric tons of \nspent nuclear material and 4,000 metric tons of high-level waste are \nstored at this national laboratory. Most of this waste was generated \nfrom defense and from our Navy's nuclear program. In fact, one of the \nmost successful programs ever in the history of the world has been our \nnaval vessels powered by nuclear reaction. All of the waste from those \nreactors over the years has been stored at Idaho.\n  Idaho was the premier training location for our men and women in the \nnuclear Navy to come and learn how to manage and operate nuclear \nreactors in our nuclear Navy. We also have waste from West Valley in \nNew York, and other locations, because Idaho has been the recipient of \nthat waste. But I must say that as a result of that, the Federal \nGovernment signed an agreement with Idaho some years ago that all of \nthat waste would go to Yucca Mountain by 2035, or to a deep geologic \nrepository other than the State of Idaho, where it is now stored in dry \nstorage and in wet storage.\n  There is no other disposable option for our Navy's high-level waste. \nBecause of the configuration of the waste, of those reactor fuel rods, \nthey cannot be reprocessed. So they, unlike the commercial reactor \nspent fuel rods, have to go into a permanent home and permanent waste. \nIdaho, South Carolina, and the State of Washington are all relying on \nYucca Mountain for permanent disposal of this waste.\n  So it is critical that this Senate, this Government, doesn't put \naside the issue of Yucca Mountain, but that we deal with it in a \nforthright way, that we recognize there is truly a need for some \ngeologic storage of our types of waste, especially our military waste \nthat, in many instances, is stored in South Carolina, Washington, and \nmy State of Idaho.\n  As I said in my opening comments, since we passed the Energy Policy \nAct of 2005, and we began to streamline the process to bring a new \ndesign construction concept on line and grant guarantees for the \nconstruction of nuclear reactors for commercial electrical production, \nthere has been what many call a renaissance as it relates to the \npossibility of pouring concrete to actually build new reactors.\n  Certainly, the debate of climate change, the emission of greenhouse \ngases has caused us to recognize the need for what we call baseloading \nof our electrical system with large units of production that are \nnonemitting. And, of course, at this time, technology says the only one \nthat is out there in that high-capacity way would be a nuclear reactor. \nThat is also clearly what has fed the growth, the desire to develop, \nthe licensing process that is underway, the design concepts, the \nattempt to locate new reactors at current sites and facilities.\n  Something happened in my State of Idaho this past week that tells me \nand should tell the world there is still a great deal of uncertainty \nout there as it relates to siting a nuclear reactor. Part of that \nuncertainty is the unwillingness of this Congress to get on with the \nissue of siting a deep geologic repository, getting the licensing \nprocess over, dealing with reprocessing, and truly bringing our arms \naround the issue of the waste stream.\n  Mid-America, a large utility in the Midwest that has recently \nacquired utilities in Idaho and adjoining States or at least utilities \nthat feed part of Idaho's electricity, made the decision that they \nwould attempt to build a nuclear reactor in my State of Idaho. They \nlooked all over the country and decided Idaho was the preferable \nlocation based on their needs and their need to load their service area \nand because they thought the climate was appropriate in Idaho. They \nstudied it. They spent millions of dollars looking at that possibility. \nThey determined this past week they would not move forward. Why? \nBecause even under the most favorable conditions and in possibly the \nmost favorable State, they found the uncertainty and the expense was \nstill too great.\n  Who is Mid-America? It is an asset of Berkshire Hathaway. It is an \nasset of Warren Buffett, probably one of the deepest pockets in the \nworld. Yet they and their studies, with due diligence, determined they \nwould not move forward after millions of dollars were spent.\n  It was all based on cost and uncertainty, and part of that \nuncertainty rests right here in the Senate and with a Congress that \nwill not in a clear, clean, decisive way say: We are going to deal with \nthe issue of the waste stream as the rest of the component pieces that \nwe put together to build a true nuclear renaissance in this country. It \nis critical we move forward. This legislation, S. 2551, speaks to that \npoint. It speaks to that long-term importance.\n  I cosponsored legislation this past year that Senator Domenici and I \nintroduced that dealt with the kinds of issues that are dealt with in \nS. 2551. These two bills, the Domenici-Craig bill, now the Inhofe-\nCraig-and-others bill, would allow Yucca Mountain to open on a \npredictable timeline, replacing, as I have said, the uncertainty. And \nit protects the citizens of Idaho, South Carolina, and 30 other States \nthat are currently storing nuclear materials.\n  Nuclear energy, nuclear power clearly remains our best and brightest \noption in the near term as it relates to a sustainable, nonemitting \nsource of energy for our country. Clearly, this Congress should not, \nand to date has not, stood in the way of building that renaissance from \nthe policies passed in 2005, to the guarantees we are offering, to the \nnew licensing process the Nuclear Regulatory Commission is now in the \nfinal stages of developing. The only piece left undone is the issue of \nwaste stream, and it is critically important we deal with it. If we do \nnot, if we were to put a blight on the potential growth\n\n[[Page S417]]\n\nof nuclear energy, here is what could happen. From 1995 to 2006, \nnuclear power helped us avoid emitting more than 8 million metric tons \nof carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Many States have started to say \nno to coal and yes to nuclear power or other forms of clean energy. But \nother than nuclear power, they are limited, and clearly we should not \nbe saying no.\n  Our economy, our growth, future jobs for this country, the vitality \nof our economic leadership in the world is tied to available energy, \nabundant energy, and reasonable cost energy. We know today the one \nsource of energy that answers all those charges is nuclear.\n  Yucca Mountain remains a key piece of all of that picture. That is \nwhy Senator Inhofe has introduced the legislation, why I am a cosponsor \nof it. I certainly encourage all my colleagues to look through clear \nglasses at this issue because we have to deal with the waste stream in \na responsible fashion. We need to do so in a way that is acceptable to \nthe industry and acceptable to the American people.\n  The efforts that have been put forth from day one in the examination \nof the geology, the development of the core tunnel at Yucca Mountain--\nall those stages are there for the public to see. The licensing process \nis now underway, which is the next step. Let's don't arbitrarily and \npolitically step into the middle of it and mess it up.\n  I must tell you the frustration I have had listening to Presidential \ncandidates out on the road. If you want the endorsement of a single \nState, you are against Yucca Mountain and that single State was Nevada. \nThis is a national issue; it is not a local issue. This is Federal land \nproperly handled, properly researched, and it can be properly developed \nin a safe way for all Americans and for our future. That is what this \nlegislation speaks to.\n  I am pleased to be a cosponsor with Senator Inhofe. He introduced it \nin a timely fashion. Clearly, in the course of this year, it is \nsomething that needs to be debated; it is something with which we need \nto deal. This administration has moved forward as quickly and \nresponsibly as they could, and the licensing process is certainly \nsomething that needs to be completed in the overall effort of the \nrenaissance of nuclear power in our country and that form of generation \nas an important option in our mix of energy sources for this Nation for \nnow and into the future.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/29/senate-section/article/S417-1", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S417-S418]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ECONOMIC STIMULUS\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I wished to rise to talk a little bit about \nthe proposed stimulus package which is working its way through the \nCongress and has been agreed to between the President and the Speaker \nof the House.\n  First, I congratulate the Speaker, the Republican leader of the \nHouse, and the President, especially Secretary Paulson, for sitting \ndown and trying to reach a bipartisan understanding as to how we move \nforward in what is obviously a very tentative economic time. We know in \nthis Nation we are confronting some very serious issues, most of them \nbrought on by a bubble in the credit markets relative to lending for \nhousing construction. As happens with a classic bubble--and this is a \nclassic bubble--when it bursts, when, in other words, the underlying \nsecurity and the people responsible for paying back the debt cannot do \nthat because money has been lent to people who are not in a position to \nrepay their loans and the security under that debt has not been able to \nbe maintained to reinstate the value of that debt, when that happens, \nthat not only affects the loans, the immediate loans that are impacted, \nbut it leads to a further contraction in the marketplace.\n  I have been through this a number of times in my experience, and it \nalways seems to happen the same way with loans which turned out to be \nnot well made being called, and they are then followed by the people \nwho lent the money and the capital markets having to contract in order \nto basically build back up their capital positions. So people who \nactually have good loans find that they cannot get credit extended \nfurther and it feeds on itself and you start to see a slowdown. That \nappears to be the type of issue which we may be confronting as a \nNation, where we know we have a huge subprime problem. It is very big. \nWe know that may lead to a further contraction. In fact, we are already \nseeing that.\n  We know also, ironically, in this market, what happened was a lot of \nthose loans were syndicated out and then they were put in synthetic \ninstruments and actually multiplied their impact and we ended up with \nan inverted pyramid. We have one little loan with inadequate capital \nwhich can't be paid back, and then you have a pyramid with the way that \nloan is chopped up and can't be sold. So it is exaggerated in size. So \nthis is a big issue for us as a nation. The question is how to address \nit.\n  Well, first off, I congratulate the Fed because the Fed has stepped \nup. I wish they had stepped up earlier, but they have stepped up and \nreduced rates and, as a result, that should create more liquidity in \nthe market. The second is fiscal policy, and that is where the \nPresident's proposal, working with the Speaker of the House and the \nRepublican leader, has come forward. It is called a stimulus package, \nthe purpose of which, in an economic slowdown, is to pursue classic \neconomic policy, which is to stimulate demand during a time of economic \nslowdown in order to stimulate the economy, generally. That is a \n``black letter'' rule of how you try to abate the economic slowdown. \nThe question is: Will it work? Will what has been put on the table make \nsense and will it work?\n  Remember the last time we did this--with what is known as the tax \nrebate, which are not tax rebates because most of the people getting \nthese don't pay taxes, it is an income transfer--we were coming off a \nperiod of surplus, the only time of surplus in the last 30 years we \nhave had as a Federal government. We had 3 years of surplus, and we \nfelt we had cash in the till to rebate or to pay out. Now we don't have \nthe surplus. In fact, we have a deficit. It is not a huge deficit but \nstill a deficit. It has been coming down over the last few years, which \nis the good news. But it does mean any stimulus package we pursue is \ngoing to have a debt effect.\n  In other words, we are going to have to borrow the money in order to \npay it out to people through this tax rebate or basic payment process. \nSo who ends up paying it? Well, our children are going to pay the cost \nof this stimulus package, and it is going to be because it is a debt-\ncompounding event. In other words, if the package represented today is \nto be $150 billion in cost over its lifetime, which is supposedly \nconfined to this year, that debt that you have to borrow to pay the \n$150 billion will have interest earned on it. So after 10 years, that \nbecomes $200 billion in debt because it won't be paid back over 10 \nyears and our children and our children's children will have to pay the \nburden of that.\n  So basically we are saying to our children, some of whom haven't even \nstarted earning money yet, we are going to give you a $200 billion bill \nfor this stimulus package we are going to put in place over the next 6 \nmonths. So if we are going to do something such as that, which is \nfairly significant, we better make sure the stimulus package works; \nthat it actually stimulates the economy; that it actually does retard \nthe slowing of forces slowing down the economy and, hopefully, \nreenergize it.\n  The proposals which we have on the table and came from the House \nbreak into two basic approaches: First is a pure consumption approach, \nwhere you basically give people of middle and low incomes in this \ncountry--I think it is $80,000 of individual or $175,000 of joint \nincome--a tax rebate of $600 to $1,200. That is a payment. It is \nstructured in a way that some people who don't pay taxes will actually \nget the payment. The theory is they will take that money and they will \ngo and spend the money and, as a result, the economy will see a boost.\n  There are two problems with this theory we need to address, however. \nFirst, under the present structure of our Internal Revenue Service, the \nCBO,\n\n[[Page S418]]\n\nwhich is a fair arbiter--they do not have prejudice in this debate--the \nCBO has testified--the Congressional Budget Office--that the IRS--and \nthey have consulted with the IRS on this--the Internal Revenue Service \ncannot get these checks out before midsummer, probably, or late June at \nthe earliest.\n  CBO has further testified that the actual economic impact of people \nspending this money, these rebates, these payments, will probably not \noccur until the late third quarter, early fourth quarter of this year. \nInterestingly enough, Dr. Orsak, the head of CBO, has also testified--\nand again this is a fair arbiter--that the slow period, the period when \nyou need stimulus, is the next two quarters or the next two-and-a-half \nquarters. And he has said, quite simply, that because of the \nlimitations within the IRS, this rebate probably would not help those \nquarters.\n  So that should be a concern to us. The money may not end up coming \ninto people's hands--taxpayers or nontaxpayers--to be able to be used \nin the timeframe when it is going to be most needed.\n\n  In fact, toward the third quarter of this year and into the fourth \nquarter of this year, it is again the testimony of the CBO Director \nthat the cuts the Fed has put in place, the \\3/4\\-percent prime cut, is \ngoing to cause the economy to react to that cut in a positive way, \nhopefully, and that will occur in the third and fourth quarter mostly. \nSo you could actually end up with two events on top of each other \nacting as a stimulus at the same time when we no longer need a \nstimulus. So we need to be concerned about that. That is of concern.\n  The second problem which this proposal has--of taking a large amount \nof cash and putting it on the table for people--is that, again, it may \nnot stimulate our economy. In other words, if somebody goes out with \ntheir $600 rebate and they buy a television made in China or they buy \nan iPod made in Vietnam--I don't know if that is where iPods are made--\nor if they buy a washing machine made somewhere else--if the product \nisn't actually physically produced here--then, basically, you are not \nstimulating our economy, you are stimulating the economy where the \nproduct is produced. Since the assumption is most of these dollars will \nbe spent on consumable items or will be used to pay down credit cards, \nwhich has no stimulus effect at all--theoretically, if it is spent on \nconsumable items and, for example, is apparel or consumable goods which \nare manufactured overseas, then the stimulative effect for the United \nStates is extremely limited, only at the margin. Again, this was \ntestified to by the Director of CBO.\n  So these are two concerns with this idea of infusing money into the \npackage. The second part of the package says: Well, we are going to do \nan inventory of basically a business incentive event. We are going to \nallow people to expense capital purchases, versus depreciate, over a \nnumber of years. We are going to allow people bonus depreciation. Both \nof those are probably good tax policies from the standpoint of \nstrengthening our economy over the long run because they make the \neconomy more efficient. It means some small businessperson will be able \nto go out and buy a machine which makes their business more efficient, \nand as a result of being more efficient, it makes the American economy \nstronger. So yes, that is good policy, but it will have very little \nstimulus effect on the underlying economy.\n  So the concern is the House package may not have the stimulus it \nclaims to have and may end up being a debt event which our children \nwill have to repay. What concerns me even more, though, is what is \nbeing talked about in the Senate. We are talking about taking the House \npackage and significantly bidding it up. The House package bothers me \nto begin with, but to bid it up in the Senate is a mistake.\n  We are talking about expanding the rebate to everybody. Now, that \nwill have absolutely no stimulus effect, in my opinion. To say that \nhigh-income individuals or people with joint incomes over $100,000 \nshould get a stimulus, should get a $500 payment--first off, they \nprobably don't need it; and, secondly, they do not need it if we are \ngoing to borrow from their children; and, thirdly, they are probably \ngoing to save it, which is great in the long run but has no immediate \nstimulus effect.\n  Secondly, there is a proposal to include an extension of unemployment \ncompensation benefits--unemployment insurance. Well, that would make \nsense if we were in a recessionary event, but right now the national \nunemployment rate is about 5.1, 5.2 percent, which is deemed full \nemployment. Anything between 5 and 5.5 percent is historically a full-\nemployment situation.\n  There are pockets of communities around this country which have \nhigher unemployment, no question about it. But to put out a nationwide \nextension of unemployment insurance for an additional year, which is \nwhat is being talked about, or for an additional 6 months, which is \nalso being talked about, that creates an incentive, in a full-\nemployment economy, to not cooperate, to not go out and find jobs. It \nhas the opposite effect. It is intuitively obvious that has a perverse \nimpact on what you want in the area of human reaction, which is to go \nand find a job, if the jobs are available. Jobs in a 5-percent economy \nare available.\n  So any unemployment extension should be tied to a trigger, and that \ntrigger should be set at what has been the historical levels of what is \ndeemed to be recessionary, or a significant slowdown, which is around 6 \nor 7 percent, so you don't extend unemployment insurance unless you hit \nthat level of unemployment. You can also make it regional. If one \nregion has 6 percent unemployment, then you give them the extended \nunemployment insurance. If one region doesn't have 6 percent \nunemployment, you don't give them the extended insurance.\n  We are also talking about, on our side of the aisle, adding food \nstamps, adding FMAP, adding LIHEAP, adding infrastructure, and adding \nState and local tax deductibility. All this has been thrown out by \nother Members on our side of the aisle. State and local aid. It is \nmaking it a grab bag of everybody's ideas of whom they want to take \ncare of and whom they want to attract in terms of political support or \nwhat is important to say to supporters or a group of people they think \nare important as their constituencies.\n  And that makes no sense at all. First, it is going to slow this \npackage dramatically if you do that. Second, you are not going to \nimprove stimulus activities around here by doing that. So I would hope \nwe would not proceed that way.\n  I have a lot of problems with the initial package. I do congratulate \nthe White House. I do congratulate Speaker Pelosi and Congressman \nBoehner for putting together a package and for recognizing the need.\n  I have big reservations as to whether it is the most useful package \nfrom the standpoint of stimulus, but it appears, in light of what the \nSenate is now talking about, to be the high watermark. Maybe we should \ntake the House package and pass it and acknowledge the fact that we \nhave done something.\n  The biggest impact of this event is very obvious; it is \npsychological. It is a big price to pay for a psychological event, $150 \nbillion, which adds up to $200 billion over 10 years to our children. \nThat is the big impact, that the American people and the world can see \nthe Congress and the President can work together to address what we see \nas an economic slowdown, even though what we are proposing probably \nwill not have the effects we hope it will have in the short term.\n  But we should not aggravate this problem by significantly increasing \nthe lack of focus of the package by throwing in all these other ideas, \nby expanding the rebate to high-income individuals, by extending \nunemployment insurance in areas where there is basically full \nemployment. Literally, the House package becomes the high watermark. I \nthought I would never say that, but that is the way it looks right now \nfrom the Senate activity.\n  So I wished to make those points because I think we may have to have \nan open discussion of what goes on around here, but we also have to \nhave expedited activity. I do not want to slow it down.\n  I do want to make the points that if we start throwing all this \nbaggage under the bill, we will probably set the train in the wrong \ndirection.\n  I appreciate the courtesy of the Chair and I yield the floor.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/29/senate-section/article/S419-1", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S419]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S419]]\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I thought I would take a few moments to \ntalk about this stimulus package that is sort of maybe making its way \nthrough the Congress.\n  I was in my home State of Iowa this weekend, and a lot of people came \nup to me, from various walks of life, questioning whether we had lost \nall our sanity around here in terms of this stimulus bill.\n  Well, as I probed and asked questions, it seemed everyone thought \nthis idea of just sending a check out to everybody--when we are \nborrowing the money from our kids and grandkids--to do it did not seem \nto make much sense, especially if some of that so-called stimulus money \nis used to buy a flat-screen TV made in China.\n  So we borrow money from China, we go into more debt to them--which \nour kids and grandkids and great-grandkids and on and on will have to \npay for--so that people here can buy a consumer good made in China, and \nsend the money to China. So whose stimulus is this? Is it for our \ncountry or is it for China? So people really rightfully question it.\n  Now, they have heard that maybe we are going to send a check to \neverybody regardless of income, that Bill Gates--and God bless him; he \nis always the foil, I guess, for the wealthiest in our country--and \npeople of that magnitude of income would actually get a check.\n  I have to believe people are beyond laughing about this now. I have \nto believe the citizens of this country are scratching their heads and \nwondering just what are we doing.\n  What I heard from my constituents in Iowa is that if you really want \nto do something in terms of the economy, first of all, you take care of \nthose who are hurt the most, those at the bottom, and then you take and \nyou invest money in the economic well-being of this country.\n  So the more I talked to people about this issue, it became very clear \nto me that what we should be focusing on in the stimulus package--not \nwhat the White House has said and not even what the House said. I was \nnot part of that agreement. I was not invited to those talks or \nanything else. It was only done by the Speaker of the House, I guess, \nand the minority leader of the House and the President. Well, there are \n100 Senators here, too, and we represent people. It would seem to me we \nshould have some input into what this ``stimulus package'' is.\n  So it is clear to me that just taking a bunch of money we borrowed \nfrom China--which our kids and grandkids have to pay back--and giving \nit in a check to everyone, just throwing it out there, is just throwing \nmoney at the problem. How many times have we heard around here: Don't \njust throw money at the problem. So if we have an economic slowdown, \nlet's target--let's target--what it is we are going to put our money \ninto.\n  Now, first, you want to ask the legitimate question of, if you are \ngoing to spend a dollar, what gives you the most economic activity? \nWhat rolls around the most in the economy? What has the largest \nmultiplier effect? Well, the Economic Research Service, the Moody's \nhave all said that the biggest bang for the buck we could get is in \nfood stamps--either a 1.73 or a 1.84 multiplier effect. It means for \nevery $1 you put in, you are getting $1.84 more in economic activity. \nThat is the highest. It dwarfs everything else. Here is a way we can \nactually do something about the economy, target money and help those \nwho need help the most.\n  We have had a constant erosion in food stamps, a 30-year erosion in \nthe asset level. The asset level right now for a person who qualifies \nfor food stamps in this country is $2,000. In other words, if you are a \nsingle parent with a couple of kids and you are working--maybe you are \nin a temporary layoff now with the economic turndown, but let's say \nwhile you were working you saved a little bit of money for that rainy \nday. We are always telling people to save money. It is good for you. It \nis good for your future. So maybe they saved a little bit of money. \nWell, if they saved over $2,000, they do not get food stamps. That is \nthe same level it was in 1977. If it had kept pace with inflation, the \nasset level today would be about $6,000. So we have had that erosion \nnow for 30 years. We have had 11 years of an erosion of the standard \ndeduction, which is, without getting into the nitty-gritty of how it \nworks, just a standard deduction for a family on food stamps, taking \ninto account certain factors that comes out to be a deduction of about \n$130 a month. That is at the level it was 11 years ago. It hasn't \nchanged. It was frozen at that level in 1996.\n\n  The childcare deduction is now capped at $175, and it has been that \nway for 11 years. There has been no increase in the childcare \ndeduction, even though we know childcare costs more money today than it \ndid 11 years ago. So we have had great erosions. Couple that with the \nfact that since 2000, the number of people on food stamps in this \ncountry has gone from 16 million to 26 million.\n  So while the economy may have been good for some people over the last \n5 or 6 years, it was good for people at the top. But if the economy was \nso darn good over the last several years, why did we go from 16 million \non food stamps to 26 million on food stamps? Because for those at the \nbottom, the economy was not very good; thus, the widening gap between \nthe rich and the poor in this country.\n  So it would seem to make sense, if we are going to have some kind of \n``stimulus package,'' the first rule would be do no harm, and then \ntarget it so that it is effective. Ask the economists. They all say the \nbest bang for the buck is when you put it in food stamps. So here is \nour opportunity, both to have some multiplier effects and to help \nstimulate the economy and do what really is morally right, what we \nshould have done a long time ago, and that is to make sure the people \nat the bottom don't keep falling through the safety nets.\n  So I say, I don't know what the Finance Committee is going to do. \nThis is not in their jurisdiction. I understand. They can't do anything \nabout food stamps; that is not in their jurisdiction. But when that \nbill comes up, and when we get it to the floor, I want everyone to be \naware that we are going to have an amendment--and I will have an \namendment on food stamps--to put a significant amount of money into \nfood stamps, about a 20-percent increase in food stamps for the next \nyear. That gives us 12 months.\n  Now, why 12 months rather than 6 months or 7 months or 8 months? \nWell,\n\n[[Page S420]]\n\nfirst of all, we have a farm bill in which both the House and the \nSenate addressed some of these longstanding problems in the food stamp \nstructure. I don't know when that farm bill is going to get passed. The \nPresident has threatened to veto it. We will get it done sometime. \nSooner or later we will get this farm bill done--hopefully, in the next \nmonth or so. But then the changes that have to take place to change the \nsystem so we can begin to increase the asset level, take the cap off of \nthe childcare deduction, and then take a standard deduction and factor \nin inflation for that, that takes time. We will not get it done right \naway. I think it would be the height of cruelty to say to people who \nneed this food and who need food stamps that we are going to increase \nit for 6 months and then we are going to take it away. Now, at least if \nyou get a rebate--as I said, I am not in favor of all of these checks \ngoing out, but if you are going to get a check, you can save it for a \nrainy day or you can do something like that. But with food stamps, you \ncan't do that. So if you get food stamps, and we say, OK, we will \nincrease your food stamps, you can buy a little better protein, you can \neat a little bit better for 6 months, and then we are going to cut it \noff.\n  Keep in mind that right now, under our Food Stamp Program, the amount \nof money a person gets per meal on food stamps is $1--$1--$1. Have you \never tried eating a meal for a dollar? Try it sometime.\n  So what we are talking about is not lavish living. We are talking \nabout giving people just the basic necessities. So, again, this is our \nchance to do something that is morally right and at the same time \ntarget our help in stimulating the economy.\n  Second only to that would be increasing unemployment benefits. People \nwho have been unemployed for a long time need to have it extended, to \nhave their unemployment benefits extended. That also has a big \nmultiplier effect. Also, close on the heels of that in terms of \nbenefiting the economy is the money that we use to build our \ninfrastructure; that is, the roads and the bridges, the school \nbuildings, the sewer and water systems, government buildings. It would \nbe things like community development block grants that we put out to \nour cities and communities to do construction projects.\n  So it seems to me, again, if we are going to put money out there, \nthis is what we ought to be doing. We have billions of dollars of \nconstruction that is needed to be done in this country on school \nbuildings, classrooms, bridges--need I mention Minnesota--highways. Our \nhighway system is falling apart, that great interstate highway system \nthat we built, and I worked on when I was in high school, well over a \nhalf a century old. Keep in mind when it was built, we didn't have the \ntruck traffic then that we have today. So we need to put money into the \ninfrastructure. Those jobs are ready to go by May. By the time these \nchecks would get out they are talking about, you would have people \nstarting to go to work.\n  The benefits of putting money into an infrastructure project are \nmultiple. There are multiple benefits. First of all, the work is done \nlocally. You can't outsource it to India or China. Obviously, if you \nare going to build a schoolhouse, you have to hire people locally to do \nit. So the work is done locally.\n  Secondly, almost all of the materials used in any kind of \ninfrastructure project, whether it is cement or reinforcing rods or \nwhether it is carpeting or doors or windows or lights, heating and air-\nconditioning systems, drywall--you name it--almost all of that is made \nin America. Maybe not all of it, but the vast majority of it is made in \nthis country. So the ripple effect throughout our economy is great when \nyou do an infrastructure project. You put people to work. Most of the \nmaterials and stuff you buy are American made.\n  Third, once you do this, you have something of lasting good to our \neconomy, something that helps the free enterprise system function \nbetter.\n  When our roads and highways are plugged up with traffic and it can't \nmove, that hurts business. When we don't have adequate clean water and \nsewer systems for communities, businesses can't locate and, therefore, \noperate efficiently. When we don't have the best schools in America \nwith the best facilities, the high-speed hookups to the Internet, when \nwe don't have schools which are the jewel of a neighborhood--the best \nthing that kids would ever see in their activities during the week \nwould be the school--not the mall, not the theater, not the sports \narena but their school. What if that was the nicest thing in every \nneighborhood? I tend to think that would help our teachers to teach \nbetter, our recruitment of teachers, and give kids more incentive to \nstudy. But it provides a lasting benefit for this country. So mark me \ndown as one who is--I am just more than a little cautious and maybe a \nlittle bit more conservative on this idea of sending everybody a check. \nI think people would be better off and our economy would be better off \nif we did those three things: Do something on the food side for the \npeople who are hardest hit in our economy, extend unemployment \nbenefits, and put a slug of money into infrastructure.\n\n  That is what we ought to tell President Bush. That is what we ought \nto tell the White House. That is our program. That is the Democrats' \nprogram for this country: to put people back to work, not just to send \neverybody a check, but let's give everybody a job. Let's give them jobs \nout there that will build our country. The multiplier effect on that is \nenormous. But if you are just going to send somebody a check, that is \nit. They might just tend to buy something made in China or Japan or who \nknows where else. That is just not the best thing for our long-term \neconomy and not for what we want to do in this country.\n  So, once again, it seems as though we look for short-term solutions \nto long-term problems. Our long-term problems are the infrastructure of \nthis country and the fact that we don't have a good job base for people \nin this country--long-term problems. We are importing more and more and \nmore from overseas. I listened to the President last night in his State \nof the Union message when he talked about how exports are up. He didn't \nmention how much more imports were up over exports. He just didn't even \nmention that. We are in hock to China up to our eyeballs, and it is \ngetting worse not better. So we are going to send everybody $500 and \ntell them to go spend some money on things probably made in China.\n  So, again, I don't think we ought to roll over. I don't think we \nought to block anything. But I think we ought to come up with a package \nthat does something for our economy. The things I just outlined I think \nwill do more for our economy than sending everybody a $300, $500, or \nmaybe a $1,200 check.\n  Lastly, I see there is some talk about sending everybody a check--no \nincome limit. Well, I thought the income limits in the House were too \nhigh: $75,000, $150,000 for a couple, so you could get up to 1,200 \nbucks. I just don't think that is logical, and I don't think it is \nhealthy. I don't think it is good for our country. I don't think it is \ngood for the long-term health of our economy.\n  So I hope we can work together in a bipartisan atmosphere to come up \nwith a package that is not just throwing money at the problem but \ntargets it, and targets it to those areas that will be effective in \nputting people back to work, helping people at the bottom of the \nladder, and providing for the long-term economic underpinning of our \ncountry.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/29/senate-section/article/S420-1", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S420-S423]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  FISA\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today as a member of the Select \nCommittee on Intelligence to discuss the pending legislation to \nmodernize the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act that was originally \npassed in 1978. At the outset of my remarks I would like to first \nexpress my sincerest appreciation to the chairman of the committee, \nSenator Rockefeller, and the vice chair, Senator Bond, for their \nexceptional leadership in working in a concerted, cooperative manner to \nshepherd the Intelligence Committee bill through the legislative \nprocess in a strong, bipartisan manner.\n  As my colleagues know, the act is set to expire on February 1--less \nthan a week from now. It is imperative that Congress pass legislation \nreflecting the\n\n[[Page S421]]\n\nwill of this body and send it to the President's desk for enactment. At \na time when al-Qaida lurks in the shadows, making no distinctions \nbetween combatants and noncombatants, between our battlefields and our \nbackyards, we as lawmakers must work with firm resolve to ensure that \nthe intelligence community possesses the tools and the legal authority \nthat is required to prevent future terrorist attacks on our soil. Yet \nin the wake of years of controversy surrounding the Terrorist \nSurveillance Program, we all must be mindful of our duties to uphold \nthe constitutional protections as old as this Republic. I do not \nbelieve these goals are mutually exclusive.\n  The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, commonly known as FISA, \nestablishes a distinct system of laws and regulations for the \nGovernment's ability to legally conduct national security-related \nsurveillance of communications. The Intelligence Committee proposal, \nwhich was reported out on a strong 13-to-2 bipartisan vote, does not \npresent the ideal solution to the urgent matter before us, underscoring \nthe difficulties and complexities that are presented by the question of \nintelligence surveillance. However, it is a marked improvement over the \nProtect America Act and represents the collective agreement of 13 of \nthe 15 members of the Intelligence Committee, both Republicans and \nDemocrats. I appreciate the disparate views that many of my colleagues \non both sides of this aisle espouse, but in the end, the Senate must \nwork to achieve its will and to find the common ground that is so \nessential on this issue for our Nation's security. For Congress to be \nrelevant, it must ultimately come to a legislative resolution and \nconclusion.\n\n  The underlying premise of FISA recognizes that obtaining a standard \nsearch warrant through a typical Federal or State court is not \nappropriate when dealing with sensitive security operations and highly \nclassified information. In creating separate legal mechanisms for such \nmatters, FISA has, for nearly 30 years, relied upon the rulings of the \nspecial Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court and continuous \ncongressional oversight in ensuring that fourth amendment protections \nagainst unreasonable searches and seizures are respected. Although FISA \nis and remains an indispensable tool in the war on terror, it was \nwritten almost 30 years ago--long before the name ``al-Qaida'' rang \nwith any significance--and it has begun to show its age.\n  FISA was enacted before cell phones, before e-mail, and before the \nInternet, all of which are used today by hundreds of millions of people \nacross the globe. Unfortunately, those numbers include terrorists who \nare using these tools for planning, training, and coordination of their \noperations. Put simply, FISA's technology-centered provisions do not \ncorrespond to the systems and apparati that are used in communications \ntoday. As Admiral McConnell, Director of National Intelligence, said \nmost bluntly and straightforwardly:\n\n       FISA's definition of electronic surveillance [has] simply \n     not [kept] pace with technology.\n\n  But we all know this is not the only backdrop to FISA \nreauthorization. Prior to December 2005, only the party leaders in both \nthe House and the Senate, and the chairmen and ranking members of those \nHouses' respective Intelligence Committees--the so-called gang of \neight--had any knowledge that warrantless surveillance was occurring on \nU.S. soil with neither court approval nor congressional authorization. \nOnce the program came to light, the administration asserted it had the \nlegal authority to conduct such surveillance anyway, citing \nconsiderably tenuous interpretations of both article II of the \nConstitution and the 2002 authorization for the use of military force \nin Iraq.\n  This was not the power-sharing construct between the three branches \nof Government under which FISA had operated for nearly three decades. \nRather, this was a unilateral exercise of executive branch authority to \nthe exclusion of the other two. The use of unchecked executive power \nwas neither how the Framers of the Constitution nor the framers of FISA \nintended this matter to be addressed.\n  Accordingly, less than 2 months later, I, along with Senators DeWine, \nHagel, and Graham, introduced the Terrorist Surveillance Act of 2006, \nwhich called for strict legislative oversight and judicial review of \nthe program. A number of colleagues joined the effort with a variety of \nadditional proposals to both exert congressional oversight, as well as \nto modernize FISA; and the administration, bowing to this collective \ncongressional pressure, finally permitted full access to the NSA \nprogram by members and staff of both Intelligence Committees. \nCongressional leverage also led the Attorney General this past January \nto submit the terrorist surveillance program to the requirements of \nFISA, including appropriate review of Stateside surveillance requests \nby the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. At the time this was \nviewed as a step toward some restoration of the rule of law and \nconstitutional principles, and FISA reform efforts focused on \nmodernizing the statute for technological purposes.\n  Yet, as noted in the Intelligence Committee's report on the FISA \nAmendments Act of 2007,\n\n       At the end of May 2007 . . . attention was drawn to a \n     ruling of the FISA court . . . that the DNI later described \n     as significantly diverting NSA analysts from their \n     counterterrorism mission to provide information to the Court. \n     In late July, the DNI informed Congress that the decision . . \n     . had led to degraded capabilities in the face of a \n     heightened terrorist threat environment.\n\n  FISA reform efforts quickly shifted to addressing this gap. Congress \nresponded this past August by passing the bipartisan Protect America \nAct, a law which cleared the Senate 60 to 28. Although an imperfect \nstatute, it granted the DNI the tools necessary to protect our homeland \nat a time when there were well-documented gaps in our intelligence \ngathering. Congress wisely employed a 6-month sunset to ensure that the \nshortcomings of this temporary law could be explored at length and \nproperly corrected. The bill before the Senate today is a product of \nthat 4-month deliberation, and given all that I have just outlined, \nclearly the time has now come to take precise and concrete action.\n  The Intelligence Committee has been guided by its vast expertise in \noverseeing American intelligence operations, and this proposal sorts \nout the confusion of the past several years and replaces legal gray \nareas with clear bright line rules. Central to this revision is the \nrole of the FISA Court--a critical step in this process, as the courts \nmust play a prominent role whenever fourth amendment concerns are at \nstake.\n  The bill rightly maintains the rule that no court order is required \nwhen targeting communications abroad, and clarifies that this remains \nthe case even if, for example, a foreign-to-foreign e-mail transits a \nserver located on U.S. soil. However, the bill would, going forward, \nallow for so-called ``umbrella surveillance'' only under the following \nconditions: First, it may be conducted for 1 year. Secondly, the DNI \nand the Attorney General must certify that such operations would target \nonly those individuals reasonably believed to be outside of the United \nStates. Third, the FISA Court must receive and approve the minimization \nprocedures to ensure that any ``inadvertent collection'' is promptly \ndestroyed.\n  More importantly, where the target is located within the United \nStates, or where the target is a U.S. citizen or a permanent resident \nanywhere in the world, the bill now requires that a warrant first be \nobtained from the FISA Court. The FISA Court--only the FISA Court--will \nhave the authority to determine that there is probable cause to believe \nthat the U.S. person in question is an agent of a foreign power. Only \nthen may a warrant be issued, and only then may targeted surveillance \ncommence. This is a strong and substantial improvement over the \nprovisions of the Protect America Act.\n  It is noteworthy that this bill, if passed, would recognize for the \nfirst time ever the right of a U.S. citizen or permanent resident to be \nfree from warrantless surveillance by the U.S. Government even when \nsuch person is abroad. As our colleague Senator Wyden said in \nthe Washington Post on December 10, this is a change that was \ncontemplated back in 1978 but which never received the attention \nnecessary from Congress to become law.\n\n  Finally, the bill authorizes the inspectors general of the Department \nof\n\n[[Page S422]]\n\nJustice and elements of the intelligence community to conduct \nindependent reviews of agency compliance with the court-approved \nacquisition and minimization procedures--adding another independent \ncheck to ensure that the agencies charged with implementing the program \nare in fact complying with the court order and minimizing any \ninformation that was inadvertently collected.\n  This is not to say that the Judiciary Committee substitute was not \nsuperior in some regards. For example, it contained far stronger \nlanguage asserting that the FISA Court and the Federal Criminal Code \nare the exclusive means by which the U.S. Government may conduct \nsurveillance, counteracting allegations by the administration that the \n2002 authorization of the use of military force against Iraq provided \nan alternate statutory authority.\n  To be clear, the Intelligence Committee bill does state that such a \nrestriction applies to ``electronic surveillance.'' In fact, I felt \nstrongly about this provision, and that is why I joined other \ncolleagues on the Intelligence Committee in submitting additional \ncomments regarding this provision--specifically that FISA is the \nexclusive means by which the U.S. Government may conduct surveillance. \nYet the Judiciary Committee bill took this one step further, expanding \nexclusivity to cover any ``communications or communications \ninformation,'' a broader term meant to reach even those communications \nnot covered under the more narrowly defined category of ``electronic \nsurveillance.''\n  Yet, on balance, the Intelligence Committee legislation reflects the \ncommittee's expertise in this field, and it presents a bipartisan \napproach for restoring order to the state of the law surrounding \nGovernment surveillance.\n  As the Intelligence Committee report noted, the committee held seven \nhearings in 2007 on these issues, received numerous classified \nbriefings, propounded and received answers to numerous written \nquestions, and conducted extensive interviews with several attorneys in \nthe executive branch who were involved in the review of the President's \nprogram. In addition, the committee received formal testimony from the \ncompanies alleged to have participated in the program and reviewed \ncorrespondence that was provided to private sector entities concerning \nthe President's program.\n  The committee secured IG reports and the orders and opinions issued \nby the FISA Court following the shift of activity to the judicial \nsupervision of the FISA Court and invited comments from experts on \nnational security law and civil liberties. The committee also examined \nextensive testimony given before other committees in the last several \nyears and visited the NSA, carefully scrutinizing the program's \nimplementation.\n  The underlying committee bill vests significant authority--and \nrightfully so--in the FISA Court to authorize targeting of U.S. persons \nand to sign off on minimization procedures of any nontargeting \nsurveillance. It further modernizes FISA so that its terms apply \nrationally to today's technology, and streamlines procedures to ensure \nthat the men and women in our intelligence community can maximize their \nfocus on detecting threats to our homeland. It does all of this while \nemploying the Intelligence Committee's technical expertise to avoid any \nunintended consequences.\n  I wish to focus the remainder of my remarks on what has become the \nflashpoint of controversy--whether to grant retroactive immunity to the \nnumerous telecommunications companies who have been sued for allegedly \nproviding private customer information to the Government in violation \nof the law. I believe that this narrow, limited grant of immunity is a \nproper course of action for these reasons:\n  First, it is critical to note and understand that a grant of immunity \nto telecom providers for assisting the Government is not a novel \nconcept, but rather a longstanding component of existing law. \nSpecifically, the Federal Criminal Code already states that ``no cause \nof action shall lie in any court against any provider . . . for \nproviding information, facilities, or assistance'' to the Federal \nGovernment in conducting electronic surveillance if the company is \npresented with either a court order or a certification signed by the \nAttorney General stating that ``no warrant or court order is required \nby law, that all statutory requirements have been met, and that the \nspecific assistance is required.''\n  Why, then, must the bill before us contain an immunity provision for \ncommunications firms? The answer is that they are unable to invoke it \nbecause the very existence of whether a particular company--or any \ncompany--did or did not participate in any alleged surveillance has \nbeen designated as a state secret by the U.S. Government. This places \nthe telecom companies in a Catch-22 scenario: if, hypothetically, a \ncompany did assist the Government, it cannot reveal that fact under the \nState Secrets Doctrine, and thus cannot claim the benefit of immunity; \nconversely, if a company did not provide any alleged assistance, it \nstill cannot demonstrate that fact to conclusively dismiss the lawsuit, \nagain because of the mandates of the State Secrets Doctrine. In the 40-\nplus active lawsuits, defendant telecom companies are in a ``no-win \nsituation.''\n  To those who may ask why Congress should concern itself with \naddressing these pending lawsuits, I would answer that the credibility \nand effectiveness of America's intelligence community depends upon it. \nParticularly in the wake of the devastating attacks of September 11, \n2001, any American company that, when reportedly presented with proper \ncertification, assisted the Government in a matter of national security \nwas doing so, in all likelihood, in the best interests of our Nation. \nAnd punishing such cooperation through subsequent lawsuits could have \ndrastic future consequences.\n  This position has been asserted by former Attorney General John \nAshcroft and former Deputy Attorney General James Comey, both of whom \nhad well-documented misgivings about the administration's approach to \nsurveillance. This view is also held by the distinguished chairman of \nthe Intelligence Committee, who on October 31 of this year wrote in the \nWashington Post that the telecom lawsuits are ``unfair and unwise. As \nthe operational details of the program remain highly classified, the \ncompanies are prevented from defending themselves in court. And if we \nrequire them to face a mountain of lawsuits, we risk losing their \nsupport in the future''--a development that Chairman Rockefeller \nassessed would be ``devastating to the intelligence community, the \nJustice Department and military officials who are hunting down our \nenemies.''\n  The immunity provision in this bill is narrow and limited. First, it \nis only retroactive. It clearly delineates what types of surveillance \nrequire a search warrant from the FISA Court and what types do not. The \nvery fact that the FISA Court will be involved contrasts starkly with \nthe ``gray area'' under which the Terrorist Surveillance Program had \noperated prior to January of this year. This clarity will thus also \nmake it clear as to whether a telecom company is complying with a \nlawful request and thus whether it will be entitled to statutory \nimmunity.\n\n  As the Intelligence Committee report underscored, the action the \ncommittee proposes should be understood by the executive branch and \nprovided as a one-time response to an unparalleled national experience \nin the midst of which representations were made that assistance to the \nGovernment was authorized and lawful.\n  In doing so, the underlying legislation acts prospectively to guard \nagainst any future infringements of constitutional liberties that might \noccur. By contrast, striking title II will accomplish nothing \nconstructive in the future. To the contrary, as I indicated, it may be \ncounterproductive by discouraging future cooperation by private \nentities.\n  Second, the bill only grants immunity for civil lawsuits. It would \nnot provide amnesty to anyone--the telecommunications companies, \nGovernment officials or any other party--who engaged in any potential \ncriminal wrongdoing. Should any criminal allegations arise against \ntelecommunications officers, Government officials or others, such \ninvestigations would not be prevented by this provision. Nothing in \nthis bill is intended to affect any of the pending suits against the \nGovernment or individual Government officials.\n  Third, this provision does not make any determination as to whether \nthe\n\n[[Page S423]]\n\nprogram in question was legal. It only grants the telecommunications \ncarriers immunity if the Attorney General certifies those carriers \ncooperated with intelligence activities designed to detect or prevent a \nterrorist attack and that such a request was made in writing and with \nthe assertion that the program was authorized by the President and \ndetermined to be lawful.\n  Finally, this bill provides the fairest course of action for \naddressing corporations that, when presented with an urgent official \nrequest at a critical period for our Nation's security, acted in a \npatriotic manner and provided assistance in defending this Nation. \nThese companies were assured that their cooperation was not only legal \nbut necessary and essential because of their unique technical \ncapabilities. Also note that the President initially authorized the NSA \nprogram in the early days and weeks after the September 11 attacks, \nattacks that shocked our Nation and forced us to quickly react and \nadjust to the new reality of the 21st century, where terrorism was \noccurring in our own backyard. If a telecommunications company was \napproached by Government officials asking for assistance in warding off \nanother terrorist attack and those Government officials produced a \ndocument stating the President had authorized that specific activity \nand that activity was regarded as legal, could we say the company acted \nunreasonably in complying with this request?\n  In the interest of protecting our Nation in this new environment of \nthe 21st century and bringing stability and certainty to the men and \nwomen who are in our intelligence community as they carry out their \nvery vital and critical missions in defending and preserving our \nfreedoms at home, I urge passage of FISA reform that is bipartisan, \nthat respects an active balance among all branches of Government, that \nwill establish a key role for the courts going forward in evaluating \nsurveillance measures in the United States and against U.S. persons \nabroad and that we will allow the intelligence community to devote its \nfull efforts to fighting and winning the war on terror.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Pryor).

I rise today to speak about the war in Iraq. There is a \nlot of talk in this Chamber and across this town and across the country \nabout our economy, and that is justifiable. But we have to remember \nthat in the midst of a difficult economy in America, there is a lot to \ntalk about and to work on to respond to that. We still have a war in \nIraq to worry about, to debate, and to take action on. I don't think we \ncan lose sight of a war that grinds on without end in Iraq.\n  This war does burden our troops, obviously, with repeated and \nprolonged deployments and, in fact, drains our national resources. The \nwar hampers our efforts in places such as Afghanistan and Pakistan, the \nreal frontlines in the global struggle against Islamic terrorism and \nextremism.\n  So we must ask ourselves at least a couple of questions when it comes \nto the war in Iraq. There are many, but there are at least a few I can \nthink of.\n  What are we in the Congress doing about this war today, this week, \nthis month, and in the months ahead, even as we struggle to deal with a \ndifficult economy?\n  The second question might be: When will the Iraqi Government start \nserious discussions on national reconciliation?\n  Third, how will we know when we have achieved our objectives in Iraq? \nHow will we know that?\n  Finally, and I think the most compelling question is: When will our \ntroops come home?\n  Last night, the President spoke about a number of topics, and one was \nthe economy. One of the first words the President said with regard to \nthe economy, he talked about a time of uncertainty. Mr. President--\nPresident Bush I mean--I disagree. With regard to the economy, this is \nnot about something that is uncertain. It is very certain. The lives of \nAmericans, the perilous and traumatic economy they are living through \nis not uncertain or vague or foggy. It is very certain. The cost of \neverything in the life of a family is going through the roof, and we \nhave to make sure we respond to that situation.\n  I argue that word ``uncertainty'' does apply when it comes to the war \nin Iraq in terms of our policy. I would argue to the President what is \nuncertain, if there is uncertainty out there in our land, it is about \nthe war in Iraq. Uncertainty, frankly, about what our plan is in Iraq \nand what is this administration and this Congress doing to deal with \nthis war in Iraq. That is where the uncertainty is. I think the reality \nof the economy is very certain for American families.\n  While the headlines about Iraq have all but vanished from the front \npages and television screens and the administration continues to divert \nattention elsewhere, we have a fundamental obligation as elected \nrepresentatives of the American people to continue to focus on the war \nuntil we change the policy and bring our troops home.\n  We marked the first year anniversary of the President's decision to \ninitiate a troop escalation in Iraq, and we are coming upon the fifth \nanniversary of the invasion of Iraq.\n  Last night, in his State of the Union Address, the President \ndescribed the surge in very positive terms. Make no mistake about it--\nwe all know this--our soldiers have succeeded in their mission with \nbravery and heroism and violence in many parts of Iraq is, in fact, \ndown. Yet despite all that, despite all that effort, despite all that \nwork, Iraq today is still not a secure nation, and it will not be \nsecure until its leaders can leave the Green Zone without fear of \nassassination. It will not be secure until they can leave the Green \nZone without fear of suicide bombings. It will not be secure until its \nown national Army and police forces can stand up and protect all of \nIraq's people without regard to ethnicity or creed.\n  In assessing whether the surge has worked, we should pay attention to \nthe President's words from a year ago. President Bush declared in \nJanuary 2007, when he first announced the surge:\n\n       Iraqis will gain confidence in their leaders and the \n     government will have the breathing space it needs to make \n     progress in other critical areas.\n\n  Those are the President's words. So let's judge this issue by his \nwords. Judged by those standards enunciated by the President, we can \nonly conclude the surge has not worked, if that is what the objective \nwas. I add to that, when I was in Iraq in August and I talked with \nAmbassador Crocker about the terminology used by this administration \nwith regard to the war, because I said sometimes the terminology is way \noff and misleading, he said: The way I judge what is happening here is\n\n[[Page S424]]\n\nwhether we can achieve sustainable stability. That is what he said, \nsustainable stability.\n  Based upon what Ambassador Crocker said and based upon what the \nPresident said, if we measure what is happening now against those \nstandards, the surge has not worked, based upon those assertions by the \nAmbassador and by the President.\n  The troop escalation did not prompt the Iraqi Government to make the \nhard choices or to meet the benchmarks laid out by the administration. \nAs General Petraeus told me in that same meeting this past summer in \nBaghdad, the war in Iraq can only be won politically, not militarily, \nand he said that on the public record as well. But on national \nreconciliation, oil sharing, and other key issues where Iraqis must \nforge agreement in order to allow U.S. forces to eventually withdraw, \nwe do not see nearly enough progress. In fact, the evidence of \nsubstantial progress is very bleak.\n  We heard recently about things that have been happening in Iraq. \nAlthough the Iraqi Parliament passed a debaathification measure this \npast month, it is unclear how far the legislation will go toward \naddressing Sunni concerns, since serious disagreements exist on the \nlaw's implementation. Some contend that former Baathists will still be \nbarred from important ministries such as Justice, Interior, and \nDefense.\n  As has often occurred in the past, once again the Iraqi political \nleadership has chosen to avoid the hard choices and instead kick the \ncan down the road, ensuring further bloodshed and national \nfragmentation in the interim.\n  We all know how long this war has endured. It has endured longer than \nthe war we know as World War II. It is longer than that war, with over \n3,900 dead, 178 Pennsylvanians, the number of wounded in Pennsylvania \nis about 1,200 or more; across the country, 28,000. Our military forces \nhave done everything we have asked of them. They have matched the \nbravery and success in every way possible of those great American \nwarriors who preceded them in past conflicts. But our troops, the best \nfighting men and women in the world, cannot force a foreign government \nto be stable, they cannot force the Iraqi national police to put aside \ntheir deep-seated sectarianism and corruption, and they cannot force \nIraqi political leaders to want progress as much as our troops do and \nas much as the Iraqi people deserve.\n  We have much to do to make progress. But here is what is happening \nlately. This is a very important point, and I conclude with it. The \nPresident is showing every sign that he intends, in the waning days of \nhis administration, to lock the United States and, in particular, to \nlock our fighting men and women into a long-term strategic commitment \nin Iraq without consultation with the elected representatives of the \nAmerican people in Congress. He has signaled to the Iraqi Government \nthat the United States can maintain significant U.S. troop levels in \nIraq for at least 10 years--10 years--if not longer. He seeks to \nnegotiate a long-term strategic agreement with the Iraqi Government \nthat would commit the United States to providing security assurances to \nthe Iraqi Government against external aggression--an unprecedented \ncommitment that could embroil the United States in a future regional \nconflict or even a full-scale Iraqi civil war. The President's senior \naides have proposed that such an agreement would need to be ratified by \nthe Iraqi Parliament--the Iraqi Parliament--and bypass the U.S. \nCongress. That is unacceptable to me and I think to anyone in this body \nand to the American people, and it is why five other Members of this \nbody joined me in December in sending a letter to the President stating \nthat the Congress must be a full and coequal partner in extending such \nlong-term commitments.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nmy letter of December 6, 2007, to the President.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, December 6, 2007.\n     President George W. Bush,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President:  We write you today regarding the \n     ``Declaration of Principles'' agreed upon last week between \n     the United States and Iraq outlining the broad scope of \n     discussions to be held over the next six months to \n     institutionalize long term U.S.-Iraqi cooperation in the \n     political, economic, and security realms. It is our \n     understanding that these discussions seek to produce a \n     strategic framework agreement, no later than July 31, 2008, \n     to help define ``a long-term relationship of cooperation and \n     friendship as two fully sovereign and independent states with \n     common interests''.\n       The future of American policy towards Iraq, especially in \n     regard to the issues of U.S. troop levels, permanent U.S. \n     military bases, and future security commitments, has \n     generated strong debate among the American people and their \n     elected representatives. Agreements between our two countries \n     relating to these issues must involve the full participation \n     and consent of the Congress as a co-equal branch of the U.S. \n     government. Furthermore, the future U.S. presence in Iraq is \n     a central issue in the current Presidential campaign. We \n     believe a security commitment that obligates the United \n     States to go to war on behalf of the Government of Iraq at \n     this time is not in America's long-term national security \n     interest and does not reflect the will of the American \n     people. Commitments made during the final year of your \n     Presidency should not unduly or artificially constrain your \n     successor when it comes to Iraq.\n       In particular, we want to convey our strong concern \n     regarding any commitments made by the United States with \n     respect to American security assurances to Iraq to help deter \n     and defend against foreign aggression or other violations of \n     Iraq's territorial integrity. Security assurances, once made, \n     cannot be easily rolled back without incurring a great cost \n     to America's strategic credibility and imperiling the \n     stability of our nation's other alliances around the world. \n     Accordingly, security assurances must be extended with great \n     care and only in the context of broad bipartisan agreement \n     that such assurances serve our abiding national interest. \n     Such assurances, if legally binding, are generally made in \n     the context of a formal treaty subject to the advice and \n     consent of the U.S. Senate but in any case cannot be made \n     without Congressional authorization.\n       Our unease is heightened by remarks made on November 26th \n     by General Douglas Lute, the Assistant to the President for \n     Iraq and Afghanistan, that Congressional input is not \n     foreseen. General Lute was quoted as asserting at a White \n     House press briefing, ``We don't anticipate now that these \n     negotiations will lead to the status of a formal treaty which \n     would then bring us to formal negotiations or formal inputs \n     from the Congress.'' It is unacceptable for your \n     Administration to unilaterally fashion a long-term \n     relationship with Iraq without the full and comprehensive \n     participation of Congress from the very start of such \n     negotiations.\n       We look forward to learning more details as the \n     Administration commences negotiations with the Iraqi \n     government on the contours of long-term political, economic, \n     and security ties between our two nations. We trust you agree \n     that the proposed extension of longterm U.S. security \n     commitments to a nation in a critical region of the world \n     requires the full participation and consent of the Congress \n     as a co-equal branch of our government.\n           Sincerely,\n     Robert P. Casey, Jr.,\n     Robert C. Byrd,\n     Edward M. Kennedy,\n     Jim Webb,\n     Hillary Rodham Clinton,\n     Carl Levin,\n                                           United States Senators.\n\n  Mr. CASEY. We now learn that the President, in signing the Department \nof Defense authorization bill into law yesterday, has once again taken \nthe opportunity to issue another infamous signing statement, imposing \nhis own interpretation of a law over the clear intent of the Congress.\n  Let's not forget that this important legislation has been needlessly \ndelayed for weeks because the President wanted to defer to concerns of \nthe Iraqi Government over compensation for U.S. victims of Saddam \nHussein's acts of terrorism. Let me repeat that. A critical pay raise \nfor our troops was delayed because a foreign government raised concerns \nwith this White House.\n  In signing the Department of Defense authorization bill into law, the \nPresident declared his right to ignore--ignore--several important \nprovisions, including the establishment of an important special \ncommission to review wartime contracting. This provision was an \ninitiative of the Senate Democratic freshmen class, led by Senators \nWebb and McCaskill. The President also declared his right to ignore a \nprovision prohibiting funding for U.S. military bases or installations \nin Iraq that facilitate ``permanent station'' of U.S. troops in Iraq.\n  Let me say that again in plain language. This provision sought to \nprevent the United States from establishing permanent bases in Iraq, \nand\n\n[[Page S425]]\n\nthe President has indicated he may ignore--ignore--this provision. \nEvery time senior administration officials are asked about permanent \nmilitary bases in Iraq, they contend it is not their intention to \nconstruct such facilities. Yet this signing statement issued by the \nPresident yesterday is the clearest signal yet that the administration \nwants to hold this option in reserve. This is exactly the wrong signal \nto send both to the Iraqi Government and its neighbors in the region \nand to others as well.\n  Permanent U.S. military bases gives a blank check to an Iraqi \ngovernment that has shown no evidence that it is ready to step up and \ntake full responsibility for what happens in Iraq. Permanent U.S. \nmilitary bases feeds the propaganda of our enemies, who argue that the \nU.S. invasion in 2003 was carried out to secure access to Iraq's oil \nand establish a strategic beachhead for the U.S. military in the \nregion. Permanent U.S. military bases means U.S. troops will be in Iraq \nfor years to come, ensuring that the great strain on the American \nmilitary will continue indefinitely.\n  Finally, and I will conclude with this, we have a lot on our plate \nthis year to deal with. We have the economy to deal with and so many \nother difficult issues, but the war in Iraq continues to be a central \nforeign policy challenge faced by the President, by the Congress, and \nby the Nation. When this President departs office after 8 years, he \nshould not--should not--commit our soldiers and our Nation to 10 more \nyears--10 more years--if not longer, and hundreds of billions of \ndollars, if not more, spent on the war in Iraq.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, it is my understanding, under a previous \nunanimous consent request, that I would be recognized for up to 35 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/29/senate-section/article/S425-1", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S425-S428]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            THE THIRD REASON\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I don't very often do this, but I am going \nto make a presentation today, and I would like to give it a title, and \nthe title is ``The Third Reason.'' The subtitle very likely could be \n``The third reason we are winning in Iraq, and we should be in Iraq.''\n  I have to say that I have had occasion to be there many times, and \nthere is no doubt in my mind and, I don't doubt, in many people's minds \nthat we are actually winning in Iraq. But before I address this, I \nwould like to point out something very few people are aware of; that \nis, the mess that was inherited by George W. Bush right after 9/11.\n  First of all, if we look back during the 1990s, there was this \neuphoric attitude that the Cold War was over and we no longer needed a \nnational defense system. So during the 1990s, during the Clinton \nadministration, we started decimating the system. And I have the \ndocumentation here because a lot of people don't understand this.\n  If you would take what happened in the first year, or the last year \nof the previous administration over the first year the Clintons had \ncontrol of the budget, and if we had taken a flat amount to determine \nhow much we were going to be spending on defending America, then draw a \nstraight line and only add into that the inflation--in other words, \nthat is what it would be if we didn't do anything else--well, the \nbudget that came from the White House is this red line down here. If \nyou take the difference between the red line and what would have been a \nflat budget, it is $412 billion. In other words, $412 billion came out \nof our defense system. However, the good news was that Congress looked \nat that and said that is too big of a cut, so they intervened and \nraised President Clinton's budget up to this brown line in the middle. \nSo what was inherited by this President was an amount $313 billion less \nthan it would have been if it had just been a static amount.\n  Now, that would have been bad enough--and I have always contended we \nhave to make that the No. 1 priority in America: to defend America--but \nto make it worse, on 9/11 we went to war, and then we were pushed into \na situation of going into and liberating Iraq, and all of a sudden, \npeople started standing on the floor of the Senate and saying things \nlike: Well, how in the world could this President be getting into \ndeficits, how could he be spending so much, and all of this. This is \nthe reason: because we started off $313 billion less than during the \ntime period of the previous administration. That is the seriousness of \nit.\n  Now, I say that just because I recall so well the confirmation \nhearings for the Secretary of Defense, Secretary Rumsfeld. During his \nconfirmation hearings, they were making statements at that time about \nwhat were they going to do with the problems that were there and that \nwe are underfunded in the military, that our modernization program has \ngone sideways, our force strength is not what it should be, and what \nshould we do about that. This was all live on TV.\n  During the confirmation hearing--and I was on the Senate Armed \nServices Committee--I said: Mr. Rumsfeld, we have a problem I see as \nvery serious, and that is you are going to get all of your generals \naround you, we are going to get all these smart people, and they are \ngoing to be asked what are we going to be confronted with 10 years from \ntoday, and the generals, as smart as they are, are going to be wrong.\n\n  I can remember what I said at that meeting 7 years ago. I said: The \nlast year I was in the House of Representatives, I was attending a \nHouse Armed Services Committee hearing, and in that committee hearing \nan expert witness said: Ten years from now, we will no longer need \nground troops in America.\n  Of course, we saw what happened in Kosovo and Bosnia, and we knew \nthat was wrong. So I said: Since we can't tell where we are going to be \n10 years from now, and there is a lead time in preparing for war or a \ncontingency, what is the answer to this thing? We don't know if we are \ngoing to have the best strike vehicles or lift vehicles or the best \nartillery pieces.\n  He said: I have made a study of that, and you are asking the right \nperson, because in the average year, for the 100 years of the 20th \ncentury, we spent 5.7 percent of our GDP on defense. At the end of the \n1990s, it went down to 2.7 percent.\n  I said: Down to 2.7 percent. Where should it be?\n  He said: We don't know for sure but somewhere in excess of 4 percent, \nprobably 4\\1/2\\ percent, which is still less than it was for the \nprevious several hundred years.\n  That was kind of interesting to me because when you look right now, \nhow many people in America realize there are some things we have that \nare not as good as some of our potential adversaries?\n  I would say that one of my heroes prior to the time he was Chief of \nthe Air Force was GEN John Jumper. General Jumper stood up and said \npublicly--in 1998, I believe it was--he said: Now the Russians are \nmaking a strike vehicle that is better than our best, and he talked \nabout the SU-27s and the SU-30s. Our best were the F-15s and the F-16s. \nThat was a shocking statement. So we started working on the F-22 and \nthe F-35, the Joint Strike Fighter.\n  Right now, the best piece of artillery we have in our arsenal is \nWorld War II technology. It is a Paladin. It is something where you \nhave to get out after every shot and swab the breech the way you did \nback in World War II. So now we are stepping ahead. But this has all \nhappened during this administration, where we now have the new FCS--\nFuture Combat System--that is going to revolutionize, for the first \ntime in probably 40 years, how we fight battles.\n  I only say that because this is something we are going to have to \ncontend with in the future, and it also paints a pretty good picture as \nto where we were when this thing happened on 9/11.\n  I would like to suggest there are three reasons we went into Iraq. \nThe liberation of Iraq is the first one, and that is called to my mind \nnow because I had an experience--you will enjoy this, I say to my good \nfriend from Arkansas, who is occupying the chair--\n\n[[Page S426]]\n\ntwo weekends ago when I happened to be in a place referred to now as \nJFK's winter White House. It was the Kennedy compound in West Palm \nBeach, FL. Ironically, it was sold to a very strong, wealthy, partisan \nRepublican, and we were having an event down there. I looked out to the \naudience when giving a talk, and there were a lot of my heroes, among \nthem Alexander Haig, who was previously Secretary of State under Ronald \nReagan. He told the story of Saddam Hussein, that in 1991--and this is \nright after the first Persian Gulf war--we had what we called the first \nfreedom flight into Kuwait. Now, it was so early in the end of the war \nthat the Iraqis did not know the war was over, and they were still \nburning the fields down there, the oilfields, and all of a sudden, day \nwould turn into night as the wind shifted and smoke went back and \nforth.\n  It wasn't all Republicans, I might add. Tony Cuello, who at that time \nwas the majority whip in the House of Representatives, was there also.\n  Anyway, we had an occasion to go to Kuwait, and one of the persons on \nthat trip was then the Ambassador from Kuwait to the United States, a \nman of nobility, and he had his daughter, who was around 8 years old, \nwith him. They wanted to go see what their home looked like in the \nPersian Gulf. So we went there, only to find out that Saddam Hussein \nhad been using that home as a headquarters. We went up to, I think it \nwas the little girl's bedroom, or one of the bedrooms, and found that \nit had been used as a torture chamber. There were body parts strewn \naround the room, stuffed into walls, and horrible things had been going \non. A little boy had his ear cut off because he was caught with a \nlittle tiny American flag within sight.\n  We talked about the horrible atrocities going on and personally \nwitnessed some stories of individuals, people who were sentenced to a \ntorturous death by Saddam Hussein. Many of them would beg that their \nbody be eased into a vat of acid head first so that they would be able \nto die quicker than feet first.\n  We saw the fact that the weddings, any weddings that were taking \nplace out in the streets at the time of Saddam Hussein, they would raid \nthe weddings, they would kill the people, rape the girls, and bury them \nalive. We saw mass graves, hundreds of people had been buried alive or \ntortured to death.\n  I guess what I would say is, the first reason we went to Iraq, as I \nthink we would go anywhere, our country would go anywhere, is to aid a \ncountry that had this type of Holocaust-type of atrocities taking \nplace. So that was the first reason was to end Saddam Hussein's regime \nof torture. It was successful. We did it.\n  The second reason was because Iraq was a major terrorist-training \narea. There are four areas where they trained. You know about Samara \nand Ramadi because people now realize--they are pretty familiar with \nthat. But you may have forgotten or may never even have known about \nsome of the other areas. Sargat, for example, was an international \nterrorist training camp in northeastern Iraq near the Iranian border. \nIt was run by Ansar al-Islam, a known terrorist organization. Based on \ninformation from the U.S. Army Special Forces, operators who led the \nattack said: It is indeed more than plausible that al-Qaida members \ntrained in that particular training camp.\n  That is in Sargat. The Green Berets discovered, among the dead in \nSargat, foreign ID cards, airline ticket receipts, visas, passports \nfrom Yemen, Sudan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Oman, Tunisia, Morocco, Iran, \nand many other places.\n  At Salman Pak, it was a facility south of Baghdad, and we have a \nnumber of videos and computer disks, documents, and other materials, \nincluding explicit jihadist propaganda, which revealed terrorist \ntraining footage, and the targets were clearly Americans. The foreign \nArabs were being trained as hijackers of airplanes. That is \ninteresting. They had a fuselage of an old Boeing 707 on the ground in \nSalman Pak, where they were training terrorists to hijack airplanes.\n  Now, we have no way of knowing whether those were the perpetrators of \nthe crime that took place on 9/11, but very likely that could have been \nthe case. Now, the bottom line, though, is the second reason for the \nliberation of Iraq was to do away with all of the training camps, the \nfour specific training camps that I am talking about, and we did that.\n  So I would like, before getting into reason No. 3, to kind of compare \nwhat is going on from a perspective that most of you guys probably have \nnot heard; that is, I have had occasion to be in what we call CENTCOM \nand Africa--that is where the major problems are--some 19 times. And \nlet's go back and kind of compare the last three visits there--not the \nlast three but three of the last visits.\n  One was before the surge. It was June of 2006. And that was in the \nwake of Zarqawi's death. We remember that so well. The Iraqis were \noperating under a 6-month-old parliament. Al-Qaida continued to \nchallenge coalition forces throughout Iraq. Things were not going all \nthat well, but the coalition forces did launch 200 raids against al-\nQaida and cleared out some of the strongholds.\n  But I had occasion to talk to Defense Minister Jasim. And in visiting \nwith him, we talked about the current situation in Iraq. And he felt it \ncould be done. It could be done--our people would be able to be trained \nover a period of time with proper training to take care of this. And we \ntalked about some of these things that our press talked about back in \nthe United States.\n  He said the big conflict between Sunnis and the Shias was mostly a \nWestern concept, and he used as evidence of that individuals in his own \nfamily. He happened to be married--I could get this backwards--either \nhe was a Sunni married to a Shia or vice-versa.\n  We had a good discussion. But we could see very clearly that we \nbelieved things might be getting a little better, but they were not as \nbetter as we hoped. Let's fast-forward to May of 2007.\n  I returned to Iraq and visited Ramadi, Fallujah, Baghdad, and some of \nthe other areas. And this is after the surge. The surge took place in \nJanuary. So this was in May; this was 3 months later. So Ramadi went \nfrom being controlled by al-Qaida and hailed as their capital. We might \nremember this. About 15 months ago they had a news conference over \nthere where they said that Ramadi was going to become the capital of \nterrorism in the world, the world capital.\n  Well, by May of 2007 it was under total control, totally secure not \nby U.S. troops but by the Iraqi security forces. The neighborhood \nsecurity watch programs were working. It was kind of like the programs \nwe have in this country. We have a neighborhood watch program, and they \ngo out and they look and see what they can do to make things more \npeaceful.\n  And you have heard the stories of how they would go out and they \nwould take an orange spray can, and they would draw circles around the \nundetonated IEDs. This was going on, and it seemed to be going very \nwell. That is the first time that I realized--I am kind of a slow \nlearner--I realized that the leaders in Iraq were not the political \nleaders but the religious leaders, the clerics and the Imams.\n  Prior to the surge, the average--we had intelligence people there--\nthe average of the messages that were in the mosques on a weekly basis \nwere 80 to 85 percent anti-American. Since April there had not been any \nanti-American messages.\n  The joint security stations seemed to be going very well there. That \nwas where, instead of going back, our troops going back into the Green \nZone in Baghdad after they were out on a raid or doing their work on a \nmission, they would instead go to some of the homes of the Iraqi \nsecurity forces and actually bed down with them, they developed \npersonal, intimate relationships with them.\n  The burden sharing was increasing. Fallujah came under the control of \nthe Iraqi brigade. And that was an area that we might recall where our \nMarines went World-War-II style door to door.\n  In Anbar, it changed from the center of violence to a success story. \nIn Baghdad, the sectarian murders decreased by 30 percent, and joint \nsecurity stations stood up forming deep relationships between the \ncoalition forces and the Iraqis. It was referred to by General Petraeus \nas ``brotherhood of the close fight.''\n\n[[Page S427]]\n\n  And there is some other good news, too. The media became about \nhalfway honest. This was kind of interesting because I can remember on \nearlier trips, the first thing the troops would ask me when I would go \nin is, they would say: Why is it the American people do not understand \nwhat we are doing? Why do they not like us? Why is it the media do not \nlike us?\n  I can remember LTC Tim Ryan. He said, as I have here:\n\n       The inaccurate picture they paint has distorted the world \n     view of the daily realities in Iraq. The result is a further \n     erosion of international support for the United States' \n     efforts there, and a strengthening of the insurgents' resolve \n     and recruiting efforts while weakening our own. Through their \n     incomplete, uninformed and unbalanced reporting, many members \n     of the media covering the war in Iraq are aiding and abetting \n     the enemy.\n\n  Well, that is what I heard from many of them, but this is one that we \ncan actually quote.\n  Well, that is something that is changing. I think we saw a few months \nafter I returned from that trip, two of the journalists--one was \nMichael O'Hanlon, the other Kenneth Pollack--wrote an op-ed piece in \nthe New York Times, and this was actually above the fold on the front \npage, to let you know. If you want to look it up on your Web site, it \nwas July 30, 2007.\n  They said things such as: Troop morale is high, and they had \nconfidence in General Petraeus and his strategy. Civilian fatality \nrates were down roughly a third since the surge began. Streets in \nBaghdad were slowly coming back to life with stores and shoppers and so \nforth. American troop levels in Mosul now numbered only in the hundreds \nfrom where they were before. More Iraqi units are well integrated in \nterms of ethnicity and religion. And, keep in mind, these were \nstatements that were made and were in the New York Times, which has not \nreally been a bastion of support for the President or the war.\n  But here is another one. I happened to see this one September 2, \n2007. Bob Schieffer had an interview televised with Katie Couric. Katie \nCouric is another one who has never been a supporter of the President. \nAnd they said this. This is a quote now. She was responding to \nquestions.\n\n       Well, I was surprised, you know, after I went to eastern \n     Baghdad. I was taken to the Allawi market which is near Haifa \n     street--\n\n  Which several of us have been to--\n\n     which was the scene of a very bloody gun battle back in \n     January, and, you know, the market seemed to be thriving, and \n     there were a lot of people out and about, a lot of family-\n     owned businesses and vegetable stalls, and so you do see \n     signs of life that seem to be normal. . . . The situation is \n     improving.\n\n  That was not me. That was not Senator Jim Inhofe who has always been \nsupporting this effort. That was Katie Couric.\n  Before giving the press too much credit, though, let me suggest to \nyou that if you look at this chart--this is something I stumbled onto \nyesterday--and since the success has been there, you notice they are \nnot saying it is not successful, but they are not covering it. This is \nthe coverage in September of 2007. It dropped down by about half in \nOctober, then it dropped down again in November. So I guess what we are \nsaying is, if they cannot print something bad because nothing bad is \nhappening there, they do not print anything at all.\n  Well, I returned to Iraq on August 30, and the surge continued its \nsuccess. I traveled to the Contingency Operating Base Speicher in \nTikrit and to the Patrol Base Murray south of Baghdad and visited \nAmbassador Crocker and General Petraeus. And so, again, the same \nchanges that took place 3 months later were taking place and were much \nbetter. Less than half of the al-Qaida leaders who were in Baghdad when \nthe surge began were still there. There was a 75-percent reduction in \nreligious and ethnic killings in the capital, double the seizure of \ninsurgents' weapons, and a rise in the number of al-Qaida killed and \ncaptured.\n  So, you know, the surge knocked out some six media cells which make \nit harder for al-Qaida to spread their propaganda. Anbar's incidents \nand attacks were down from 40 a day to less than 10 a day. Economic \ngrowth, you heard what Katie Couric said about the markets. I was in \nthe same crowded markets. They were selling fresh food like normal \ntimes.\n  The large hospital project in the Sunni Triangle is back on track. \nThe Iraqi Army is performing very well. The Iraqi citizens formed a \ngrassroots movement called the Concerned Citizens League.\n  Baghdad returned to normalcy. Little kiddie pools, the lawns that \nwere cared for, amusement parks and markets, and the surge provided \nsecurity. Security allowed the local population and governments to \nstand up. Basic economics has taken root. Iraqis are spending money on \nIraqi projects.\n  Now that is the good news. Here is the bad news. General Petraeus, \nafter all of his success, the far left had crossed the line--I think we \nall remember this--when a full-page ad, paid for by moveon.org, \nbesmirched the motives and the honor of our No. 1 commander on the \nground in Iraq, General Petraeus.\n  Remember, they called him General ``Betrayus.'' I supported Senator \nLieberman's condemnation of moveon.org's attempt at character \nassassination, as well as Senator Cornyn's resolution. Senator Cornyn's \nresolution stood behind General Petraeus. And there were 28 Senators in \nthis Chamber who supported moveon.org, an act, I am sure, will be \nremembered.\n\n  While no American is above scrutiny, this was clearly a calculated \nmove on the part of this organization to undermine the noble efforts of \nthis patriot to execute the duties that we in the Congress unanimously \nsent him to accomplish.\n  You simply have to wonder whose side some of these people were on. \nThis goes to show how far some will go to root for American failure in \nIraq. These organizations are clearly placing their political agenda \nahead of the best interests of the United States and particularly the \nmen and the women who are in uniform.\n  So let's just for a minute set Iraq aside and look at Iran. Beyond \nthe obvious consequences that would befall an Iraq without U.S. \nsupport, lack of a secure and stable Iraq means instability in the \nMiddle East; namely, an unimpeded rogue Iran. A crippled Iraq will \ncreate a power vacuum. Remember what Ahmadinejad said on August 28, \n2007.\n\n       Soon, we will see a huge power vacuum in the region. Of \n     course, we are prepared to fill the gap, with the help of \n     neighbors and regional friends like Saudi Arabia, and with \n     the help of the Iraqi nation.\n\n  Maybe it was good that was said because people know what kind of \nperson he is, and they know he was prepared and wanting to fill the \ngap, a gap, a vacuum that is not there now.\n  Arab nations in the region have expressed their concern about Iran \nand are eager to contain the growing Iranian power. The world knows \nwhat Iran is capable of. The world has seen their aggression.\n  BG Jimmy Cash, U.S. Air Force retired, former command director inside \nthe Cheyenne Mountain Complex, that was 1987 to 1989. He was the only \nperson who could initiate a nuclear attack after advising the sitting \nPresident of a missile launch by our enemies and our need to respond.\n  No political or civilian had more knowledge about day-to-day military \nactions around the world. He said--and this is a quote. This is BG \nJimmy Cash:\n\n       I watched Iran and Iraq shoot missiles at each other every \n     day, and all day long, for months, they killed hundreds of \n     thousands of their own people. . . . They were fighting for \n     control of the Middle East.\n\n  Iran's nuclear work continues, including the enrichment of uranium, \nwhich could easily be used as part of a nuclear weapons program. I \nthink we all understand that.\n  In the last 2 years, Iran has continued developing ballistic missile \ntechnology, launching missiles over 2,000 kilometers. Coalition forces \nhave intercepted Iranian arms shipments in Iraq, including materials \nthat are used to make explosively formed penetrators--that is EFPs--\nwhich are the most deadly of IEDs, which are being used against our \nAmerican troops.\n  Coalition forces have also detained Iranian agents in Iraq. On \nJanuary 7, Iranian gunboats--we remember that, how they were harassing \nsome of our U.S. warships at the time.\n  Iran has now turned their attention to the only other threat to their \ndominance--freedom-loving nations throughout the globe. The world \ncannot afford to have Iran in control of the Middle East.\n\n[[Page S428]]\n\n  So Iraq remains as the critical link. Iraq is at a decisive turning \npoint in their journey toward democracy. The surge has created \nopportunities that the Iraqi people have not taken for granted. The \n``awakening'' is spreading from Al Anbar Province to Diyala Province. I \nsaw it coming years ago. Years ago, I can remember going, as many of my \ncolleagues had, from place to place in Iraq--long before the surge--\nseeing that our troops, when they would receive goods from home, such \nas cookies and candies, and they would take their packages and \nrepackage them in small packages and throw them out to these kids way \nout in the countryside, and the kids would wave American flags. That \nwas out there. We knew that success was taking place.\n  The once turbulent and violent Al Anbar Province is returning to \nIraqi control--Iraqi control, not our control. The Government of Iraq \nenacted The Justice and Accountability Act--that law--on January 12, \nshowing real progress toward former baathist reconciliation.\n  Al-Qaida is a spent force in Iraq. It is retreating to the Horn of \nAfrica.\n  Speaking of Africa, I have had occasion to be in Djibouti in the Horn \nof Africa. I have to say this with some degree of pride--this picture \nyou are seeing in the Chamber now is of a little girl who was actually \nfound as a little orphan girl who was 3 days old, south of Djibouti. My \nwife Kay and I are blessed with 20 kids and grandkids. Our daughter had \nnothing but boys, so she has now adopted this little girl, and that \nlittle girl is my granddaughter.\n  Some good things are happening over there. But I have to say that \nlooking at the squeeze that is taking place in the Middle East, a lot \nof the terrorist activity is going down into the Horn of Africa. The \noccupier of the chair is fully aware that we--both sitting on the \nSenate Armed Services Committee, we are very proud of the fact that we \nare setting up and helping the Africans set up African brigades.\n  Syria has ceased supporting foreign fighters in Iraq. The Saudis are \ncracking down on supporters of Islamic terrorists in their own country. \nIran is isolated. The world must remain focused and steady.\n  Iraq is an example to the world of how to reject terror and confront \nthose who practice it. It is not going unnoticed. Political leaders see \nthis. The world sees now that little kids are not being tortured to \ndeath in Iraq. Girls are now going to school instead of being raped and \nmurdered. No more mass graves, no more vats of acid. And the butcher, \nSaddam Hussein, is dead.\n  Yes, we are doing a difficult thing, but we are doing the right \nthing. Just as Americans always try to do the right thing, we are doing \nthe right thing there. But think of it for a minute. Isn't Iraq trying \nto do what we were trying to do 230 years ago? We were seeking a \nparliament at that time 230 years ago, and that is what Iraq is doing \ntoday. We were seeking a constitution. That is what Iraq is trying to \ndo. We were seeking democracy. We were seeking freedom. Iraq is seeking \nthe same things we were seeking some 230 years ago.\n  The Iraqis are watching us. They are risking their lives, the same as \nwe were risking our lives some 230 years ago. I think of that first \nelection that took place up in Fallujah, when the Iraqi security forces \nwere going--knowing they were going to be shot at, but they were \nwilling to do that--to go vote. Remember the purple fingers. That is \nwhat was taking place.\n  I would have to say this: We went through the same thing in this \ncountry. I have always said one of the best speeches made was Ronald \nReagan's ``Rendezvous With Destiny,'' when he talked about the Cuban \nwho trying to escape Castro's Cuba. As his ship washed up on the shore \nof Florida, a lady was there and said--and he was talking about the \natrocities of Castro's Cuba--and she said: I guess we in this country \ndon't know how lucky we are. He said: How lucky you are? We are the \nones who are lucky because we had a place to escape to.\n  I would have to say that the first reason was to end the murderous \nregime of Saddam Hussein. The second reason was to shut down the \nterrorist training camps. The third is they are doing exactly what we \ndid 230 years ago.\n  When you stop and think about the message and the inspiration we had \nfrom our forefathers, and when you stop and think about the message \nthat was given when a tall redhead stood before the House of Burgesses \nand made a speech for them at that time--and it is certainly for us \ntoday, and certainly for Iraq today--he said:\n\n       They tell us, sir, that we are weak--\n\n  This is exactly what they have been saying to the Iraqis.\n\n       They tell us, sir, that we are weak--unable to cope with so \n     formidable an adversary. But when shall we be stronger? Will \n     it be the next week or the next year? Will it be when we are \n     totally disarmed . . . ? Shall we gather strength by \n     irresolution and inaction? Shall we acquire the means of \n     effectual resistance by lying supinely on our backs, and \n     hugging the delusive phantom of hope . . . ? [W]e are not \n     weak, if we make a proper use of those means which the God of \n     nature has placed in our power. . . . armed in the holy cause \n     of liberty, and in such a country as that which we possess, \n     are invincible by any force which our enemy can send against \n     us. Besides, sir, we shall not fight our battles alone.\n\n  This is important.\n\n        . . . we shall not fight our battles alone. There is a \n     just God who presides over the destinies of nations; and who \n     will raise up friends to fight our battles for us. The \n     battle, sir, is not to the strong alone; it is to the \n     vigilant, the active, the brave. Besides. . . .if we were \n     base enough to desire it, it is now too late to retire from \n     the contest. There is no retreat but in submission and \n     slavery! Our chains are forged.\n\n  Some would say that we should retreat, we should leave. But that man \nstood before the House of Burgesses and said:\n\n       Why stand we here idle? What is it that gentlemen wish? \n     What would they have? Is life so dear, or peace so sweet, as \n     to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery? Forbid \n     it, Almighty God!--I know not what course others may take; \n     but as for me--\n\n  Said Patrick Henry--\n\n       give me liberty or give me death!\n\n  I guess what I am saying is, the Iraqi freedom fighters are not \nunlike what we were some 200 years ago. Wouldn't it be great if we were \nto provide the inspiration for them that our forefathers provided for \nus?\n  That is what is happening right now. We are winning. We are doing the \nright thing.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/29/senate-section/article/S428-1", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S428-S429]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                GI BILL\n\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I wish to raise two issues briefly to the \nMembers of our body today.\n  The first is, if we look back at the State of the Union speech last \nnight, the President, toward the end of his speech, talked about those \nwho have been serving since 9/11--the same individuals my colleague \nfrom Oklahoma has been talking about for the last 35 minutes. The \nPresident said, at one point:\n\n       We must keep faith with all who have risked life and limb \n     so that we might live in freedom and peace. Over the past 7 \n     years, we have increased funding for veterans by more than 95 \n     percent. As we increase funding, we must also reform our \n     veterans system to meet the needs of a new war and a new \n     generation.\n\n  Unfortunately, what the President did not speak about in his remarks \nlast night was probably the most important benefit we can be offering \nto people who have served our country since 9/11; and that is, a GI \nbill that would give them the same sort of educational benefits as \nthose who served during World War II.\n  We have heard so many people on this floor and in the administration, \nin their speeches, talk about how this is the next greatest generation. \nWe hear people lionizing the service they have given since 9/11, and I \nam one of those who is a great admirer of those young men and women who \nhave stepped forward and served since then. But when they leave the \nmilitary, they have an educational package that was designed in \npeacetime as a recruitment incentive in the 1980s and does not allow \nthem to move forward toward truly a first-class future.\n  Here are a couple of examples for you:\n  When people came back from World War II--those veterans--8 million of \nthem were able to take advantage of a GI bill that paid all their \ntuition, bought their books, and gave them a monthly stipend to the \nschool of their choice.\n  For instance, Senator Lautenberg, who is a cosponsor of my GI bill \nlegislation, S. 22, was able to go to Columbia on a full boat. Today, \nthat would\n\n[[Page S429]]\n\ncost $46,874 a year. Our average veteran coming out of Iraq and \nAfghanistan is able to receive about $6,000 a year under this \nMontgomery GI bill that is in place. That is about 12.8 percent of what \nit would take for our veterans today to be able to go to Columbia.\n  Senator Warner, my senior colleague from Virginia, was able to take \nadvantage of two GI bills. He was able to go to Washington and Lee \nUniversity for his undergraduate degree, and then he was able to go to \nthe University of Virginia Law School--full boat. Today, the Montgomery \nGI bill would pay about 14 percent of what it would take to go to the \nWashington and Lee University, and about 13 percent of what it would \ntake to go to the UVA Law School.\n  I emphasize that I am standing here as a full beneficiary of Uncle \nSam. After I was wounded in Vietnam and left the Marine Corps, I was \nable to go to Georgetown Law School, with my tuition paid for, my books \nbought, and a monthly stipend. Today's Montgomery GI bill would pay \nabout 11.6 percent of that.\n  I think it is time for all of us in the political process, who like \nto use the words of praise--rightfully earned by the people on these \nbattlefields--to talk the talk and then walk the walk. Let's get them a \nGI bill that truly allows them a first-class future. We have a \nmajority--an overwhelming majority--of my Senate colleagues on the \nDemocratic side who are cosponsors of this legislation. I am truly \nhopeful people on the other side of the aisle will understand this is \nnot a political measure; it is a measure of respect, and it is an \nearned benefit.\n  We are giving this year $18.2 billion worth of educational grants to \npeople in this country purely based on their economic status. Certainly \nwe can afford to pay for a meaningful GI bill for these young men and \nwomen who have been serving since 9/11.\n  The senior Senator from Alaska mentioned, during the Christmas break, \nthat we are spending approximately $15 billion a month in Iraq and \nAfghanistan. We could fund this GI bill for 1 week of what it would \ncost for us to run the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Unlike a lot of \nother comparisons that are made on this floor, this is a direct \ncomparison because a GI bill is a cost of war.\n  I urge my colleagues to get behind it. Let's get this done early in \nthis session before we go into the political season, and get these \nyoung men and women the benefits they not only deserve but they have \nearned.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/29/senate-section/article/S429-1", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S429]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   COMMISSION ON WARTIME CONTRACTING\n\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, the second issue I wish to mention today \nregards the National Defense Authorization Act, which the President \nsigned into law yesterday. In that act was a commission on wartime \ncontracting, which Senator McCaskill and I jointly introduced last year \nand were able to get embodied in the National Defense Authorization \nAct.\n  This is a very important piece of legislation. It will put into place \nan independent, bipartisan commission that has a 2-year sunset date on \nit--jointly picked, jointly selected by Democrats and Republicans in \nthe Senate and in the House and from the administration--a commission \nfilled with experts, not Senators sitting around or political people \nsitting around, to examine the wartime contracting that has taken place \nsince our invasion of Iraq, particularly, also looking at Afghanistan, \nand trying to bring accountability to the broad range of fraud, waste, \nand abuse that we all know has occurred during that period.\n  Now, to my surprise, when the President signed this legislation \nyesterday, he issued a signing statement along with it saying this, \nwith respect to this wartime contracting commission, that:\n\n       This wartime contracting commission purports to impose \n     requirements that could inhibit the President's ability to \n     carry out his constitutional obligations to take care that \n     the laws be faithfully executed to protect national security, \n     to supervise the executive branch, and to execute his \n     authority as Commander in Chief.\n\n  He goes on to say that:\n\n       The executive branch shall construe such provisions in a \n     manner consistent with the constitutional authority of the \n     President.\n\n  In other words, the President of the United States, who has been in \ncharge of the conduct of this war, and whose administration has been in \ncharge of executing these contracts--supervising them, making sure that \nthey meet the requirements of fairness in the law, is now saying that \nhe believes a legislative body can enact a law that he can choose to \nignore basically because he says it would interfere with his \nresponsibility as Commander in Chief to supervise a war. I am totally \nat a loss. I am totally amazed to see this kind of language as it \nrespects this legislation.\n\n  The Commission was put into place with broad bipartisan support and \nbicameral support by both the House and the Senate, the idea being to \nstudy systemic problems--the same sorts of things this President, I \nwould think, would want to root out. Its historic precedent comes from \nthe Truman Committee that took place during World War II, when then-\nSenator Harry Truman wanted to look at wartime fraud, waste, and abuse \nso we could get a proper handle on the Federal spending that was going \ninto mobilization and into the projects that were being put on line \nduring World War II. We certainly didn't see President Franklin \nRoosevelt trying to say the Truman Committee's work was going to \ninterfere with his ability to conduct World War II. To the contrary, \nthe President, during that war, saw this was the type of thing he \nneeded in order to bring the right sort of supervision and the right \nsort of accountability that might eliminate waste, fraud, and abuse.\n  So we don't quite know what the administration intends with this sort \nof language, but I want all my colleagues to be aware of it and to be \naware that it potentially is an impingement on the rights of the \nlegislative body, in effect saying the President has the authority to \nignore a law that has now passed, a law he has now signed.\n  So we are going to go forward with this Commission. We are going to \nwork with the administration, we hope, to set it up. We are going to \nmove as rapidly as we can because the clock is ticking in terms of \nstatute of limitations on some of the charges that might be filed. I \nhope the people of this country understand we want to do this for the \ngood of the American people; that we have a responsibility to make sure \nthe Nation's purse strings have been properly taken care of and that we \nare acting as the stewards of America's taxpayers.\n  Again, if someone in the administration would like to explain to us \nwhat their constitutional issue is with a piece of legislation the \nPresident has signed, we would be happy to hear that. In the meantime, \nwe are moving forward with this Commission. It is vitally important to \naccountability in the Government. I am very proud to have been a \nsponsor of it, and we are marching forward.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed for 5 \nminutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/29/senate-section/article/S429-2", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S429-S430]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, first, let me commend Senator Webb for the \nleadership on the issue he talked about. I am going to speak very \nbriefly on that same issue--the signing of the statement by the \nPresident yesterday--but before I do that, I wish to commend him and \nthe other sponsors of this legislation. It is critically needed. It is \nlong overdue. But for the leadership of Senator Webb and a few other \nSenators, we would not have had that provision in the bill which was \nfinally signed yesterday.\n  Yesterday, the President did sign into law the National Defense \nAuthorization Act, which is essentially the same bill the President \nvetoed last month. In his signing statement, the President identified a \nfew provisions of the act and stated that they:\n\n       Purport to impose requirements that could inhibit the \n     President's ability to carry out his constitutional \n     obligations.\n\n  The President's statement went on to say that:\n\n       The executive branch shall construe such provisions in a \n     manner consistent with the constitutional authority of the \n     President.\n\n  The specific provisions the President cited relate to a commission to \nstudy\n\n[[Page S430]]\n\nand submit reports to Congress on wartime contracting in Iraq and \nAfghanistan. He cited a provision that enhances the protections from \nreprisal for contractor employees who disclose evidence of waste, fraud \nor abuse on Department of Defense contracts. He objected--or at least \nraised a question--about a requirement for offices within the \nintelligence community to respond to written requests from the chairman \nor ranking member of the Armed Services Committees for intelligence \nassessments, reports, estimates or legal opinions within 45 days, \nunless the President asserts a privilege pursuant to the Constitution \nof the United States; and he also made reference to at least a \nlimitation on the use of funds appropriated pursuant to the act to \nestablish a military base or installation for the permanent stationing \nof U.S. Armed Forces in Iraq or to exercise U.S. control of the oil \nresources of Iraq.\n  Now, I understand the President's statement did not say these \nspecific provisions or any other provisions of the act are unlawful, \nnor that the executive branch would not implement these provisions. I \nalso understand similar statements have been included in signing \nstatements on a number of laws by this President and that those \nstatements did not result in the refusal to enforce the law as written.\n  Nevertheless, I believe it is important to come to the floor as the \nchairman of the Armed Services Committee to express the view that \nCongress has a right to expect the administration will faithfully \nimplement all the provisions of the National Defense Authorization Act \nof 2008--not just the ones the President happens to agree with.\n  As I noted at the outset, the President vetoed an earlier version of \nthis act which contained the same specific provisions he singled out in \nhis signing statement yesterday. The President did not choose to \nexercise his veto over those provisions and, as a result, they have not \nchanged in any way whatsoever in the version of the bill the President \nchose to sign. With his signature, these provisions become the law of \nthe land. Congress and the American people have a right to expect the \nadministration will now faithfully carry them out.\n  I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Webb).

Mr. President, I come to the floor this afternoon to \ntalk for a minute about the pending FISA legislation.\n  As a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, I have been very \npleased to be a part of the bipartisan process in which Chairman \nRockefeller and Vice Chairman Bond have crafted a very delicate, a very \nsensitive, yet important piece of legislation. Probably the most \nimportant piece of legislation that the Intelligence Committee has \ndealt with over the last several months or even years. Certainly, it is \none of the most important pieces of legislation to come to the floor of \nthis body this year.\n  This FISA legislation gives tools to our intelligence community which \nallow our brave men and women--who stand at the forefront today of the \nwar on terrorism in every part of the world--to gather information from \nthose who are plotting, planning, and scheming to kill and harm \nAmericans. The tools with which the intelligence community seeks to get \nin this particular instance deal with their ability to gather \ninformation, primarily through what we refer to as electronic \nsurveillance, from terrorists, or bad guys, who are overseas \ncommunicating to other individuals who are also overseas. There is no \nquestion that in order for our intelligence or law enforcement \nofficials to be able to gather information from communications of \npersons located within the United States, it is necessary that they \nfirst obtain a court order. Let's make that very clear. We must first \nobtain a court order to conduct surveillance against individuals \nlocated within the United States. What we are seeking to do in this \nlegislation is to give our intelligence community the ability to \ncollect information without a court order from people who are planning \nattacks against the United States and located outside the United \nStates. It is those individuals whom we seek to gather information from \nand prohibit from having the capability to kill and harm Americans. \nThis legislation is a crucial piece in the puzzle to enable the \nintelligence community to gather information from these individuals.\n\n  This particular piece of legislation has been debated in the \nIntelligence Committee for 10 months and was voted out of the \nIntelligence Committee on a very bipartisan vote of 13 to 2. I actually \nvoted against several of the amendments offered in the Intelligence \nCommittee. But at the end of the day, even though some of the \namendments I voted against were accepted and were included in the bill, \nI believed it was such an important piece of legislation and put such \nnecessary power and authority into the hands of the intelligence \ncommunity that I voted to support it.\n  I commend my vice chairman, Senator Bond, who is on the floor with me \nnow, for his leadership. I would simply ask the vice chairman: We \nstarted debate on this bill on the Senate floor in December, have been \ndebating this bill this week, as well as last week. Where are we? What \nis the holdup in passing this critical legislation? What is the \nproblem? Why can't the Senate give our intelligence community the tools \nthey need to protect Americans?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, if I may respond to my colleague from \nGeorgia, who is a very valuable member of the Intelligence Committee \nand who brings expertise from the other body and who has been a \nvaluable contributor, when we passed the FISA bill in what is called \nthe Protect America Act in August, everybody agreed that it should be \n60 votes because this is a very important but very controversial bill \nthat has to be adopted by 60 votes. Thus, we have asked that amendments \nto this bill be considered under a 60-vote rule.\n  It is very common in this Senate to demand 60 votes to be sure it is \na nonpartisan bill. So far, we have not been able--although we have \nprovided several alternatives to our friends on the other side--to get \na clear way of going forward. So that is why we are stuck, waiting to \nfind a reasonable manner of proceeding.\n  I would ask my colleague if, in fact, he feels we had adequate \ncontact with, interaction, and advice from the intelligence community \nand whether it is important to have the advice and assistance of those \nwho are experts in and know the operations of electronic surveillance, \nto have a role in our drafting of the legislation.\n\n[[Page S431]]\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I would respond to the vice chairman, \nthe Senator from Missouri, that without question, under his leadership \nand the leadership of Senator Rockefeller, the chairman, we have \nreceived important input and had dialogue with the intelligence \ncommunity throughout the drafting stages of this legislation. We not \nonly had the top leadership, including the DNI, the Director of the \nNSA, the head of the CIA, and folks from the FBI in to testify before \nthe Intelligence Committee, but also every member of the Senate \nIntelligence Committee has had the opportunity to visit these agencies \nand see firsthand where and how this information is gathered. We have \nhad the opportunity to see firsthand the methods our intelligence \ncommunity uses and the professionalism they exhibit. All of this is \nvery highly classified. Our committee deals with all of this \ninformation in a very sensitive and classified manner. But the fact is, \nwe have had testimony and firsthand accounts from top to bottom--from \nthe individuals who physically gather the information all the way to \nthe top leadership. Members of the committee on both sides of the aisle \nhave asked tough questions to the individuals who have presented \ntestimony before the committee. Everybody had the opportunity to have a \nfree and open dialog and debate with those individuals.\n  Again, based upon what our intelligence experts had to say, this \nlegislation was crafted and debated within the committee. Without \nquestion, there was ample opportunity for every member to inquire of \nall of those in the intelligence community of why we need this \nlegislation, why it is so critically important, where we would be \nwithout it, and why we need it to make sure we are able to stop those \nindividuals who seek to do harm to Americans around the world.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I would ask the Senator from Georgia further \nwhy it is so important to have the intelligence community operatives \nand lawyers involved in drafting the measure. We had several good ideas \noffered in the committee that turned out not to be workable. I would \nask my colleague why he thinks it is important to have the direct \ninvolvement by the intelligence community experts as to how to craft \nnot only the legislation but amendments to it.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I would respond to the distinguished \nSenator from Missouri that without question, it is necessary, from a \nlegal standpoint and from a practical standpoint, to get testimony and \nadvice from the legal experts and our operators in the intelligence \ncommunity to make sure there are no unintended consequences that come \nout of the final product from the Intelligence Committee.\n  As the Senator will recall, we had some very heated debates on a \ncouple of amendments within the committee. Very good debate on both \nsides of the issues. Sometimes, there were Democrats arguing \nwith Democrats, other times Republicans were arguing with Republicans, \nbut that is the nature of the Intelligence Committee. It operates in a \nbipartisan fashion to make sure we look at every aspect--legal, \ntechnical, as well as practical--to make sure we get it right. As the \nvice chairman knows and has been working to correct, some of the \namendments adopted in committee were well intentioned but harmful to \nour collectors. With the input of the intelligence community the \nmanager's amendment has been able to correct those unintended \nconsequences while preserving the intent of the amendments. In this \ninstance, I think we did get it right through engaging with our \nintelligence experts.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, would the Senator from Georgia say that this \nbill not only enables the intelligence community to move forward, but \nit provides additional protections for Americans, for their privacy and \nconstitutional rights? I would ask him if he thinks those amendments \nhave been incorporated in the legislation before us and what he thinks \nthe final product of the Intelligence Committee is as a result.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his question. I \nwould simply say that, again, there is just no doubt this legislation \ngoes beyond the Protect America Act and the current FISA statute to \nprotect American's privacy and constitutional rights. After all the \ndiscussion, after all the testimony that was presented, after all the \ndebate that took place within the confines of the Senate Intelligence \nCommittee, we found that for 25 years, the members of the intelligence \ncommunity have been able to conduct surveillance against Americans \noverseas without a court order. I would point out that they did this in \na professional manner and reduced the risk of compromising American's \nprivacy through established minimization procedures. Since FISA's \noriginal enactment, the intelligence community has used minimization \nprocedures to ensure that the information being gathered from Americans \nwas necessary foreign intelligence information and from individuals who \nare foreign agents. This legislation subjects this type of surveillance \nto a court order, providing new protections for Americans.\n  One purpose of FISA reform was to ensure that the ultimate and final \nlanguage we came up with would provide additional privacy protections \nto American citizens, both inside the United States as well as outside \nthe United States.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I would ask, isn't this the first time any \nof the FISA bills--even the predecessor FISA bill or the Protect \nAmerica Act--have included privacy protections for Americans overseas?\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I would respond to the distinguished \nSenator from Missouri that this is the first time these protections \nhave been enacted. This bill also prohibits reverse targeting.\n  This is the first time in the history of our intelligence community \nthat a FISA court order for U.S. persons is required regardless of \nwhere that individual is located. So if a U.S. citizen who goes abroad \nis an agent of a foreign power or a terrorist seeking to communicate, \nour intelligence community must first get a court order before they can \nconduct any electronic surveillance, irrespective of whether that \nperson is inside the United States or outside. For the first time in \nthe history of our intelligence operations, this will be the case. So \nthe added protections of the fourth amendment, which normally are not \nneeded for a person located outside the United States, are applied in \nthis particular piece of legislation.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, my colleague mentioned reverse targeting. I \nwould ask him, after debate on both sides and suggestions from both \nsides, did we not also include an express prohibition of reverse \ntargeting, as well as providing court review, as he has stated, of \nminimization, acquisition, and certification procedures? I would ask \nhim if reverse targeting is prohibited and what reverse targeting \nreally means.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Again, I thank the vice chairman for his question. The \nissue of reverse targeting is directly addressed in the bill--it is \nprohibited explicitly. Reverse targeting refers to the hypothetical \nsituation where our intelligence community targets a foreigner overseas \nsolely to get a U.S. persons' communications between that foreign \nperson and a U.S. person. The targeting of the foreign person is \nallowed without a court order. The targeting of a person located in the \nU.S. is not allowed unless a court order is first obtained. So if \nsomeone in the intelligence community targeted a foreigner with the \nintent to listen in on the U.S. citizen, that is reverse targeting. \nThis is prohibited in this legislation. Again, this is the first time \nwe have seen that protection put in the statute.\n  So as a lawyer still recovering from practicing law sometimes, I \nthink, it is the first time that I can remember in all of my years \nsince my days of constitutional law at law school where the United \nStates applies fourth amendment rights to individuals who are outside \nof the United States.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I would ask my colleague--he just talked \nabout the new protections for U.S. persons overseas: prohibition of \nreverse targeting, court review of acquisition, minimization, and \ncertification procedures.\n  Now, some have said we just ought to extend the Protect America Act. \nAs a sponsor of the Protect America Act, I thought it was pretty good. \nBut if we were simply to extend the Protect America Act, would that not\n\n[[Page S432]]\n\neliminate or at least delay any of the additional protections against \nreverse targeting, providing court review, and preventing reverse \ntargeting of U.S. persons?\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Again, Mr. President, I respond to the vice chairman \nthat reverse targeting is not prohibited under the Protect America Act. \nIt is a procedure that some allege could occur under the Protect \nAmerica Act, but which is clearly prohibited under this act.\n  Anybody who is concerned about extending and protecting the rights of \nindividuals ought to be a lot more concerned about getting this bill \nenacted into law than they should be about extending the Protect \nAmerica Act. So this is one of those situations where it is totally \nunexplainable to me for someone to say: I don't think we ought to pass \nthis law because it doesn't go far enough, when it goes further than \ncurrent law and the Protect America Act which we already have voted \nfor. Now there is an attempt being made to extend the Protect America \nAct for an additional period of time.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask my colleague why it has taken so long \nto get us to this point when the Protect America Act expires on \nFebruary 1?\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. As the Senator has said on the floor over the last \nseveral days, we are ready to pass this bill tonight if our friends on \nthe other side of the aisle will simply get together with us and let us \nvote it up or down.\n  When it comes to the issue of 60 votes, I have only been in this body \nfor 5 years, but I cannot think of one single major piece of \nlegislation that I have seen on the floor of the Senate during those 5 \nyears that didn't require 60 votes for all major amendments. I was the \nmanager of the farm bill recently. That is a long way away from this \nsophisticated piece of legislation, but every major amendment we had \nrequired 60 votes. That was the most recent, large piece of legislation \nwe have had on the floor. So every time we have a major bill, a 60-vote \nrequirement is reasonable and is going to be called for. I think for us \nnot to have it in this particular situation would be extremely unusual.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I might ask, isn't there a danger that if \nthere is an amendment not subject to the 60-vote point of order, it is \npossible, with various Senators absent, that we could adopt, perhaps, \non a 47-to-46 vote, an amendment that would make it impossible for the \nintelligence collection required by the intelligence community to go \nforward, and if such were adopted, what would happen to the \nlegislation?\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, if I may respond, the Senator is \nexactly right. If we did not have a 60-vote requirement on amendments, \nor dealing with any issue in this bill, then it is possible that we \ncould adopt amendments, by less than a majority of the Members of the \nSenate, which could hamper our intelligence community. And on this \ncritical, sensitive, most important piece of legislation, for us to \npass an amendment without a 60-vote requirement really makes no sense \nat all.\n  I think all of us would certainly be remiss and derelict in our \nduties if we didn't insist on a 60-vote requirement.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BOND. Of course.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, is the Senator proposing to change the \nSenate rules that all amendments will now take 60 votes? Is that the \nproposal before the Senate?\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, if I may respond, as my friend from Georgia \npointed out, in order to pass very important legislation such as this, \nit has been the practice in this body to require 60 votes, and as my \ncolleague from Georgia just said, the farm bill passed with 60 votes on \nthe amendments. When we passed the Protect America Act, we had to get \n60 votes.\n  This bill could be enacted into law and will undoubtedly have to have \n60 votes to be signed by the President. I say to my distinguished \ncolleague from Illinois, if there are changes made with less than a 60-\nvote margin, if they destroy the ability of the intelligence community \nto operate the collection system as we have prescribed, then that bill \nwill never be signed into law. We would have to start all over again, \nand we would thus be leaving our intelligence community without the \ntools to protect us.\n  We are not saying we are changing the rules of procedure. We are \nfollowing the practice that has been adopted in this Senate.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator will further yield, I am new here; I have \nonly been here 11 years. So I am trying to learn a little about how \nthis works. I recall that somehow the Republic survived and the Nation \ndid well, we kept our armies in the field and built our highways and \npassed our bills, and we did that for a long period of time without \nrequiring 60 votes on every amendment. Then there came this age of the \nfilibuster, where the Republican minority last year had 62 filibusters, \nbreaking a record in the Senate. Well, to stop the filibuster, you need \n60 votes.\n  So now I assume what the Senator is suggesting is that we are in a \nnew age in the Senate, and it is going to take 60 votes for everything. \nIf that is the proposal, I suggest a rules change. Let's get on with it \nand find out if there are enough votes here to make that the rule. If \nit is going to be the age of filibusters again this year, the public \nwon't like it much. We were in the minority not that long ago.\n  But if that is your goal, if you want to make this a 60-vote \nrequirement, it is a different Senate, and it will be, unfortunately, \nadding to the frustration many people have when they look at Washington \nand say: Why don't you pass something, or why don't you do something \nabout health care or about other issues? We will have to tell them we \ndon't have 60 votes.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, if that was a question--and I assume it was \na question--let me say that requiring 60 votes is something which has \noccurred frequently in previous years, when this side had the majority \nand the other side was in the minority. We found that it was very \ndifficult to pass legislation without 60 votes. Thus, we have seen that \npractice before.\n  But this is not an ordinary piece of legislation. Had we dealt with \nthis in a timely fashion, this could have been handled on a different \nbasis. But the Director of National Intelligence, whom I will refer to \nas the DNI, submitted to the Intelligence Committee, in April, a \nmeasure that he felt was necessary to modernize FISA. That bill was not \nbrought up. The DNI testified in person before the committee in open \nhearing in May. Despite my request, no legislation was developed in the \ncommittee. The DNI came before the Senate in closed session, in a \nconfidential room, in July of this year, to say how important it was. \nNo bill came out of the Intelligence Committee. So the DNI proposed a \nshort-term fix, which I brought to the floor on his behalf at the end \nof July, the first of August, and we were able to pass the bill, but we \nhad to pass on a 60-vote basis.\n  When there are very important pieces of legislation, with strong \nfeelings on both sides--as my colleague from Georgia has pointed out, \nhe handled a very important and difficult farm bill--those measures had \nto have 60 votes.\n  Now, the fact is, we could have a bunch of simple majority votes, and \nthere are many we can take on a simple majority. But if there are \namendments which, if adopted, would prevent the bill from being passed \nand signed into law, as a practical matter, it makes sense to have a \n60-vote margin.\n  We are waiting for a response to the offers we have made to the other \nside because, frankly, February 1 is coming. I hope we will agree on \nit. I understand the House is sending us a 15-day extension. I say to \nmy friend from Illinois that I hope we can adopt the 15-day extension \nand a collaborative agreement between the two sides on how we are going \nto proceed to finish this bill.\n  I see the distinguished assistant majority leader has some \ninformation. I am happy to yield to him for that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/29/senate-section/article/S432-1", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S432]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     EXTENSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Georgia. I thought \nmaybe, if anybody is still listening, we would talk a little bit about \nthe intent of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. I hope maybe \nwe can clarify some of the misunderstandings.\n  First, I believe that when the distinguished Senator from California, \na valued member of the committee, Mrs. Feinstein, spoke on the origins \nof FISA, she correctly noted that it was created, at least in part, in \nresponse to the disclosed abuses of domestic national security \nsurveillance. However, as the legislative history makes clear, FISA was \nnever intended to regulate the acquisition of the contents of \ninternational or foreign communications where the contents are acquired \nby intentionally targeting a particular known U.S. person who is in the \nUnited States.\n  The legislative history states:\n\n       This bill does not afford protections to U.S. persons who \n     are abroad, nor does it regulate the acquisition of the \n     contents of international communications of U.S. persons who \n     are in the United States, where the contents are acquired \n     unintentionally. The Committee does not believe this bill is \n     the appropriate vehicle for addressing this area. The \n     standards and procedures for overseas surveillance may have \n     to be different than those provided in this bill for \n     electronic surveillance within the United States, or targeted \n     against U.S. persons who are in the United States.\n\n  In essence, then, FISA, as originally drafted, was a domestic foreign \nintelligence surveillance act. Congress was concerned about targeting \npersons inside the United States with interceptions conducted inside \nthe United States.\n  The FISA Act amendments legislation we are considering today is a \nvery different animal, and it could be better characterized as an \ninternational foreign intelligence surveillance act. The bill is \nconcerned mainly with targeting persons outside the United States when \ninterception might occur inside the United States. What do I mean by \nthat? The legislation will regulate how the President may conduct \nelectronic surveillance of foreign terrorists operating in foreign \ncountries when their communications just happen to pass through the \nUnited States on wire communications networks.\n  This strange interference with the intelligence community's and, \nindeed, the President's authority to conduct foreign intelligence \nactivities appears to arise from an overabundant concern about the \n``rights'' of persons in the United States whose communications are \nincidentally collected when they talk to terrorists overseas.\n  It is odd that we are creating a new law in this area that departs \nfrom the original construct of FISA because in the international \nsurveillance realm, there have been no significant abuses of the \nintelligence community's ability to collect overseas foreign \nintelligence.\n  Unfortunately, two factors have compelled us to make these changes to \nFISA. First, we need to ensure that the critical intelligence gaps \nidentified by the DNI last year do not reappear.\n  The Protect America Act effectively closed those gaps last summer, \nbut there was bipartisan agreement that we could improve on its \nprovisions, especially in the area of carrier liability protection, and \nthat is what our committee did.\n  Second, this legislation is also required because we must address the \npractical reality that electronic communications service providers are \nnow insisting on a formal process to compel cooperation in the foreign \narena in order to obtain prospective liability protection similar to \nthat enjoyed for domestic intelligence and criminal wiretaps. That is \nwhy the carrier liability protection and prospective liability \nprotection provisions of this bill are so important.\n  Another area where we are departing from the original intent of FISA \nis the targeting of U.S. persons abroad. FISA, as passed in 1978, left \nthe targeting of American citizens abroad to the President's Executive \norder applicable to the intelligence community and the procedures \napproved by the Attorney General. In this legislation for the first \ntime in history, we build into the FISA new laws that govern the \ntargeting of U.S. persons overseas who are agents, officers or \nemployees of foreign powers when a significant purpose of the \nacquisition is to obtain foreign intelligence information.\n  These new procedures are sometimes referred to as 2.5 procedures \nbecause they are based in part upon section 2.5 of Executive Order \n12333, which has long governed the electronic surveillance of U.S. \npersons overseas by requiring the approval of the Attorney General \nbased upon a finding of probable cause that the target is a foreign \npower or agent of a foreign power.\n  These 2.5 changes were part of the overall bipartisan compromise and \nnow require prior court review by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance \nCourt of all surveillance conducted by the U.S. Government targeting \nU.S. persons overseas. Americans will still be on their own with \nrespect to being surveilled by foreign governments overseas, but at \nleast they can remain confident that if they are not working for a \nforeign power as a spy or terrorist, their own Government will not be \nlistening to their conversations.\n  The last area that merits discussion on the issue of FISA's original \nintent is the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. We refer to it \nas the FISC. According to section 103 of FISA, the FISC was established \nas a special court with nationwide jurisdiction to ``hear applications \nfor and grant orders approving electronic surveillance anywhere within \nthe United States.'' That is it.\n  As evidenced by the application and order requirements in FISA, each \napplication is for a ``specific target'' for the significant purpose of \nobtaining foreign intelligence information.\n  The court was originally structured so its seven judges would provide \ngeographical diversity. The post-9/11 expansion of the FISC from 7 to \n11 judges enhanced that diversity. Judges are nominated by the chief \njudge of their circuit to promote ideological balance on the FISC.\n  It was clearly recognized that only one or two judges would be in \nWashington, DC, on a rotating basis at any given time. This was \nintended to discourage judge shopping and make it unlikely that an \napplication for the extension of an order would be heard by the same \njudge who granted the original order.\n  The FISC was never envisioned as a court that would or should handle \nprotracted litigation. It possesses neither the staff nor the \nfacilities to preside over such litigation. Moreover, it is very likely \nthat such prolonged litigation would interfere with the main business \nof the FISC, which is to ensure the timely review and approval of \nindividual operational FISA applications for court orders.\n  We need to remember that the FISC was set up to review domestic \nelectronic surveillance and later physical searches, an area that has \nnumerous parallels to the similar reviews conducted by district court \njudges when they are asked to authorize criminal wiretaps. As I \nmentioned previously, even the FISC has acknowledged its lack of \nexpertise in the foreign-targeting context, which is, they say, better \nleft to the executive branch.\n  The Court's recent opinion in the case of In re: Motion for Release \nof Court Records stated:\n\n        . . . even if a typical FISA judge had more expertise in \n     national security matters than a typical district court \n     judge, that expertise would still not equal that of the \n     Executive Branch, which is constitutionally entrusted with \n     protecting the national security.\n\n  We should be very hesitant to disregard the Court's own assessment of \nits competency in the overseas intelligence realm, especially given the \noriginal intent of FISA. I urge all my colleagues to be mindful of the \nCourt's own words as we consider some of the\n\n[[Page S434]]\n\nproposed amendments, particularly those that would allow the court to \nassess compliance with minimization procedures used to target foreign \nterrorists. For example, amendment Nos. 3920 and 3908, and would \nrequire the court to determine the good faith of those providers who \nallegedly assisted the Government with the Terrorist Surveillance \nProgram. As examples, amendment Nos. 3919 and 3858.\n  In conclusion, I offer these observations mainly to ensure the record \nreflect the legislation departs from FISA's original intent in a \ndeliberate and carefully tailored manner. While there are some \npractical considerations, including a desire for a strong bipartisan \nbill, that have driven the need for this legislation, we should be \nextremely careful about adding new or changing existing provisions in \nthe bill that could negatively impact the operational effectiveness of \nour intelligence community or provide unwarranted protection to \noverseas terrorists and spies.\n  Mr. President, I will not propound a unanimous consent request now, \nbut I advise my colleagues that if we cannot reach agreement, I will \nask unanimous consent that all amendments to the FISA bill be brought \nup and decided at a 60-vote threshold so we can move forward on this \nimportant legislation. I am not making that request now. I alert my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle, I hope that will not be \nnecessary, but we have not had a response to our proposal on how we \nmove forward. We have been at this a week now, and we only have, at \nbest, two full working weeks before we go on recess. We must get this \nbill done, sent to the House, conferenced, and passed before we leave \nfor the President's Day recess. Failure to do so could leave our \nintelligence community without the tools they need and, thus, America \nwithout the protection it needs.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Menendez).

Mr. President, when we looked back at the work of this \nChamber at the end of 2007, we saw this Chamber coming together in a \nbipartisan way to garner what was 82 votes for the passage of the 2007 \nfarm bill. It is an example of Republicans and Democrats working \ntogether to address a fundamental need of America, and that is the \nissue of food security.\n  Last night, we heard the President of the United States address the \nNation on the state of the Union, in which one of the things he talked \nabout was the importance of moving forward with an economic stimulus \npackage. That economic stimulus package, which has been negotiated at \nleast with the House of Representatives on a bipartisan basis, is \nanother example of when people are willing to work together, we can \nactually get some business done.\n  That is what we should be doing in this Chamber today. We should be \nworking through amendments with respect to improving the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act in order for us to get that legislation \nfinally approved. What we are up against, frankly, is an unwillingness \non the part of the Republican minority to allow us to move forward to \nget to final passage of this bill in a way that would consider relevant \nand germane amendments that would make it better, in a way that would \naddress the absolute need to protect the cherished civil liberties of \nAmericans.\n  Those are the kinds of amendments with which we ought to be dealing. \nBut instead, we are faced with a filibuster.\n  I hope we can act on this legislation and then move on to the urgent \nneeds the people of America have brought us here to work on, on their \nbehalf. We heard the President last night talk about the economic \nissues that face America.\n  In my view, when I look at my State of Colorado, I believe the \neconomy is skating on very thin ice. We see it in a lot of different \nways. We see it in rising gas prices. We see it in the extraordinary \nhealth care costs people have to pay. We see it with respect to the \nhousing crisis we are facing in my State and across America.\n  When I think about my State, maybe it is a small State in comparison \nto the great States of New Jersey, New York, and others, but there are \n5 million people in my State who I believe are very concerned with what \nis happening with housing in Colorado. That is because 1 out of every \n376 homes today in the State of Colorado is in foreclosure. If 1 out of \n376 homes is in foreclosure today, I would venture that probably 90 \npercent of the homes in Colorado have seen a very significant decline \nin their value over the last 2 years.\n  So, yes, the people of America are very nervous about what is \nhappening with the economy, and it is our responsibility, therefore, to \nmove forward with an economic stimulus package that will address that \neconomic uncertainty. I am hopeful that with the leadership of Senator \nBaucus and Senator Grassley and my colleagues on the Finance Committee, \nwe will be able to get to a markup of legislation that can reach the \nfloor of the Senate tomorrow evening, perhaps the next day, that will \nbe that jump-start to the economy we need.\n  There is broad agreement on what that legislation will do. It will \nput money into the pockets of the consumers of America so it can help \nstimulate the economy. It will create initiatives for small businesses, \nwhich are so much of the economic engine of America, to go out and \ninvest in equipment and growth so we can create jobs for people of this \ncountry.\n  We will move forward with a package that will also include extending \nunemployment benefits and also include in that making sure 20 million \nseniors who were left out of the House stimulus package are also \nincluded.\n  There will be other provisions that will come forward. So it is \nimportant we get beyond the legislation we are dealing with now with \nrespect to FISA so we can work on those short-term economic issues. And \nhaving worked on those economic issues, which I hope we are able to do \nin a bipartisan fashion, then we will have the opportunity, hopefully, \nto work on the other legislation that addresses the longer term \nsecurity needs of America.\n  In that long-term economic set of issues I believe we have to \naddress, we have to, first of all, get the farm bill which garnered, I \nbelieve, 82 votes in the Senate, across the finish line so we can \nguarantee the food security of America for generations to come. It is \nthe best farm bill, in my view, that has come out of this Senate \nChamber, out of Congress for a long time. I think my Republican and \nDemocratic colleagues would agree with that characterization of the \nfarm bill.\n  We need to move beyond the farm bill to also address other long-term \neconomic issues that face us. We must address the issue of the clean \nenergy future for America. Yes, we can celebrate the fact that we came \ntogether in a bipartisan way to pass the Energy bill which the \nPresident signed in December, that we did a lot to move forward with \nefficiency and transportation and how we use electricity and other \nenergy in our homes and buildings, a very significant step forward in \nembracing the new future with biofuels for America with the quintupling \nof the renewable fuel standards, and we took some steps to start \ndealing with the issue of global warming by putting carbon \nsequestration in that bill. But there is a lot more to be done on \nenergy because what is missing in that bill, and still missing today, \nis a jet engine that will power us into the 21st century clean energy \neconomy, because the legislation we passed out of the Finance Committee \nwas one vote short to get to the 60 votes to stop the filibuster that \nwas underway.\n  We need to turn back to the energy legislation so we can build that \nlong-term economic security for America.\n  We also have to deal with the housing crisis. We will deal perhaps \nwith it in some minor ways when we deal with the stimulus package, but \nthere are other pieces of legislation which a number of committees have \nbeen working on to try to deal with the housing crisis. So we need to \ndeal with both the short-term and the long-term economic challenges we \nface here in America, and yet we are wrapped around the axle in terms \nof moving forward on this FISA bill because the Republican minority has \ntaken the view that we can simply stall, stall, stall until the time \nruns out.\n  I think we ought to be working in good faith, consider the amendments \nthat many of my colleagues have brought to this floor and which are \nbeing prevented from being considered so we can then get a FISA bill \npassed\n\n[[Page S435]]\n\nand we can move forward with the economic issues that we need to so \nurgently address.\n  I will continue to speak more specifically about FISA and some of the \nvery important work that both Chairman Rockefeller and Vice Chairman \nBond have put together in this legislation, as well as the work of \nChairman Leahy and Senator Specter on the Judiciary Committee, and I \nprobably have another 10 minutes or so to go on the general legislation \nin support of the bill and moving forward with it, but because we are \nat this impasse, because we are wrapped around the axle, it seems to me \na timeout is what would make sense for us then to be able to turn our \nattention, to pivot over to the economic issues which we have to \naddress and which the President asked us to address last night.\n  In that regard, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenate proceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 564, S. \n2556; the bill be read a third time and passed; and the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BOND. Reserving the right to object, I thank my colleague for his \ncourtesy and for his attention and his interest in this subject.\n  As I had previously stated, we have to get this bill done to replace \nthe Protect America Act. I believe the House has passed or is \nconsidering passing a 15-day extension, which I think is long enough, \nand on behalf of our side, I must object to this unanimous consent \nrequest.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. I thank my friend from Missouri, and I look forward to \nthe leadership that was shown by the Intelligence Committee in terms of \nSenators Rockefeller and Bond bringing Republicans and Democrats \ntogether to fashion the legislation that is before us.\n  In addition to that, I think we have an opportunity to work with \nSenator Leahy and the members of the Judiciary Committee to figure out \nthe best way of moving forward to achieve the ultimate goal, which is \nto make sure we are protecting America. So I very much look forward to \nworking with my good friend from Missouri and getting that done.\n  I don't think any Member in this Chamber would argue the fact that we \nneed to update and extend FISA. The technologies available, \nsurveillance methods that are now being used, and the threats that we \nface have changed dramatically since Congress first enacted FISA a long \ntime ago--in 1978. Think of the attacks of the last years. September 11 \nillustrated in the most tragic and bloody and horrible way the great \nthreat that extremist groups can pose to the United States. The attacks \nin New York, Washington, and Pennsylvania brought the spectre of \nterrorism to our front door. In many ways, the innocence of America was \nlost on that day.\n  But September 11 is not the only terrorist attack that we or our \nallies have endured in recent years. In 2002, a bombing in Bali killed \n202 people and wounded 209. In 2004--this is after 9/11--the bombs on \nthe trains in Madrid killed 191 people and wounded over 2,000 people. \nAnd in 2005, we saw the attacks on London's underground commuter train, \nkilling 52 and injuring 700.\n  I could go on with a list of violent incidents that have been caused \nbecause of terrorism around the world. The State Department reports \nthat the number of incidents of terrorism worldwide has grown \ndramatically in recent years. Between 2005 and 2006, the number of \nincidents rose from 11,153 to 14,338. Three-fourths of those \nincidents--that is three-fourths of 14,338 incidents--resulted in \ndeath, injury, or kidnapping. All told, terrorism has claimed the lives \nof more than 74,000 people around the world in only the year 2006. That \nis 74,000 people, most of them innocent members of our human race, who \nhave been killed by the scourge of terrorism around the world.\n  Americans understand that our intelligence and surveillance \ncapabilities are absolutely essential to preventing these types of \nattacks. Our Government needs to have the power and the tools to listen \nin on those who are plotting an attack on the United States and our \ninterests. They need to be able to monitor the e-mails of a terrorist \nsuspect. They need to be able to track people, and they need to be able \nto track those vital networks. They need to be able to respond quickly \nand decisively on information that is collected to make sure that we \nprotect the innocent from harm.\n  Americans want a government that can and will fulfill its primary \nresponsibility--the responsibility of keeping its citizens safe from \nattack. But we also want to make sure we have a government that will \nnot abuse the power entrusted in it. We want a government that honors \nthe rule of law and upholds the cherished values of our Constitution. \nWe want a government that protects the privacy of law-abiding citizens, \nand we want a government that is worthy of respect, not fear.\n  Without a doubt, the events of September 11 demanded an expansion of \nour intelligence-gathering capabilities. We needed to take emergency \naction to ensure the security of Americans over the short term. But \nrather than work within the authorities provided by Congress, the \nPresident and then-Attorney General John Ashcroft built their own \nprogram--the terrorist surveillance program--out of the view of \nCongress, out of the view of the public, in the darkness, and without \noversight of the courts. They built it on their own based on some \nassumed authority.\n  The administration hid the fact that it was implementing its program \nin a manner that overstepped the authorities that Congress had provided \nunder law. It hid the fact that it could target Americans for \nsurveillance without a warrant. There was no mention to the American \npeople that their communications could be spied upon without a warrant \nor without any other kind of protection from the courts. It hid the \nfact that it was grabbing more power for the executive branch than our \nFounding Fathers would have ever thought wise in their quest to protect \nthe civil liberties and freedoms of America.\n\n  We need to move, in my view, beyond the thinking that characterized \nthe formation of this unlawful terrorist surveillance program within \nthe executive branch, and we have indeed made some progress together in \nmoving forward in a new direction. We have consolidated the information \nthat our intelligence agencies collect, we have implemented the \nrecommendations of the 9/11 Commission in this Congress, we have \ncreated the Department of Homeland Security, and we are now ready to \nbring FISA up to date with our technology in the threats we face.\n  Over the last few days, the administration has presented the American \npeople with a false dichotomy. They claim we have to choose between \nprotecting our national security on the one hand and protecting our \ncivil liberties. That is a false dichotomy. As a former attorney \ngeneral, I can tell you that we can do both. We can have a surveillance \nprogram that gives our law enforcement the tools it needs to protect \nAmerica and at the same time we can make sure that we are protecting \nthe civil liberties of the citizens of our country.\n  The bill before us places some simple but highly effective safeguards \non the Government's surveillance program, and we should be thankful for \nthis legislation in that regard. These safeguards will in no way impede \nour efforts to defeat the terrorist networks and prevent attacks on \nAmericans. If an intelligence agency gets actionable information, it \ncan establish surveillance immediately; no waiting for a warrant, no \nredtape, no delay. The agency will simply have to seek a retroactive \nwarrant once surveillance has begun.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to continue as in morning \nbusiness for an additional 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. I thank the Chair.\n  The bill before us places some simple but highly effective safeguards \non the Government's surveillance program. These safeguards will in no \nway impede our efforts to defeat the terrorist networks and prevent \nattacks on Americans. I want to highlight a few provisions of the bill \nthat the Intelligence Committee reported, and which are at the center \nof our debate this week. These provisions require the FISA Court and \nCongress to play a greater\n\n[[Page S436]]\n\nrole in overseeing the Nation's surveillance program. I should say a \ngreater role and an appropriate role in overseeing the Nation's \nsurveillance program.\n  First, the FISA reauthorization will require the FISA Court to review \nthe administration's procedures for determining that the targeted \nsurveillance is reasonably believed to be outside the United States. \nSecond, the FISA Court must review the procedures for minimizing the \nidentities of and information about Americans incidentally detected \nduring the surveillance of foreign targets. Third, the court must \napprove or disapprove the targeting of Americans overseas under this \nnew authority on an individual basis, based on its review of whether \nthere is probable cause to believe the person is an agent of a foreign \npower. Fourth, the bill includes a 6-year sunset to allow Congress to \nevaluate how the new authorities are carried out, and to ensure abuses \ndo not occur before authorities are extended further. The threats and \ntechnologies are changing so fast that Congress will need to update the \nlegislation during that time.\n  Finally, the bill requires the intelligence community to conduct an \nannual review and requires detailed semiannual reports to be submitted \nto the House and Senate Intelligence and Judiciary Committees \nconcerning collections authorized under the bill, including instances \nof noncompliance.\n  These provisions represent a dramatic improvement to our Nation's \ninternational surveillance program, and I am pleased they are the \nfoundation of the bill. But we can do more to strengthen the bill and \ndo better to enforce the rule of law.\n  I support Senator Cardin's amendment, which I cosponsored, to have a \n4-year sunset for the bill rather than 6 years. If we learn of problems \nin the program, if the technologies continue to change or if the threat \nchanges, we should have the opportunity to change the law.\n  Over the coming days, we will also debate how to handle the question \nof immunity for companies that participated in the warrantless \nsurveillance program from 2001 until 2007.\n  In my view, if a company was knowingly acting in violation of \nexisting law, the courts should review their actions to determine if \nthere was wrongdoing. If, however, the Attorney General or an \nintelligence agency approached that company, and the company clearly \ntried to follow the law and act in good faith, it should not be held \nliable.\n  That is why I am cosponsoring Senator Feinstein's amendment which \nestablishes an independent process for reviewing whether a company \nshould receive immunity. Under this amendment, the FISA Court would \nfollow a three-step process for determining whether a lawsuit has \nmerit.\n  Senator Feinstein has proposed a smart and fair solution to this very \ndifficult problem. The FISA reauthorization has become unnecessarily \npoliticized, in my view. We are fully able to strengthen our Nation's \ninternational surveillance capabilities while protecting the privacy of \nAmericans. I hope the Members of this Chamber can put the rhetoric and \nthreats aside and move forward to assure that America is, in fact, \nprotected, both in terms of threats against them in violence from \nterrorists and at the same time that we protect their civil liberties.\n  I hope we can pass the FISA bill soon. I hope the President will do \nwhat is right and sign it.\n  The Senator from Alaska.\n  (The remarks of Senator Murkowski pertaining to the introduction of \nS. 2570 are printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nBills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI.

Last night we heard a vision that the President of the \nUnited States was standing in the Chamber of the House of \nRepresentatives speaking to all of us. He talked about how best to \nproceed during times of clear economic crisis, job loss, health care, \nenergy costs soaring, threats to our domestic safety nets, and a war in \nIraq with no end in sight.\n  When news media people asked me what I thought about the speech, one \nof the things I said was I wished the President could have sat in on \nsome of the meetings that I had as I traveled Ohio in the last year, my \nState. I had about 80 roundtable meetings of 15, 20, 25 people in a \ncommunity where for an hour and a half I would ask them questions about \ntheir communities, about their problems. In every corner of the State, \nI heard from veterans and first responders, from farmers, from people \nrunning small businesses, from teachers, from students, from community \nleaders, from mothers and fathers. I wish the President had been able \nto hear some of this because people clearly want to hear their \nGovernment is finally committed to change and to fighting for the \nmiddle class.\n  They want to hear that the economic policies of the last 7 years, \npolicies that have failed them, are a thing of the past and we have a \nnew direction. They want to hear about a plan to finally bring back \ngood-paying jobs, lower our health care and energy coasts, secure our \nsafety nets, and end the war in Iraq.\n  For Ohioans, the future is about change. Let's say you are driving \ndown the road. You notice that the signs, mile markers, exit signs, \nbillboards as huge as houses are telling you that you are going in the \nwrong direction: Signs saying wages stagnating, signs saying U.S. jobs \nbeing shipped overseas, a housing crisis deepening, health care costs \nsoaring, increased dependance on foreign oil, product safety unsure, no \nend to the war in Iraq. The longer you stay on the road, the worse \nthings get.\n  So you hit the gas pedal and head further down that road. If you \ndrive down the road, the wrong road, long enough, does it become the \nright one? Of course not. You do not proudly log more miles on the \nwrong road. You change direction.\n  If there is one thing you can say about the administration and its \nsupporters in Congress it is that they are consistent. They \nconsistently answer to the wealthiest Americans and to the largest \ncorporations and pay lipservice to the rest of the population.\n  Think about last night. The President said 116 million people--if we \nextend the tax cuts, 116 million people will get tax cuts averaging \n$1,800 a person.\n  Does the President really say--does that really say what the tax cuts \nmean? It is a very small number of people getting huge tax cuts, and \ntens and tens and tens of millions of Americans are getting almost \nnothing.\n  Does he say it that way? Does he tell the American people that is \nwhat it is? Of course not. He says the average American will average \n$1,800 from the tax cuts. Simply, that is very misleading. We have seen \nthat on tax policy over and over and over in this administration.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator would yield for a \nquestion.\n  Mr. BROWN. I will yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I was going to inquire of the Senator from \nOhio if he found, as I did last night, it very unusual to have the \nentire State of the Union Address talking about the economic \ndifficulties in our country and the need for a stimulus plan and so on \nwithout ever mentioning the real root causes at all of what has put us \nin this position: For example, a $700 billion, going to an $800 \nbillion-a-year trade deficit; a fiscal policy budget deficit that is \ngoing to require us to borrow $600 billion in this fiscal year, just \nthat combination is $1.3 trillion in red ink, 10 percent of our GDP in \n1 year.\n  You know, the fact is, everyone in the world, including American \ncitizens, look at that and understand that is so far off the track \nthere is no way that works.\n\n[[Page S437]]\n\n  I support a stimulus package. I think it is fine to do for \npsychological purposes. But I am wondering if the Senator from Ohio \nwonders, as I do, why the President does not even seem to recognize the \nunderlying causes of the economic difficulty in our country.\n  Mr. BROWN. I appreciate the comments from the Senator from North \nDakota, who understands probably better than anybody in this body what \nthis trade deficit means, what this trade policy means. And what is \namazing is the President does not look at the $800 billion trade \ndeficit.\n  When I came to the Congress in 1992, it was $38 billion. Now it is \nover $800 billion.\n  The President's father once said $1 billion in trade deficits \ntranslates into the loss of 13,000 jobs. Now it is $800 billion, and \nthe President did not address that. But what he did say is: Let's do \nmore of this. He said: We need a trade agreement with Columbia, we need \na trade agreement with Panama, we need a trade agreement with South \nKorea. And it just makes me incredulous that the President cannot look \nat what has happened and say: Wait a second, let's do a timeout. Let's \ndo no further trade agreements. Let's go back, as the Senator from \nNorth Dakota, Mr. Dorgan, has suggested, and let's have benchmarks. \nLet's look at what NAFTA did to our country, look at what CAFTA has \ndone to our country, look at what trade with China has done to the \nmiddle class.\n  The President totally missed that. At the same time, the President \nsaid: Let's do more tax cuts for the wealthiest 1 percent at the \nexpense of the middle class and drive up these budget deficits. So we \nhave trade deficits of $800 billion, plus we have budget deficits of \nabout $1 billion a day. And that is fundamentally the biggest problem \nwith our economy, as you suggest.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I agree with that analysis. I sat in that Chamber last \nevening. A joint session is always a wonderful privilege, to hear the \nPresident give the State of the Union Address. I was thinking, everyone \nis sitting here in dark suits and pretty well dressed up for a big \noccasion. Not one person in that Chamber is going to have their job \nlost because it was shipped overseas someplace in search of cheap \nlabor. Nobody in this Chamber, nobody in the Senate has ever lost their \njob because somebody decided to outsource it to China for 30 cents an \nhour labor.\n  A lot of working people have to come home at the end of the day and \nsay: Honey, I was given notice today. I lost my job because they found \nsomebody halfway around the world who will do it for 20 cents an hour. \nThey told me I can't compete with that. Our family can't live on that.\n  Just talking about the trade piece of this, the President completely \nignores that. There ought to be a summit meeting at this point, if you \nhave $1.3 trillion of red ink in 1 year. They say the budget deficit is \nonly $300 billion, $275 billion. It is not. Take a look at the budget \npolicy and find out how much we are going to increase the debt in this \nyear. The debt is going to increase by $600 billion on the budget side \nand $700 to $800 billion on the trade side. That is $1.3 trillion off \nthe track in one single year, 10 percent of our economic output. The \nfact is, that is unsustainable and is going to run this country's \neconomy into a ditch. If we are going fix it, we have to diagnose it. \nThis President hasn't come close to even acknowledging the difficulty \non those two issues, fiscal policy and trade policy, let alone the \nissue of the scandal of the subprime loan which is regulators falling \nasleep or unbelievable hedge fund speculation outside of the view of \nregulators because they don't want to be regulated.\n  Would the Senator from Ohio agree that these are the underlying \ncauses of concern about this economy?\n  Mr. BROWN. Absolutely. I remember back in the early 1990s, we were \nconcerned about the twin deficits, the trade deficit and the budget \ndeficit. We had a budget deficit then of about $300 billion a year and \na trade deficit, as the Presiding Officer knows--who joined me in \nvoting against NAFTA a decade ago--of under $100 billion. We considered \nthat a serious problem. Today, President Bush doesn't recognize that \nthis trade deficit means anything. To the contrary, he says, it seems \nto be working. Let's do more of it.\n  Again, I go back to what his father said, that a billion dollars in \ntrade deficit translates into 13,000 lost jobs. You can see how it \ndoes. Because a billion dollars in trade deficit means we are buying a \nbillion dollars, we are importing a billion dollars more than we are \nselling, and that means we are manufacturing less because we are not \nmaking it ourselves. If we manufacture less, it means thousands of \nOhioans or North Dakotans or New Jerseyans are finding they are not \nworking at $12 or $15 or $20 an hour. If those plants lay off workers, \ncommunities get less tax dollars, police, firemen and teachers are laid \noff. It undercuts the economic vitality of the community and the public \nsafety. It undercuts the ability of our schools to educate our \nchildren. It is clearly a downward spiral that is only accelerated when \nwe pass a trade agreement with Colombia and with Peru and Panama and \nanother trade agreement with South Korea.\n  Mr. DORGAN. The fact is, it is not something I enjoy doing, to talk \nabout the difficulties. I would like to talk about the opportunities \nfor this country. We will not get to the opportunities until we decide \nwe are going to start taking care of some things here at home.\n  This President, in this past fiscal year, the one we are in right \nnow, sent us a request for $196 billion of emergency money and said: I \nwant it put on top of the debt. Don't pay for it. Add it to the debt. \nThat is $16 billion a month, $4 billion a week for Iraq and \nAfghanistan, to replenish the military accounts for that purpose. Now \nwe are told he is going to send another $70 billion on top of that. \nThat takes us to close to three-quarters of a trillion that will have \nbeen spent, none of it paid for, all of it requested by this President \nas an emergency so it didn't have to be paid for. You look at that and \nyou say to yourself: We have so much that needs doing, including not \njust on the budget side getting our act together but on the trade side, \nstanding up for our country's interests, demanding fair trade, and, on \nthe investment side, investing in infrastructure, all these things.\n  Last night it was almost as if the President was oblivious to the \nfundamental causes of the economic difficulty. This is a great economic \nengine we have, but the fact is, it needs some work. It doesn't need \nsomebody to polish it with a rag and hum a nice tune. It needs real \nwork to get this engine going again. The American people are \ninnovative, great workers. It is an inspired country in which we live. \nThat is why we have progressed the way we have over 200 years. But the \nAmerican people need something to work with. We need to invest in \nworking people. We need to have faith in working people. Instead what \nwe have done is pulled the rug out from under working families.\n  I have used so many examples in the Senate, and my friend from Ohio \nknows all of them because a good number of them come from the State of \nOhio, Huffy bicycles and Etch A Sketch and so many examples, all those \njobs now in China that used to be in Ohio.\n  One of my favorites is to talk about Fig Newton cookies. The National \nBiscuit Company, NABISCO, took Fig Newton cookies from New Jersey to \nMexico. Why? They could find somebody who would shovel fig paste \napparently at a much lower cost than it cost to pay somebody to shovel \nfig paste in New Jersey. If you want to buy some Mexican food, buy Fig \nNewton cookies, made in Mexico, still called the National Biscuit \nCompany, except it isn't so national anymore. Now they are made in \nMexico.\n  That is one example of a hundred, a thousand, a million we could give \nand have. It is the question of whether this country is going to stand \nup for its workers and whether we are going to have the courage not \njust to stand up for workers in fair trade agreements but whether we \nare also going to put on track fiscal policy, trade policy, regulatory \nauthority in a way that gives people confidence about the future of \nthis economy and jobs and opportunity.\n  Mr. BROWN. When I hear Senator Dorgan talk about this, I think about \n20 years from now, 15 years from now. We are going to look back on this \ntime, and we will think: What were they thinking when they changed the \nlaws to allow so many cheap imports from\n\n[[Page S438]]\n\nChina, made by workers in unsafe conditions, sending products back, \ntoxic toys to our children's bedrooms and contaminated food into our \nkitchens and pantries? We are going to look back 20 years from now and \nthink: Why did we dismantle our industrial base, jeopardizing our \nnational security, the security of our family farms in North Dakota and \nOhio and small businesses and manufacturers in New Jersey and all over \nthe country? We are going to look back and think: Why did we let \ncorporations lobby this Congress so that they changed the rules so that \nit made sense for these companies, in terms of their bottom line, in \nterms of their profits, to go to China instead of manufacturing in \nGalion or Toledo or Youngstown, OH?\n\n  Imagine instead if we as a nation decided we were going to have a \nMarshall plan or go to the Moon kind of plan on alternative energy, \nthat we changed our trade law and our tax law and we began through \nbiomass, through production of wind turbines and solar panels. Imagine \nif we set out to remake our energy policy and our country's industrial \nbase by changing trade law, by changing tax law. We clearly still do \nthe best R in the world on all kinds of scientific research and \nmedical research. But so often we do the R here, which is good for \nthe economy and good for creating jobs, but then most of the production \nis shipped offshore. So what good is that for our country, when we \ndevelop the research, we do the research and development and then send \nit offshore?\n  The Senator mentioned the Ohio Art Company. That sort of tells the \nstory. It is a company in northwest Ohio right in the corner where \nIndiana and Ohio intersect with Michigan. They make something that most \nof us knew as children called Etch A Sketch. About 7 or 8 years ago--I \nwas in Bryan a couple months ago talking to an executive of Ohio Art \nCompany. Seven or eight years ago a major U.S. retailer went to them \nand said: We want to sell your product in our stores for less money, \nfor under $10. The only option that Ohio Art Company had was to stop \nmost of its production in Ohio and move its production overseas. Every \njob that was moved to China meant less money for the Bryan Police \nDepartment, less money for the Williams County government, less money \nfor public schools, less money paid into Medicare, less money paid into \nSocial Security. It made us poor as a nation. At the same time, those \nproducts moved to China. But it lifted the living standards there \nbecause wages are so low. The Chinese wink and nod at best at any kind \nof environmental rules or worker safety rules. We have done little to \nlift up.\n  Senator Dorgan and I want more trade but a different set of rules. \nInstead of lifting workers up so Mexican workers would be buying \nAmerican products and we would be buying Mexican products back and \nforth the way we should trade, and their living standards would go up, \nthey would have good environmental and worker safety standards, their \nwages would rise. That is what happened with the 50 States in the \nUnited States. As companies moved around the United States to the \nSouth, eventually their wages went up and we began to enrich all \nsections of the country.\n  We are not doing that with China. We are not doing that with our \ntrade policy. That is why I was so disappointed that last night the \nPresident said: We want a new trade agreement with Colombia. We want \none with South Korea. We want one with Panama. Instead of going in the \nright direction, we are changing our trade policy and moving in a \ndifferent direction.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the Senator and I are working on a piece \nof legislation we intend to introduce that would establish benchmarks \nfor trade agreements. We had a $1.5 billion trade surplus with Mexico. \nWe did a trade agreement. Guess what. We turned that surplus into a \nhuge deficit, a giant deficit, $60 billion to $70 billion a year. So we \nturned a surplus into a deficit, shipped a lot of U.S. jobs to Mexico. \nWhat we need is a trade agreement with benchmarks and accountability. \nIs this trade agreement meeting the objectives we developed for our \ncountry? After all, we are stewards of our country. We want our country \nto do well. Yes, we want to lift others. We want to it be a more \nprosperous world. But first we want this country to do well.\n  Wouldn't it be the height of irony, an unbelievable perversion, if we \npassed a ``stimulus package,'' and we borrow the money from China to \nput money in the hands of American families who can take it to Wal-Mart \nand buy a Radio Flyer little red wagon made in China. We borrow the \nmoney from China, give to it an American consumer who goes to Wal-Mart \nto buy a Chinese wagon. I say Radio Flyer because that is one of those \ngreat American brands. Almost every child in this country has hooked a \nride on a Radio Flyer, either theirs or their neighbor's. Do you know \nhow Radio Flyer got its name? It was an immigrant who came to Chicago, \nIL, and decided to start trying to make some wagons. He made a few of \nthem. Everybody liked them. He was a guy who came to our country and \nwas so pleased with being able to come to our country. He liked two \nthings. He loved airplanes and somehow he liked Marconi and the radio. \nSo he decided he was going to put Radio Flyer on the side of the little \nred wagon, and it began. For 110 years, they built Radio Flyer little \nred wagons in America, the dream of this immigrant innovator. They \ndon't make them here anymore. They are all made in China. They closed \ntheir doors, went in search of cheap labor.\n  It is interesting that when we talk about this, some will listen and \nsay: The guy from Ohio, the fellow from North Dakota, they don't get \nit. They are a bunch of xenophobic isolationist stooges who can't see \nover the horizon. It is a global economy. Get over it.\n  It is a global economy. But the rules have not kept pace with \ngalloping globalization. The result is pushing down standards in the \nUnited States, moving jobs from the United States overseas, a \nhemorrhaging trade deficit that is dangerous for our country's \ninterests, $2 billion a day every day that we import more than we \nexport. The largest export from the United States by volume is \nwastepaper to Asia. Think of that.\n  My point is simple. I appreciate the work the Senator from Ohio and \nothers have done on this issue. We have to put this country on track. I \nam for trade and plenty of it. But I demand and insist that we stand up \nfor this country's interests and demand fair trade. We have to bring \nthis trade deficit down. That is putting dramatic amounts of money in \nthe hands of the Chinese and Japanese and others. Don't be surprised \nwhen you open the paper to find out what they have purchased next, one \nof our major investment banking companies, you name it.\n  We to have fix this. I know the Senator from Ohio came here with a \nstatement and I interrupted him, but what I wanted to do was to say, I \nwas very surprised last night to sit in the State of the Union Address \nand hear talk about a stimulus and hear talk about the economy and not \neven hear one whisper about the real vulnerabilities of this economy--a \ntrade deficit out of control, reckless fiscal policy, combined with \nadding $1.3 trillion in debt, 10 percent of the GDP in 1 year, and then \nregulators asleep and apparently applauded for being asleep, while we \nhave unregulated hedge funds, leveraged transactions, $43 trillion of \nnotional value, something most people can't understand, notional value, \ncredit default swaps. Sounds like a foreign language. There is $43 \ntrillion of notional value out there in credit default swaps. There is \na totally unregulated hedge fund industry with derivatives.\n\n  There are a lot of things we need to care about and we need to fix. \nThe Senator from Ohio is absolutely right in talking about it on the \nfloor of the Senate tonight. I deeply appreciate his willingness to let \nme interrupt him for a couple minutes because these are very important \nissues for our country.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from North Dakota. He \ntold the story about the immigrant who settled in Chicago. That may \nhave been a story from a different era, but we still in so many ways \nare a nation of tinkerers and inventors, entrepreneurs and scientists--\na nation that still leads the world in brain power in terms of figuring \nout new products, new ways of doing things, new services. The problem \nis, there has been a disconnect between that and production and job \ngrowth and job creation.\n  That is why the President's speech last night, to me, was so \ndisappointing,\n\n[[Page S439]]\n\nthat he has asked for more tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans, tax \ncuts that, frankly--usually, these tax cuts to the wealthiest Americans \nare at the expense of the middle class. He has asked for more trade \nagreements while our trade deficit explodes year after year after year.\n  As Senator Dorgan suggested, we know what we need to do as a nation. \nWe know what we need to do with tax policy to serve the middle class. \nWe know what we need to do with trade policy to serve the middle class.\n  Even though the President wants to stay the course, wants to continue \nthe same direction, I think there is change afoot in this country. \nPeople want change. People want to strengthen again the middle class \nand strengthen our communities in New Jersey and Rhode Island--Senator \nWhitehouse is in the Chamber, too--and in my State of Ohio, from Lima \nto Zanesville and from Dayton to Warren.\n  I thank you, Mr. President, for your time and again exhort Americans \nto look down the road for a new trade policy, a new tax policy that \nhelps to build the middle class.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/29/senate-section/article/S439-1", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S439-S440]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  FISA\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, at the end of this week, Americans may \nfind themselves at greater risk of a terrorist attack when the Protect \nAmerica Act expires on February 1. On that date, we will be forced to \nrevert to the antiquated 1978 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or \nFISA, to monitor the communications of suspected terrorists, unless \nthis Congress moves quickly to make permanent changes to that law. It \nis therefore critical for Congress to enact permanent modernizations to \nFISA so that our intelligence officials will have every tool they need \nto monitor the communications of terrorists who seek to destroy the \nUnited States.\n  The consequences of allowing the Protect America Act to lapse could \nbe deadly. The PAA was passed last August to modernize FISA so that the \nstatute could do in practice what it was always intended to do--govern \ncertain foreign intelligence surveillance activities directed at \npersons in the United States, without inadvertently burdening those \nactivities directed at persons overseas. FISA, however, has not kept up \nwith technological advances that have been made since 1978. As a \nresult, prior to the PAA, intelligence officers were often forced to \nobtain a court order before beginning surveillance against a terrorist \nor other foreign target located in another country. This unnecessary \nand burdensome requirement caused U.S. intelligence agencies to lose \nabout two-thirds of their ability to collect communications \nintelligence against al-Qaida.\n  Thankfully, the Protect America Act helped to close the inexcusable \ngap that left this country blind to the plans our enemies were making \nagainst us. As Director of National Intelligence Michael McConnell \nsaid, the PAA has ``allowed us to obtain significant insight into \nterrorist planning.'' To allow such a vital antiterror tool to lapse at \nthis time would be the ultimate dereliction of duty.\n  The United States must remain vigilant against a terror threat that \nis real and constant. The National Intelligence Estimate on ``The \nTerrorist Threat to the US Homeland,'' released just 6 months ago, \nconcluded that this country will face a ``persistent and evolving'' \nterrorist threat over the next 3 years, particularly from Islamic \nterrorist groups and cells like al-Qaida. No person in America is \nunfamiliar with the capabilities and determination of such terrorist \ngroups, and Americans trust us to make the right decisions to protect \nthem and their children. Without making permanent changes to FISA to \nensure the fast and effective intercept of foreign intelligence \ninformation, little else we do will matter.\n  Retroactive immunity is in the best interest of this Nation's \nsecurity and must be included in FISA modernization, as it was in the \nIntelligence Committee bill. Following the attacks of September 11, \n2001, President Bush authorized the National Security Agency to \nintercept international communications into and out of the United \nStates of persons linked to al-Qaida or related terrorist \norganizations. The administration's obvious and stated purpose of this \nauthorization was to ``establish an early warning system to detect and \nprevent another catastrophic terrorist attack on the United States.'' \nTherefore, the administration made requests for telecom companies to \ncooperate with its intelligence activities. The companies complied with \nthe government's request for help, relying on written assurance from \nthe executive branch that their actions were both necessary and legal.\n  Now these companies face multibillion dollar lawsuits challenging \ntheir actions. Such lawsuits not only create potentially staggering \nliability for the companies, they also create the risk that sensitive \ndetails about our intelligence sources and methods will be revealed \nthrough discovery. Moreover, failing to protect those who cooperate \nwith the Government to thwart terrorist activity will undermine the \nwillingness of others to cooperate in the future. A powerful op-ed \nauthored last October by former Attorneys General Benjamin Civiletti, \nDick Thornburgh, and William Webster, said it best:\n\n       The government alone cannot protect us from the threats we \n     face today. We must have the help of all our citizens. There \n     will be times when the lives of thousands of Americans will \n     depend on whether corporations such as airlines or banks are \n     willing to lend assistance. If we do not treat companies \n     fairly when they respond to assurances from the highest \n     levels of the government that their help is legal and \n     essential for saving lives, then we will be radically \n     reducing our society's capacity to defend itself.\n\n  Recognizing the gravity of the situation, the bipartisan Senate \nIntelligence Committee voted 13 to 2 to include retroactive immunity in \nits bill. This overwhelming vote came after the committee reviewed the \nclassified documents on which these companies relied. The committee \nultimately concluded that the Government ``cannot obtain the \nintelligence it needs without assistance from [telecommunications] \ncompanies.''\n  Protecting the corporate good citizens who answered the call to \nassist our intelligence community during a time of great danger to this \ncountry is the right thing to do. Anything short of full immunity for \nthose companies that, at the Government's request, on the written \nassurance that such action had been authorized by the President and \ndeemed lawful, would undermine the security of the United States is \nsimply unacceptable.\n\n  The carefully crafted, bipartisan Senate Intelligence Committee bill \nprotects privacy interests without undermining our intelligence \ncommunity's ability to do its vitally important job. The bill was \napproved by a vote of 13 to 2 after careful consideration of \ncomplicated issues and classified documents. It will allow our \nintelligence professionals to continue collecting foreign intelligence \nagainst foreign targets located outside the United States without \nrequiring prior court approval. This is consistent with the intent of \nthe legislators who enacted FISA in 1978 and represents no change in \nthe way that the NSA has always conducted foreign surveillance.\n  In so doing, the bill will also continue to protect the civil \nliberties of Americans in this country, surveillance of whom has always \nrequired prior court approval. Nothing we are considering in the Senate \ntoday would alter that. In the event that communication from a U.S. \nperson is inadvertently intercepted, the intelligence community uses \n``minimization procedures'' to suppress the data. The result is that \nthe communication is never used or shared. These procedures have been \nused effectively for 30 years and will remain in place after permanent \nFISA changes are enacted.\n  Enacting permanent modernizations to FISA is one of the most \nimportant duties the Senate will undertake this year. We have known for \n6 months that the Protect America Act would expire on February 1 and \nhave no excuse for not getting this done correctly before that date. \nThe stakes in this debate could not be higher. Although the details can \nbe complicated, the basic issue is pretty simple. As Andy McCarthy said \nin a recent piece for the National Review Online, ``Osama bin Laden \ndoesn't need to apply to a sharia court before blowing up an American \nembassy; the president shouldn't need to apply to a federal court to \ntry to stop him.''\n  Unfortunately, I was unable to make it back to town in time for the \ntwo cloture votes that were held yesterday.\n\n[[Page S440]]\n\nHad I been here, I would have voted for cloture on Rockefeller \namendment No. 3911, the Intelligence Committee's FISA bill, and against \ncloture on Reid amendment No. 3918, to temporarily extend the Protect \nAmerica Act.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, last night, President Bush spoke of the \nbipartisan effort we've seen to put together an economic stimulus \npackage.\n  I have joined this chorus of praise. It is important for us to \nremember that despite our differences, we can find common ground in \npursuit of common good.\n  The stimulus package is in markup today in the Finance Committee. I \nam confident that Chairman Baucus and Senator Grassley will send a bill \nto the floor that all 100 Senators can proudly support.\n  We all agree that with our economy ailing, homeowners struggling and \nenergy prices rising, this short-term stimulus plan will help working \nAmericans make ends meet.\n  But I think we also all agree that this is only the first step. A \nshort-term solution will help, but we must create long-term solutions \nthat will treat the cause rather than the symptoms.\n  President Bush suggested last night that this could be accomplished \nwith more tax cuts for the wealthy.\n  We strongly disagree. No one wondering if they can make their next \nmortgage payment or whether they can afford to retire believes that \nmore tax cuts for the rich will solve this problem.\n  This morning, the Reno Gazette Journal reported that home \nforeclosures in Washoe County--the Reno area of Nevada--skyrocketed 614 \npercent in 2007 from the year before.\n  This pain isn't just felt in one area or neighborhood. Foreclosures \nhave risen in all parts of the Truckee Meadows.\n  One realtor said:\n\n       It's ridiculous. I'm up to 22 right now. A year ago, I had \n     zero. I have potentially another 50 homes not foreclosed on \n     yet but are on the brink. And that's just me.\n\n  Experts say this crisis in Reno, throughout Nevada, and all over \nAmerica is going growing worse.\n  Nationally, foreclosures jumped 79 percent in 2007.\n  One of America's largest lenders, Countrywide, just reported that one \nout of every three subprime loans is now delinquent.\n  And this is affecting not just the families who may lose their \nhomes--but their neighbors who are seeing property values drop, and all \nof us who are faced with the collateral damage of a badly damaged \nhousing market.\n  We call on President Bush to work with us to solve this and other \neconomic problems.\n  We need to provide tax incentives for companies to invest in \nrenewable energy. This will create jobs, save consumers money, and \nprotect our air.\n  America's infrastructure is crumbling. We saw it in the bridge \ncollapse. Investing in our infrastructure will not only strengthen our \ncommunities, it will strengthen our economy by creating good-paying \njobs.\n  For every $10 billion we spend on infrastructure, we create 47,500 \nnew jobs. And for every $10 million capital investment in public \ntransportation, we create $30 million in sales for businesses.\n  Instead of cutting funding for community block grants and the \nConsumer Credit Council in his budget, the President should sit down \nwith us to come up with real long-term solutions.\n  With less than a year to go in his term, we can still come together \nto solve these problems and get America's economy working again.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/29/senate-section/article/S440-3", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S440]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            CITY OF HARTFORD, KENTUCKY, CELEBRATES 200 YEARS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I wish today to honor a long respected \ncommunity in the great Commonwealth of Kentucky, the city of Hartford, \nwhich on February 3, 2008, will celebrate 200 years of establishment in \nthe Commonwealth.\n  Since February 3, 1808, the great city of Hartford has been a part of \nmy great State. After an act of the legislature of the Commonwealth of \nKentucky, Hartford was formally established on 400 acres of land around \nRough River, in the county of Ohio, occupying the land of the late \nGabriel Madison. The city humbly began governing with a group of seven \ntrustees overseeing the town and has since grown to a population of \nover 2,000 outstanding citizens and has developed into the \nadministrative center for Ohio County, becoming the county seat. Now, \ngreat leadership comes from Mayor Earl Russell, who proudly carries on \nthe tradition of his family of governing in Hartford.\n  As proclaimed in Hartford's town slogan, this honored town is home to \n``2,000 happy people and a few soreheads.'' These ``soreheads and happy \npeople'' strenuously work to promote civic pride and generate the \nenthusiasm needed to accomplish future goals throughout their city.\n  Due to the enthusiasm from citizens like these and great leadership \nfrom Mayor Earl Russell, Kentucky has grown to the honorable State it \nis today. Inhabiting the western coal field region of the State, \nHartford has been contributing to the Commonwealth for 200 years and \nhas planned a celebration in honor of this. Because of the continued \ncontribution of the citizens of Hartford to the betterment of their \ntown, county and the Commonwealth, I ask my colleagues to join me in \ncelebrating with them today for 200 years of dedication.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/29/senate-section/article/S440-4", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S440]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    THE MATTHEW SHEPARD ACT OF 2007\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. Each Congress, Senator Kennedy and I introduce \nhate crimes legislation that would strengthen and add new categories to \ncurrent hate crimes law, sending a signal that violence of any kind is \nunacceptable in our society. Likewise, each Congress I have come to the \nfloor to highlight a separate hate crime that has occurred in our \ncountry.\n  On January 14, 2008, 63-year-old Baljeet Singh was parking his car \noutside a Sikh temple in Queens, NY, when David Wood, 36, approached \nhim. Wood reportedly shouted: ``Arab, go back to your country'' before \nphysically attacking Singh. Wood continued to hurl epithets as he beat \nSingh, allegedly without provocation. Singh, whose family has attended \nthe temple--known as a gurdwara--for over 12 years, sustained a broken \nnose and jaw, both of which may require surgery. Wood, who lives near \nthe temple and allegedly has a history of harassing its members, has \nbeen charged with second-degree assault as a hate crime, second and \nthird degree assault, and second-degree aggravated harassment.\n  I believe that the Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, \nto defend them against the harms that come out of hate. Federal laws \nintended to protect individuals from heinous and violent crimes \nmotivated by hate are woefully inadequate. This legislation would \nbetter equip the Government to fulfill its most important obligation by \nprotecting new groups of people as well as better protecting citizens \nalready covered under deficient laws. I believe that by passing this \nlegislation and changing current law, we can change hearts and minds as \nwell.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/29/senate-section/article/S440-5", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S440-S441]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                JUSTICE\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise to speak about justice.\n  Today, the Simon Wiesenthal Center, in coordination with the Targum \nShlishi Foundation, is conducting Operation: Last Chance, a final \neffort to bring the most guilty Nazis to justice before they die. The \nperpetrators of the Holocaust must not be allowed to cheat their \ndeserved fate.\n  The uniqueness of the Holocaust crime lies not wholly in its number \nof\n\n[[Page S441]]\n\nvictims, though that number was horrifyingly large. Its singularity is \nalso the reality of a modern government's methodically executed plan to \nannihilate an entire race, an effort that is now one of the greatest \ncrimes against humanity the world has ever seen. Even in a century \nwhere so much blood was shed--in China, Russia, Africa, and the Middle \nEast--the Holocaust stands alone. For the victims of the Holocaust were \nchosen not based on any threat to the state, real or imaginary. Indeed, \nsome victims had served with distinction in the German Army during the \nFirst World War, and many had then given their lives for their country. \nThey were chosen instead simply for who they were, one of the most \nancient peoples to grace this Earth, and one which has never before \ncome so perilously close to utter oblivion.\n  Historians have argued for years about why and how the Holocaust \noccurred. But for the survivors, and even more for victims, that \nquestion is entirely secondary. There is only the reality of the crime \nand the ongoing quest for justice.\n  We can argue about which Nazi organizations are the most culpable and \nwhich were relatively ignorant. As the Nuremburg war crimes trials \nshowed, all Germans are not guilty, and not all are innocent. In some \ncases, the line blurs slightly. But that does not mean the line does \nnot exist because some--many, perhaps all--are certainly guilty. The \nEinsatzgruppen. The concentration camp guards. The SS. The bureaucrats \nwho signed off on orders with little thought of the immense crime which \nthey were committing. For these people, there can be no amnesty. There \ncan be no looking away. There must be justice.\n  Unfortunately, after the war, many of the guilty scattered to the \nfour corners of the earth. Some, like Klaus Barbie, fled to South \nAmerica. Others remained in Germany, Austria, and the Balkans, where \nsuccessor governments to the Axis gradually lost interest in \nprosecution. Many fled to the United States, which had only finished \nfighting the Nazi threat when it faced a resurgent Soviet threat. The \nCold War diverted, partially, the Western governments from bringing \nNazi killers to justice. Living in homes across the United States and \nEurope, working at normal jobs and raising families, the most culpable \nkillers may have thought they escaped a reckoning. And, for a time, \nthey did. The Government was certainly not looking for them. But one \nman was. One man had himself been a prisoner in those terrible camps \nand had seen firsthand the horrors perpetrated there.\n  Simon Wiesenthal began searching for Nazis and documenting the crimes \nof them after World War II, and continued for many years. The Simon \nWiesenthal Center was founded in 1977 and has an impressive track \nrecord of combating modern bigotry and antisemitism, promoting human \nrights, and ensuring the safety of Jews worldwide. These efforts \ncomplement Simon Wiesenthal's life's work in hunting Nazi fugitives and \ntrying to repair, in part, the damage of the Holocaust.\n  Today, however, the hour grows late. It is now almost 63 years since \nthe end of World War II. Every week, Nazi criminals are passing away, \n80 and 90-year-old men escaping the long arm of justice. Many of the \nhost countries in which they reside are grateful for this quiet end, \navoiding uncomfortable legal proceedings and revisiting old specters \nfrom the past.\n\n  But the easy way is almost never the right way. In these later days, \nit is incumbent on all of us to help finish the task Simon Wiesenthal \nbegan decades ago. In view of the dwindling time available, the center \nlaunched Operation Last Chance in 2002, which is aimed at finding Nazi \nfugitives in the Baltic states, Poland, Romania, Germany, Austria, \nCroatia, and Hungary. There is much work to do: the opening of the \nSoviet archives since 1991 offers a magnificent opportunity to identify \nsome of the most guilty Nazis, previously hidden behind the Iron \nCurtain.\n  Operation Last Chance is fittingly named, after a final opportunity \nto bring those remaining Nazis to earthly justice before they meet \neternal justice. To date Wiesenthal Center has identified nearly 500 \nwar crimes suspects, 99 of whom have been turned over to prosecutors. \nOperation Last Chance primarily focuses on offering rewards for the \nlocation and arrest of such criminals as Dr. Sandor Kepiro, a Hungarian \npolice official; Milivoj Asner, a police chief in fascist Croatia; \nCharles--Karoly--Zentai, a fascist Croatian city governor; Erna \nWallisch, a German concentration camp guard; and many others; and Dr. \nAribeit Heim was nicknamed ``Dr. Death'' for the medical murders and \ntorture he inflicted on hundreds of concentration camp inmates. He is \nat large, and his whereabouts unknown. Finding him, and prosecuting all \nof the wanted Nazi criminals, is a task of the utmost moral importance.\n  The roadblocks are many, and the shortcuts few. This late hour \ndemands that the U.S. Government make every effort to help with \nOperation Last Chance. I call upon the President and Secretary Rice to \nmake it clear to our European and South American allies that we will \nnot tolerate footdragging on extradition orders, deportation, and \ncriminal indictments. We will not tolerate the easy way. We demand that \nthey commit the resources of the U.S. Government to this cause that our \ndescendents will not look back on us and say: In the end, they did too \nlittle. In the end, they turned away.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/29/senate-section/article/S441-1", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S441]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             JOHN SIDNEY `SID' FLOWERS POST OFFICE BUILDING\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON.

He was also a committed elder at the \nFirst Presbyterian Church, to which he gave not only his time, but also \nhis legal expertise.\n  The Senate has passed H.R. 3470, a bill naming the post office in \nHinesville, GA, as the Sidney `Sid' Flowers Post Office Building. It \nwill stand as a reminder of one man's exceptional contribution to his \ncommunity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/29/senate-section/article/S441-2", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S441-S442]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        HONORING WILLIE HENSLEY\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to join in a colloquy with \nfellow Alaska Senator Ted Stevens to honor a giant of the Alaska Native \nrights and Native corporation movement, and an individual who has \nserved his State and Nation for decades with great distinction, Mr. \nWillie ``Iggiagruk'' Hensley.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I too rise to join Senator Murkowski in \nhonoring a personal friend and long-time political colleague, Willie \nHensley. He soon will be retiring after spending the last 10 years \nrepresenting the Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. in Washington, DC, the \npipeline that brings Alaska's North Slope oil to the rest of the \nNation. Immediately prior to that job, he was Alaska's Commissioner of \nCommerce and Economic Development, under the administration of former \nAlaska Governor Tony Knowles. He also has served on important State \ncommissions under both Democratic and Republican governors.\n  Besides leading Alaska's State department responsible for tourism and \nseafood marketing, international trade, insurance, banking and \nsecurities, and occupational licensing, he also was a director of the \nAlaska Permanent Fund Corporation, the Alaska Railroad Corporation, and \nthe Alaska Industrial Development Authority under Democratic Governors, \nand chairman of the Capitol Site Selection Committee and the chairman \nof the Land Claims Task Force under Republican Governors Jay Hammond \nand Walter Hickel.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. And before then, as Senator Stevens well knows, since \nhe too served in the Alaska State Legislature at that time, Mr. Hensley\n\n[[Page S442]]\n\nserved as both a State Representative in Alaska for 4 years, as House \nmajority leader, and as a State senator, for 4 years from 1971-75 and \nagain for a term starting in 1987, representing his home region of \nnorthwest Alaska. Mr. Hensley was born, in Kotzebue, AK, a small \nvillage about 40 miles north of the Arctic Circle. He and his family \nlived in the Noatak River delta where they lived by subsistence \nhunting, fishing and trapping. While home schooled through the Harrison \nChilbowee Academy, he studied for 2 years at the University of Alaska \nin Fairbanks before receiving his B.A. degree in political science with \na minor in economics in 1966 from George Washington University. He then \nconducted postgraduate studies in law at the University of New Mexico.\n  It was in 1966 that he wrote a paper in a constitutional law course \nentitled, ``What Rights to Land Have the Alaska Natives: The Primary \nIssue.'' The paper covered the background of public land issues in \nAlaska and forcefully made the case for Alaska Native claims to \naboriginal lands, that coming 7 years after Alaska had won statehood. \nThe paper, which laid out steps Alaska Natives should take to win their \nland claims, became an important underpinning of the Alaska Native \nrights movement that culminated in passage of the Alaska Native Claims \nSettlement Act in 1971. The Act provided Alaska Natives with 44 million \nacres of Alaska and nearly $1 billion in funds and cemented Mr. \nHensley's reputation as one of the most capable young Native leaders of \nAlaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. As Senator Murkowski knows, while Mr. Hensley entered \nthe Alaska Legislature in 1967, he also was a founder of the NANA \nRegional Corporation, one of the 13 Alaska Native regional corporations \nformed by the 1971 Native Claims Act. He served as a director of the \ncorporation for the first 20 years during its formative period, and \nended his career at NANA as president. While at NANA, he directed its \ninvolvement in the oilfield service industry, most notably in \nenvironmental services and drilling ventures. He also was a guiding \nforce in NANA's development of the Red Dog lead and zinc mine--the \nworld's largest lead and zinc mine. While at NANA he also was a founder \nof the nonprofit Manillaq Corp., the regional nonprofit corporation \nthat represented the tribes in northwest Alaska and that has been the \nleader in improving health care and social services for 11 villages in \nan area nearly the size of the State of West Virginia.\n  While at NANA, Mr. Hensley also served in the formation of the Alaska \nFederation of Natives, the umbrella organization that represents the \nhopes and aspirations of all Native Alaskans, and served as the AFN's \nexecutive director, president and cochairman. In 1979, partially for \nhis pioneering work in Native rights, he was named as one of the young \nleaders of America by Time Magazine in a cover story ``50 Faces for \nAmerica's Future,'' He was honored along with then Arkansas Governor \nand later President Bill Clinton, the Rev. Jesse Jackson, Congressman \nand later Federal Budget Director David Stockman and Ted Turner.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. I understand that Mr. Hensley has recently completed \nhis first book, a memoir entitled, ``50 Miles from tomorrow: A Memoir \nof Alaska and the Real People,'' which will be published later this \nyear.\n   Mr. Hensley, who joined Alyeska Pipeline Corp. years after Alaska's \nPrince William Sound oil spill, has worked tirelessly for the past \ndecade to guarantee that Alaska's oil has flowed south without serious \nincident and without environmental damage or harm to the wildlife that \nis so important to Alaskans' way of life. He has worked tirelessly for \nthe benefit of Alaska and all Alaskans. While he clearly has earned his \nretirement, Alaskans know that Willie will stay involved in issues that \nare vital for the economic betterment of his native State. I and I am \nsure Senator Stevens can't thank him enough for all of his efforts, his \nwisdom and wise counsel and his dedication to making Alaska a better \nplace.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I too wish him well and know that all Members of the \nSenate join us and all Alaskans in wishing him the very best in all his \nfuture endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/29/senate-section/article/S442-1", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S442]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO FAYE MANGER\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN, Mr. President, I come to the floor today to celebrate \nthe 85th birthday of a truly extraordinary woman, my Aunt Faye.\n  Throughout her life, Faye Manger has been committed to philanthropy \nand community service. She established deep roots in Stamford, CT, \nwhere she and her late husband; my Uncle Ben, a successful business \nentrepreneur, established the B.L. Manger Foundation. The foundation, \nwhich Faye has continued since Ben's untimely death in 1995, has \nsupported numerous Jewish charitable, educational, and cultural causes. \nIt has also donated money to advance medical research.\n  In addition to her work with the foundation, Faye is involved in \nsynagogue and community activities in Stamford. She has received \nnumerous awards and honors for her commitment to charities throughout \nthe United States and Israel. During World War II, Faye served her \ncountry in the Women's Army Corps at Fort Monmouth, NJ.\n  Aside from all of her great works, Faye is a loving mother, \ngrandmother and aunt. Faye's and Ben's humanitarian spirit can be seen \nin their four children--Joyce, Marc, Renee, and Steven. All four have \ntaken an active role in charitable activities. In fact, on November 28, \nFaye and her children were honored by the American Committee for Shaare \nZedek Medical Center in Jerusalem for funding the hospital's pediatric \nophthalmology Clinic.\n  Looking back at all she has already done, it would be understandable \nwhy one might expect her to take it easy and relax. But, if I know my \nAunt Faye, she has a lot of good works she will still do, and, with \nGod's help, a lot of great times our family will share together.\n  Thank you, Aunt Faye, for all you have done to make Stamford, and the \nrest of the world, a better place, and for all you have meant to all of \nus who are blessed to be your family and friends.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/29/senate-section/article/S442-2", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S442-S443]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n        CELEBRATING THE 75TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE PORT OF STOCKTON\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in \ncelebrating the 75th anniversary of the Port of Stockton, the second \nbusiest inland port on the west coast.\n  During the Gold Rush, the city of Stockton was an important seaport \nbecause it was the farthest point upriver ships could travel. In the \nearly 20th century, Stockton became a vital hub for farm equipment that \ntransformed the San Joaquin Valley from a primarily wheat-growing \nregion to the Nation's most diverse and productive agricultural region.\n  When it became apparent that the San Joaquin River was too shallow to \naccommodate the increasingly large ships that supplied the region's \ngrowing demand for farm equipment, the first dredging contracts for the \nStockton Deep Water Channel were awarded in 1930. The port of Stockton \nofficially opened in 1933.\n  Today, the Port of Stockton processes more than 6 million tons of \ncargo annually. The port trades with more than 55 countries, from \nCanada to New Zealand, and from Thailand to Trinidad. It supports over \n4,500 jobs in the region, accounting for more than $170 million in \nannual income.\n  In recent years, the Port of Stockton has made a commitment to \nimplement a program for environmentally friendly port operations. \nThrough its Delta Environmental Enhancement Program, the port has \nplanted the seeds for sustained, long-term changes that will help \nprotect the air, water, soil, and wildlife that are part of the \nprecious Delta waterways.\n  The success of the Port of Stockton is made possible by the \ndedication of scores of hard-working people who work together to make \nsure that its operations go smoothly. Every person who has lent a \nhelping hand over the years can take great pride in knowing that their \nsupport and hard work has resulted in the continued growth and success \nof the Port of Stockton.\n  I congratulate the Port of Stockton on its 75th anniversary and wish \nits\n\n[[Page S443]]\n\nstaff and supporters a bright future and continued success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/29/senate-section/article/S443-1", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S443]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO ARTHUR PRATT\n\n Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, today I honor the memory of Arthur \nPratt, a friend and distinguished Hoosier who dedicated his life to \nhelping the less fortunate among us. While I am saddened by Arthur \npassing, I continue to be inspired by his legacy of selfless service.\n  Among his many remarkable endeavors, Arthur will be remembered by \nmany in the Indianapolis community for the work that he did counseling \ninmates as they worked to address addiction to alcohol and drugs. The \nprogram that Arthur created to facilitate these efforts, Life \nEffectiveness Training, has worked in the Marion County Jail for more \nthan 35 years and has since expanded to other counties across Indiana.\n  On July 14, 2001, I joined Arthur at Christ Church Cathedral to \ncelebrate his important leadership of the Life Effectiveness Training \nprogram. Joining Arthur were community leaders who had witnessed the \nsuccess of Arthur's leadership, including members of the religious \ncommunity and law enforcement and government officials.\n  It was my great honor to work closely with Arthur to pass the Jail \nBased Substance Abuse Treatment Act as part of the 21st Century \nDepartment of Justice Appropriations Authorization Act in 2002. This \nlegislation makes available additional resources to programs like Life \nEffectiveness Training as they work with inmates to address their \nsubstance abuse issues. Not only has this approach reduced recidivism \nby up to 64 percent, but it has given countless Hoosiers a new \nopportunity to turn away from crime and commit themselves to becoming \nproductive, law-abiding members of the community.\n  While I know that this is a difficult time for Arthur's family and \nmany friends, my thoughts are with his wife Amal and their children and \ngrandchildren as they remember and celebrate his life of service and \nleadership.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/29/senate-section/article/S443-2", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S443]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      IN RECOGNITION OF BO PELINI\n\n Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, with the Senate having \nreconvened after the recess, I start the new year by rising to \nrecognize Bo Pelini, the new head coach of the University of Nebraska \nCornhuskers' football team.\n  The University of Nebraska at Lincoln, my alma mater, has a proud and \ndistinguished record in National Collegiate Athletic Association, NCAA, \nfootball, including 5 National Championships, 3 Heisman Trophies, 8 \nOutland Trophies, 93 Academic All-Americans, and other impressive \nrecords and awards.\n  Nebraskans statewide are united behind their Cornhuskers and will \nundoubtedly welcome Coach Pelini at Memorial Stadium with an NCAA-\nrecord 290th consecutive sellout for his first home game on August 30, \n2008. Husker fans' optimism has been renewed with the hiring of Coach \nPelini, who we hope will build our program back to its glory days, \nwhich were marked not only by athletic success on the field, but also \nacademic success in the classroom.\n  I joined many of my fellow Cornhusker fans on January 7, 2008, in \ncelebrating the 38-24 victory of Louisiana State University, LSU, over \nOhio State University in the Bowl Championship Series National \nChampionship Game. Our partisanship was directed more at LSU's then-\ndefensive coordinator, Bo Pelini, than it was for the team itself. \nAlthough Coach Pelini had already been hired as Nebraska's new head \ncoach, he honorably chose to finish his commitment at LSU.\n  Coach Pelini and the Tigers came through as champions, further \nencouraging Nebraska fans everywhere that the Big Red can return to \nnational prominence under our new leader. We look forward \nenthusiastically to the annual Red/White Spring Game and the start of \nthe fall collegiate football season. On behalf of my fellow Huskers, I \nwelcome Coach Bo Pelini with a resounding, ``Go Big Red!'' or perhaps, \neven more appropriately, ``Bo Big Red!''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/29/senate-section/article/S443-3", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S443]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:18 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 3913.

A bill to authorize the extension of nondiscriminatory \ntreatment (normal trade relations treatment) to the products of \nKazakhstan; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \ndesigned to extend permanent normal trade relations to Kazakhstan. \nKazakhstan is still subject to the provisions of the Jackson-Vanik \namendment to the Trade Act of 1974, which sanctions nations for failure \nto comply with freedom of emigration requirements. This bill would \nrepeal permanently the application of Jackson-Vanik to Kazakhstan.\n  In the post-Cold-War era, Kazakhstan has demonstrated a commitment to \nmeet these requirements, and in addition, has expressed a strong desire \nto abide by free market principles and good governance. Since 1992, \nKazakhstan has been certified annually as meeting the Jackson-Vanik \nrequirements. This legislation would make this trade relationship \npermanent and, in so doing, stimulate further market reforms and \nencourage a commitment to safeguarding individual liberties.\n  The U.S. has a long record of cooperation with Kazakhstan through the \nNunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction. Kazakhstan inherited the \nfourth largest nuclear arsenal in the world with the fall of the Soviet \nUnion. Through the Nunn-Lugar Program the United States has assisted \nKazakhstan in eliminating this deadly arsenal and joining the \nNonproliferation Treaty as a nonnuclear state.\n  Earlier this month, a team of American scientists working under the \nNunn-Lugar Program quietly entered Kazakhstan in sub-zero temperatures \nto begin the careful packaging of bubonic and pneumonic plague samples \nin accordance with international safety standards for the transport of \ndangerous biological materials. I am pleased to inform my Senate \ncolleagues that the samples have been safely transported on a U.S. Air \nForce C-17 cargo plane to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention in Fort Collins, Colorado. It marked the successful \ncompletion of a 5-year negotiation to secure, transport and develop a \nresearch program for the pathogens.\n  Cooperative research by American and Kazakhstani scientists will \ndevelop prevention and cure possibilities for this deadly plague. It \nprovides new hope for places where the disease is naturally occurring \nand helps deter the plague's use as a bio-terror weapon. As many may \nknow, Plague is a highly lethal disease spread from rodents to humans \nby fleas. It caused the Black Death which swept across Europe in the \n14th century. It is estimated that 20-30 million Europeans died--\nperhaps as much as half of the continent's population at the time. An \nestimated 75 million people worldwide died from the Black Plague.\n\n[[Page S447]]\n\n  Kazakhstani and American plague experts will conduct joint research \non the samples at Federal labs in Fort Collins, CO. They will develop \nadvanced diagnostics and treatments for plague. This cooperative public \nhealth research funded through the U.S. Department Health and Human \nServices Biotechnology Engagement Program will yield valuable \nscientific insights into a potentially devastating disease, which is \nendemic throughout Central Asia. The aim of such cooperation is to \nimprove the protection of Kazakhstani and global populations against a \nnaturally occurring disease that could also be exploited by terrorists.\n  U.S. strategic and economic interests intersect in Central Asia. With \nRussia to the north and Iran and Afghanistan to the south, energy-rich \nCentral Asia is at the frontline of American national security \npriorities. We have tremendous opportunities in the region, but it will \ntake time and consistent high-level effort to build constructive \nrelationships. This region needs to have a much higher priority on \nAmerica's foreign policy agenda. In Kazakhstan, we have a record of 15 \nyears of collaboration on weapons destruction through the Nunn-Lugar \nprogram. This is a solid foundation on which to continue building our \nrelationship.\n  I recently traveled to Kazakhstan and met with senior government \nofficials and discussed opportunities for expanding cooperation with \nthe United States, including energy security. In my conversations with \nKazakh leaders I encouraged the government to pursue trans-Caspian \ntransportation options for oil and gas. At the current time, Kazakhstan \nrelies almost exclusively upon Russia to transport oil and gas to world \nmarkets. In turn, Russia has occasionally demonstrated willingness to \nuse its control over these supplies for political gain at the expense \nof our European allies. Opening trans-Caspian export routes will dilute \nRussia's control over energy supplies. Likewise, having multiple export \noptions will reinforce the political independence of Kazakhstan. I was \npleased that Kazakh officials indicated a willingness to work with the \nU.S. and their neighbors on these issues.\n  There are areas in which Kazakhstan needs to continue to improve. \nThese include market access, democratic and human rights reforms. The \nU.S. must remain committed to assisting Kazakhstan in pursuing these \nreforms. The government in Astana still has important work to do in \nthese critical areas. The permanent waiver of Jackson-Vanik and \nestablishment of permanent normal trade relations will be the \nfoundation on which further progress in a burgeoning partnership can be \nmade.\n  I am hopeful that my colleagues will join me in supporting this \nimportant legislation. It is essential that we act promptly to bolster \nthis burgeoning democracy and promote stability and in this region.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LUGAR:\n  S. 2563. A bill to authorize the extension of nondiscriminatory \ntreatment (normal trade relations treatment) to the products of \nAzerbaijan; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \ndesigned to extend permanent normal trade relations to Azerbaijan. \nAzerbaijan is still subject to the provisions of the Jackson-Vanik \namendment to the Trade Act of 1974, which sanctions nations for failure \nto comply with freedom of emigration requirements. This bill would \nrepeal permanently the application of Jackson-Vanik to Azerbaijan.\n  In the post-Cold-War era, Azerbaijan allows its citizens the right \nand opportunity to emigrate and has demonstrated a commitment to meet \nthese requirements. In addition, Azerbaijan has expressed a strong \ndesire to abide by free market principles and good governance. Since \n1992, Azerbaijan has been certified annually as meeting the Jackson-\nVanik requirements. This legislation would make this trade relationship \npermanent and, in doing so, stimulate further market reforms and \nencourage its continued commitment to safeguarding individual \nliberties.\n  The U.S. has a long record of cooperation with Azerbaijan through the \nNunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction. Through the Nunn-Lugar Program \nthe U.S. has assisted Azerbaijan in safely securing dangerous \nstockpiles of deadly pathogens and infectious diseases and improving \nits ability to interdict weapons and materials of mass destruction. In \n2005 the Nunn-Lugar Program in close coordination with Government of \nAzerbaijan transported 124 samples of 62 unique strains of plague, \nanthrax, cholera, and other dangerous diseases from Baku to the U.S. \nArmed Forces Institute of Pathology in Washington, DC. These strains \nwere collected over many years from environmental, human, and animal \nsources in Azerbaijan. The strains will be studied in joint research \nprograms with the U.S. Department of Defense and Azerbaijan medical \nresearchers.\n  Earlier this month I traveled to Azerbaijan and met with President \nAliyev and the First Lady of Azerbaijan. We had an interesting \ndiscussion on the important role Azerbaijan is playing in energy \nrecovery and transportation. It is a tribute to Azerbaijan that they \nare using their energy resources to the benefit of global security. \nBuilding pipelines and opening energy production to foreign markets \nrequires difficult foreign policy decisionmaking. Azerbaijan is located \nin a tough neighborhood, and countries there are under tremendous \npressure to keep their distance from the U.S. I thanked President \nAliyev for taking concrete steps to affirm his country's strategic \npartnership with the U.S.\n  I discussed at length with the President and members of his \nGovernment the possibility of connecting Azerbaijan's energy \ninfrastructure with Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan. I encouraged continued \nprogress on rapprochement between Governments in Baku and Ashgabat. I \nheard encouraging statements toward improved relations and cooperation \non energy in both Ashgabat and Baku. It is clear that there is \nwillingness for progress.\n  Integrating some oil and gas production in Kazakhstan and \nTurkmenistan would diversify export routes for those countries and \nimport sources for European nations. Successful integration of such \ntrans-Caspian transport routes is a vital contribution to international \npeace and security. In some countries oil and gas revenues are a curse, \nleading to corruption and conflict. Two years ago President Aliyev \npledged to me that Azerbaijan would follow the Norway model in managing \nits oil and gas revenues. As reflected by the State Oil Fund of \nAzerbaijan's receipt in 2007 of the United Nations Public Service \nAward, it is now on a path of transparency and is investing for \ndevelopment today and for future generations. I am hopeful that \nprogress in Azerbaijan will continue and other emerging countries learn \nfrom Azerbaijan's example.\n  One of the areas where we can deepen U.S.-Azerbaijan relations is \nbilateral trade. In light of its adherence to freedom of emigration \nrequirements, compliance with threat reduction and unwavering \ncooperation in the production and delivery of energy supplies, the \nproducts of Azerbaijan should not be subject to the sanctions of \nJackson-Vanik. The U.S. must remain committed and engaged in assisting \nAzerbaijan in pursuing democratic and human rights reforms. The \nGovernment in Baku still has important work to do in these critical \nareas, including in the area of media freedom and freedom of assembly. \nI discussed the ongoing democratic reforms with President Aliyev during \nmy visit and was assured that they are proceeding. Azerbaijan faces an \nimportant Presidential election this October. The support and \nencouragement of the U.S. and the international community will be key \nto encouraging the Government of Azerbaijan to hold free and fair \nelections. The permanent waiver of Jackson-Vanik and establishment of \npermanent normal trade relations will be the foundation on which \nfurther progress in a burgeoning economic and energy partnership can be \nmade.\n  I am hopeful that my colleagues will join me in supporting this \nimportant legislation. It is essential that we act promptly to bolster \nthis important relationship and promote stability in this region.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BIDEN (for himself, Mr. Sununu, and Mr. Specter):\n  S. 2565. A bill to establish an awards mechanism to honor exceptional \nacts of bravery in the line of duty by Federal law enforcement \nofficers; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n[[Page S448]]\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, the Federal Law Enforcement Congressional \nBadge of Bravery Act of 2007 establishes an award to honor exceptional \nacts of bravery in the line of duty by Federal law enforcement \nofficers. This bipartisan bill is cosponsored by Senators Arlen Specter \nand John Sununu and it is supported by the Federal Law Enforcement \nOfficers Association along with other law enforcement groups.\n  An ``ABC Nightly News'' series last November reported that 2007 may \nturn out to be one of the deadliest years in history for law \nenforcement officers. That sour prediction has come to pass. The \nNational Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund--which commemorates the \nservice and sacrifice of law enforcement officers and helps promote law \nenforcement safety--found that officer deaths were up sharply \nnationwide last year. There were 194 fatalities--34 percent more than \nthe year before.\n  Unfortunately, with crime on the rise around the country the increase \nin fallen officers should be no surprise. The FBI's Uniform Crime \nReport for 2006--the gold standard of crime reports in our country--\nmust be taken seriously. Murders were up 1.9 percent on top of the \nprevious year's increases--these were the largest increases in 15 \nyears. What's more, violent crime rose 1.9 percent.\n  Clearly, our Federal law enforcement officers are doing their jobs in \nan environment more fraught with danger than ever. Police departments \naround the country are scrambling in an arms race to match the \nfirepower of the bad guys. In my view, we should give special \nrecognition to those Federal law enforcement officers who are going \nabove and beyond to protect us in this kind of environment.\n  With this bill Congress can continue its support of the brave men and \nwomen law enforcement officers who risk their lives every day making \nsure our communities are safe. I hope this bill will be accepted by the \nfull Senate.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER (for herself, Mrs. Dole, Mr. Tester, Mrs. Murray, \n        Mr. Wyden, Ms. Cantwell Ms. Stabenow, and Mr. Obama):\n  S. 2569. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to authorize \nthe Director of the National Cancer Institute to make grants for the \ndiscovery and validation of biomarkers for use in risk stratification \nfor, and the early detection and screening of, ovarian cancer; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I am joined by my colleagues \nSenators Dole, Tester, Murray, Wyden, Cantwell, Stabenow, and Obama to \nintroduce the Ovarian Cancer Biomarker Research Act of 2008--\nlegislation that supports the research of early detection and screening \nof ovarian cancer\n  For many years, ovarian cancer has been called the ``silent killer'' \nbecause the list of symptoms women are warned to look out for are \nmerely whispers about the dangers of this deadly disease.\n  There is currently no effective screening test available for ovarian \ncancer and the disease is difficult to identify because symptoms are \neasily misdiagnosed. Without an effective screening test most women who \nhave ovarian cancer are diagnosed too late to be saved.\n  A woman's chance of surviving ovarian cancer is considerably greater \nif she is diagnosed early. When ovarian cander is diagnosed early, more \nthan 93 percent of women survive longer than 5 years. Unfortunately, 4 \nout of 5 ovarian cancer cases in the U.S. are diagnosed in the later \nstages, when a woman's chance of surviving that long drops to about 30 \npercent.\n  Though only one in 69 women will face ovarian cancer, this disease \nranks fifth in cancer deaths among women and causes more deaths than \nany other cancer of the female reproductive system. In the last year \nalone, the National Cancer Institute, (NCI), estimated there were \n15,280 deaths from ovarian cancer in the U.S.\n  Developing the tools to detect ovarian cancer early is critical to \nimproving the rate of survival for women struck by this disease--that \nis why this legislation is so necessary.\n  Specifically, the Ovarian Cancer Biomarker Research Act would \nauthorize NCI to make grants for public or nonprofit entities to \nestablish research centers focused on ovarian cancer biomarkers. \nBiomarkers are biochemical features within the body that can be used to \nmeasure the progress of a disease and predict the effects of treatment. \nThis legislation also authorizes funding for a national clinical trial \nthat will enroll at-risk women in a study to determine the clinical \nutility of using these validated ovarian cancer biomarkers.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me as well as the Society of Gynecologic \nOncologists, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, \nthe Ovarian Cancer National Alliance, and the American College of \nSurgeons in supporting the Ovarian Cancer Biomarker Research Act of \n2008.\n  This legislation is of vital importance to the health of thousands of \nwomen across our Nation. I look forward to working with my colleagues \nto pass this critical investment in the fight against ovarian cancer.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. MURKOWSKI (for herself and Mr. Stevens):\n  S. 2570. A bill to amend title II of the Social Security Act to \nauthorize waivers by the Commissioner of Social Security of the 5-month \nwaiting period for entitlement to benefits based on disability in cases \nin which the Commissioner determines that such waiting period would \ncause undue hardship to terminally ill beneficiaries; to the Committee \non Finance.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to discuss \nlegislation that I have introduced that will fix an inequity in the \nSocial Security disability insurance system. This inequity rises from \nFederal law that places an arbitrary 5-month waiting period on when an \nindividual who has been diagnosed with a terminal illness is eligible \nfor disability compensation provided through Social Security benefits.\n  Currently, under title II of the Social Security Act, Federal law \nrequires a 5-month waiting period from when the patient is diagnosed \nuntil the disability benefits begin. Monthly cash benefits, about $980 \non average, will be provided to the disabled individual to help offset \nmedical or any other expenses and will also help diminish the financial \nhardships that are faced by those workers.\n  The monthly cash benefits that are available to the individuals can \nhelp not only offset the medical or other expenses, but they can really \nhelp to diminish financial hardships that are faced by the workers, by \nthe families, who really may have very little or oftentimes no \nresources to fall back upon during the early months of a disability.\n  This legislation came about as a result of a telephone call received \nin my Anchorage office to the head of my constituent services. She \nreceived a call from a constituent in Alaska by the name of Robert \nJames. He indicated he had been diagnosed in November with stage 4 lung \ncancer, and he was given, at that time, 3 to 6 months to live. He \ncalled my office asking for help.\n  He wanted to know how, as someone who had just been diagnosed with a \nterminal illness, he might be eligible for disability compensation \nprovided through Social Security benefits.\n  And so my constituent service director, after listening to his story, \nwent through everything to try to figure out a way to help this \nindividual, only to learn that the process, the law as it sets out now, \nprovides for a 5-month waiting period.\n  Although Mr. James has insurance coverage through his employer, he is \nunable to work because of his disability. He is going to incur \nthousands of dollars, probably hundreds of thousands of dollars in \nmedical bills because of this arbitrary 5-month waiting period.\n  If he had only been given the opportunity to demonstrate his case for \nfinancial hardship to the Social Security Commissioner, he and his \nfamily may have qualified for this cash benefit offset. What my \nlegislation would do is give the Social Security Commissioner the \nability to waive the 5-month waiting period on a case-by-case basis for \nterminally ill individuals who would have to demonstrate the financial \nhardship.\n\n[[Page S449]]\n\n  In Mr. James's case, as I indicated, he is employed, works for the \ncargo department of a major airline in Alaska, but he would have to \ndemonstrate there is financial hardship as a consequence of this \nterminal diagnosis.\n  It makes you wonder why this 5-month period. The capriciousness of a \n5-month waiting period is evidenced by looking at the legislative \nhistory. In 1972, the House Ways and Means Committee report sought to \nreduce the waiting period from at that time 6 months to 5 months. At \nthe time the Senate Finance Committee was pushing for a shorter period. \nThey were pushing for a 4-month period.\n  So back in 1972, you had a 6-month period. Some wanted it to go to 4 \nmonths. Eventually they agreed upon a 5-month waiting period. But it \nbegs the question: Should it be 4 months, 5 months? Should it only be 1 \nmonth?\n  My legislation would give the Social Security Commissioner the \ndiscretion to waive the waiting period if the terminally ill individual \ncan demonstrate a financial hardship. This will alleviate the financial \nburden or help to offset the financial burden of a terminal illness on \nthe disabled individuals and their families and will also provide for a \nfinancial offset for paying medical bills after he or she is deceased.\n  I would ask that in honor of my constituent, Mr. Jones, my colleagues \nsupport this bill because there are people who become disabled.

and\n       (2) urges communities, schools, parents, and youth to \n     engage in, and carry out, appropriate prevention and \n     education activities and programs to reduce and stop drug use \n     before it starts.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President. Today I rise to introduce an important \nresolution designating the week of February 10-16, 2008 as National \nDrug Prevention and Education Week. While we have made progress in \ncurbing the rate of illegal drug use among teens in this country, there \nremains a great deal of work to be done. Key components of staying on \ntop of emerging drug threats and lowering the overall rate of drug use \nin this country are prevention and education. These efforts start at \nthe local level and this resolution encourages communities, schools, \nparents, and youth to engage in and carry out community-based \nprevention and education activities and programs to reduce and stop \ndrug use before it starts.\n  We have come a long way in combating drug use in this country, in \nlarge part because of the good work of so many talented professionals \nin the prevention and treatment fields. However, the rates of illegal \ndrug use among teens and adults remains too high. The overall rate of \ncurrent illegal drug use among persons aged 12 or older is 8.3 percent, \nwhich has remained stable since 2002. Moreover, the well-known \nMonitoring the Future survey found ``a clear pattern of gradually \nrising use [of ecstasy] in the upper grades'' over the past couple of \nyears. Thus, as the data shows, clearly we have got a lot of work left \nto do.\n  The threat of illegal drugs is not our only concern. Newly released \ndata shows that abuse of prescription and over-the-counter medicines is \na huge problem that has not declined in recent years. One in ten 12th \ngraders has reported non-medical use of the powerful painkiller Vicodin \nwithin the past year and abuse rates of other powerful narcotics are \nsimilarly troubling.\n  Abuse of over-the-counter drugs has also become concerning, with \nnearly 6 percent of 12th graders having used over-the-counter cough and \ncold medications in the past year for the purpose of getting high. \nThese problems don't simply pose serious health risks, but they are \nalso closely linked to low educational achievement and increased risk \nof illegal activity and crime.\n  One critical component of stemming drug use is prevention. Over 20 \nyears of research has demonstrated that prevention intervention, \ndesigned and tested to reduce risk and enhance protective factors, can \nhelp children at every step along their developmental path, from early \nchildhood into young adulthood. The more successful we are at general \nprevention of drug use in younger adolescents, the less we will have to \ndeal with the concomitant economic and societal consequences of their \nuse-including the more than $500 billion in societal costs associated \nwith drug and alcohol use. Community anti-drug coalitions provide the \nflexibility needed to effectively address the local needs of their \ncommunities.\n  Coalitions of local leaders, including parents, teachers, religious \nleaders, local law enforcement officials, youth, and business leaders \nhave the power to reduce the demand for drugs, and we must support \ntheir efforts and applaud them for their outstanding work on these \nissues.\n  During the week of February 10-16, thousands of community anti-drug \ncoalition leaders and community based substance abuse prevention, \ntreatment, and education specialists will come to Washington, DC to \nreceive state-of-the-art technical assistance, training, and education \non drug prevention at the Community Anti-Drug Coalition of America's \nAnnual National Leadership Forum. I applaud these community leaders--\nand prevention and treatment professionals around the Nation--for their \ntireless efforts to curb drug use in our country and, in recognition of \nthese efforts I have introduced this resolution to designate the week \nof February 10-16, 2008 as National Drug Prevention and Education Week.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/29/senate-section/article/S450-1", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S450-S451]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              NATIONAL DRUG PREVENTION AND EDUCATION WEEK\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague, \nSenator Biden, in cosponsoring a resolution to designate the week of \nFebruary 10-16, 2008, as National Drug Prevention and Education Month. \nAlthough recent survey data compiled by the Substance Abuse and Mental \nHealth Services Administration shows illegal drug use among youth has \ndeclined by 24 percent since 2001, the number of teens abusing \nprescription and over-the-counter medicines has rapidly increased. Kids \nare turning to these dangerous drugs because they are easily accessible \nand widely used. Many of us do not realize that our left-over \nprescriptions and cold medicines are just as addictive and dangerous as \nmeth or heroin when not properly used. This is why we must continue our \nefforts to inform the public about the dangers of these and other \ndrugs. We must continue to do all we can to prevent our kids from \nfalling into a vicious cycle of drug abuse and dependence.\n  Research has shown that if you can keep a child drug free until they \nturn 20, chances are very slim that they will ever try or become \naddicted to drugs. This is why it is essential to maintain a coherent \nantidrug message that begins early in adolescence and continues \nthroughout the growing years. Such an effort must engage professionals, \nparents, communities, and young people. While the Federal Government \nhas a role to play in supporting these activities, local, community-\nbased initiatives are better able to target specific concerns and \nrespond to them flexibly.\n  Local community antidrug coalitions are our first line of defense \nagainst the scourge of drug abuse. Each community is different from the \nother, and each community antidrug coalition is tailored to meet the \nspecific antidrug needs of its community. For example, I formed the \nFace It Together, FIT, Coalition in an effort to combat drug use in \nIowa. My goal with FIT is to bring to the same table parents, \neducators, businesses, religious leaders, law enforcement officials, \nhealth care providers, youth groups, and members of the media to \npromote new ways of thinking about how to reach and educate Iowans \nabout the dangers of drug abuse. With everyone working together, we \nwill make a difference in our communities. Moreover, together we can \nbuild healthy children, healthy families, healthy communities, and a \nhealthy future for society at large.\n  Community antidrug coalitions would not be able to succeed in \nfighting drug abuse without the support of the Community Anti-Drug \nCoalitions of America, CADCA. CADCA works to strengthen the ability of \nnew and existing community coalitions to build safe, healthy, and drug-\nfree communities and helps provide vital funding to local coalitions \nthrough the Drug Free Communities grant program.\n  Since the inception of the Drug Free Communities grant program over \n1,300 community coalitions have received grants nationwide. There have \nbeen 43 coalitions in my State of Iowa that have received grants to \nprovide crucial assistance to combat the abuse of alcohol, tobacco, and \nillegal drugs. These coalitions have been successful in tracking the \nuse of illegal drugs in their communities, starting afterschool and \nsummer programs for kids, holding community events and townhall \nmeetings, and uniting all sectors of the community to fight drug abuse.\n  I believe that we have a moral obligation to ensure that our young \npeople have a chance to grow up without being accosted by drug dealers \nat every turn, whether on TV, in the movies, or on the way to school. \nWe need, as a country, to create a strong moral context to help our \nkids know how to make the right choices. They need to know how to say \n``no.'' They need to know that saying ``no'' is OK. They need to know \nthat saying ``no'' to drugs is the right thing to do, not just the safe \nthing or the healthier thing\n\n[[Page S451]]\n\nbut the right thing. I urge my colleagues to join us in passing this \nresolution to show our ongoing support for community antidrug \ncoalitions that work to eliminate drug abuse throughout the Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/29/senate-section/article/S451-1", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S451]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 435--RECOGNIZING THE GOALS OF CATHOLIC SCHOOLS WEEK \n  AND HONORING THE VALUABLE CONTRIBUTIONS OF CATHOLIC SCHOOLS IN THE \n                             UNITED STATES\n\n  Mr. VITTER (for himself and Ms. Landrieu) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

I ask unanimous consent we now proceed to S. Res. 433.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 433) honoring the brave men and women \n     of the U.S. Coast Guard whose tireless work, dedication, and \n     selfless service to the United States have led to more than 1 \n     million lives saved over the course of its long and storied \n     217-year history.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I have come to the floor to speak to the \nSenate about the heroic actions of PO Willard Milam, a U.S. Coast Guard \nrescue swimmer who serves our Nation in Kodiak, AK.\n  I hope many Senators have seen the film ``The Guardian.'' Really, I \ndo believe it was Willard Milam who inspired the preparation of that \nmovie, and I want to tell the Senate about his actions.\n  Shortly after midnight on February 10, 2007, the U.S. Coast Guard \nRescue\n\n[[Page S455]]\n\nCoordination Center in Juneau, AK, received an emergency beacon from a \nfishing vessel. The vessel was the Illusion. \n  Like so many of our brave Coast Guard men and women, Petty Officer \nMilam and his crew of four launched in a Coast Guard rescue helicopter \nto investigate the source of the distress signal they had received, \nundaunted by a howling 50-mile-an-hour wind and heavy rain and near \nzero visibility.\n  When the aircrew arrived on the scene, they realized that the crew of \nthe fishing vessel had abandoned their ship and climbed into a life \nraft, which was being tossed, at that time, in the treacherous Bering \nSea. Petty Officer Milam readied himself to be hoisted down into the \n40-degree temperature seas below.\n  As soon as Petty Officer Milam entered the water, he swam to the life \nraft and found four survivors. They were hypothermic and in shock and \nunprotected from the elements. They did not have any survival equipment \non. One by one, Petty Officer Milam pulled the survivors out of the \nlife raft and took them and swam with them over to a rescue basket that \nhad been lowered through the darkness from the helicopter that was \nhovering above them.\n  After loading the first two survivors into the rescue basket, Petty \nOfficer Milam could begin to feel the frigid water flowing into his own \nsuit. He told me it had, unfortunately, hung up on the edge of the life \nraft and partially unzipped and that water was filling into his \nsurvival suit. But he had to fight the debilitating effects of the cold \nand struggle against exhaustion in order to continue to swim the third \nsurvivor from the life raft to the rescue basket.\n  While the third survivor was being lifted toward the spotlights of \nthe rescue helicopter, Petty Officer Milam--his legs now numb with \ncold--realized that the life raft, with one survivor still onboard, had \ndrifted too far for him to reach under its current condition. So he \nsignaled for an emergency pickup, and he was hoisted back into the \nhelicopter.\n  Once inside the helicopter, he became aware of the fact that the crew \nhad only enough fuel to remain on the scene for 15 minutes more. But \nPetty Officer Milam courageously asked to be lowered back into the sea, \nnow over the top of this survivor, to try and save that last remaining \nsurvivor.\n  Upon entering the water, Petty Officer Milam pulled the last \nsurvivor, who was now very combative because of the fear of the \ncircumstances--he was nearly drowning--he was forced to drag this \nperson from the life raft through the storm back into this rescue \nbasket.\n  With the last survivor in the rescue helicopter, Petty Officer Milam \ndrifted into a stage of unconsciousness as the aircrew lowered the \nrescue basket directly back to him. He was still in the water. \nMiraculously, Petty Officer Milam was able to climb inside that basket \nand was hoisted to safety.\n  He told me personally that the next time he awoke he was in the \nclinic at Dutch Harbor, AK, wrapped in blankets and surrounded by heat \nlamps. As a matter of fact, he told me he was in bed for a period of \nhours, and they told him his boat was leaving, so he just got himself \nup and went back to the dock and went onboard the boat. This man is one \nof the most courageous men I have ever met in my life.\n  When we consider the Coast Guard as the guardian of our last \nfrontier, I am proud to tell the Senate that fellow Alaskans recognize \nhim as a man who has dedicated his life to public service. Petty \nOfficer Milam's heroic actions personify the selfless public service \nrepresentative of U.S. Coast Guard men and women who are stationed \naround the globe and represent us so well.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed to, \nthe preamble be agreed to, the motions to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 433) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 433\n\n       Whereas, since 1867 the United States Coast Guard has been \n     a vital piece of Alaskan history, providing lifesaving \n     medical treatment to native villages along its coasts, \n     protecting its fisheries resources, and courageously rescuing \n     those who face peril on the seas;\n       Whereas, in 2007 the men and women of the United States \n     Coast Guard stationed in Alaska valiantly responded to 696 \n     calls for assistance and saved the lives of 463 mariners in \n     distress;\n       Whereas, the actions of Petty Officer Willard L. Milam \n     personify the proud history of courage and public service of \n     the United States Coast Guard on the 10th of February, 2007, \n     when, on a pitch-black winter morning, Petty Officer Milam \n     launched aboard a Coast Guard HH-65 helicopter in near-zero \n     visibility to locate the source of a distress signal \n     approximately 50 miles southwest in Makushin Bay, Alaska;\n       Whereas, Petty Officer Milam bravely deployed into storm \n     tossed, 40-degree seas and swam to a life raft to find four \n     survivors hypothermic and soaked in unprotected clothing;\n       Whereas, Petty Officer Milam heroically overcame exhaustion \n     and hypothermia to pull each survivor from a life raft and \n     assist them through the raging seas, placing them into a \n     rescue basket to be hoisted into the rescue helicopter;\n       Whereas, Petty Officer Milam's courageous rescue off the \n     coast of Alaska has earned him the 2007 Coast Guard \n     Foundation Award for Heroism and the 2007 Captain Frank \n     Erickson Aviation Rescue Award;\n       Whereas, through extraordinary teamwork, airmanship, and \n     courage, the crew of the Coast Guard rescue helicopter saved \n     four lives from the treacherous Bearing Sea: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n     Resolved, That the Senate--\n         (1) honors the heroic accomplishments of Petty Officer \n     Willard Milam, who represented the finest traditions of the \n     United States Coast Guard during the dramatic rescue of four \n     survivors from the treacherous Bering Sea; and\n         (2) honors the United States Coast Guard, America's \n     lifesavers and guardians of the sea, for its unflinching \n     determination and proud 217-year history of maritime search \n     and rescue resulting in over 1 million lives saved; and\n         (3) recognizes the tireless work, dedication, and \n     commitment of Coast Guard men and women, many of them \n     stationed in Alaska, far away from family and friends, who \n     commit themselves every day to executing this noble mission \n     hundreds of miles from our shores with honor, respect, and \n     devotion to duty.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/29/senate-section/article/S455-1", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S455-S456]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         CATHOLIC SCHOOLS WEEK\n\n  Mr. REID.

Res. 431\n\n       Whereas on December 27, 2007, Kenyan citizens went \n     peacefully to the polls to elect a new parliament and a new \n     President and signaled their commitment to democracy by \n     turning out in large numbers, and in some instances waiting \n     in long lines to vote;\n       Whereas election observers reported serious irregularities \n     and a lack of transparency that, combined with the \n     implausibility of the margin of victory, and the swearing in \n     of the Party of National Unity presidential candidate Mwai \n     Kibaki with undue haste, all serve to undermine the \n     credibility of the presidential election results;\n       Whereas the Government of Kenya imposed a ban on live media \n     broadcasts that day, and shortly after the election results \n     were announced, in contravention of Kenyan law, the \n     Government also announced a blanket\n\n[[Page S457]]\n\n     ban on public assembly and gave police the authority to use \n     lethal force;\n       Whereas subsequent to declaring Mr. Kibaki the winner, the \n     head of the Election Commission of Kenya (ECK) stated that he \n     did not know who won the presidential election;\n       Whereas in the aftermath of the election announcement, \n     significant violence began and continues to flare;\n       Whereas on January 1, 2008, 4 commissioners on the ECK \n     issued a statement which called for a judicial review and \n     tallying of the vote;\n       Whereas the head of the European Union Election Observation \n     Mission stated that ``[l]ack of transparency, as well as a \n     number of verified irregularities . . . cast doubt on the \n     accuracy of the results of the presidential election as \n     announced by the ECK'' and called for an international audit \n     of the results;\n       Whereas the Attorney General of Kenya has called for an \n     independent investigation of the tallying of votes and for \n     the votes to be retallied;\n       Whereas observers from the East African Community have \n     called for an investigation into irregularities during the \n     tallying process and for those responsible for such \n     irregularities to be held accountable;\n       Whereas some estimates indicate that at least 700 people \n     have died and as many as 250,000 have been displaced as a \n     result of this violence, which continues;\n       Whereas the economic cost to Kenya of the violence and \n     civil unrest in the wake of the disputed polls is estimated \n     at $1,000,000,000;\n       Whereas the Assistant Secretary of State for African \n     Affairs traveled to Nairobi in an attempt to mediate between \n     the 2 leading presidential candidates and has stated that \n     ``serious flaws in the vote tallying process damaged the \n     credibility of the process'' and that the United States \n     should not ``conduct business as usual'' in Kenya; and\n       Whereas Kenya has been a valuable strategic, political, \n     diplomatic, and economic partner to those in the subregion, \n     region, and to the United States and has been 1 of the major \n     recipients of United States foreign assistance in sub-Saharan \n     Africa for decades: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) commends the Kenyan people for their commitment to \n     democracy and respect for the democratic process, as \n     evidenced by the high voter turnout and peaceful voting on \n     election day;\n       (2) strongly condemns the violence in Kenya;\n       (3) urges all politicians and political parties to \n     immediately desist from the reactivation, support, and use of \n     militia organizations that are ethnic-based or otherwise \n     constituted;\n       (4) calls on the 2 leading presidential candidates to--\n       (A) engage in an internationally brokered dialogue, which \n     results in a new political dispensation that is supported by \n     Kenyan civil society; and\n       (B) respect the will of the Kenyan people;\n       (5) simultaneously--\n       (A) supports a call for electoral justice in Kenya, \n     including a thorough and credible independent audit of \n     election results with the possibility, depending on what is \n     discovered, of a recount or retallying of votes, or a rerun \n     of the presidential elections within a specified time period; \n     and\n       (B) encourages any political settlement to take into \n     account these recommendations;\n       (6) calls on Kenyan security forces to refrain from use of \n     excessive force and respect the human rights of Kenyan \n     citizens;\n       (7) calls for those who are found guilty of committing \n     human rights violations to be held accountable for their \n     actions;\n       (8) calls for an immediate end to the restrictions on the \n     media, and on the rights of peaceful assembly and \n     association;\n       (9) condemns threats to civil society leaders and human \n     rights activists who are working towards a peaceful, just, \n     and equitable political solution to the current electoral \n     crisis;\n       (10) holds all political actors in Kenya responsible for \n     the safety and security of civil society leaders and human \n     rights advocates;\n       (11) calls on the international community, United Nations \n     aid organizations, and all neighboring countries to provide \n     assistance to Kenyan refugees who have fled in search of \n     greater security;\n       (12) encourages others in the international community to \n     work together and use all diplomatic means at their disposal \n     to persuade relevant political actors to commit to a peaceful \n     resolution to the current crisis; and\n       (13) urges the President of the United States to--\n       (A) support diplomatic efforts to facilitate a dialogue \n     between leaders of the Party of National Unity, the Orange \n     Democratic Movement, and other relevant actors;\n       (B) consider the imposition of personal sanctions, \n     including a travel ban and asset freeze on leaders in the \n     Party of National Unity, the Orange Democratic Movement, and \n     other relevant actors who refuse to engage in meaningful \n     dialogue to end the current crisis; and\n       (C) conduct a review of current United States aid to Kenya \n     for the purpose of restricting all nonessential assistance to \n     Kenya, unless all parties are able to establish a peaceful, \n     political resolution to the current crisis, which is credible \n     with the Kenyan people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/29/senate-section/article/S457-1", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S457]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              EXTENSION OF THE PROTECT AMERICA ACT OF 2007\n\n  Mr. REID.
