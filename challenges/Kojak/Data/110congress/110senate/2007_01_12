Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: How much time is \ndivided up now?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 7 minutes on the Senator's side.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, my amendment is cosponsored by Senator Salazar, \nSenator Ben Nelson, and Senator Pryor, and it is based on a bill \nSenator Salazar and I introduced that we hope will go some further \ndistance in this effort we are engaged in now with ethics reform to \nreestablish the trust of the American people in their Government in \nWashington.\n  We do this by an effort to prevent Members of Congress who betray \nthat trust from receiving their pensions. This is plain deterrence. It \nis an effort to try to make it clear there are serious consequences to \nbetraying that trust.\n  In a sense, the trust is larger than perhaps the day-to-day \nrelationship of most citizens in this country to the law. We take a \nspecial oath of office to uphold the Constitution of the United States. \nBut, more importantly, when people elect you to high Federal office, or \nany office, they are putting a special kind of trust in you to \nrepresent their lives, their interests, their values--indeed, the \nhighest level of aspiration of values that we all share in this \ncountry.\n  So this is done because there is something that grates in the notion \nthat you can put the public's trust and the public's business up for \nsale and then walk away and have the people whom you betrayed turn \naround and pay for you to be able to have for the rest of your life a \nfat pension because of the level of service you had reached at their \ntrust.\n  Let me be very specific about this. A few years ago, Congressmen \nRandy ``Duke'' Cunningham sat down at a cozy meeting with some \nlobbyists and he proceeded to betray the public trust.\n\n[[Page S487]]\n\nHe used his official congressional stationary to draft a series of quid \npro quo deals.\n  Let me show you this blowup of the stationary itself: Here is the \ncongressional seal. Here is Randy ``Duke'' Cunningham's name. Here is a \nlist of the amounts of millions of dollars: $16 million; ``BT''--that \nis ``boat''--``140''--that was $140,000--$17 million; an additional \n$50,000; $18 million, $50,000. Once they paid about $340,000. The price \nof this service went down, and he charged only $25,000 for each million \ndollars of contract that he would award.\n  He was convicted of collecting approximately $2.4 million in homes, \nyachts, antique furnishings, and other bribes--including a Rolls \nRoyce--from defense contractors. This disgraceful conduct--which is \nbeyond the comprehension of any Member of this institution--earned him \n8 years and 4 months in a Federal prison, and it has required him to \nalso pay the Government $1.8 million in penalties but also some back \ntaxes.\n  But under today's rules, the American taxpayer is going to continue \nto pay a Federal pension that is out of the reach of any American \ntaxpayer, and that is disgraceful. Right now, only a conviction for a \ncrime against the United States, such as treason or espionage, would \ncost a Member of Congress their pension. So we set a standard for the \npension being held accountable, but it is only for two things. Surely \nwe ought to put this moral bar higher than that.\n  Most Americans do not get a $40,000 a year pension. Those who abuse \nthe public trust should not be allowed to exploit the Federal system at \ntaxpayers' expense. The American people cannot afford to spend millions \non pensions for politicians who steal from them. More importantly, \nCongress cannot afford to have a standard where it is willing to \nforgive and forget and betray that trust.\n  I have shown what the ``bribe menu'' was, which is a pretty \nextraordinary menu. Unfortunately, Congressman Cunningham was not \nalone. Last November, Representative Bob Ney resigned from the House of \nRepresentatives after pleading guilty to conspiracy and making false \nstatements. In a plea agreement, former Representative Ney acknowledged \ntaking trips, tickets, meals, and campaign donations from Mr. Abramoff \nin return for taking official actions on behalf of Abramoff clients.\n  In March 2002, Representative Ney inserted an amendment in the Help \nAmerica Vote Act to lift an existing Federal ban against commercial \ngaming by a Texas Native American tribal client of Abramoff. In return, \nRepresentative Ney received all-expenses-paid and reduced-price trips \nto Scotland to play golf, a trip to New Orleans to gamble, and a \nvacation in Lake George--all courtesy of Mr. Abramoff.\n  Another former Congressman, Jim Traficant, currently enjoys a lavish \ntaxpayer-funded lifetime pension worth an estimated $1.2 million, \ndespite being thrown out of Congress and sent to jail.\n  So these examples are just three of at least 20 former lawmakers who \nwere convicted of serious crimes and are still receiving a taxpayer-\nfunded pension, some as high as $125,000 a year.\n  As I said earlier, we should hold ourselves to the highest standards. \nThe principle is a simple one: Public servants who abuse the public \ntrust and are convicted of ethics crimes should not collect taxpayer-\nfinanced pensions. This should serve, hopefully, as a bold deterrent \nthat when any Member comes in here, they know they are putting their \nlives at greater risk than just the penalty they might pay on a short-\nterm basis for their particular transgression.\n  This amendment denies Federal pensions--as soon as is legally \npossible--to Members of Congress who are convicted of white-collar \ncrimes, such as bribery of public officials and witnesses, conspiracy \nto defraud the United States, perjury in falsely denying the commission \nof bribery or conspiracy, and subornation of perjury committed in \nconnection with the false denial or false testimony of another \nindividual.\n  It is my understanding there is some concern among a couple of \nMembers about how this legislation might affect innocent spouses and \nchildren of Members of Congress who lose their pensions as a result of \nthis legislation. Obviously, we are trying to set up an adequate \ndeterrent to prevent people from that in the first place.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. But after the legislation is enacted, the Member will \nstill receive a refund of all of their personal contributions--those \nwill not be taken away--into either the Federal Employees Retirement \nSystem or the Civil Service Retirement System, and they will retain all \nthe benefits from the Thrift Savings Plan.\n  Also, the payment of spousal benefits is permitted in forfeiture \ncases when the Attorney General determines that the spouse cooperated \nwith Federal authorities in the conduct of a criminal investigation.\n  This can significantly improve our Government by the way business is \ndone. I hope my colleagues will join overwhelmingly in voting to \nprohibit sending pension checks to criminals. This amendment is a step \nin the right direction.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I rise today as a cosponsor of \nthe amendment introduced by Mr. Kerry and Mr. Salazar. I strongly \nencourage my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  When the ethics reform process began last year, I was quick to point \nout that, for the most part, our laws had worked the way we intended. \nToday, Jack Abramoff, Bob Ney, and Duke Cunningham have all been found \nguilty of the crimes they committed and have been punished accordingly. \nLast year, when we held our hearing in the Rules Committee, I remarked \nthat Capitol Hill must be the only place in the world where, if someone \nbreaks the law, we rush to change the law.\n  Well in this case, we have an opportunity to add to the law to \ncorrect a significant shortcoming. We take away the retirement benefits \nof those Members of Congress who violate the public trust by committing \ncrimes while in office.\n  It is often said, ``If you do the crime, you do the time.'' Well, it \nseems that if you are a former Congressman or Senator, you do the \ncrime, do the time, and continue to collect Federal retirement benefits \npaid for by the American taxpayer. That just doesn't seem right to me.\n  This amendment, the Congressional Pension Accountability Act, will \nbar Members of Congress from receiving taxpayer-funded retirement \nbenefits after they have been convicted of bribery, conspiracy, \nperjury, or other serious ethics offenses. If we are serious about \ncleaning up Congress, we should approve this amendment and put our \nmoney where our mouth is--by saying that the public, who are the \nprimary victims of crimes committed by elected officials, should not be \nrequired to pay benefits for those who are convicted of a breach of the \npublic's trust.\n  I strongly believe that all Members of Congress must be held to the \nhighest ethical standards and those who violate the public trust must \nbe held accountable for their actions. I urge my colleagues to support \nthis amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from \nMassachusetts. I think this is an excellent amendment. I think it is \nlong overdue. I am very hopeful it will pass the Senate this morning.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to very briefly discuss the \namendments I have offered. I will be happy to debate them more fully at \nthe appropriate time if necessary. All of these amendments are drawn \nfrom the bill I introduced this week with Senators Obama, Lieberman, \nand Tester, S. 230. I believe that several of the amendments have the \nsupport of the majority leader, but for a variety of reasons, they were \nnot included in the substitute that is now before the body. I again \nthank him for his support of strong lobbying and ethics reform, and I \nlook forward to the Senate's consideration of these amendments.\n  My first amendment, amendment 31, changes the universe of activities \nthat former Members of Congress can engage in during their cooling off \nperiod after they serve in this body. Currently, they cannot personally \nlobby their former colleagues. This amendment states in addition they \nmay not engage in lobbying activities, which is a defined term in the \nLobbying Disclosure Act. They must refrain from running the show behind \nthe scenes. They won't be able to strategize with and coordinate the \nlobbying activities of others who are trying to influence the Congress. \nMembers who have just left Congress should not be capitalizing on the \nclout, access, and experience they gained here to lobby their \ncolleagues, whether they are doing the lobbying themselves or \ninstructing others.\n  My next amendment, amendment 32, is the same as the revolving-door \namendment that I just described but also extends the ``cooling-off \nperiod'' for senior staff from one to two years. Under the bill, the \n``cooling off period'' for Members of Congress is increased from 1 to 2 \nyears. I believe that just as one year is not an adequate ``cooling off \nperiod'' for Senators, and the bill reflects that, it is not adequate \nfor senior staff. Staff, of course, can lobby the other body after they \nleave, and my amendment would not subject them to the same lobbying \nactivities prohibition that it seeks to apply to former Members. It \nsimply will make them wait 2 years to lobby this body after they leave \nthe Senate.\n  My next amendment, No. 33, ends Senate gym and parking privileges for \nformer Members of Congress who are lobbyists. The underlying bill \nterminates floor privileges for Members turned lobbyists, and we should \nfinish the job by making sure that other special privileges aren't \navailable to these lobbyists just because they used to serve here.\n  My next amendment, No. 34, will finally bring Senate campaigns into \nthe 21st century by requiring Senate candidates to file their FEC \ndisclosure reports electronically. This amendment mirrors a bill that \nI, along with Senators Cochran, McCain, and 20 of our colleagues from \nboth sides of the aisle, introduced on Tuesday.\n  These amendments, along with amendments that have been offered by my \npartners on S. 230, Senators Lieberman and Obama, and another to be \noffered by the junior Senator from Pennsylvania, will get us closer to \ncompleting the job of improving this bill and making it a product that \nwe can be proud of. More importantly, we can make this a product that \nthe American people will accept as real change. We are headed in the \nright direction on this bill, with the substitute\n\n[[Page S489]]\n\nand the Reid amendment on gifts, travel, and corporate jets. But we \nneed to keep pressing for the best reform possible. These amendments \nare offered for that purpose, and I urge the Senate to adopt them.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

No. 2, they have an opportunity \nto cure the problem, so that would only be achieved in very serious, \nvery egregious cases. No. 3, we raise the penalties on public \nofficials. I think it is very appropriate that we set these new \npenalties, particularly considering the money made in lobbying. I \ncommend it to your attention. Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I think I have just revised my amendment \nto the substitute in a number of significant ways. This bill started \nbipartisanly by introduction. The minority leader and I jointly offered \na substitute amendment as well. I want to keep this process bipartisan, \nso I am adopting a number of changes that reflect input and ideas from \nthe Republicans and Democrats, and that is what is in this \nmodification.\n  First, I have adopted an idea from the Senator from Oklahoma, Mr. \nInhofe, to make sure it is clear that the new rules on private jets do \nnot apply to Members who fly their own planes. Senator Inhofe has flown \na one-engine plane all around the world, literally, and he flies back \nand forth to Oklahoma on a frequent basis. I think this is an important \namendment and a fair amendment.\n  Second, I have adopted an idea from the Senator from Arizona, the \nsenior Senator from Arizona, Mr. McCain, to add a reporting requirement \nwhen Senators fly on private jets. Now, when people pay the charter \nrate, they will have to file that. I think that was the law before, but \nit really doesn't matter. It is something that I think will make things \nmore clear.\n  Third, I have adopted an idea from a bipartisan amendment suggested \nby Senator Feingold that instructs the Legislative Branch \nAppropriations Subcommittee to review the impact on the new rule on \nprivate jets on Members' travel spending. I think that is extremely \nimportant because the subcommittee is going to have to take a look at \nhow this impacts States differently. If you are from the State of Rhode \nIsland or Delaware, you don't have much of a problem flying around \nbecause you can drive around. But if you are from the State of Alaska, \nthe State of Montana, the State of Nevada, Colorado, some of these very \nlarge area Western States, it is a problem. So I commend Senator \nFeingold for being thoughtful in this regard.\n  Madam President, on another issue, I also want to say that I have \nspoken to Senator DeMint on his earmarking proposal. We had a number of \ngood conversations. I have spoken to the Republican leader. We \nprepared--and I have given a copy of the amendment to Senator DeMint--a \nsecond-degree amendment which would strengthen the DeMint amendment \nthat we talked about on the Senate floor yesterday. What our second \ndegree would do would strengthen the definition of targeted tax \nbenefits. Certainly, we want to make it one that is understandable, not \nrigid and narrow, and I have talked to the Senator from South Carolina \nabout this.\n  Also, on the same piece of paper I gave the Senator from South \nCarolina, I have explained to my friend, Senator DeMint, that we want \nto make sure the Duke Cunningham exception is in place. What \nCongressman Cunningham did is, he had earmarks in that bill, but he \nnever mentioned the entity that got the money. What we would do is, in \nthis amendment, you can't write your way around it. We think our \nsuggestion to Senator DeMint to strengthen his amendment is certainly \nsomething we need to do. You can't write your way around giving money \nto corporation X. If it limits that, it has to be listed.\n  Also, importantly, we have added a strengthening provision in the \nproposed second-degree amendment to list earmarks on the Internet 48 \nhours before. Now, I have told Senator DeMint if he wants to make this \npart of his amendment, fine. If he wants us to offer the second degree, \nwe will do that. I told him if he has any suggestions that he feels \nwould improve what we are trying to do, we are agreeable to take a look \nat that. He has suggested that he wants a vote on that. We also want a \nrecorded vote. I think that is important. So I hope we can work \nsomething out.\n  What I would like to do is have a number of votes set for Tuesday \nevening. After these agreed-upon votes on amendments, then we would \nmove to invoke cloture on the airplane amendment and then, after that, \non the substitute. I hope we can work on a bipartisan basis in the next \nhour or so to set up some votes that would occur before cloture on \nthose matters about which I have spoken.\n  Yesterday was a rather difficult day, as some days are. There was a \nlot of confusion as to what people were trying to accomplish. I think \nthat perhaps we should have given a little more time for explanations. \nWe tend to get in a hurry sometimes when we shouldn't be. We tend to \nspend a lot of time doing things that accomplish nothing, and a lot of \ntimes limit time on things that do matter. So, personally, for the \nmajority, we probably could have done a little better job of giving \nopportunities for people to speak. No one came forward wanting to \nspeak, so that is a pretty good sign that people are ready to vote. But \nI think realistically maybe they were not.\n  But regardless of that, we are where we are, and we are going to try \nto move forward in a reasonable manner in the next 2 hours and complete \nthis bill some time next week, we hope.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask unanimous consent to proceed as in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The remarks of Mr. McConnell are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I ask for the regular order with regard \nto a Vitter amendment, amendment No. 9. I send a modification to the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is not possible to call for the regular \norder for that amendment at this time because under the regular order \nthe majority leader has called for the regular order for another \namendment.\n  Mr. VITTER. I ask unanimous consent to go to regular order for \namendment No. 9 for the exclusive purpose of sending a modification to \nthe desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, reserving the right to object, I will \nnot object, but I ask unanimous consent that after the Senator finishes \nhis amendment, I be given unanimous consent to return to amendment No. \n11.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. VITTER. Reserving the right to object, and I will not, I will \nsimply slightly expand my unanimous consent request to ask for up to 5 \nminutes to speak, and I offer that unanimous consent request. I \ncertainly have no objection to the other business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n         Amendment No. 9 to Amendment No 3, as Further Modified\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I send the modification to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is so modified.\n\n[[Page S492]]\n\n  The amendment (No. 9), as further modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 19, line 19, strike ``(b) In this'' and insert the \n     following:\n       ``(b) Members and employees on the staff of a Member \n     (including staff in personal, committee, and leadership \n     offices) shall be prohibited from having any official contact \n     with any spouse of a Member who is a registered lobbyist \n     under the Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995, or is employed or \n     retained by such a registered lobbyist.\n       ``(c) The prohibition in subparagraph (a) shall not apply \n     to the spouse of a Member who was serving as a registered \n     lobbyist at least 1 year prior to the election of that Member \n     to office or at least 1 year prior to their marriage to that \n     member.\n       ``(d) In this''.\n\n  Mr. VITTER. I want to spend a few minutes regarding this general \ndebate to say I hope that we have, in the rest of this debate, an \nadequate opportunity to debate and address and vote on some of the key \nissues that are and should be at the center of this discussion. I think \nthere is now a rush to cloture, quite frankly--specifically to cut off \nthe opportunity to vote on some amendments. I hope we do not do that.\n  I commend the majority leader for the suggestion that we are going to \nhave votes on many significant amendments on Tuesday. I ask him that \nthat list be very inclusive, to include all significant amendments in \nwhich either side of the aisle is interested. I specifically highlight \nthree.\n  One is the DeMint amendment, and I appreciate the words of the \nmajority leader regarding working with Senator DeMint on that \namendment. I fully support that amendment. Much more importantly, that \namendment has proved to have majority support on the floor of this \nbody. There was a motion to table, and it lost. So that amendment has \nmajority support, and clearly we need to vote and pass that amendment. \nIt has already been proven that it has majority support.\n  The second amendment I would highlight is a Judd Gregg amendment with \nregard to spending and earmarks and waste. Again, that is very much at \nthe heart of this discussion. Earmarks--earmark abuse, what that does \nto spending, how it inflates it--have been part of the abuses, \nunfortunately, that have come to light in the last several years. So \nthat is absolutely at the heart of this debate. A lot of Members of the \nSenate are interested in that amendment, so we need a debate and a vote \non that amendment.\n  Third, I would highlight my own amendment which I just modified, and \nthat has to do with spouses of Members of the Senate lobbying. Again, \nthis debate, this bill, is about two things: ethics and lobbying. I \ndon't know how you come up with any argument that the issue of spouses \nlobbying, gaining unusual access, having the opportunity of being a \nconduit for large amounts of money to be deposited in the family bank \naccount of Members from special interests, isn't at the heart of that \ndebate. That is at the heart of the lobbying issue. That is at the \nheart of the ethics issue. It is foursquare in the center of this \ndebate, and certainly we need an adequate debate and a vote on that \nidea.\n  I urge all Senators to support a full and open debate and a full and \nopen airing and voting on important amendments, including but not \nlimited to those three. I very much look forward to that next week. I \ncertainly hope cloture is not invoked in an attempt, as many of us \nfear, frankly, to cut off certain significant and relevant amendments.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. VITTER. Certainly.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am not finding fault with the Senator from Louisiana, \nbut the fact is, we do not have a copy of the modification. The reason \nI raise that is later I am going to suggest a change in the Senate \nrules so that when you file an amendment or modification, copies will \nbe given to both the ranking member and the Chair on the floor, as is \nthe custom and rule of the House. That is a good way to make sure there \nis knowledge of what is being considered and debated as promptly as \npossible.\n  Going to the substance of the matter, does the Senator's modification \nchange the original language in his amendment which makes this \nprovision on spousal lobbying retroactive, not prospective? In other \nwords, if there is some Member on either side of the aisle today who \nhas a spouse lobbying at the Federal level, it is my understanding that \nthe Senator would prohibit that in his original amendment unless that \nspouse was lobbying a year before the marriage or a year before the \nfirst election of Congress. Does the modification change that in any \nrespect?\n  Mr. VITTER. No, it doesn't. I will tell you exactly what it does. \nFirst of all, I appreciate the question. Certainly I am eager to give \nthe Senator and all Members a copy of it, which I will do immediately, \nand that will be well before any full debate and vote. But let me use \nthe opportunity to explain what the modification does.\n  The modification is very simple. It moves the provision to the Senate \nrules, and it makes it apply to lobbying Members of the Senate only. I \ndid the modification for one reason and one reason only--not because I \nthink that limitation excluding activity on the House side is better \nbut because it makes it germane to the bill and therefore guarantees me \na vote.\n  So, to go to the question, the provision--it is only about lobbying \nthe Senate. But in that context, there is an exclusion if the spouse \nlobbyist was an active lobbyist a year or more before the marriage or \nthe first election. But there is no grandfathering clause other than \nthat. I hope that answers the question of the Senator.\n  Mr. DURBIN. It does. I would like to ask the Senator from Louisiana, \nin the spirit of your amendment, would you consider an amendment which \nwould make the 2-year prohibition on lobbying also retroactive, so that \nSenators who have not lobbied previously would be prohibited from \nlobbying for 2 years and it would be retroactive as well?\n  Mr. VITTER. I will be happy to consider that idea. I am not going to \nchange my amendment to include that because I think it would lose votes \nfrom our amendment and I want first of all to pass my amendment, but I \nam completely open to that discussion and that idea. Without making a \nfinal decision, I am completely open to supporting that on the floor of \nthe Senate if somebody were to bring it forward.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment has been so modified.\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n\n\n                  Amendment No. 44 to Amendment No. 11\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, pursuant to the unanimous consent \nrequest, it is my understanding that we now return to the DeMint \namendment No. 11.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I rise to offer a second-degree \namendment to the DeMint amendment No. 11 which I send to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Illinois [Mr. Durbin] proposes amendment \n     numbered 44 to DeMint amendment No. 11.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey).

Madam President, yesterday there was a debate about the \ndisclosure of earmarks. It was an interesting debate, and Senator \nDeMint and Senator Coburn of Oklahoma offered an amendment.\n  I felt that amendment had several flaws in it. The purpose of my \nsecond-degree amendment is to address those flaws. It does not go to \nthe heart of their argument about expanding the number of earmarks that \nwould be subject to disclosure. In fact, if anything, it expands the \nnumber of earmarks subject to disclosure.\n  My amendment would strengthen the DeMint amendment in three ways: It \nretains the Reid-McConnell bipartisan language in the underlying bill. \nThe DeMint amendment No. 11 now pending does not go far enough in terms \nof covering so-called targeted tax benefits. A lot of attention has \nbeen given to Duke Cunningham, the former Congressman from California, \nwho was steering Department of Defense funds to certain contractors and \nbenefiting from it personally. He paid dearly for this transgression \nand is currently in prison. That is an example of an egregious abuse of \nthe appropriations process.\n  We understand, as well, there are decisions made by Congress outside \nof the appropriations process which can be just as beneficial, if not \nmore profitable, to individuals and businesses. One of the categories \nwould be in the area of targeted tax credits. However, it could be \nothers, as well.\n  Even though my amendment does not go to this issue, consider the fact \nthat the asbestos legislation pending before Congress 2 years ago would \nhave benefited one of the corporations from Illinois to the tune of $1 \nbillion had it passed. That figure was arrived at not by myself or \nanyone in Congress but, rather, by those who filed the annual report \nfor that corporation. So you can understand that decisions made in the \nSenate and the House of Representatives can have a direct positive \nfinancial impact on businesses and individuals.\n  As we go after earmarks and try to change those because of the Duke \nCunningham scandal and others, we should also be mindful of the fact \nthat other decisions made by Congress can be just as beneficial, if not \nmore so. They cry for transparency, too. Unfortunately, the underlying \nDeMint amendment has a restrictive view of targeted tax credits.\n  The Senator from South Carolina has said he has agreed to language \nconsidered by the House. In all honesty, as good as they are in the \nHouse of Representatives, what I am offering may be an improvement. \nSenator DeMint's amendment covers revenue-losing provisions only that \nprovide tax benefits to 10 or fewer beneficiaries or contain \neligibility criteria that are not the same for other potential \nbeneficiaries. This unnecessarily limits the definition of revenue-\nlosing provisions instead of all revenue provisions. My amendment \ncorrects this.\n  The DeMint amendment also allows for a loophole. Someone could easily \nwrite a provision that affects 11, 15, or 50 beneficiaries and be \nexempt from the disclosure requirements of the DeMint amendment. The \nReid-McConnell definition, which I include in my second-degree \namendment, says a tax earmark is anything which has the practical \neffect of providing more favorable tax treatment to a ``limited group'' \nof taxpayers when compared with similarly situated taxpayers. We do not \ncome up with a number--10 beneficiaries, 20 beneficiaries--but, rather, \nkeep it in the category of a tax benefit that is clearly designed to \nhelp a limited group of taxpayers of a certain number compared with \nothers. This is a more flexible and more realistic standard to be \napplied than the language currently in the DeMint bill.\n  Moreover, the Reid-McConnell language is for the language that they, \nin fact, created. It is language that Senator Judd Gregg, former \nchairman of the Senate Committee on the Budget, included in his line-\nitem veto bill. Senator Gregg has found what I think is a sensible \ndefinition we ought to use and adopt as part of our reform and ethics \nchanges we are currently debating. My amendment retains the concept of \nReid-McConnell language, amends the DeMint provision to remove the \nlimitation of ``10 or fewer beneficiaries'' and would cover ``any \nrevenue provision that provides a Federal tax deduction, credit, \nexclusion, or preference, to a particular beneficiary or a limited \ngroup of beneficiaries.''\n  Finally, under the DeMint amendment, information about earmarks must \nbe posted 48 hours after it is received by the committee. In the case \nof a fast-moving bill, it is possible that the information would be \nmade public only after a vote on the relevant bill containing the \nearmarks. So there is a weakness in the DeMint language when it comes \nto this public disclosure. On the other hand, in the interest of full \ndisclosure, the Reid-McConnell language requires the earmark disclosure \ninformation be placed on the Internet, available to the public 48 hours \nbefore\n\n[[Page S494]]\n\nconsideration of the bills or reports that contain the earmarks. \nSenator DeMint's amendment does not have a similar provision. My \namendment retains the stronger Reid-McConnell earmark disclosure \nlanguage.\n  These are three important changes necessary to improve the DeMint \namendment. As I noted yesterday, there are some positive elements of \nthe DeMint amendment. In some instances it does not go far enough. I \nquestion the whole notion that committee report language should be \ntreated the same as bill language. Those who have gone through the \nbasics of legislation understand that bill language can be a law. \nCommittee report language is never going to be a law. It is only a \nrecommendation. Having said that, though, I don't address that issue in \nany way at all.\n  I urge my colleagues to support my secondary amendment to the \nunderlying DeMint amendment. I believe it strengthens the DeMint \namendment. I urge the DeMint amendment, with these changes, be agreed \nto, as well.\n\n\n                  Amendment No. 36 to amendment No. 3\n\n  At this point I ask unanimous consent to set aside this pending \namendment and call up amendment No. 36 which is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Illinois [Mr. Durbin] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 36.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To require that amendments and motions to recommit with \n instructions be copied and provided by the clerk to the desks of the \n     Majority Leader and the Minority Leader before being debated)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. AMENDMENTS AND MOTIONS TO RECOMMIT.\n\n       Paragraph 1 of rule XV of the Standing Rules of the Senate \n     is amended to read as follows:\n       ``1. (a) An amendment and any instruction accompanying a \n     motion to recommit shall be reduced to writing and copied and \n     provided by the clerk to the desks of the Majority Leader and \n     the Minority Leader and shall be read before being debated.\n       ``(b) A motion shall be reduced to writing, if desired by \n     the Presiding Officer or by any Senator, and shall be read \n     before being debated.''.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I welcome you to the Senate. I am glad \nyou are presiding. I will describe one of the procedures in the Senate \nI discovered when I came over from the House that I did not understand. \nIt is the fact that an amendment filed at the desk by a Member is then \ntaken to the corridor, to a copy machine, copies are made and then \nbrought back to the floor. Sometimes these amendments are large. \nSometimes it takes a while to get copied. In the meantime, the debate \nis underway. So for those who want to engage in a real deliberation and \ndebate, there is a mystery quality here for minutes, sometimes longer. \nYou wait until you get a copy of the amendment.\n  There has to be a better way. The better way is obvious. Members who \nbring modifications to the floor should bring three copies, at least--\none copy for the clerk, one copy for the Republican side, and one copy \nfor the Democratic side--so that as they are filed, each side has the \nlanguage in front of them. As the Senator who is moving the amendment \nis making the argument, those who want to follow the amendment have at \nleast one copy on each side of the aisle to look at. That is the only \nway to have a meaningful debate.\n  There is a way to change this which is clumsy and awkward. As you \nprobably heard me suggest earlier, I asked unanimous consent to suspend \nthe reading of the amendment. I could have allowed them to read the \namendment and hear it firsthand. But I think it is more valuable to \nhave it in writing and have it in front of you.\n  I have suggested this change in the Senate rules since I arrived 10 \nyears ago. It turns out to be one of the biggest challenges I have \nfaced in the Senate, to have two additional copies of the amendment \ncome to the Senate floor. This is a venerable institution. It prides \nitself on deliberation, but we operate in Senate years, as opposed to \nreal years, or dog years, and sometimes things take a lot longer than \nthey should, so I am offering this amendment.\n  I have already spoken to the ranking member, Senator Bennett, about \nit. I have not spoken to Senator Feinstein, the chairman of the Rules \nCommittee. I hope it is the kind of noncontroversial amendment that \nmakes life easier here, but, more importantly, will lead to a debate \nwhich, in fact, would be more meaningful.\n  I am going to, at some point, ask this be agreed to. I hope my \ncolleagues will consider supporting it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I have been in the Senate a little bit \nlonger than the Senator from Illinois but long enough to discover that \nthe Senate and its rules are superbly constructed to deal with the \nproblems of the 19th century. I think perhaps we should recognize that \nwe have moved beyond the 19th century into the 21st.\n  I cannot speak for any member of my caucus, but I will be happy to \nsupport this particular rule change. I think of all of the things that \nhave been proposed, this is perhaps the most benign.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \npermitted to speak for up to 10 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n\n                                  Iraq\n\n  Mr. President, I want to briefly address the ethics bill before this \nCongress, but before I do that, I want to discuss an issue of paramount \nimportance to my State, in light of the President's recent address, and \nthat is the war in Iraq.\n  Sending more American troops is not the change of course the people \nof Minnesota and the American people called for in this past election, \nand it is not the change of course our military forces deserve.\n  We learned this week that 3,000 of the 22,000 troops added for the \nescalation are from Minnesota's National Guard. These Minnesota \nsoldiers have already served honorably and well. They and their \nfamilies were told they would be coming home in March. And I just \ntalked to General Shellito, who heads up the National Guard in \nMinnesota. He said the hardest thing for them is they have been hanging \non--in his words: ``hanging on''--through March. And now they are \nextended well into the summer.\n  These brave soldiers will be thrust even more deeply into the midst \nof Iraq's civil war. Haven't we asked our soldiers and their families \nto sacrifice enough?\n  The great burden on Minnesota and the rest of the country should \nremind us that what is needed is a surge in diplomacy and not a surge \nin troops.\n  With that, Mr. President, I would like to turn to the issue of ethics \nreform. I thank Senator Reid and the other Senators for their \nleadership and for making ethics reform a real priority for this \nCongress.\n  When I arrived in Washington last week, we pulled up in our family \nSaturn, loaded with my husband's college dishes and a shower curtain I \nfound in the basement from 1980. But we brought a little more than \ndishes and a shower curtain. We, also, brought a commitment for change, \nsomething the people of our State--Democrats, Independents, and \nRepublicans, from Worthington to Moorhead to Duluth to Rochester--\ncalled for very clearly and loudly in November.\n  We also brought a Minnesota moral compass, grounded in a simple \nnotion of Minnesota fairness--a notion that all people should be on \nequal footing in the Halls of Congress. But they cannot be on equal \nfooting when their elected representatives are selling their votes for \ntrips to Scotland or stashing away cash in the freezer. They cannot be \non\n\n[[Page S495]]\n\nequal footing unless this new Congress delivers real, meaningful ethics \nreform.\n  Ethics reform is an issue of great importance to the people of my \nState. Wherever I went, Minnesotans told me this was the kind of change \nthat they wanted to see in Washington.\n  It is not an abstract political science issue. It affects real people \nin the real world. And today it comes out of the political science \nclassrooms and into the Halls of Congress.\n  Ethics is woven into the very fabric of how our Government does \nbusiness. Ethics reform goes to the very heart of our democracy, to the \npublic trust and respect that is essential to the health of our \nconstitutional system.\n  Recent scandals have cast a shadow over the legitimacy of the laws \nand policies that come out of Washington. The American public's \nreceding faith in the integrity of our legislative process means that \nethics reform is now central to every public issue that we will \nconsider whether it is energy policy, health care reform, fiscal \nreform, or even homeland security.\n  The ability of Congress to deal credibly and forthrightly with these \nother issues depends on reforming our own ethical rules.\n  The long-term challenges that we face in this country are enormous. \nThey include high energy prices and a growing dependency on foreign \noil, health care costs that have spiraled out of control, global \nwarming that threatens the future of our environment and our economy, a \nmounting national debt, and a growing middle-class squeeze.\n  I believe that there are solutions to these challenges. While not \nalways immediate, these solutions are within our grasp. We can achieve \nenergy independence by investing smartly and having some guts to take \non the oil companies. We can get this country back on the right fiscal \ntrack and move forward to more affordable health care. We can deliver \nmuch needed and long overdue relief to the middle class. These are the \nthings the people of Minnesota sent me to Washington to fight for. They \nsent me here because they have not yet seen the bold change of \ndirection that we need to make these solutions happen. Instead, they \nhave seen a Washington that too often serves big special interests at \nthe expense of the middle class.\n  As a prosecutor, I learned firsthand how the well-connected and \npowerful do not face the same challenges as middle-class families. \nEvery day, I would go into our courthouse in Minnesota with a mission \nto treat people the same no matter where they came from. When we \nprosecuted a wealthy, well-connected person for a white-collar crime, \nthe courtroom was packed with his friends. I would get all kinds of \ncalls. One of my favorites was, ``I know he stole $400,000 from a \nmentally disabled woman, but he is such a good guy; he shouldn't go to \nprison.''\n  But when we prosecuted someone who was poor or middle class, they \nwere lucky if their mom could take the day off from work to stand \nbehind them in the courtroom. My job was to even the playing field and \nto treat people the same no matter where they came from and who they \nknew.\n  That is still my job, and it is the job of this Congress. With that \nin mind, we need to change business as usual. Business as usual has \ncreated a playing field tilted toward special interests and against the \nmiddle class.\n  When our energy policy is drafted in secret meetings with the oil \ncompanies, we all end up paying more at the pump because they have \nfailed to invest in renewable energy. When our health care legislation \nis written by the drug companies, we pay more because they have banned \nnegotiation on prices. The people of this country know corruption when \nthey see it. They saw this last November who was benefiting and who was \ngetting hurt.\n  Business as usual doesn't only generate bad policy and wasteful \nspending, it also erodes public trust in the integrity of our \nGovernment institutions, our elected leaders, and the law-making \nprocess itself.\n  We the American people know what we want from Washington. It is this: \na Government that is focused on doing what is best for our Nation and \non securing a better and more prosperous future for the people.\n  There are so many people of good faith on both sides of the aisle who \nwant to see this happen. Like me, they want to solve the great \nchallenges of our day and to restore public faith in our Government. \nThey know, as I do, that General Omar Bradley was right back in 1948 \nwhen he said that ``we need to start steering our ships by the stars, \ninstead of the lights of each passing ship.''\n  The new leadership that took the helm last week has already begun \nthat change in course. They have introduced the ethics reform package \nat issue today as the very first bill to be considered by the new \nSenate.\n\n  It has been an honor to work with Senator Reid and with colleagues \nsuch as Senators Feingold and Obama, and with a great class of freshmen \nthat includes the Presiding Officer, as well as Senator Tester who is \nhere with me today, who share a passion for ethics reform. I am also \npleased by the bipartisan support for this bill.\n  The proposals being offered will strengthen the original S. 1 in a \nnumber of important areas, including stricter travel rules, enhanced \nlobbying disclosure requirements, tougher restrictions on the revolving \ndoor between Capitol Hill and lobbying firms, and additional earmarking \nreform.\n  It is also my understanding that the Senate will thoughtfully address \nmethods to improve ethics enforcement in debates and hearings over the \nnext few months. Speaking as a former prosecutor, I have expressed to a \nnumber of Senators the great value of strong, sensible enforcement.\n  I am particularly gratified to see Senator Reid's amendment No. 4 \ncontain improvements to the Senate gift and meal rules. Under current \nlaw, anyone, including a lobbyist, is permitted to buy a gift or a meal \nfor a Senator or a staff member up to a certain dollar amount. We need \nto make sensible changes to current law.\n  A decade ago, the Minnesota Legislature passed a strong, clear rule \nin this area. Lobbyists and those who employ them cannot give gifts or \nmeals to State or local officials, subject to very limited exceptions \nthat were meant to be just that--limited exceptions. For more than 10 \nyears, our State officials have abided by these rules, which are rooted \nin Minnesota values. I followed them as county prosecutor, and the \nresults have been greater fairness in our democratic process and \ngreater faith in our Government.\n  A rule banning gifts and meals from both lobbyists and those who hire \nlobbyists worked in Minnesota, and it can work in Washington, DC.\n  I want to make clear that my support for this rule is no reflection \non my colleagues who have humbled me with their good faith, honor, and \nintegrity since I arrived in Washington. Instead, I support it because \nthe urgency of our need to restore public faith in Government has \nconvinced me that clear, bright line rules are best. Such rules don't \nimpose unreasonable constraints and do not adversely affect citizens' \nrights to petition their Government. But it does send a strong, clear \nmessage and an important signal to the American people that we are \nfocused solely on representing their interests.\n  Last week at my swearing in a number of people and Senators from both \nsides of the aisle came up to me remembering the great Senators who \nhave come to Washington from the State of Minnesota. It is humbling to \nfollow in the footsteps of people such as Hubert Humphrey and Walter \nMondale and Paul Wellstone. I was reminded many times this past week of \nthe great things they did and said.\n  On Humphrey's gravestone, there is an inscription, a quote from \nHumphrey himself. It says:\n\n       I have enjoyed my life, its disappointments outweighed by \n     its pleasures. I have loved my country in a way that some \n     people consider sentimental and out of style. I still do. And \n     I remain an optimist with joy, without apology about this \n     country and about the American experiment in democracy.\n\n  Like Humphrey, Mr. President, I, too, remain an optimist about this \ngrand experiment in democracy. I remain an optimist because the people \nin my State and across the country have spoken up for change. I remain \nan optimist because the people in this Chamber are devoted to getting \nthings done, and getting them done the right way. I remain an optimist \nbecause this American experiment in democracy has worked best when we, \nthe American people, without apology, have demanded accountability.\n\n[[Page S496]]\n\n  This past November was one of those times. The American people spoke \nout for change. We need to answer them.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n\n\n              Amendments Nos. 45 and 46 to Amendment No. 2\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I send two amendments to the desk and ask \nunanimous consent that the pending amendment be set aside.\n  Mr. President, if I may clarify this, one of the amendments is a \nsecond degree to the Leahy amendment currently pending.

Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a moment \nbefore he speaks?\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Yes.\n\n\n                       Amendment No. 40 Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I have tried to work out a problem \ndealing with our State regarding aircraft. It is my understanding that \nthe agreed to\n\n[[Page S497]]\n\namendment has been modified. Apparently, the decision of the majority \nis that we should use more taxpayer money to meet our needs. I am not \ngoing to persist in my attempt to work out our problems in this manner.\n  It is my understanding that somebody talked about my jet amendment. \nIt had nothing to do with jets until I modified it to accommodate some \nof the problems of majority members. I withdraw amendment No. 40.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is withdrawn.\n\n\n                     Honoring Champions of Equality\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, on January 15 we honor the legacy of a man \nwho gave his life in the struggle for equality. Dr. Martin Luther King \nread the words to our Nation's Declaration of Independence and worked \nto ensure that they were lived that way:\n\n       All men are created equal, that they are endowed by their \n     Creator with certain unalienable rights . . .\n\n  Throughout history we have been fortunate to have leaders of \nunbelievable character and vision, such as Dr. King, who rose in power \nand worked to change the course of history. Today I want to talk about \nthe legacy of Dr. King and another champion of human rights, William \nWilberforce.\n  In 1790, the transatlantic slave trade was thriving. The economic \ndevelopment of Europe was fueled by the trading in enslaved Africans, \nan incredibly profitable business at that time. Conditions for slaves \nwere horrific--from being kidnaped by foreigners speaking an unknown \nlanguage, being chained up and forced into unfathomable conditions for \nthe torturous trip from Africa, to finally being sold into a lifetime \nof slavery--if they survived--in a strange land.\n  Witnesses to and survivors of these atrocities shared their stories \nwith the small, but dedicated, bands of abolitionists who worked \ntirelessly to rid the world of this shameful slave trade.\n  In the late 1700s, they found their voice in William Wilberforce, a \nmember of the British Parliament. In 1789, Wilberforce laid out the \ncase against slavery with eye witness and survivor accounts of the \nbrutality inflicted on slaves. He told his fellow legislators:\n\n       Having heard all of this, you may choose to look away, but \n     you can never say again that you did not know.\n\n  For two decades, William Wilberforce fought with every fiber of his \nbeing to abolish the slave trade. It was not easy going up against \nthose who made a fortune off of this trade. Many felt the economy and \nEngland would crumble without the slaves. Vilified and ridiculed, \nWilberforce refused to give up the fight against the fierce proslavery \nforces. Wilberforce introduced motions to abolish slavery in every \nsingle session of Parliament. In 1807, his legislation to abolish the \nslave trade finally passed. Wilberforce continued his fight until his \nhealth could no longer take it. In 1833, a bill passed giving all \nslaves in the British Empire their freedom. William Wilberforce passed \naway 3 days later.\n\n  More than a century later, across the Atlantic, a young Black pastor \nfrom Atlanta, Georgia, was sharing his dream for a united, multiracial \nAmerica. It was Dr. King's eloquence, intense spirit, and vision that \nlifted him to lead our civil rights movement at a pivotal time. He said \nthat ``Life's most persistent and nagging question is, what are you \ndoing for others?'' and he challenged citizens to make the answer \ncount.\n  While his life was cut tragically short, Dr. King's work to bring \nequality for all has become part of the fabric of our maturing Nation.\n  William Wilberforce and Dr. Martin Luther King are two men who rose \nto extraordinary levels of public service by embracing their faiths and \nworking to correct a great abuse of human rights. They each served \nmankind in a way that very few others have. Yet, the lesson we learn \nfrom their life stories is that we all have that spark of greatness. It \nis our choice whether we stand on the sidelines while others light the \nway or step forward and ignite our own passion to make a difference in \nthis world.\n  The path to righting an injustice is full of obstacles and risks. Dr. \nKing lost his life and left behind a widow and four young children on \nhis mission to leave them a better world. William Wilberforce faced \ndefeat after defeat with his unpopular legislation to abolish slavery. \nIn fact, his abolition bill was defeated 30 times over the course of 20 \nyears, but he continued the fight, and his eventual victory has been \ncalled one of the turning events in world history.\n  I chose to talk about Dr. King and William Wilberforce today because \nthey are truly remarkable people whose stories I believe inspire others \nto action.\n  Neither Dr. King nor William Wilberforce embarked on their careers \nknowing that they would become giants of history. They sought to make a \ndifference in whatever capacity they could. It is a lesson from which \nwe should all learn.\n  After all, while Dr. King and William Wilberforce made tremendous \nprogress in eliminating slavery and empowering equality, there is still \nmuch work to be done. Racial division and the violence that Dr. King \npreached against have not disappeared from our country, and slavery \nworldwide is a bigger problem today than it was in 1790. There are \nactually more slaves today than there were seized from Africa in four \ncenturies of the transatlantic slave trade.\n  It is appalling, but it gives us the opportunity to ask that question \nDr. King and William Wilberforce would have easily been able to answer: \nWhat are you doing for others?\n  I was able to recently watch the screening of a movie about William \nWilberforce called ``Amazing Grace.'' I had actually started learning \nabout and admiring William Wilberforce several years ago, so I was \nthrilled that his life and impact would be documented and shared this \nway. The movie shows that while William Wilberforce was the voice and \nface behind the effort to abolish the slave trade, there were many \npeople who inspired him to take action in the first place.\n  There was John Newton who was William Wilberforce's childhood pastor. \nNewton was at one time a slave trader. It was from a sea voyage during \nwhich he nearly died that he went on to write the hymn ``Amazing \nGrace.'' Newton convinced William Wilberforce to stay in politics in \norder to make a difference, and he provided his confession as a slave \ntrader for Wilberforce to use in his appeals for abolition.\n  There was also his friend William Pitt who went on to become the \nyoungest Prime Minister of England. Pitt pushed Wilberforce to continue \nas a public servant and encouraged him to lead the abolition movement.\n  There were many other characters who played a role in William \nWilberforce's involvement and eventual success in abolishing slavery. \nWhile they may not be the names we often read about in history books, \ntheir impact was tremendous.\n  Former Chaplain of the Senate Lloyd John Ogilvie once said:\n\n       You may only be able to make a small difference, but that \n     does not relieve you of the responsibility to make that \n     difference.\n\n  When he says ``You may only make a small difference,'' I think he was \nencouraging people to try to make any difference, whatever difference \nthey were called to make. They may think that it would only be a small \ndifference, but in reality, it is history that will make that \ndetermination.\n  I talked earlier about how shameful it is that there are more slaves \naround the world today in 2007 than there were during the 400-year \nperiod of the transatlantic slavery movement. I applaud a campaign \ncalled The Amazing Change. They highlight the work of groups continuing \nWilliam Wilberforce's work to abolish slavery and make a better world.\n  The campaign is motivating young people across the country to get \ninvolved and to make a difference, and there are many causes such as \nthis that need advocates and supporters. Whether it is volunteering in \nyour own community to help abused children or working to help cure \ncancer, spreading the word about the atrocities in Darfur, find your \npassion and use it to leave this world a better place.\n  Ultimately, this is the message of Dr. King and William Wilberforce: \nDo something for others.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S498]]\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Tribute to Lamar Hunt\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, first, I rise today to pay tribute to a much \nloved sportsman, businessman, civic leader, and family man, Lamar Hunt, \nbest known as founder and owner of the Kansas City Chiefs, who, \nregrettably, passed away on December 13 of complications related to \nprostate cancer. Some might be surprised to learn that Kansas City was \nLamar Hunt's adopted town, not his hometown. Born in Arkansas and \nraised in Texas, Lamar began his journey to Kansas City in 1959, when \nthe National Football League unwisely turned down his request for a new \nfranchise in Dallas. If you can't join 'em, beat 'em, to turn a cliche \non its head.\n  Shut out of the NFL, Lamar Hunt decided to create another football \nleague. He found seven other men as passionate about football as he \nwas, and together they created the American Football League, the AFL. \nAt the time, theirs was considered a risky venture. They called \nthemselves ``the foolish club'' and located their teams in Midwestern \nand Southern cities, places without a history of professional football.\n  It has been said that leaders are visionaries with a poorly developed \nsense of fear and no concept of the odds against them. Lamar was such a \nleader and he fit that description.\n  He was certainly visionary. His leadership in creating and expanding \nthe American Football League helped professional football gain a \nnationwide following before merging to become today's NFL.\n  I think he did understand the odds against him. He did not let them \nget in the way. He stuck with his plan for a new football league and \nsucceeded. He first located his franchise in Dallas. In 1963, he moved \nthe Dallas Texans to Kansas City, where they became the Chiefs.\n  Lamar Hunt coined the term ``Super Bowl'' and was on hand to see the \nChiefs win Super Bowl IV. Unfortunately, our Chiefs have not won a \nSuper Bowl since, but Lamar never gave up on his team and neither will \nwe, the fans.\n  Lamar Hunt was a true entrepreneur, willing to take calculated risk \non investments that would benefit the larger community. Since the \n1960s, the Hunt family has been instrumental in the growth and \ndevelopment of Kansas City from a frontier town to a world-class city.\n  The Hunts have contributed to the Kansas City economy through Hunt \nMidwest Enterprises, which, among other ventures, developed Worlds of \nFun and Oceans of Fun, two recreational theme parks that draw hundreds \nof thousands of visitors each year.\n  While he is best known for his love for professional football, Lamar \nHunt was deeply involved in other sports. He was a part owner of the \nChicago Bulls, he founded World Championship Tennis in 1969, and he \nspearheaded the development of soccer as a professional sport in the \nUnited States. He owned two Major League Soccer teams.\n  While successful, Hunt remained modest. He never thought of himself \nas a the Chief's owner. He preferred the term ``founder.''\n  As he told Joe Posnanski of the Kansas City Star:\n\n       To me, every Chief's fan has ownership in the team. They \n     are just as invested emotionally as I am. I was able to bring \n     the team to Kansas City, but it is Kansas City's team.\n\n  In fact, since Mr. Hunt's death, the Star has run several stories, \nincluding examples of his love for players, coaches, and fans as \nindividuals. Hall of Fame linebacker Bobby Bell remembered him, saying:\n\n       He's a guy who never valet parked his car unless they \n     absolutely made him.\n\n  Chief's tight end Fred Arbanas recalled that Hunt, himself, served \nthe team food and drinks and picked up trash on the plane to road \ngames. He is said to have given the widow of an employee killed in a \nconstruction accident a book of blank checks bearing his signature.\n  Despite struggling with cancer for 8 years, Lamar kept a strenuous \nschedule right until the very end. The last time I saw him was in \nNovember, during the Governor's Cup game, where the Chiefs played \nagainst the St. Louis Rams in St. Louis. The Chief's pulled out a 31-\nto-7 win. At that game, his illness had necessitated a car for \ntransportation, but it had not affected his good nature, his \nfriendliness or his optimism for his beloved Chiefs.\n  In an era of rapid change and turnover in the sports world, Lamar \nHunt stood apart. He remained owner of the Chiefs, or founder of the \nChiefs, for more than 40 years, from 1963 until his death. He invested \nin the lives of people in his adopted town, and the benefits of those \ninvestments will be felt for generations to come.\n  More than 1,000 fans have signed the Kansas City Star's online \nguestbook for Lamar Hunt, praising him for his honesty and sincerity, \nhis class and his countless contributions to the Chiefs, to football, \nand to Kansas City.\n  While his family and friends will miss Lamar very much, they can take \nheart in the tremendous legacy he left. I know his son Clark will \ncontinue to lead the Chiefs with the same love for the game and \nbusiness sense his father had. We will always remember fondly Lamar \nHunt.\n\n\n                                  Iraq\n\n  Mr. President, my colleagues and our staffs, people need to know \nabout the worldwide threat hearing we had at an open session of the \nIntelligence Committee yesterday. In that hearing, we asked the \nDirector of National Intelligence, the Director of the CIA, the general \nin charge of the Defense Intelligence Agency, Mr. Fort of the State \nDepartment's INR, and Director Bob Mueller of the FBI what their \nassessment was of the situation in Iraq.\n  Very simply, they said that, while it is not certain by any means, \nthey believe the leadership of Iraq has bought into the concept \nannounced by the President as a result of his telephone call from Prime \nMinister Malaki that Iraq is going to take over the responsibility for \nquelling the insurgency, the sectarian violence, and they will devote \ntheir own resources, heavily, into Baghdad, with district units headed \nby generals, brigades in each area supported by American troops on a 3-\nto-1 ratio, Iraqi to American.\n  While this by no means is sure to work, and recent actions do not \nsuggest it is a very strong bet, they believe it has apparently the \nbest chance to succeed.\n  In addition, since there was another idea on the table, I asked what \nwould happen if we withdrew immediately, or within a very short \ntimetable of 2 to 3 months, and the Director of National Intelligence \nand the Director of the CIA, first, said a precipitous withdrawal would \nbring about a collapse of the Government; that al-Qaida would establish \na beachhead and a sanctuary in Iraq for the purpose of promoting the \nworldwide caliphate that it supports. That was the Director of National \nIntelligence, who, also, was joined by the Director of the CIA, General \nHayden, who said if we withdraw, it would empower the jihadists to gain \na safe haven, which would have a tremendous impact on the region. There \nwould be a tremendous impact because they could be in control of the \noil-rich Iraqi resources, and it would further empower Iran.\n  In summary, he said three things very unfortunate would be likely to \noccur.\n  No. 1, more innocent Iraqi civilians would die in sectarian violence.\n  No. 2, there would be a safe haven for al-Qaida and its cooperating \nentities--a goal that has been stated by the leader of al-Qaida, Osama \nbin Laden, and his second in command, Ayman al-Zawahiri.\n  And third, this would very likely bring about regionwide conflicts \nbecause with the Shia in control in Iraq in the current Government, \nwith the numbers they have, Iran has shown a very great interest and \nhas been too actively involved in Iraqi matters already. Iran and its \nShias, if they came in and heaped great losses on the Sunnis, could \nexpect that Sunni neighbors in the region would respond to the threats \nof the Iraqi Shia, as the Iranians, and the danger of a tremendous \nconflict throughout that region would occur.\n  So I appreciate the opportunity to address the Senate on these \nmatters.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe reading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To help encourage fiscal responsibility in the ear-marking \n                                process)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. ENCOURAGING FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY IN THE EARMARKING \n                   PROCESS.\n\n       (a) In General.--If an entity is properly awarded an \n     earmark as defined in section 103, the entire amount of the \n     earmark shall be transferred to the entity to be expended for \n     the essential governmental purpose of the earmark.\n       (b) Agency Prohibition.--Earmarked funds shall not be spent \n     by the authorizing department or agency (unless specifically \n     authorized in the section of the appropriations bill or \n     report containing the earmark) and shall instead be returned \n     to the Treasury for the purposes of deficit reduction.\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I am concerned about the abuse \nof the earmark process, and I applaud the bipartisan efforts of the \nmajority and minority leaders in crafting the earmark reforms in the \nunderlying bill. I strongly support improving transparency and \naccountability in the appropriations process. I believe Members should \ncertainly be required to disclose and justify their earmarks. My \namendment takes this notion one step beyond by ensuring that earmarked \nfunds are spent only for the stated purpose for which they are approved \nby the Senate.\n  The amendment simply states:\n\n       If an entity is properly awarded an earmark, the entire \n     amount of the earmark shall be transferred to the entity to \n     be expended for the essential government purpose of the \n     earmark.\n\n  If the entity doesn't spend the entire amount of the earmark, my \namendment requires the excess funds to be returned to the Treasury for \nthe purposes of deficit reduction. That is all this does.\n  Some Senators may ask, Why is such an amendment necessary? I think \nmany of my colleagues in the Senate would be quite surprised to learn \nthat all too often, after going through the process of earmarking funds \nfor the benefit of their constituents, the earmarked funds are, on some \noccasions, spent by someone else once the bill leaves the Senate. The \nearmarked funds are going to be spent as the Senate intended. In \nreality, however, a portion of earmarked funds may sometimes be \nreallocated to other purposes by the agency tasked with delivering the \nfunds to the intended recipient. Unfortunately, I have discovered this \npractice of ``skimming,'' as I call it, where the agency simply skims a \nportion off the top of the earmarks. It is fairly common, and in many \ncases it simply is not authorized by law.\n  Last year, with the help of the Congressional Research Service, I \nasked the 15 Cabinet-level departments to help me understand how this \nprocess works, what happens with the funding once Congress approves an \nearmark. Only 12 departments responded, and the responses varied \nwidely. Some said they do not skim from the earmarks at all; however, \nsome said they skim 2 to 3 percent off the top of the earmark without \nauthority by law. In some instances, the agencies did cite a statutory \nauthority for the skimming, but in others it looks as if the skimming \nwas done without express authority to do so. Alarmingly, one agency \nreplied only with this statement:\n\n       The magnitude of your request outstrips our ability to \n     provide you with the extensive amount of data that you \n     desire.\n\n  I found not only skimming in some cases, but there was stiffing when \nyou asked for information as well.\n  The Constitution gives Congress the power of the purse. Yet sometimes \nthe executive branch sees fit to spend congressionally approved earmark \nfunds for their own purposes. That is simply wrong under any set of \ncircumstances. From a constitutional standpoint, from a fiscal \nresponsibility standpoint, and from a practical standpoint, the \nexecutive branch should not be able to redirect earmarked funds unless \nspecifically authorized to do so in that earmark. There shouldn't be an \nongoing authority to do that with every earmark without the authority \nestablished by Congress. And if that authority has been established by \nlaw, I believe we ought to reconsider it because it should be on an \nearmark-by-earmark basis. If they want their budget to include a \ncertain amount of money above\n\n[[Page S501]]\n\nwhere they are at the moment, let them come to the budgeting process \nand make their request just like everyone else has to for the budgeting \nprocess here in Congress.\n  The earmark reforms in this bill are important, and we shouldn't \nallow the executive branch to undermine them. We owe it to our \nconstituents to make sure earmarks are carried out as intended by this \nbody in accordance with our earmarks disclosure rules.\n  To conclude, this amendment simply reinforces the earmark reforms in \na very straightforward way. It will ensure that earmarks are only spent \nfor the stated purpose for which they were approved. It will put an end \nto unaccountable skimming of earmarks and require that any unspent \nearmarked funds will be used for deficit reduction.\n  This amendment protects our constituents and the American taxpayer. \nIt strengthens the underlying bill by providing a guarantee that \nearmarks will be spent only as the Senate intends, for the purpose for \nwhich they were approved, in accordance with the earmark reforms. I \nbelieve the underlying bill is incomplete without my amendment, and I \nurge my colleagues to adopt it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Menendez).

Mr. President, before we proceed to the resolutions \nappointing our committee membership, I want to thank the majority \nleader for his assistance in working on this joint leadership \nagreement. As was agreed to in the 108th Congress, we have included \nlanguage which keeps the current minority staff salary baseline from \ngoing below the allocation in the 109th if those funds are available. \nGiven the possibility of a continuing resolution, the majority leader \nand the chairman of the Rules Committee have agreed to provide each \nranking member, if requested, an allocation equal to 49 percent of the \n10 percent that was available to the chairman in the 109th Congress. I \nwould further say that this money is available out of existing funds \nand is not considered as supplemental funds above the current funding \nlevels.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I concur with the remarks of the Republican \nleader. The baseline was not reduced for Democratic staff in the 108th \nCongress. This agreement allows for that same accommodation for the \nRepublican side in the 110th, if that money is available. Further, \nsince additional funds may not be available, we have agreed that each \nranking member will be allocated the amount mentioned above, if they so \nrequest, and those funds will be made available from existing funds \nprovided by the Rules Committee.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter signed by the \ntwo leaders be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, this Monday we will celebrate the \nlife and legacy of one of America's greatest heroes, the Reverend \nMartin Luther King, Jr.\n  Dr. King dreamt of an America where, as he so profoundly put it, all \nof America's children would be judged not by the color of their skin, \nbut by the content of their character. By sharing his dream with the \nrest of us, Dr. King literally awoke a nation.\n  I remind my colleagues this also will be the first observance of \nMartin Luther King Day when his lovely wife, Coretta Scott King, is no \nlonger with us. She kept the dream alive after Dr. King's tragic \nassassination in 1968. With her passing last year, we lost the first \nlady of America's civil rights movement.\n  I remember all too well the days before Dr. King and the civil rights \nmovement lit a fire across this country. Many parts of America were \nsplit into two separate nations, and they were certainly not equal. As \na child growing up in Alabama and later in Kentucky, I remember \nsegregated lunch counters. I remember separate water fountains.\n  I am proud to say that as a young man I was present for not just one \nbut two significant events in the life of Dr. King. On August 28, \n1963--a Wednesday, without a cloud in the sky--more than 200,000 people \ngathered on the Mall here in Washington to protest racial inequality \nand to hear Dr. King give what would be his most remembered speech.\n  I was an intern at the time for Congressman Gene Snyder of Kentucky, \nand so I went outside and stood on the Capitol steps.\n  I could see up the length of the entire Mall, and see the crowd that \nhad gathered there. I supported Dr. King and his cause, and wanted to \nwitness what I knew would be a pivotal point in history.\n  What none of us knew at the time, Mr. President, is that history was \nalmost denied hearing Dr. King say, ``I have a dream.'' His scripted \nremarks for that day did not include the stirring conclusion to his \nspeech.\n  But when he was about to conclude his remarks and sit down, the \ngospel singer Mahalia Jackson cried out, ``Tell them about your dream, \nMartin! Tell them about the dream!''\n  So Dr. King drew from his past speeches and sermons, and in the \nshadow of the Lincoln Memorial, he issued the greatest declaration of \nfreedom since Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation a century \nearlier.\n  Dr. King's words moved a nation. And the next summer I returned to \nWashington to intern for the great Kentucky Senator John Sherman \nCooper. That year, Senator Cooper worked hard to pass the Civil Rights \nAct of 1964.\n  After my internship, I went on to the University of Kentucky School \nof Law, and returned to Washington in August of 1965 to pay my old boss \nand mentor a visit. It is thanks to him that I had my second \nencounter--not exactly close up, but my second encounter with Dr. King.\n  All that summer, Senator Cooper had been a key proponent of the 1965 \nVoting Rights Act, and on August 4 it passed the Senate and was sent to \nPresident Johnson for his signature.\n  As I sat waiting for the Senator, he suddenly emerged from his office \nand\n\n[[Page S505]]\n\nmotioned for me to follow him. He led me to the Capitol Rotunda, where \nPresident Johnson was about to sign the Voting Rights Act.\n  I'll never forget the President's sheer physical presence in that \nroom. The room was packed with people, but LBJ was bigger than anyone \nin there. Every good history book describes him as a larger-than-life, \nimposing man, and they are all correct. His commanding figure almost \nfilled the rotunda.\n  But there was another figure there, not as large but just as \nsignificant.\n  Here in this Capitol, Dr. King stood by the President and witnessed \nthe signing of the Voting Rights Act--an act that would not have gained \nAmerica's support without his efforts.\n  With its enactment, the promise of the 14th amendment, extending the \nfranchise to newly freed slaves, was finally realized. Sadly, it was a \nhundred years too late.\n  I do not believe this country's march towards liberty and equality, \nand away from racial injustice and division, would have been possible \nwithout Dr. King.\n  It would not have been possible without his leadership of the \nMontgomery bus boycott, which first began to ignite what he called ``a \ncertain kind of fire that no water could put out.''\n  It would not have been possible without his plea to America in front \nof the Lincoln Memorial, when he said:\n\n       I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and \n     live out the true meaning of its creed: We hold these truths \n     to be self-evident, that all men are created equal.\n\n  It would not have been possible without his enlisting all of us, \nBlack and White, in the cause of freedom when he said, ``Human progress \nnever rolls in on wheels of inevitability; it comes through the \ntireless efforts of men.''\n  Dr. King's faith and courage continue to inspire America. Like Moses, \nhe led his people from the dark night of bondage to the promised land.\n  Through courage, Dr. King persevered even in the face of death. \nConstant threats were made on his life. Many times his travel plans \nwere interrupted by bomb threats.\n  No one would have blamed Dr. King if, fearing for his life, he had \nretreated from public view. But he refused to.\n  In 1958 in Harlem, a woman stabbed him in the chest with a letter \nopener, and the blade came so close to his heart that doctors told the \nreverend that if he had even sneezed, he would have died.\n  Dr. King recalled that attack 10 years later in Memphis, in what \nwould be his final speech. ``I am so glad that I didn't sneeze,'' he \ntold a crowd of 2,000. ``I'm just happy that God has allowed me to live \nin this period to see what is unfolding.''\n  Dr. King would die in hours, not from a letter opener, but from an \nassassin's bullet. As he spoke, it seemed he knew his fate was \npreordained, and he was at peace with it.\n  ``I've seen the promised land,'' Dr. King continued. ``I may not get \nthere with you. But I want you to know tonight that we, as a people, \nwill get to the promised land. And I'm happy tonight.''\n  America has traveled far since the civil rights movement, to reach \nthat promised land. It's been a difficult journey, and the journey is \nnot yet over.\n  Dr. King said:\n\n       I am convinced that the universe is under the control of a \n     loving purpose, and that in the struggle for righteousness, \n     man has cosmic companionship. Behind the harsh appearance of \n     the world there is a benign power.\n\n  Those words serve to remind us that no matter the difficulty or the \ndistance of our journey, our destination is clear, thanks to the \nfoundation laid by Dr. King. That destination is liberty and justice \nfor all.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, on Monday, our Nation honors the life and \nlegacy of the late Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., a national hero and man \nwhose words and deeds brought hope and healing to America.\n  We commemorate the timeless values he taught us through his example--\nthe values of courage, truth, justice, compassion, dignity, humility \nand service that so radiantly defined Dr. King's character and \nrevolutionary spirit. Dr. King's belief in the strength of nonviolence \nwas not merely aspirational--though surely it spoke to our aspirations \nas a nation--but it gave his leadership a unique power that resonates \nto this day.\n  I am grateful for this holiday because it is a reminder to listen \nagain to Dr. King's inspiring words and to let the children and \ngrandchildren of those who remember Dr. King hear his voice that filled \na great void in our Nation and answered our collective longing to \nbecome a country that truly lived by its noblest principles.\n  A few months ago, we broke ground on a memorial to honor Dr. King. At \nfirst glance, it may seem a bit out of place that Dr. King's memorial \nwill be located on our National Mall--a place adorned with memorials to \nAmerica's greatest Presidents and wartime heroes. Dr. King was neither \na President of the United States nor a hero in a foreign war. He never \neven held public office. Yet he deserves his place in the pantheon of \ngreat American leaders because lead a Nation he did. Through words, he \ngave voice to the voiceless. Through deeds, he gave courage to the \nfaint of heart. Through his bravery and courage, he endured tremendous \nhardships--he was beaten and jailed 29 times, his family was \nthreatened, his home was fire bombed, and he was placed under \nsurveillance by the FBI--yet he overcame these hurdles and ignited a \nmovement that would lead to historic reforms.\n  In his famous ``I Have a Dream'' speech, Dr. King noted that ``[w]hen \nthe architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the \nConstitution and the Declaration of Independence, they were signing a \npromissory note to which every American was to fall heir.'' And it was \nthanks to the work of great civil rights leaders like Dr. King and his \nwife Coretta Scott King, whom we lost a year ago and whom we honored in \nreauthorizing the Voting Rights Act, that Jim Crow segregation was \nuprooted, and legal barriers to the full participation of racial \nminorities in the political life of the Nation were removed.\n  Yet, as I was reminded last year during our many hearings on the \nreauthorization of the Voting Rights Act and again by accounts of voter \nsuppression during the recent midterm elections, the work of the Voting \nRights Act is not yet complete and the dream of Dr. King has not yet \nbeen fully realized. And so we must not only honor Dr. King's vision by \nremembering him this week, but we must also continue our work to make \nhis dream a reality.\n  Dr. King's own words remind us that this holiday is not merely a \ncelebration of a particular time in American history but also a living \nlegacy to the value of service. Dr. King once said that we all have to \ndecide whether we ``will walk in the light of creative altruism or the \ndarkness of destructive selfishness. Life's most persistent and nagging \nquestion, he said, is `what are you doing for others?'''\n  On this day, we must urge our children and grandchildren to abide by \nDr. King's message that if they serve our country and strive for what \nis just, they can remake a nation and transform a world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/12/senate-section/article/S505-1", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S505-S508]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           JUDICIAL NOMINEES\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise today to express my regret that \nnominations to the U.S. Courts of Appeals will not be resubmitted for \nWilliam G. Myers, Judge Terrence Boyle, William J. Haynes, and Michael \nB. Wallace. All four of these nominees were eminently qualified to \nserve on the U.S. Court of Appeals and no reasonable question has been \nraised as to their integrity. Each of them very likely would have been \nconfirmed had they been afforded to the courtesy of a vote by the U.S. \nSenate. It is generally understood that the Senate did not vote on \nthese nominations because of Democratic threats of obstruction and \nfilibuster, and that the President chose not to resubmit these \nnominations as a result of a hard political calculation that the new \nDemocratic majority in the Senate would not allow a vote on these \nnominations during the remainder of his Presidency. These nominees were \nnot treated fairly by this institution. This week's action reflects \npoorly on the Senate.\n  Much could be said about each of these nominees, their \nqualifications, and the way that they were treated throughout the \njudicial nominations process. I would like today to simply submit for \nthe Record a column published by Edward Whelan in National\n\n[[Page S506]]\n\nReview Online. Mr. Whelan's column raises some disturbing questions \nabout the American Bar Association's actions with regard to Michael B. \nWallace, whom the President had nominated to the U.S. Court of Appeals \nfor the Fifth Circuit. Mr. Wallace is a graduate of Harvard University \nand received his law degree from the University of Virginia, where he \nserved on the law review and was elected to the Order of the Coif. He \nclerked for Justice William Rehnquist on the United States Supreme \nCourt. He became an associate and later a partner at a major law firm \nin his home state of Mississippi. His over twenty years of legal \npractice focused on complex commercial and constitutional litigation \nand afforded him substantial appellate experience. Mr. Wallace even \nargued and won a case before the United States Supreme Court. These are \nobviously superb qualifications to serve on the U.S. Court of Appeals.\n  It is generally understood that the ultimate reason why Mr. Wallace's \nnomination has not been resubmitted is that he was rated ``not \nqualified'' by the ABA. on account of his ``temperament.'' Mr. Whelan's \ncolumn paints a disturbing picture of the process by which the ABA. \ncame to rate Mr. Wallace. Mr. Whelan presents persuasive evidence that \nthe ABA not only allowed its evaluations process to be corrupted by \nindividuals who used it to carry out personal and political vendettas \nagainst Mr. Wallace, but that the chairwoman of the ABA's judicial \nevaluations committee perjured herself in her testimony before the \nSenate Judiciary Committee.\n  To Mr. Whelan's column, I would simply add that I found the ABA's \nwritten justification for its rating of Mr. Wallace to be stunningly \nunpersuasive. The grounds cited in the ABA's written testimony, to the \nextent that they provided any verifiable basis at all for the ABA's \nrating of Mr. Wallace, do not stand up to even the most cursory \nscrutiny. To cite just one example: the ABA found that Mr. Wallace \nlacked the ``temperament'' to be a judge in part because ``positions \ntaken by Mr. Wallace related to the Voting Rights Act'' in the course \nof the Jordan v. Winter litigation were ``not well-founded and [were] \ncontrary . . . to existing interpretations of the Voting Rights Act.'' \nMr. Wallace had argued in the Jordan case that the 1982 amendments to \nthe Voting Rights Act did not invalidate a State's redistricting plan \nabsent some evidence that the plan was the product of racial \ndiscrimination. At the time that Mr. Wallace made this argument, the \n1982 amendments were less than a year old. Moreover, when the very case \nthat Mr. Wallace litigated went to the Supreme Court, two Justices of \nthat Court filed an opinion that substantially agreed with Mr. \nWallace's litigating position. These two Justices also noted that ``the \nlanguage used in the amended statute is, to say the least, rather \nunclear.'' Mississippi Republican Executive Committee v. Brooks, 469 \nU.S. 1002, 1010, Rehnquist, J., dissenting. See also id. at 1012, ``we \nhave a statute whose meaning is by no means easy to determine.''\n  Thus the ABA has rated Mr. Wallace as ``not qualified'' on the basis \nthat he argued for a particular interpretation of a statute when the \nstatute was new and was not yet subject to an authoritative \ninterpretation, when Mr. Wallace's position was later adopted by two \nmembers of the U.S. Supreme Court, and when those same Supreme Court \nJustices characterized the statute as ``unclear.'' I find the ABA's \nanalysis to be wholly unreasonable. It is a lawyer's duty to make good-\nfaith arguments on behalf of his client. Yet in the case of Mr. \nWallace, the ABA has effectively taken the position that if a lawyer \nargues for an interpretation of a statute that is ultimately rejected \nby the courts, then even if the statute is new and unclear and the \nlawyer's interpretation is even endorsed by some members of the U.S. \nSupreme Court, the lawyer's litigating position shows that he lacks a \n``judicial temperament'' and that he is ``not qualified'' to serve as a \nFederal judge. This is a frivolous argument. It is an argument that the \nABA should be embarrassed and ashamed to have made to the Senate \nJudiciary Committee.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the following column be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            [From the National Review Online, Jan. 10, 2007]\n\n                      Not Credible ``Whatsoever''\n\n                           (By Edward Whelan)\n\n       Among the many challenges that new White House counsel Fred \n     Fielding will face on judicial nominations is ensuring that \n     the American Bar Association's ideologically stacked judicial \n     evaluations committee behaves responsibly. Now that \n     Mississippi attorney Michael B. Wallace has requested that \n     President Bush not renominate him to serve on the U.S. Court \n     of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, it is instructive to \n     complete an accounting of the ABA's thoroughly scandalous \n     ``not qualified'' rating of Wallace.\n       Although it determined that Wallace ``has the highest \n     professional competence'' and ``possesses the integrity to \n     serve on the bench,'' the ABA judicial-evaluations committee \n     found him lacking on the highly malleable element of \n     ``judicial temperament.'' As I have previously documented, \n     bias, a glaring conflict of interest, incompetence, a stacked \n     committee, violation of its own procedures, and cheap \n     gamesmanship marked the ABA's evaluation of Wallace. Those \n     internal defects were compounded at Wallace's September 2006 \n     hearing by the incredible testimony given under oath--flat-\n     out perjury, in my judgment--by the new chair of the ABA \n     committee, Philadelphia lawyer Roberta Liebenberg. \n     Liebenberg's testimony merits careful scrutiny as an \n     illustration of the depths to which the ABA will descend to \n     defend its internal failings.\n       First, some background: One of the several scandals \n     surrounding the ABA's evaluation of Wallace relates to the \n     fact that the chair of the ABA committee at the time of the \n     evaluation, Stephen Tober, had had a major run-in with \n     Wallace in 1987 when Wallace served on the board of the Legal \n     Services Corporation (a federal agency that funds legal \n     services for the poor and that was the focus of contentious \n     reform efforts). In the course of strikingly intemperate and \n     buffoonish testimony before an LSC committee headed by \n     Wallace, Tober twice accused him of a ``hidden agenda.'' (The \n     ABA president at the time of the ABA's evaluation of Wallace, \n     Michael Greco, and another ABA committee member, Marna \n     Tucker, had likewise attacked Wallace over contentious LSC \n     matters.) On the Wallace evaluation, Tober played the \n     customary role that the ABA committee chair plays (and that \n     is set forth in the ABA's so-called Backgrounder): He \n     assigned Fifth Circuit member Kim Askew--whose own biases and \n     conflict of interest concerning Wallace are an even greater \n     scandal--to conduct the investigation. He reviewed her draft \n     report with her. In light of her proposed ``not qualified'' \n     rating, he assigned a second person, Thomas Hayward, to \n     conduct a second evaluation of Wallace. He reviewed Hayward's \n     draft report with him. He determined that he was satisfied \n     with the ``quality and thoroughness'' of Askew's \n     investigation, and made the same determination regarding \n     Hayward's investigation. He then directed his committee \n     colleagues to read Askew's report and Hayward's report in \n     tandem.\n       Without any deliberation among the committee members (so \n     Liebenberg has informed me), Tober then received and tallied \n     the votes of the other committee members. Under the ABA \n     committee's procedures, the chair votes only in the event of \n     a tie, so Tober did not cast a vote. Tober then reported \n     the committee's unanimous ``not qualified'' rating to the \n     Senate Judiciary Committee.\n       Beyond the fact that Tober plainly should have recused \n     himself from the Wal1ace evaluation, many of the facts that I \n     recite about Tober's role are in themselves of little \n     interest. What ought to be of considerable interest, however, \n     to anyone who cares about the integrity of the manner in \n     which the ABA committee carries out the privileged role in \n     the judicial-confirmation process that the Senate Judiciary \n     Committee accords it, are Liebenberg's sworn statements about \n     Tober's role in the Wallace evaluation.\n       Time after time, in emphatic, categorical declarations, \n     Liebenberg testified that it was immaterial that Tober had \n     not recused himself because, she claimed, he simply had no \n     role at all in the ABA committee's evaluation of Wallace:\n       ``This is not a process where Mr. Tober had any role \n     whatsoever in the evaluation or the vote.'' (Transcript, p. \n     134 (emphasis added))\n       ``it is important to emphasize that Mr. Tober did not \n     participate in any way in the rating'' of Wallace \n     (Transcript, p. 126 (emphasis added))\n       Tober ``did not participate in either the evaluation or the \n     rating'' (Transcript, p. 126)\n       ``neither Mr. Tober, nor Mr. Greco participated in the \n     evaluation or the rating of Mr. Wallace'' (Transcript, p. \n     128)\n       ``I would just, again, add that Mr. Tober did not \n     participate in the evaluation'' (Transcript, p. 131)\n       Tober, as chair of the committee, ``does not oversee the \n     evaluations'' (Transcript, p. 131)\n       I have the same reaction to these sworn statements that I \n     had when I first heard them in Liebenberg's live testimony: \n     These statements are patently false, and Liebenberg, as an \n     ABA committee member during the Wallace evaluation and as \n     chair at the time of her testimony, had ample reason to know \n     that they were false. Indeed, in\n\n[[Page S507]]\n\n     her prepared testimony, Liebenberg stated, ``The evaluation \n     of Mr. Wallace was conducted in accordance with the normal \n     practices and procedures'' of the ABA committee, and she \n     referred senators to the ABA's Backgrounder for a ``more \n     detailed description of these procedures.''\n       In recent weeks, I have, through an intermediary friendly \n     to Liebenberg, afforded her the opportunity to dispute or \n     clarify my understanding of the facts that render her \n     testimony false. She has availed herself of the opportunity, \n     and the exchange, in my judgment, has clearly confirmed my \n     understanding. (See the appendix below.)\n       In sum, Liebenberg's sworn testimony that ``This is not a \n     process where Mr. Tober had any role whatsoever in the \n     evaluation or the vote,'' and her other categorical \n     statements to the same effect, are truthful only if \n     ``whatsoever'' is not given anything close to its ordinary \n     meaning but is instead a secret code that means, at a \n     minimum, ``except that he assigned the first investigator, \n     reviewed her draft report with her, assigned the second \n     investigator, reviewed his draft report with him, determined \n     that he was satisfied with the quality and thoroughness of \n     both investigations, directed his committee colleagues to \n     read the investigators' reports in tandem, received and \n     tallied the votes, and reported the ABA's rating to the \n     Senate Judiciary Committee.''\n       In her exchange with me, Liebenberg now maintains that \n     Tober ``did not play a substantive role in the evaluation or \n     rating of Mr. Wallace.'' (Emphasis added.) That modifier \n     ``substantive'' is conspicuously absent from her Senate \n     testimony. Indeed, her categorical denial that Tober had \n     ``any role whatsoever in the evaluation'' and her assertion \n     that he ``did not participate in any way'' do not permit \n     reading in that modifier. Moreover, I think it plain that \n     Tober did play a ``substantive'' role--among various \n     respects, in selecting the two investigators and in \n     determining that he was satisfied with the ``quality and \n     thoroughness'' of the investigations.\n       It is also worth noting that Liebenberg's effort to obscure \n     Tober's actual role stands in striking contrast to the ABA's \n     effort to justify its re-rating of D.C. Circuit nominee (and \n     now judge) Brett Kavanaugh. In that case, the shenanigans of \n     the circuit investigator, Mama Tucker, deserved scrutiny. But \n     Tober, who played essentially the same role as chair there as \n     he did on Wallace's nomination, gave Tucker cover by \n     presenting the entire testimony for the ABA committee. He \n     never remotely suggested the absurd notion that he had played \n     no role in the evaluation or rating and was therefore not \n     competent to testify.\n       I have no reason to doubt that Liebenberg is a fine lawyer \n     and, by the standards of the legal profession, generally an \n     honorable person. The interesting question is how such a \n     person could ever have made the statements that she did, let \n     alone under oath. The answer, I would suggest, is that the \n     ideological partisanship, intellectual mediocrity, and \n     institutionalized mendacity of the ABA--the ABA's culture, so \n     to speak--tend to degrade those who rise within its ranks.\n       I don't know Wallace, and I leave open the theoretical \n     possibility that, notwithstanding what his many supporters \n     say, he lacks the necessary judicial temperament. The \n     thoroughly scandalous process by which the ABA reached that \n     judgment, however, provides no basis for confidence in its \n     assessment. Nor, given the ``go along to get along'' \n     collective posterior-covering ethos of the ABA, is there any \n     reason to credit the more recent supplemental evaluations of \n     Wallace. This is especially so because assessments of \n     judicial temperament are so subjective and manipulable. \n     Indeed, it is striking to contrast the extrapolations made \n     about Wallace's judicial temperament from his experience as a \n     litigator with the ABA's unanimous conclusion a dozen years \n     ago that federal district judge Lee Sarokin was ``well \n     qualified'' to be elevated to the Third Circuit. Despite the \n     fact that the Third Circuit had lambasted Sarokin for \n     ``judicial usurpation of power,'' for ignoring ``fundamental \n     concepts of due process,'' for destroying the appearance of \n     judicial impartiality, and for ``superimpos[ing his] own view \n     of what the law should be in the face of the Supreme Court's \n     contrary precedent,'' the ABA had no concerns about his \n     judicial temperament. But, of course, Sarokin was a nominee \n     of President Clinton and was a self-described ``flaming \n     liberal'' as a judge.\n       Can the ABA possibly sink any lower? Let's see what these \n     next two years bring.\n\n\n                                Appendix\n\n       On November 27, 2006, I sent to an intermediary who is \n     friendly to Roberta Liebenberg the twelve propositions set \n     forth below and invited her to let me know whether she agreed \n     or disagreed with the propositions and to provide any \n     amplification (or any reference to other material) that she \n     saw fit to provide. On December 1, 2006, that intermediary \n     responded, stating that he had reviewed the propositions with \n     Liebenberg and providing her responses (which ``she has \n     confirmed with Mr. Tober''). I set forth in full below those \n     responses and my brief replies.\n       Proposition 1: Tober assigned Askew to conduct the \n     investigation of Wallace.\n       Liebenberg response: ``Consistent with the standard \n     practice of the Standing Committee, which generally provides \n     for an evaluation to be conducted by the Committee member \n     from the circuit to which the nomination has been made, Ms. \n     Askew was assigned by Mr. Tober to conduct the Wallace \n     evaluation because she served as the Fifth Circuit \n     representative on the Committee.''\n       My reply: Liebenberg concedes Tober's role. As Tober \n     testified, the investigation is ``ordinarily assigned'' to \n     the circuit member, ``although it may be conducted by another \n     member or former member.'' Whether or not to apply the \n     default rule, and what sort of preliminary inquiry ought to \n     be undertaken, requires a decision-indeed, a substantive \n     judgment (or a failure to exercise judgment)--on the part of \n     the chair. Tober decided to have Askew perform the review \n     despite her ideological bias against Wallace. Further, when \n     Tober became aware (or should have become aware) of facts \n     demonstrating that Askew had an actual conflict of interest, \n     he continued to let her perform the review.\n       Proposition 2: Tober reviewed Askew's draft report with \n     her.\n       Liebenberg response: ``Mr. Tober did not review Ms. Askew's \n     draft report with her, nor did he perform a substantive \n     review of that report. Instead, his review was solely \n     procedural in nature. He utilized a procedural checklist to \n     ensure that, among other things, all disciplinary agencies \n     had been contacted, the requisite number of interviews had \n     been conducted, and a sufficient number of writing samples \n     had been submitted and reviewed. Mr. Tober did not edit, \n     delete, modify, or add anything to the report. He did not \n     tell Ms. Askew whom to interview or what to ask during her \n     interviews. Nor did he ask Ms. Askew to take any further \n     actions with respect to the report or her evaluation before \n     she circulated her report to the rest of the Standing \n     Committee.''\n       My reply: (a) The first clause of Liebenberg's response \n     contradicts her testimony that the Backgrounder's procedures \n     were followed. The Backgrounder states (on page 7): ``The \n     Chair reviews the informal report with the circuit member.'' \n     (b) Liebenberg' s response contradicts itself. The first \n     sentence states that Tober did not review Askew's draft \n     report, but the second sentence concedes that he did review \n     it. (c) Liebenberg's response contrives an unsustainable \n     distinction between ``substantive'' and ``procedural'' \n     review. Tober himself had authority to determine the \n     substantive content of his checklist.\n       Proposition 3: Tober assigned Hayward to conduct a \n     supplemental investigation of Mr. Wallace.\n       Liebenberg response: ``Mr. Tober assigned Mr. Hayward to \n     perform a second evaluation of Mr. Wallace. Mr. Hayward, who \n     is a former Chair of the Standing Committee, had participated \n     in the ratings of over 500 nominees during his tenure on the \n     Committee. Incidentally, Mr. Hayward is a Republican who has \n     made contributions to a number of Republican political \n     candidates.''\n       My reply: Liebenberg concedes Tober's role. (Incidentally, \n     Hayward did not re-interview any of the individuals \n     interviewed by Askew but instead accepted, and relied on, her \n     interview summaries. So much for an independent check.)\n       Proposition 4: Tober reviewed Hayward's draft report with \n     him.\n       Liebenberg's response: ``Mr. Tober did not review Mr. \n     Hayward's draft report with him, nor did he perform a \n     substantive review of that report. Instead, his review was \n     solely procedural in nature, and entailed the same process \n     set forth above in No. 2. As was true with Ms. Askew's \n     report, Mr. Tober did not edit, delete, modify, or add \n     anything to Mr. Hayward's report. He did not tell Mr. Hayward \n     whom to interview or what to ask during his interviews. Nor \n     did he ask Mr. Hayward to take any further actions with \n     respect to the report or his evaluation before Mr. Hayward \n     circulated his report to the rest of the Standing \n     Committee.''\n       My reply: My reply on Proposition 2 applies fully here.\n       Propositions 5 and 6: Tober determined that he was \n     satisfied with the quality and thoroughness of Askew's \n     investigation. Tober determined that he was satisfied with \n     the quality and thoroughness of Hayward's investigation.\n       Liebenberg's response: ``Mr. Tober's review of the draft \n     reports by Ms. Askew and Mr. Hayward for `quality and \n     thoroughness' did not entail any substantive input on his \n     part. Instead, his review was procedural in nature, as set \n     forth above in Nos. 2 and 4.''\n       My reply: The Backgrounder (which Liebenberg testified was \n     followed) makes clear that the chair must be ``satisfied with \n     the quality and thoroughness of the investigation.'' This \n     standard plainly requires a decision by the chair. Again, \n     Liebenberg's posited distinction between procedure and \n     substance is incoherent. Further, she conflates the issue \n     whether Tober provided ``any substantive input'' with the \n     distinct question whether he performed a substantive review. \n     (Incidentally, the fact that Tober evidently performed his \n     substantive role in such a perfunctory fashion undermines the \n     integrity of the ABA process. One reason to have a chair, \n     rather than simply a checklist, is to harmonize the \n     approaches taken by investigators so that ratings are \n     consistent and don't turn unduly on the assignment of the \n     investigator.)\n       Proposition 7: Tober directed his committee colleagues to \n     read Askew's report and Mr. Hayward's report ``in tandem''.\n       Liebenberg's response: ``Consistent with the practice of \n     the Committee, Ms. Askew circulated her report directly to \n     the Standing Committee members. In her transmittal\n\n[[Page S508]]\n\n     letter accompanying the report she advised the members that \n     they would separately receive Mr. Hayward's report at or \n     about the same time. She also advised the Committee members \n     to review all of the evaluation materials, including the \n     documents pertaining to the Standing Committee's 1992 \n     evaluations of Mr. Wallace, before voting on Mr. Wallace's \n     rating. It should be noted that Ms. Askew advised Committee \n     members that she was the person who should be called if they \n     had any questions about her report or the accompanying \n     materials.\n       ``Subsequently, Mr. Tober similarly advised Committee \n     members to review the reports by Ms. Askew and Mr. Hayward in \n     tandem. He did not direct Committee members to ascribe more \n     significance to one report than another; did not suggest how \n     Committee members should vote; and did not discuss with Ms. \n     Askew, Mr. Hayward, or any members of the Committee his own \n     views of the professional qualifications of Mr. Wallace.''\n       My reply: Liebenberg concedes Tober's role.\n       Proposition 8: Whether in person, by telephone, by e-mail, \n     or in some other fashion, Tober was party to the ABA \n     committee's deliberations on Wallace.\n       Liebenberg's response: ``There were no `deliberations' \n     among Standing Committee members with respect to the rating \n     of Mr. Wallace. Each Committee member independently reviewed \n     the evaluation materials and voted on a rating to be given to \n     Mr. Wallace. Mr. Tober and the rest of the Standing Committee \n     did not have an in-person meeting, conference call, or e-mail \n     discussion regarding Mr. Wallace's qualifications or the \n     rating to be given to him.''\n       My reply: For present purposes, I assume the correctness of \n     Liebenberg's account. (If there were no deliberations on a \n     ``not qualified'' recommendation--and on Askew's badly flawed \n     report--that would seem yet another damning indictment of the \n     ABA's processes.)\n       Propositions 9 and 10: Tober received and tallied the votes \n     from other committee members. Tober reported the ABA \n     committee's rating to the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n       Liebenberg's response: ``The 14 voting members of the \n     Committee conveyed their votes to Mr. Tober, who in turn \n     reported the Committee's unanimous 'Not Qualified' rating of \n     Mr. Wallace to the Senate Judiciary Committee.''\n       My reply: Liebenberg concedes Tober's role.\n       Proposition 11: At the Judiciary Committee hearing, Senator \n     Sessions asked Mr. Hayward, ``Are you aware that other \n     members of the [ABA] committee probably were aware that the \n     chair of the committee [i.e., Mr. Tober] had had a personal \n     run-in with the nominee, Mr. Wallace?'' Mr. Hayward replied, \n     ``I said I was aware. If you read the record, you are \n     aware.'' (Transcript, pp. 142-143) I understand this exchange \n     to indicate that the confidential ABA committee report on Mr. \n     Wallace included a discussion of Mr. Tober's experience with, \n     and views of, Mr. Wallace.\n       Liebenberg's response: ``Neither the report by Ms. Askew \n     nor the report by Mr. Hayward included a discussion of Mr. \n     Tober's experience with, and views of, Mr. Wallace. The \n     evaluation materials did not include a discussion of any \n     `run-in' between Mr. Tober and Mr. Wallace in 1987, or any \n     other interactions between them. Mr. Tober was not \n     interviewed by Ms. Askew or Mr. Hayward about Mr. Wallace, \n     they did not solicit his views regarding the nominee, and he \n     did not volunteer to them his views.''\n       My reply: For present purposes, I assume the correctness of \n     Liebenberg's account.\n       Proposition 12: Liebenberg testified at the Judiciary \n     Committee hearing that ``it is important to emphasize that \n     Mr. Tober did not participate in any way in the rating'' of \n     Wallace (Transcript, p. 126); that Tober ``did not \n     participate in either the evaluation or the rating'' \n     (Transcript, p. 126); that ``neither Mr. Tober, nor Mr. \n     Greco participated in the evaluation or the rating of Mr. \n     Wallace'' (Transcript, p. 128); that ``I would just, \n     again, add that Mr. Tober did not participate in the \n     evaluation'' (Transcript, p. 131); that Tober, as chair of \n     the committee, ``does not oversee the evaluations'' \n     (Transcript, p. 131); and that ``This is not a process \n     where Mr. Tober had any role whatsoever in the evaluation \n     or the vote'' (Transcript, p. 134).\n       Liebenberg's response (presented in the third person): \n     ``When Ms. Liebenberg testified that Mr. Tober did not \n     `participate' in the evaluation or rating of Mr. Wallace, her \n     testimony was based on the fact that Mr. Tober did not \n     conduct any of the evaluation interviews; was not interviewed \n     by Ms. Askew or Mr. Hayward; did not prepare the evaluation \n     reports or make any revisions to them; did not vote on Mr. \n     Wallace's rating; and did not express his own opinion of Mr. \n     Wallace's professional qualifications or what Mr. Wallace's \n     rating should be to Ms. Askew, Mr. Hayward, or anyone else on \n     the Committee. Thus, Mr. Tober did not play a substantive \n     role in the evaluation or rating of Mr. Wallace. Ms. \n     Liebenberg explained to the Senate Judiciary Committee that \n     the evaluations were the sole responsibility of Ms. Askew and \n     Mr. Hayward, and that each of the 14 voting members of the \n     Committee independently voted on the rating, with no \n     influence being exercised over their votes by Mr. Tober. \n     (transcript pp. 116, 121)''\n       My reply: Propositions 1-7, 9 and 10 establish that \n     Liebenberg's testimony was false. The transcript pages cited \n     in her response do not put a different gloss on Liebenberg's \n     testimony. Indeed, they consist entirely of (unrelated) \n     testimony by Askew, not Liebenberg.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/12/senate-section/article/S508-1", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S508]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    THE PASSING OF JUDGE JANE BOLIN\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this week we lost Judge Jane Bolin, the \nNation's first African-American female judge, whose career marks a \nshining example of a person knocking down barriers and leaving a \nfootprint for others to follow.\n  Stirred by a strong sense of justice and a forceful determination to \ncontribute, Judge Bolin overcame the indignity of signs saying ``no \nwomen should apply'' and ``no blacks allowed,'' and rose to have a \ncareer defined by ``firsts,'' the first African-American woman to \ngraduate from Yale Law School, the first to join the New York City Bar \nAssociation, the first to work in the office of the New York City \ncorporation counsel, and the first to serve on the judicial bench. Her \nlegacy will live on, not only through her accomplishments on the bench \nof ending the placement of children in childcare agencies on the basis \nof ethnic background and ending the assignment of probation officers on \nthe basis of race but also through the example of her lifelong struggle \nto show ``a broad sympathy for human suffering'' which will continue to \ninspire generations to come.\n  I salute her life and hope that our Nation will continue its march \ntowards a more representative judiciary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/12/senate-section/article/S508-2", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S508]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 3:20 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 4.

A bill to repeal certain sections of the Act of May 26, 1936, \npertaining to the Virgin Islands; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n\n[[Page S510]]\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself and Mr. Domenici):\n  S. 283. A bill to amend the Compact of Free Association Amendments \nAct of 2003, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, today I am joined by my colleague, and \nthe Ranking Member of the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, \nPete Domenici, on the introduction of two bills regarding the insular \nareas affiliated with the United States. The text of both of these \nbills is identical to the text of bills that passed the Senate by \nunanimous consent on September 29, 2006.\n  The first bill, ``To Repeal Certain Sections of the Act of May 26, \n1936 Pertaining to the Virgin Islands,'' would repeal sections of a \n1936 law governing local U.S. Virgin Islands tax policy that were \nthought to have been effectively repealed in 1952. That year, Congress \nenacted the Virgin Islands Organic Act to establish local self-\ngovernment and to delegate certain local functions, including the \ndevelopment and administration of local property taxes, to a newly \nestablished local government. Notwithstanding this intent, in 2004, a \nFederal court ruled that these sections of the Act of 1936 are still in \neffect.\n  The text of the bill introduced today is identical to S. 1829, as \npassed by the Senate four months ago. A hearing was held on that bill \non October 25, 2005, and it was reported from the Committee on April \n20, 2006. Details on the background, purpose, and need for this \nlegislation is available in Senate Hearing 109-291, and in Senate \nReport 109-236.\n  The second bill being introduced today, ``To Amend the Compact of \nFree Association Amendments Act of 2003, and For Other Purposes,'' \nwould make several relatively minor, clarifying, and technical changes \nto Public Law 108-188 which approved the Compact of Free Association \nbetween the U.S. and the Marshall Islands, and the Compact between the \nU.S. and Micronesia. The text of this bill is identical to S. 1830, as \npassed by the Senate four months ago. A hearing was held on that bill \non October 25, 2005, and it was reported from the Committee on April \n20, 2006. Details on the background, purpose, and need for this \nlegislation is available in Senate Hearing 109-291, and in Senate \nReport 109-237.\n  Although relatively small and remote, the U.S.-affiliated insular \nareas are the home for many U.S. citizens, or for communities with \nwhich our Nation has special historical and political relationships. \nMaintaining and strengthening these relationships is a particular \nconcern of the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources because of its \njurisdiction over matters relating to the territories and freely \nassociated states. It is unfortunate that, last year, Senate passage of \nthese bills was delayed leaving insufficient time for enactment. I look \nforward to working with members of the Committee and the Senate on \ntheir prompt consideration this session, and to their enactment as soon \nas possible.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bills be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the texts of the bills were ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 279\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. REPEAL OF CERTAIN LAWS PERTAINING TO THE VIRGIN \n                   ISLANDS.\n\n       (a) Repeal.--Sections 1 through 6 of the Act of May 26, \n     1936 (48 U.S.C. 1401 et seq.), are repealed.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by this section \n     takes effect on July 22, 1954.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                                 S. 283\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

CLARIFICATION OF TAX-FREE STATUS OF TRUST FUNDS.\n\n       In the U.S.-RMI Compact, the U.S.-FSM Compact, and their \n     respective trust fund subsidiary agreements, for the purposes \n     of taxation by the United States or its subsidiary \n     jurisdictions, the term ``State'' means ``State, territory, \n     or the District of Columbia''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LIEBERMAN (for himself, Mr. McCain, Mrs. Lincoln, Ms. \n        Snowe, Mr. Obama, and Mr. Durbin):\n  S. 280. A bill to provide for a program to accelerate the reduction \nof greenhouse gas emissions in the United States by establishing a \nmarket-driven system of greenhouse gas tradeable allowances, to support \nthe deployment of new climate change-related technologies, and to \nensure benefits to consumers from the trading in such allowances, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, on October 4 of last year, the Hadley \nCentre for Climate Prediction and Research, which houses Great \nBritain's leading climate scientists, projected that in the absence of \nprompt action to curb global warming, extreme drought will spread \nacross one third of the Earth's land surface by the end of this \ncentury.\n  On October 30, the head of the United Kingdom's Government Economic \nService forecasted that unchecked global warming will cost the world \nbetween five and twenty percent of gross domestic product each year.\n  On December 4, the director of the U.S. Center for Disease Control's \nNational Center for Environmental Health cited global warming as ``the \nlargest looming public health challenge we face.'' Insect-borne \ndiseases such as malaria are expected to spike as tropical ecosystems \nexpand; hotter air will exacerbate the air pollutants that send our \nchildren to the hospital with asthma attacks; food insecurity from \nshifting agricultural zones will spark border wars; and storms and \ncoastal flooding from sea-level rise will cause mortality and \ndislocation.\n  On December 14, in fact, the journal Science published a peer-\nreviewed study projecting that unchecked global warming could cause sea \nlevels to rise between a half meter and one-and-a-half meters above \n1990 levels by the end of this century. A sealevel rise in the middle \nof that range would submerge every city on the East Coast of the United \nStates, from Miami to Boston.\n  And on December 27, the Interior Department proposed to list the \npolar bear as threatened with extinction due to Arctic ice melt from \nglobal warming.\n  When even erstwhile skeptics cite melting habitat as the reason polar \nbears are now threatened, I say the global warming debate is over. The \nAmerican people want action, and they want it now.\n  As you know, Senator McCain and I have brought our legislation to \nsolve global warming to a vote in this chamber twice already, first in \n2003 and then again in 2005. On the same day that the Senate failed for \na second time to pass our bill, in June 2005, this body fortunately did \npass Senator Bingaman's resolution that the Congress should enact ``a \ncomprehensive and effective national program of mandatory, market-based \nlimits on emissions of greenhouse gases that slow, stop, and reverse \nthe growth of such emissions.''\n\n[[Page S512]]\n\n  Today I am reintroducing an improved version of my and Senator \nMcCain's Climate Stewardship and Innovation Act. As the last version of \nthe Act did, the version I introduce today carries the co-sponsorship \nof Senators Obama and Snowe. I am proud to say that improvements to the \nbill have now attracted the additional co-sponsorship of Senators \nLincoln and Collins. Very shortly, I understand, Representatives Olver \nand Gilchrest will reintroduce this bill's companion in the House.\n  The 2005 version of the Climate Stewardship and Innovation Act would \nhave capped U.S. greenhouse gas emissions at year 2000 levels without \nmandating further reductions. The new bill will gradually lower the \nemissions cap, such that it reaches approximately one third of 2000 \nlevels by 2050. Those long-term reductions will forestall catastrophic, \nmanmade climate change, provided the world's other major economies \nfollow suit within the next decade. Like the 2005 version, the \nreintroduced bill will control compliance costs by allowing companies \nto trade, save, and borrow emissions credits, and by allowing them to \ngenerate ``offset'' credits by inducing noncovered businesses, farms, \nand others to reduce their emissions or capture and store greenhouse \ngases. The reintroduced bill, however, will increase the availability \nof borrowing and offsets in order to control costs further.\n  This bill will be referred to the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee, where I will chair a subcommittee on climate change. \nColleagues of mine on that committee, including our esteemed chairwoman \nand my good friend, Senator Boxer, will have their own strong proposals \nfor curbing global warming. I look forward to working with them to get \ncomprehensive legislation reported favorably to the floor in a \nbipartisan manner. Senator Bingaman, the chairman of the Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee, has invested a great deal of work and \nexpertise in a comprehensive climate bill of his own. I believe Senator \nBingaman will be highly influential in this process, and I look forward \nto working with him closely to solve this problem.\n  With American know-how we can and will solve this problem. We will \nuse the power of the free market to promote the rapid and widespread \ndeployment of advanced technologies and practices for reducing \ngreenhouse gas emissions. And we will do so without weakening the \neconomic position of the United States or otherwise imposing hardship \non its citizens.\n  I would like to close by extending my heartfelt thanks to the \ndistinguished majority leader, Senator Reid, for placing legislation to \ncurb global warming among his top ten priorities for this Congress, and \nfor memorializing that commitment with the introduction, as S. 6, of \nthe National Energy and Environmental Security Act, a bill that I was \nproud to co-sponsor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Lieberman \ntoday, along with our co-sponsors, Senators Snowe, Obama, Collins, and \nLincoln, in introducing the Climate Stewardship and Innovation Act of \n2007. This legislation is designed to significantly reduce the Nation's \ngreenhouse gas emissions to prevent the dangerous impacts of climate \nchange, enhance our national security and maintain the strength to our \neconomy. It would be accomplished through a combination of trading \nmarkets and the deployment of advanced technologies.\n  As I have stated on previous occasions, the design of this \nlegislation is an evolving process. The legislation we are introducing \ntoday represents yet another step in that effort. Since our last vote \non this legislation, Senator Lieberman and I have continued work on \nthis proposal with the goal of producing the most innovative, \nmeaningful, and economically feasible measure that can be embraced by \nthe Senate. We believe the changes which we have made since we first \nintroduced climate change legislation in the 108th Congress puts us on \nthe path to achieving this goal, and we intend to make further \nimprovements to this comprehensive legislation in the days ahead.\n  We have continually worked with scientists, industry, \nenvironmentalists, as well as the faith-based community, to ensure that \nwe are fully addressing the serious problem of global warming. We \ncontinue to learn more about the science and the impacts of climate \nchange on a daily basis. We continue to work with economists and \nindustry experts to ensure that our emissions goals do not hamstring \nour economic objectives. In particular, we continue to learn more about \nthe power of the markets to control costs as emission credit trading \ncontinues in Europe and here in the U.S. I am confident that given the \nwill, the Federal Government can be a lead advocate for ensuring that \nAmerica is doing its part to reduce global warming, and join in the \nglobal effort that is needed to address this world-wide environmental \nissue.\n  I want to mention the efforts of States like California, which has \nalready enacted legislation requiring mandatory reduction of greenhouse \ngas emissions, and the Northeast States of Connecticut, Delaware, \nMaine, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, and Vermont, which are also \nseeking to limit emissions from power plants. Over 300 U.S. mayors have \nsigned an agreement to reduce emissions in their cities.\n  As these State plans and legislation are implemented, they will offer \nCongress and the Administration unique opportunities to review and \nincorporate lessons learned from these efforts into Federal \nlegislation. Despite the improvements we have made in this version of \nour bill to be environmentally responsible and to minimize economic \ncosts, we will continue to pursue new and innovative ideas that will \nfurther these objectives, and we will modify our bill accordingly.\n  The legislation we submit today is designed to protect our \nenvironment from the impacts of the climate change resulting from the \nbuildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, improve our national \nsecurity by reducing reliance on fossil fuels that often carry with \nthem geopolitical costs, and position our economy to become a world \nleader in the expanding markets for development and deployment of new \nenergy efficient technologies and renewable energy sources. It proposes \nthe utilization of the ``cap and trade'' approach and promotes the \ncommercialization of technologies that can significantly reduce \ngreenhouse gas emissions, mitigate the impacts of climate change, and \nincrease the nation's energy independence. And it will help to keep \nAmerica at the cutting edge of innovation where the jobs and trade \nopportunities of the new economy are to be found. It will also serve to \nprotect our country and the world from the security threat posed by \npopulations whose health, livelihood, and variability are potentially \nthreatened by global rising temperatures and altered environments.\n  In fact, the cap and trade provisions and the technology title are \ncomplementary parts of a comprehensive program that will allow us to \nusher in a new energy era, an era of responsible and innovative energy \nproduction and use that will yield enormous environmental, economic, \nand diplomatic benefits. The cap and trade portion provides the \neconomic driver for existing and new technologies capable of supplying \nreliable and clean energy and making the best use of America's \navailable energy resources. Because of the multiple benefits promised \nby this comprehensive program, we expect that the new bill will attract \nadditional support for the vital purposes of the Climate Stewardship \nand Innovation Act. We simply need the political will to match the \npublic's concern about climate change, desire for national security, \nthe economic interests of business and consumers, and American \ntechnological ingenuity and expertise.\n  As I mentioned, we continue to learn more about the science of \nclimate change and the dangerous precedence of not addressing this \nenvironmental problem. The science tells us that urgent and significant \naction is needed. Our National Academies of Sciences, along with the \nnational academies from the other G8 nations, China, India, and Brazil, \nhas said in a joint statement that ``there is now strong evidence that \nsignificant global warming is occurring.'' and ``[t] he scientific \nunderstanding of climate change is now sufficiently clear to justify \nnations taking prompt action.''\n  We recognize that many fear the costs of taking action. But there are \ncosts to delay as well. Failure to implement significant reductions in \nnet\n\n[[Page S513]]\n\ngreenhouse gas emissions in the near term will yield only more climate \nchange and a much harder job in the future. Our comprehensive \nlegislation is one approach to a productive, secure, and clean energy \nfuture. But it is only one approach and we welcome other proposals--let \na thousand flowers bloom.\n  Significant reductions in greenhouse gases--well beyond those \nrequired by this bill--are feasible over the next 15-20 years using \ntechnologies available today. Also, the most important technological \ndeployment opportunities to reduce emissions over the next two decades \nlie with energy efficient technologies and renewable energy sources, \nincluding nuclear, solar, wind, and bio-fuels. For example, in the \nelectric power sector, which accounts for one-third of U.S. emissions, \nmajor pollution reductions can be achieved by improving the efficiency \nof existing fossil fuel plants, adding new reactors designs for nuclear \npower, expanding use of renewable power sources, and significantly \nreducing electricity demand with the use of energy-saving technologies \ncurrently available to residential and commercial consumers. These \nclean technologies need to be promoted and that is what spurs our \naction today.\n  Let me take a moment to address a section of our legislation that has \nbeen the target of some concerns by environmentalists and others--\nconcerns that I believe are entirely unwarranted. The provisions in our \nbill to promote nuclear energy are an important part of the \ncomprehensive technology package.\n  I know that some of our friends here in the Senate and in the \nenvironmental community maintain strong objections to nuclear energy, \neven though today it supplies nearly 20 percent of the electricity \ngenerated in the U.S. and much higher proportions in places such as \nFrance, Belgium, Sweden and Switzerland--countries that are not exactly \nknown for their environmental disregard. The fact is, nuclear energy is \nCLEAN. It produces ZERO emissions, while the burning of fossil fuels to \ngenerate electricity produces approximately 33 percent of the \ngreenhouse gases accumulating in the atmosphere, and is a major \ncontributor to air pollution affecting our communities.\n  The idea that nuclear power should play no role in our future energy \nmix is an unsustainable position, particularly given the urgency and \nmagnitude of the threat posed by global warming which most regard as \nthe greatest environmental threat to the planet.\n  The International Energy Agency estimates that the world's energy \nconsumption is expected to rise over 65 percent within the next fifteen \nyears. If the demand for electricity is met using traditional coal-\nfired power plants, not only will we fail to reduce carbon emissions as \nnecessary, but the level of carbon in the atmosphere will skyrocket and \nintensify the greenhouse effect and the global warming it produces.\n  As nuclear plants are decommissioned, the percentage of U.S. \nelectricity produced by this zero-emission technology will actually \ndecline. Therefore, at a minimum, we must make efforts to maintain \nnuclear energy's level of contribution, so that this capacity is not \nreplaced with higher-emitting alternatives.\n\n  No doubt, some people will object to the idea of the Federal \nGovernment playing any role in helping demonstrate and commercialize \nnew and beneficial energy technologies, and particularly nuclear \ndesigns. We understand the power of markets to spur innovation and our \nproposals is built on this fundamental lesson. But the fact remains \nthat the market playing field has been highly uneven--fossil fuels have \nbeen subsidized for many decades at levels that can scarcely be \ncalculated. The enormous economic costs of damage caused by air \npollution and greenhouse gas emissions to the environment and human \nhealth are not factored into the price of power produced by fossil-\nfueled technologies. Yet, it's a cost that we all bear, too often in \nterms of ill-health and diminished quality of life. That is simply a \nmatter of fact.\n  It is also inescapable that the ability to avoid internalizing these \ncosts placed produces at a great advantage over clean competitors. \nBased on that fact, and in light of the enormous environmental and \neconomic risk posed by global warming, I believe that providing zero \nand low emission technologies such as nuclear a boost into the market \nplace so that these clean technologies can be utilized as soon as \npossible is responsible public policy, and a matter of simple public \nnecessity, particularly, as we work to promote America's energy \nindependence.\n  The Navy has operated nuclear powered submarines for more than 50 \nyears and has an impressive safety and performance record. The Naval \nReactors program has demonstrated that nuclear power can be done \nsafely. One of the underpinning of its safety record is the approach \nused in its reactor designs, which is to learn and built upon previous \ndesigns. Unfortunately for the commercial nuclear industry, they have \nnot had the opportunity to use such an approach since the industry has \nnot been able to build a reactor in over the past 25 years. This lapse \nin construction has led us to where we are today with the industry's \naging infrastructure. As we have learned from other industries, this in \nitself represents a great risk to public safety.\n  As Senator Lieberman and I have continued working for passage of \nlegislation to address climate change in a meaningful way, it has \nbecome clear to us that any responsible climate change measure must \ncontain five essential components:\n  First, it must have rational, mandatory emission reduction targets \nand timetables. It must be goal oriented, and has both environmental \nand economic integrity. We need policy that will produce necessary \noutcomes, not merely check political boxes. The goal must be feasible \nand based on sound science, and this is what we have tried to do in \nthis bill.\n  Second, it must utilize a market-based cap and trade system. It must \nlimit greenhouse gas emissions and allows the trading of emission \ncredits to drive enterprise, innovation and efficiency. This is the \ncentral component of our legislation. Voluntary efforts will not change \nthe status quo, taxes are counterproductive, and markets are more \ndependable than regulators in effecting sustainable change.\n  Third, it must include mechanisms to minimize costs and work \neffectively with other markets. The ``trade'' part of ``cap and trade'' \nis such a mechanism, but it's clear it must be bolstered by other \nassurances that costs will be minimized. I am as concerned as anyone \nabout the economic impacts associated with any climate change \nlegislation. I know that many economists are developing increasingly \nsophisticated ways to project future costs of compliance. Lately, we \nhave seen the increased interest in this area of research. As we learn \nmore from these models about additional action items to further reduce \ncosts, we intend to incorporate them. Already, based upon earlier \neconomic analysis, we have added ``offsets'' provisions in this bill in \nan effort to minimize costs and to provide for the creation of new \nmarkets. And, I assure my colleagues, we will continue to seek new and \ninnovative ways to further minimize costs.\n  Fourth, it must spur the development and deployment of advanced \ntechnology. Nuclear, solar, and other alternative energy must be part \nof the equation and we need a dedicated national commitment to develop \nand bring to market the technologies of the future as a matter of good \nenvironmental and economic policy. There will be a growing global \nmarket for these technologies and the U.S. will benefit greatly from \nbeing competitive and capturing its share of these markets. This \nlegislation includes a detailed technology title that would go a long \nway toward meeting this goal. Unlike the Energy bill, it would be \nfunded using the proceeds from the auctioning of allowable emission \ncredits, rather than from the use of taxpayers' funds or appropriations \nthat will never materialize.\n  And fifth, it must facilitate international efforts to solve the \nproblem. Global warming is an international problem requiring an \ninternational effort. The United States has an obligation to lead. Our \nleadership cannot replace the need for action by countries such as \nIndia and China. We must spur and facilitate it. We have added \nprovisions that would allow U.S. companies to enter into partnerships \nin developing countries for the purpose of conducting projects to \nachieve certified emission reductions, which may be traded on the \ninternational market.\n\n[[Page S514]]\n\n  These five components represent a serious challenge that will require \na great deal of effort, the concentration of substantial intellectual \npower, and the continued efforts of our colleagues and those in the \nenvironmental, industry, economic, and national security communities. \nWe look forward to collaborating in this effort as we continue to shape \nour legislation to its most effective form.\n  The status quo is a strong and stubborn force. People and \ninstitutions are averse to change, even when that change is critical \nfor their own well-being, and that of their children and grandchildren. \nIf the scientists are right and temperatures continue to rise, we could \nface environmental, economic, and national security consequences far \nbeyond our ability to imagine. If they are wrong and the Earth finds a \nway to compensate for the unprecedented levels of greenhouse gases in \nthe atmosphere, what will we have accomplished? Cleaner air; greater \nenergy efficiency, a more diverse and secure energy mix, and U.S. \nleadership in the technologies of the future. There is no doubt; \nfailure to act is the far greater risk.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to offer, with my colleagues \nSenators Lieberman, McCain, Obama, Lincoln, and Collins, S. 280, the \nbipartisan Climate Stewardship and Innovation Act that requires the \nUnited States to take actions to reduce manmade greenhouse gas \nemissions for the protection of both our environment and our economy. \nThis legislation takes concrete steps by using a fair, market-based \nsystem to once and for all demonstrate leadership on climate change and \nreduce emissions in the United States. Furthermore, it will do so \nwithout weakening the economic position of the United States or \notherwise imposing hardship on its citizens.\n  Ongoing peer-reviewed scientific and economic research demonstrates \nthat climate change is one of the most significant environmental and \neconomical issues of the 21st century, impacting the planet's weather \npatterns, resulting in more severe, sustained storm systems, floods, \nheat waves, and droughts. Yet, I have grave concerns that the lack of \ndomestic climate change policy is akin to Nero's approach, fiddling as \nthe planet warms.\n  With overwhelming scientific evidence that global warming is \nadversely impacting the health of our planet, the time has come for the \nCongress to step up and take action. Anthropogenic greenhouse gas \nemissions that enter the atmosphere today from all sectors of our \nsociety will last for generations to come threatening our oceans, our \nenvironment and the economic well-being of our country and the world. \nIt is beyond dispute that we cannot afford the price of inaction.\n  The urgency is clear as climate change is no longer an abstract \nconcept. Sea levels are rising, polar ice caps are melting. Indeed, \nearlier this month the Bush administration listed the polar bear a \nthreatened species. Department of Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne \nstated, ``Polar bears are one of nature's ultimate survivors. They're \nable to live and thrive in one of the world's harshest environments, \nbut there's concern that their habitat may literally be melting away.'' \nThe listing document says that the polar bear's ice habitat that is \nused as platforms for hunting, mating and resting could vanish within \nhalf a century.\n  The majestic polar bear of the Arctic may well be the symbol of \nclimate change just as the bald eagle was when Rachel Carson published \nher stunning book ``Silent Spring'' in 1962 that linked the DDT \npesticide to the fate of our national symbol--and created an \nenvironmental conscious for the country.\n  It is obvious that new and longer term ideas for securing both \ndomestic and international cooperation are necessary as we cannot get \nto the heart of this global problem without the world's major economies \ntaking domestic actions. Clearly, as the causes of climate change are \nglobal and the atmosphere knows no boundaries, the challenge can only \nbe met with all the countries of the world working together.\n  That is why when asked by three major independent think tanks--the \nCenter for American Progress in the U.S., the Institute for Public \nPolicy Research in the U.K. and the Australia Institute--I accepted the \nco-chairmanship of the high-level International Climate Change \nTaskforce--the ICCT--to chart a way forward on climate change on a \nparallel track with the Kyoto Protocol process. The report from this \nTaskforce, Meeting the Climate Challenge, recommends ways to involve \nthe world's largest economies in the effort, including the U.S. and \nmajor developing nations, focusing on creating new agreements to \nachieve the deployment of clean energy technologies, and a new global \npolicy framework that is both inclusive and fair.\n  The Taskforce, along with Co-chair, the Rt. Honorable Stephen Byers \nof the U.K., includes an international, cross-party, cross-sector \ncollaboration of leaders from public service, science, business and \ncivil society from both developed and developing countries. We set out \na pathway to solve climate change issues in tandem--collaboratively \nfinding common ground through recommendations that are both ambitious \nand realistic to engage all countries, and, critically, including those \nnot bound by the Kyoto Protocol and major developing countries. We hope \nour proposals will be a prelude to the international dialogue and, \nultimately, set the score for lasting change.\n  The Report calls for the establishment of a long-term objective of \npreventing global average temperature from rising more than 3.6 degree \nFahrenheit, 2 degrees Centigrade, above the pre-industrial level by the \nend of the century.\n  The Taskforce arrived at the 2 degrees Centigrade--or 3.6 degree \nFahrenheit--temperature increase goal on the basis of an extensive \nreview of the relevant scientific literature that shows that, as the \nICCT Report states, ``Beyond the 2 degree Centigrade level, the risks \nto human societies and ecosystems grow significantly. It is likely, for \nexample, that average temperature increases larger than this will \nentail substantial agricultural losses, greatly increases numbers of \npeople at risk of water shortages, and widespread adverse health \nimpacts.''\n  Our Report goes on to say that, ``Climate science is not yet able to \nspecify the trajectory of atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse \ngases that corresponds precisely to any particular global temperature \nrise. Based on current knowledge, however, it appears that achieving a \nhigh probability of limiting global average temperature rise to 2 \ndegrees C will require that the increase in greenhouse-gas \nconcentrations as well as all the other warming and cooling influences \non global climate in the year 2100, as compared with 1750, should add \nup to a net warming no greater than what would be associated with a \nCO2 concentration of about 400 parts per million (ppm)''.\n  This goal of the ICCT comports well with the Climate Stewardship and \nInnovation Act we are introducing today because the legislation creates \na domestic market-based cap-and-trade system to reduce manmade carbon \ndioxide emissions with specific targets to meet specific dates. The \nbill will also make the U.S. a partner in the vast community of \ndeveloped countries who have adopted national mandatory cap-and-trade \nsystems for carbon emissions. I believe it will also bring emerging \neconomies to the international negotiating table, such as China, who is \npredicted to surpass the U.S. as the largest emitter of greenhouse \ngases by 2010--China who is putting on line one carbon-spewing coal-\nfired power plant each week.\n  Achieving success for climate change legislation that calls for \nrealistic reductions of greenhouse gases by setting certain targets \nmeans disabusing skeptics and opponents alike of cherished mythologies \nthat environmental protection and economic growth are mutually \nexclusive. The irony is both are actually increasingly interdependent \nand will only become more so as the 21st century progresses. Robust \ncompanies dedicated to reducing emissions are proof-positive ``going-\ngreen'' represents a burgeoning sector of our economy, not the drain \nand hindrance we've been led to believe for so many years. This bill \naccommodates for the early actions these companies have taken to reduce \nemissions.\n  And to their credit--the most progressive U.S. companies have reduced \nemissions even further than required in the Climate Stewardship and \nInnovation Act. In an act of economic acumen, they are hedging their \nbets by\n\n[[Page S515]]\n\nadopting internal targets. And, these companies are saving money by \nreducing their energy consumption and positioning themselves to compete \nin the growing global market for climate-friendly technologies. Any \ncost-conscious CFO--or forward-thinking CEO for that matter--should \nadmit that to prevent pollution now will most certainly cost less than \ncleaning it up later.\n  The economics of prevention and stewardship resonate more when you \nconsider property that erodes because of rising sea levels, farm land \nthat fails to yield crops and becomes barren and arid, and revenue \nopportunities squandered because of dwindling fishing stocks caused by \nhotter temperatures. These represent real costs to the bottom line--not \nto mention irreparable damage to our health and quality of life. We \nprocrastinate on these policy imperatives at the peril of both our \ncountry and our planet. Congress is quite facile at deferring costs to \nthe future, often with enormous consequences. No one was more aware of \nthis tendency than Abraham Lincoln, who--in his Message to Congress in \n1862--offered this challenge to the legislative branch, ``The dogmas of \nthe quiet past are inadequate to the stormy present. The occasion is \npiled high with difficulty, and we must rise with the occasion. As our \ncase is new, so we must think anew, and act anew.''\n  We have a choice between an ever more treacherous path of greater \nenvironmental damage and economic harm, or an upward path to a better \nfuture for our planet, and enhanced competitiveness for our industries. \nI urge my colleagues to join with those of us who believe we should \nmove forward by taking appropriate actions now for global warming \nreductions so that we may leave behind a better environment that was \nbestowed to us.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, more than 18 months ago I stood in this \nChamber to express my support for a previous version of the Climate \nStewardship and Innovation Act, and to urge the support of my \ncolleagues. On that day, I said that there are moments when we have the \nchance to take a new course that will leave our children a better \nworld. However, in the interim, Congress has chosen not to act. In the \ninterim, our Nation, and others around the world, continued to release \ngreenhouse gases into the atmosphere at increasing rates.\n  With each passing year, as we choose not to act, the air we breathe \ncontains ever more carbon dioxide, resulting from our use of fossil \nfuels. If we continue on our present course, human endeavors could \ncause a rise in temperature equivalent to the change between the last \nice age and today. The decisions we make now on greenhouse gas \nemissions will have effects in the second half of this century, and \ninto the next. The consequences of our inaction will be devastating for \nour children and grandchildren, and will be even worse for the poorest \nglobal populations.\n  Climate change is not reflected just in the fact that last year was \nthe warmest year on record in the United States, or in the recent \nproposal that polar bears be listed as an endangered species because \nArctic ice is melting. Those are just symptoms. The bigger problem is \nthat global climate change will, in this century and the next, have \neffects on human health, on access to water, and on production of food.\n  Our inaction may reflect a misunderstanding of scientific evidence, \neven though such evidence accumulates, year by year, showing that \nclimate change is a global threat resulting from human activity. \nPerhaps our inaction betrays an uncertainty about our ability to \naddress this problem. Or perhaps our inaction is simply a result of \ninertia, a lack of political will in facing a difficult problem.\n  Whatever the basis of our inaction, I am convinced that we must now \nact. Every delay makes a solution more distant, and more difficult. I \nam also convinced that the best solution takes the form of the Climate \nStewardship Act, which addresses the real costs and consequences of our \ncurrent patterns of energy use, establishing a framework for a market-\nbased solution which relies on American will, ingenuity, and \ntechnological expertise to mitigate climate change.\n  This bill establishes limits for greenhouse gas emissions well into \nthe 21st century. To remain below these limits, the bill encourages the \nmarket to determine how best to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, \nrewarding cost-effective approaches using a system of tradeable \nallowances.\n  Revenues generated from this program will be used to help the \nindustries and individuals most affected by the limits. These revenues \nwill also fund research and development of efficient energy \ntechnologies, such as green buildings, high-power batteries for hybrid \ncars, safer nuclear plants to generate electricity, large scale \nbiofuels facilities, renewable sources, and advanced coal power plants \nthat capture the carbon dioxide they generate. This program will spur \nAmerican innovation, creating business opportunities as new markets are \ncreated in low-carbon technologies and services.\n  I am proud to join Senators Lieberman and McCain in introducing this \nlegislation, and I urge others to join this effort. I also look forward \nto the support of the American people as we move together to confront \nthe very real threat to future generations of global climate change.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN (for himself and Mr. Kennedy):\n  S. 282. A bill to-amend the Higher Education Act of 1965 to reduce \nover a 5-year period the interest rate on certain undergraduate student \nloans; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to \nsupport the ``College Student Relief Act.'' In 1958, spurred on by the \nlaunch of the Russian satellite, Sputnik, Congress passed the National \nDefense Education Act in order to ensure that through education, the \nUnited States would stay ahead of the Soviet Union in the space race. \nBecause of the low interest loans offered through the National Defense \nEducation Act, countless students were able to obtain a college \neducation and help move America forward. I could never have attended \nGeorgetown University and law school were it not for the government \nloans.\n  It is unquestionable that higher education plays a critical role in \nthe future of our children. Over the course of a lifetime, a college \ngraduate will earn over $1 million more than those without college \ndegrees. In addition to the individual benefits of a college education, \ninvesting in and producing more college-educated Americans is vital to \nour Nation's growth. Economists estimate that the increase in the \neducation level of the United States labor force between 1915 and 1999 \ndirectly resulted in at least 23 percent of the overall growth in U.S. \nproductivity. To keep America at the economic forefront in the 21st \nCentury, we must recognize the value of investing in higher education \nand provide students with the assistance they need so that they can \ncompete in the global economy.\n  As college costs continue to skyrocket, attaining a college education \nis becoming an even bigger hurdle for many American students. Millions \nof eligible students never even make it to college because of financial \nbarriers. Over the last five years, tuition, fees, room and board at \nfour-year public colleges and universities increased by 42 percent. \nMore than two-thirds of four- year college students now borrow to pay \nfor school, and their average debt more than doubled between 1993 and \n2004. According to the Congressional Advisory Committee on Student \nFinancial Assistance, financial barriers will prevent 4.4 million high \nschool graduates from attending a four-year public college over the \nnext decade, and prevent another two million eligible students from \nattending college at all.\n  Last year, Republicans missed an opportunity to prevent higher \nstudent loan interest rates from going into effect. On July 1, 2006, \nstudent loan interest rates went from a 5.3 percent variable rate to a \n6.8 percent fixed rate for student borrowers. We can address this \nsituation and take the first step towards helping millions of college \nstudents across the Nation realize the American dream--achieving a \ncollege education.\n  That's why I'm introducing the College Student Relief Act of 2007. \nThe bill cuts interest rates on subsidized student loans in half and \nwill help lower the interest rates for 5.5 million college students. \nThe bill phases in interest rate cuts over five years, from a 6.8 \npercent fixed rate to a 3.4 percent fixed\n\n[[Page S516]]\n\nrate for undergraduate borrowers of new subsidized student loans. Once \nfully implemented, these cuts will save the typical borrower--with \n$13,800 in need-based loan debt--approximately $4,400 in interest costs \nover the life of his or her loan.\n  Smart, hard-working kids deserve a chance to go as far as their \ntalents will take them; however, large education debt changes the \nfuture in ways that cannot be quantified. Career plans are changed. \nLifestyles are restricted. Home and auto purchases are put on hold. \nFamily plans may be delayed to accommodate debt payments.\n  Let me share a few stories with you that illustrate the effects of \ncarrying large education debt. When Stacie Odhner-Sibley and her \nhusband made the decision ten years ago that she would go back to \nschool and obtain her Bachelor's degree in order to provide a better \nfuture for their family, she was the first in her family to go to \ncollege. Fast forward to today. Stacie now has her Bachelor's degree \nand a Master's degree in School Guidance and Counseling. While this is \nthe happy part of Stacie's story, the sad part is that Stacie and her \nhusband are considering uprooting their three children and selling \ntheir home because they can't afford both student loans and a mortgage. \nThe saddest part of Stacie's story is that the money her family would \nrealize from the sale of their home won't even pay off the student \nloans. It will only be enough to take off some of the financial \npressure they otherwise would be feeling.\n  Katie Miller is a student at Southern Illinois University at \nEdwardsville. Katie's story is not uncommon. She works part-time and \nher parents are unable to provide her with any financial assistance. \nShe is extremely grateful for the financial aid she receives and \nrecognizes that without it, she would not be able to go to school even \nthough she is struggling to pay for food, insurance and other basic \nnecessities.\n  Summer Boyd is an elementary teacher in Decatur, IL. She graduated \nfrom Millikin University in 2003 with $65,000 in student loans. As with \nKatie, Summer's parents could not afford to help pay for her college \neducation. So, for the next 25 years, Summer will be paying over $500 \neach month toward her student loans. She doesn't mind paying for her \neducation; however, the heavy burden of her student loan debt is \nalready affecting her future plans. She and her husband want to have \nchildren, but for the time being, they must continue to scrape by each \nmonth and can only hope to someday be able to afford children.\n  Young people like Stacie, Katie and Summer should not face such high \npenalties because they had the desire and determination to pursue \nhigher education.\n  An investment in our children's education is an investment in our \nNation's future. We must do what we can today to ensure that America \nremains a global leader in the future. Our Nation will be richer--not \njust economically, but also culturally and socially--for having given a \nhigher priority to making college affordable.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 282\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend titles 10 and 14, United States Code, to \nprovide for the use of gold in the metal content of the Medal of Honor; \nto the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, this week Cpl Jason Dunham was posthumously \nrecognized for his bravery in Iraq with the Congressional Medal of \nHonor. Corporal Dunham exemplified the valor and selflessness of an \nAmerican service member. As a leader of his Marine Corps rifle squad \nCorporal Dunham encountered an Iraqi insurgent along the Iraq/Syria \nborder. Corporal Dunham wrestled the insurgent to the ground when he \nbecome aware that he was about to throw a grenade he had been hiding. \nWithout a moment's hesitation, Corporal Dunham sacrificed himself and \nthrew himself on the grenade, using his body as a shield for the rest \nof his unit. He died from the wounds he sustained from the blast--but \nhis act of heroism saved two Marine lives.\n  Today I reintroduce a bill that would ensure that this Nation more \nappropriately honors our veterans and soldiers like Corporal Dunham. \nThis bill requires the use of 90 percent gold in the Congressional \nMedal of Honor instead of gold-plated brass, as is currently used.\n  The Medal of Honor is the highest award our country bestows for valor \nin action against an enemy force. These are ordinary soldiers who \nperformed extraordinary deeds in battle, often giving what President \nLincoln termed ``the final full measure'' in doing so.\n  Corporal Dunham in receiving this honor joins many other noble \nservice members. This is the medal won by Marine Corps pilot, CPT Joe \nFoss, who in less than 30 days of combat over Guadalcanal, shot down 23 \nenemy planes, three in one engagement, and is credited with turning-\nback an entire Japanese bombing mission before it could drop a single \nbomb.\n  This is the medal won by Army PVT Edward Moskala who set aside his \npersonal safety one night on the island of Okinawa to assault two \nmachine gun nests, provide cover for his unit as it withdrew, and \nrescue fallen comrades amidst a hail of enemy fire before finally \nsuffering a mortal wound.\n  This is the medal won by PMFC Francis Pierce, Jr., who on the island \nof Iwo Jima exposed himself repeatedly to enemy fire to save the lives \nof Marines he accompanied, traversing open terrain to rescue comrades \nand assaulting enemy positions that endangered his wounded comrades.\n  This is the medal won by Air Force CPT Hilliard A. Wilbanks who made \nrepeated strafing runs over an advancing enemy element near Dalat, \nRepublic of Vietnam on February 24, 1967. Captain Wilbanks' aircraft, \nit should be noted, was neither armed nor armored. He made the assaults \nby sticking his rifle out the window and flying low over the enemy. His \naction saved the lives of friendly forces, but it cost him his own.\n  Corporal Dunham has now been added to this esteemed group of heroes. \nTheir brave acts are more than just inspirational stories, they are \nsacrifices made by real men and women that serve their country with \npride.\n  This is a time in history when we are asking more and more from our \nmen and women in uniform. They answer this call every time with honor \nand sacrifice. We should make the medals we award them for these acts \ncommensurate with their dedication.\n  Regrettably, the medal itself, though gold in color, is actually \nbrass plated with gold. It costs only about $30 to craft the award \nitself. As a veteran I recognize the value of the Medal does not lie in \nits composition but the sacrifices and service that merited it. \nHowever, this is a small way that we can express our gratitude to these \nheroes by giving them a medal that shows the depth of our appreciation.\n  Compared with other medals, the Congressional Medal of Honor, which \nis meant to be one of the country's highest honors, falls woefully \nshort. Congress awards foreign dignitaries, famous singers, and other \ncivilians, with medals that cost up to $30,000. For our\n\n[[Page S517]]\n\nveterans that give so much of themselves to this country you will agree \nthat we can do better.\n  Put simply, this legislation will forge a medal more worthy of the \nesteem with which the nation holds those few who have earned the \nCongressional Medal of Honor through valor and heroism beyond compare.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WARNER (for himself, Mr. Cardin, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Webb, \n        Mr. Casey, and Mr. Rockefeller):\n  S. 289. A bill to establish the Journey Through Hallowed Ground \nNational Heritage Area, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Journey \nThrough Hallowed Ground National Heritage Area Act, S. 289, a piece of \nlegislation that seeks to designate some of Virginia's, indeed \nAmerica's, most historic and beautiful lands as a national heritage \narea.\n  As I am sure my colleagues are aware, national heritage areas are \nintended to encourage residents, government agencies, nonprofit groups, \nand private partners to collaboratively plan and implement programs and \nprojects to recognize, preserve, and celebrate many of America's \ndefining landscapes. Today, there are 37 national heritage areas spread \nout across the United States.\n  In Virginia, we are lucky enough to have a landscape that is worthy \nof the recognition and celebration that a national heritage area \ndesignation would afford it. Stretching through four states, and \ngenerally following the path of the Old Carolina Road, today's Route \n15, the Journey Through Hallowed Ground is home to some of our Nation's \ngreatest historic, cultural, and natural treasures. The region's riches \nread like a star-studded list of American History: Monticello, \nMontpelier, Manassas, Gettysburg. The list goes on. In all, there are \neight presidential homes, 15 National Historic Landmarks, 47 historic \ndistricts, and the largest collection of Revolutionary and Civil War \nbattlefields in the country. It is an area, literally, where America \nhappened.\n  With the help and tutelage of the National Park Service, this \nproposed heritage area would be managed by the Journey Through Hallowed \nGround Partnership, a nonprofit entity whose sole purpose is to trumpet \nthe magnificence of the hallowed ground's offerings. I am confident \nthat the Partnership will be tremendous promoters and wonderful \nstewards of the resources within the Route 15 corridor. Already, the \npartnership has spent years heralding the Region's spectacular natural \nand historical resources, and they have worked hard to get this area \nthe designation and recognition it deserves.\n  Mr. President, no area in America could possibly be more deserving of \nthe national heritage area designation than the region affectionately \nknown as the Journey Through Hallowed Ground. Therefore, I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in support of this legislation, and I thank you \nfor this opportunity to speak on behalf of the Journey Through Hallowed \nGround National Heritage Area Act.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I am proud to support the Journey Through \nHallowed Ground National Heritage Area Act. Today, that bill is being \nintroduced by my esteemed colleague, Senator Warner, along with myself \nand other Members of the Senate. A bipartisan group also has introduced \nthis bill in the House of Representatives.\n  This bill will designate the corridor that runs between Gettysburg, \nPA, and Charlottesville, VA, as a National Heritage Area. Within this \nproposed area, there are numerous sites of historic importance, \nincluding eight Presidential homes. This hallowed ground is a \ngeographic area of immense beauty, history, and cultural significance, \nwhich will be protected under the terms of this bill.\n  For me, this hallowed ground has special personal significance, \ndrawing me back to thoughts of my ancestors who settled and worked much \nof this land centuries before. I cannot visit this part of the country \nwithout harkening back to the tough, resilient women on buckboard \nwagons, hard men with rifles walking alongside, and kids tending cattle \nas they made their way down the mud trail called the Wilderness Road.\n  As I wrote in my book ``Born Fighting,'' my ancestors--the Scots-\nIrish--were a proud, adventurous people who left their native lands for \nthe early American colonies in the 18th century. The majority of these \ncourageous pioneers settled along the Appalachian Mountains from \nPennsylvania southward into Virginia and beyond. Ultimately, they \nmigrated westward, in the process helping to shape America's \nindependent, individualistic, unbridled culture.\n  This bill will help preserve the legacy of these early settlers for \nfuture generations. Moreover, this bill is a truly patriotic piece of \nlegislation--one that will help us capture the rich diversity and \nhistoric experiences of our American forefathers and mothers.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. MURKOWSKI (for herself and Mr. Stevens):\n  S. 290. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \na tax credit to rural primary health providers; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the ``Rural \nPhysicians' Relief Act of 2007.'' This important legislation will bring \nneeded assistance to physicians who provide primary health services to \nrural America.\n  Physicians who provide health care in the most rural locations in \nAmerica face challenges unlike their more urban counterparts. Often \ngreat distances, remote locations, limited transportation, and harsh \nclimate--combine to make health care delivery extremely difficult to \nsay the very least. Patient populations are small and spread out across \nextremely remote areas. As a result, many of these areas tend to be the \nmost medically underserved areas in the Nation.\n  In my State of Alaska, a State that is larger than the States of \nCalifornia, Texas and Montana combined, nearly one-quarter of the \nState's population live in communities and villages that are only \nreachable by boat or aircraft. In fact, Alaska has fewer roads than any \nother State--even fewer roads than Rhode Island. And, unlike Rhode \nIsland where over 90 percent of the roads are paved, less than 20 \npercent of the roads are paved in Alaska.\n  This means that approximately 75 percent of Alaskan communities are \nnot connected by road to another community with a hospital. This means \nthat all medical supplies, patients and providers must travel by air.\n  These remote populations tend to be among the poorest in the State. \nAir travel equates to excessively high health care costs--generally 70 \npercent higher than costs in the Lower 48 States. In short, ``rural'' \ntakes on a new definition in Alaska.\n  In Alaska, patient access to health care is exacerbated because our \nState also faces a chilling crisis--we have 25 percent to 30 percent \nfewer physicians than our population needs. In fact, Alaska has one of \nthe smallest numbers of physicians per capita in the country. We need a \nminimum of 500 more doctors just to be at the national average of \nphysicians per capita. An American Medical News article recently \ndeclared Alaska's precarious situation: ``Alaska has long ranked among \nthe worst states in terms of physician supply.''\n  Our physician shortage crisis will only worsen. There is an expected \nretirement of at least 118 physicians in Anchorage alone in the next 10 \nyears. In the 1990s, there were 130 new doctors each year. Now that \nfigure has dropped to only 31 new physicians since 2001. Outside of \nAnchorage, one in every eight physician positions is vacant.\n  Additionally, many physicians are forced out of the Medicare and \nMedicaid programs because reimbursement rates simply do not cover the \ncost to treat those patients. With Alaska's growing population, \nespecially of our elderly, this shortage will lead to the severe health \ncare access crisis for all Alaskans.\n  On top of harsh physical challenges, Alaska's rural population also \nfaces significant human challenges. These rural patient populations are \noften in the greatest need for primary health care services. Heart \ndisease, stroke and other cardiovascular diseases are the leading \ncauses of death in Alaska. Women in our state have higher death rates \nfrom stroke than do women nationally; and mortality among Native\n\n[[Page S518]]\n\nAlaskan women is dramatically on the rise, whereas, it is actually \ndeclining among Caucasian women in the Lower 48. The prevalence of \nchronic disease such as diabetes and even tuberculosis is increasing \nfaster in Alaska than any other state. Each of these health concerns is \nmagnified because access to health care--especially in rural Alaska--\nremains our greatest challenge.\n  The legislation that I introduce today with Senator Stevens seeks to \nlessen this problem. It will both assist physicians who currently \npractice in rural America and will provide an incentive to encourage \nphysicians to practice in these remote and underserved areas. \nSpecifically, it would give a physician who is a primary health \nservices provider a $1,000 tax credit for each month that he/she \nprovides services in a designated ``frontier'' area. Furthermore, \nphysicians who treat a high percentage of patients from frontier areas \nwould also be eligible for the tax credit.\n  My hope is to encourage physicians to practice medicine in rural \nAlaska and throughout rural America. Creating incentives that offset \nthe high cost of providing care in the most remote areas of nation will \ngo far in recruiting physicians to the areas that are most in need of \ntheir services.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. NELSON of Florida (for himself, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Lott, \n        Mr. Vitter, and Mr. Cochran):\n  S. 292. A bill to establish a bipartisan commission on insurance \nreform; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by my \ncolleagues and cosponsors Senators Mary Landrieu, Trent Lott, David \nVitter, and Thad Cochran as we introduce the Commission on Catastrophic \nDisaster Risk and Insurance Act of 2007.\n  As we know all too well, the last few years have brought a \ndevastating cycle of natural catastrophes in the United States. In 2004 \nand 2005, we witnessed a series of powerful hurricanes that caused \nunthinkable human tragedy and property loss. In my own home State of \nFlorida, eight catastrophic storms in 15 months caused more than $31 \nbillion in insured damages. Now Florida is witnessing skyrocketing \ninsurance rates, insurance companies are canceling hundreds of \nthousands of policies, and the State's catastrophe fund is depleted.\n  The inability of the private insurance markets to fully handle the \nfallout from these natural disasters has made our Nation's property and \ncasualty insurance marketplace unstable. This instability has forced \nthe Federal Government to absorb billions of dollars in uninsured \nlosses, at a huge cost to all American taxpayers.\n  Let me be clear--these issues will not just affect Florida or the \ncoastal States. Natural catastrophes can strike anywhere in our \ncountry. In the few decades, major disasters have been declared in \nalmost every State. Congress has struggled with these issues time and \ntime again, but nothing much has gotten accomplished. It's time for a \ncomprehensive approach to solving our Nation's property and casualty \ninsurance issues.\n  This bill would create a Federal commission--made up of a group of \nthe best experts in the Nation--to quickly recommend to Congress the \nbest approach to addressing catastrophic risk insurance. In the 1990s, \nwhen I was Insurance Commissioner for the State of Florida, I created a \nsimilar commission, and within months, the commission acted, and many \nof its key recommendations became State law.\n  We need a comprehensive approach that will make sure the United \nStates is truly prepared for the financial fallout from natural \ndisasters. I know this complicated process won't be easy for us--but \nlet's roll up our shirtsleeves and get it done.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 292\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Commission on Catastrophic \n     Disaster Risk and Insurance Act of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma, which struck the \n     United States in 2005, caused over $200 billion in total \n     economic losses, including insured and uninsured losses.\n       (2) Although private sector insurance is currently \n     available to spread some catastrophe-related losses \n     throughout the Nation and internationally, most experts \n     believe there will be significant insurance and reinsurance \n     shortages, resulting in dramatic rate increases for consumers \n     and businesses, and the unavailability of catastrophe \n     insurance.\n       (3) The Federal Government has provided and will continue \n     to provide billions of dollars and resources to pay for \n     losses from catastrophes, including hurricanes, volcanic \n     eruptions, tsunamis, tornados, and other disasters, at huge \n     costs to American taxpayers.\n       (4) The Federal Government has a critical interest in \n     ensuring appropriate and fiscally responsible risk management \n     of catastrophes. Mortgages require reliable property \n     insurance, and the unavailability of reliable property \n     insurance would make most real estate transactions \n     impossible. In addition, the public health, safety, and \n     welfare demand that structures damaged or destroyed in a \n     catastrophe be reconstructed as soon as possible. Therefore, \n     the inability of the private sector insurance and reinsurance \n     markets to maintain sufficient capacity to enable Americans \n     to obtain property insurance coverage in the private sector \n     endangers the national economy and the public health, safety, \n     and welfare.\n       (5) Multiple proposals have been introduced in the United \n     States Congress over the past decade to address catastrophic \n     risk insurance, including the creation of a national \n     catastrophic reinsurance fund and the revision of the Federal \n     tax code to allow insurers to use tax-deferred catastrophe \n     funds, yet Congress has failed to act on any of these \n     proposals.\n       (6) To the extent the United States faces high risks from \n     catastrophe exposure, essential technical information on \n     financial structures and innovations in the catastrophe \n     insurance market is needed.\n       (7) The most efficient and effective approach to assessing \n     the catastrophe insurance problem in the public policy \n     context is to establish a bipartisan commission of experts to \n     study the management of catastrophic disaster risk, and to \n     require such commission to timely report its recommendations \n     to Congress so that Congress can quickly craft a solution to \n     protect the American people.\n\n     SEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT.\n\n       There is established a bipartisan Commission on \n     Catastrophic Disaster Risk and Insurance (in this Act \n     referred to as the ``Commission'').\n\n     SEC. 4.

Res. 29\n\n       Whereas Reverend Doctor Martin Luther King, Jr. dedicated \n     his life to securing the Nation's fundamental principles of \n     liberty and justice for all citizens;\n       Whereas Dr. King was the leading civil rights advocate of \n     his time, spearheading the civil rights movement in the \n     United States during the 1950s and 1960s, and earned \n     worldwide recognition as an eloquent and articulate \n     spokesperson for equality;\n       Whereas in the face of hatred and violence, Dr. King \n     preached a doctrine of nonviolence and civil disobedience to \n     combat segregation, discrimination, and racial injustice, and \n     believed that each person has the moral capacity to care for \n     other people;\n       Whereas Dr. King awakened the conscience and consciousness \n     of the Nation and used his message of hope to bring people \n     together to build the Beloved Community--a community of \n     justice, at peace with itself;\n       Whereas Dr. King was born on January 15, 1929, and attended \n     segregated public schools in Georgia;\n       Whereas Dr. King began attending Morehouse College in \n     Atlanta, Georgia at the age of 15, and received a B.A. degree \n     in 1948 from Morehouse College, following in the footsteps of \n     both his father and grandfather;\n       Whereas Dr. King received his B.D. in 1951 from Crozer \n     Theological Seminary in Pennsylvania and his Ph.D. in \n     theology in 1955 from Boston University;\n       Whereas in Boston Dr. King met Coretta Scott, his life \n     partner and fellow civil rights activist, and they married on \n     June 18, 1953, and had 2 sons and 2 daughters;\n       Whereas Dr. King was ordained in the Christian ministry in \n     February 1948 at the age of 19 at Ebenezer Baptist Church, in \n     Atlanta, Georgia, and became Assistant Pastor of Ebenezer \n     Baptist Church;\n       Whereas, in 1954, Dr. King accepted the call of Dexter \n     Avenue Baptist Church in Montgomery, Alabama, and was pastor \n     there until November 1959, when he resigned to move back to \n     Atlanta to lead the Southern Christian Leadership Conference;\n       Whereas from 1960 until his death in 1968, Dr. King was \n     again a pastor at Ebenezer Baptist Church, along with his \n     father;\n       Whereas between 1957 and 1968, Dr. King traveled over \n     6,000,000 miles, spoke over 2,500 times, and wrote 5 books \n     and numerous articles, supporting efforts around the Nation \n     to end injustice and bring about social change and \n     desegregation;\n       Whereas Dr. King led the Montgomery bus boycott for 381 \n     days to protest the arrest of Mrs. Rosa Parks and the \n     segregation of the bus system of Montgomery, Alabama, in the \n     first great nonviolent civil rights demonstration of \n     contemporary times in the United States;\n       Whereas during the boycott, Dr. King was arrested and his \n     home was bombed, yet he responded with nonviolence and \n     courage in the face of hatred;\n       Whereas, on November 13, 1956, the Supreme Court of the \n     United States declared the laws requiring segregation in \n     Montgomery's bus system to be unconstitutional, leading to \n     the end of the bus boycott on December 21, 1956;\n       Whereas Dr. King led the March on Washington, D.C. on \n     August 28, 1963, the largest rally of the civil rights \n     movement;\n       Whereas during that march, Dr. King delivered his famous \n     ``I Have A Dream'' speech from the steps of the Lincoln \n     Memorial and before a crowd of over 200,000 people;\n       Whereas Dr. King's ``I Have A Dream'' speech is one of the \n     classic orations in United States history;\n       Whereas Dr. King was a champion of nonviolence, fervently \n     advocating nonviolent resistance as the strategy to end \n     segregation and racial discrimination in the United States;\n       Whereas Dr. King was awarded the 1964 Nobel Peace Prize in \n     recognition for his efforts, and, at the age of 35, was the \n     youngest man to receive the Nobel Peace Prize;\n       Whereas through his work and reliance on nonviolent \n     protest, Dr. King was instrumental in the passage of the \n     Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965;\n       Whereas the work of Dr. King created a basis of \n     understanding and respect and helped communities, and the \n     Nation as a whole, to act cooperatively and courageously to \n     achieve tolerance, justice, and equality between people;\n       Whereas, on the evening of April 4, 1968, Dr. King was \n     assassinated while standing on the balcony of his motel room \n     in Memphis, Tennessee, where he was to lead sanitation \n     workers in protest against low wages and intolerable working \n     conditions;\n       Whereas in 1968 Representative John Conyers first \n     introduced legislation to establish a national holiday \n     honoring Dr. King;\n       Whereas Coretta Scott King led a massive campaign to \n     establish Dr. King's birthday as a national holiday;\n       Whereas in 1983 Congress passed and President Ronald Reagan \n     signed legislation establishing Martin Luther King, Jr. Day;\n       Whereas in 2007 Martin Luther King, Jr. Day is celebrated \n     in more than 100 countries;\n       Whereas in remembering Dr. King we also honor his wife and \n     indispensable partner, Coretta Scott King, a woman of quiet \n     courage and great dignity who marched alongside her husband \n     and became an international advocate for peace and human \n     rights;\n       Whereas Mrs. King, who had been actively engaged in the \n     civil rights movement as a politically and socially conscious \n     young woman, continued after her husband's death to lead the \n     Nation toward greater justice and equality for all, traveling \n     the world advocating for racial and economic justice, peace \n     and nonviolence, women's and children's rights, gay rights, \n     religious freedom, full employment, health care, and \n     education until her death on January 30, 2006;\n       Whereas the values of faith, compassion, courage, truth, \n     justice, and nonviolence that guided Dr. and Mrs. King's \n     dream for the

and live out the true meaning of its creed: `We hold \n     these truths to be self-evident; that all men are created \n     equal' ''; and\n       Whereas Dr. King's voice is silenced today, but on the \n     national holiday honoring Dr. King and throughout the year, \n     the people of the United States should remember his message, \n     recommit to his goal of a free and just nation, and consider \n     each person's responsibility to other people: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved by the Senate, That the Senate--\n       (1) observes and celebrates the national holiday honoring \n     Reverend Doctor Martin Luther King, Jr.;\n       (2) honors Dr. King's example of nonviolence, courage, \n     compassion, dignity, and public service;\n       (3) pledges to advance
