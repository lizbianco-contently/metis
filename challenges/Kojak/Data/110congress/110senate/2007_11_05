Mr. President, today the Senate will be in a period of \nmorning business until 3 p.m. Senators are allowed to speak for up to \n10 minutes each. Then, at 3 p.m. today, the Senate will proceed to the \nfarm bill. Once the managers offer the substitute amendment, the bill \nwill be up for debate only for the remainder of today's session. That \nis the previous order that was entered by the Chair. As I previously \nannounced, there will be no rollcall votes today as a result of what we \nwere able to accomplish last week.\n  On Tuesday, the House is expected to vote on overriding the \nPresident's veto of the water resources bill, which is a very \nbipartisan bill which passed overwhelmingly both in the House and the \nSenate. I anticipate the Senate will debate that veto message sometime \nthis week, and a vote on overriding could be as early as Wednesday.\n  I would remind Members that the President of France will address a \njoint meeting of Congress Wednesday morning at 11 a.m.\n  Also this week, the Senate has a lot of other work to do. I have had \na lengthy conversation, just a few minutes ago, with the Republican \nleader. He is aware of the many obligations we have, and it is going to \nbe difficult to get our work done this week. We can get it done, but \nthe reason I mention this, I know Veterans Day is coming and people \nhave a very busy schedule Saturday, Sunday, and Monday. I know I do, \nand I am sure, like everyone else, they also are obligated. But there \nare certain things we have to finish. We are going to be out of here \nfor the Thanksgiving recess to go back to our States, to our families, \nbut there is work that obligates us to stay until we finish, and we \nonly have this week and next week to do that.\n\n\n                             appropriations\n\n  This week, we will receive the conference report for the Veterans and \nLabor, Health, and Education appropriations bill. This legislation was \nagain supported on a bipartisan basis. It provides the greatest funding \nincrease ever to care for our troops and veterans, who have sacrificed \nso much for our country. It repairs the woeful conditions we have seen \nat Walter Reed and at other medical centers. It helps reduce the logjam \nthat is keeping thousands of veterans from receiving health care \nbecause the VA has been underfunded during the Bush years.\n  This bill makes critical investments in America's children and \nsubstantially increases the Federal financial commitment to medical \nresearch for a multitude of diseases, which the Bush budget goes \nbackward on rather than increasing.\n  This legislation passed the Senate overwhelmingly because they are \ngood priorities for America. Unfortunately, the President has said he \nis going to veto this bill. That is unfortunate because this is the \nsame President who has underfunded and shortchanged our troops, our \nveterans, and other domestic priorities here at home. He argues this \nbill costs too much. Yet, in the same breath, he reported last week \nthat there is $100 billion being spent in\n\n[[Page S13740]]\n\nIraq on infrastructure. And only this much of it is still standing. \nMost of the money has been wasted. What was attempted to be constructed \nhas been destroyed or construction has been so faulty it simply is not \nusable. The President is wrong.\n\n  It appears the Republicans will attempt to separate the VA portion of \nthe bill. I think that is unfortunate. The minority supported the VA \nbill and the Labor bill overwhelmingly, and it would be a shame to put \nup roadblocks to their passage. So I urge all my colleagues to reject \nthat effort so we can pass and send this crucial legislation to the \nPresident as soon as possible.\n\n\n                             The Farm Bill\n\n  The farm bill. Chairman Harkin, Senator Baucus, and Ranking Members \nChambliss and Grassley deserve a lot of credit for working among their \ncaucuses to write the bill we are debating this week. In the 24 years I \nhave been in the Congress, first in the House and now in the Senate--\nactually, 25 years--no farm bill has embodied as much reform as this \none. There are some who say this bill doesn't go far enough in the \ndirection of reform. To those critics, it should be clear there will be \nan opportunity for Senators to offer amendments during debate. Would I \npersonally like more reform? Of course I would. But I would like to \nfocus on the positive and forward-looking elements that lie at the \nheart of this bill.\n  This bill saves billions of dollars by reforming existing programs, \nwhich allows new investment to expand food and nutrition programs for \nfamilies, the elderly, and the disabled, as well as an expansion of the \nfresh fruits and vegetables programs to all 50 States to improve the \nhealth and wellness of America's children. It invests more than $4 \nbillion in conservation programs to protect wetlands, grasslands, and \nworking farms. More than 60 percent of this bill is simply nutrition \nprograms.\n  This bill takes us a step closer to the vital goal of energy \nindependence, with more than $1 billion for programs that are \nenvironmentally responsible while growing the farming economy. We \nimport about 70 percent of our oil. We don't import 70 percent of our \nfood. One reason we don't is because we have farm programs that work. \nCould they be made better? Of course they could be. But this bill does \ndo some extremely important things.\n  It responds to the urgent need for permanent disaster assistance, \nwhich will help farmers respond and recover from future unavoidable \ndisasters. It invests about $2 billion in specialty crops. What are \nspecialty crops? Strawberries, apples, and those programs that are so \nimportant to our country, so that it stops us from having to import as \nmuch as we would have to if we didn't have these programs. But with \nweather changes, some of these farmers have had tremendous losses from \nwhich they have not been able to recover. It offers a reasonable \ncompromise on country-of-origin labeling, and it improves competition \nin the livestock industry.\n  There will be a number of amendments offered during the floor debate. \nSenators Dorgan and Grassley will offer an amendment on payment limits. \nSenators Lautenberg and Lugar will offer an alternative farm bill \namendment. Senator McConnell and I understand these amendments are \nimportant to Members on both sides of the aisle, and we will work \ntogether to ensure ample time is given for consideration.\n  I am confident and hopeful that this process will result in a truly \nbipartisan bill which will support our agricultural communities, \npromote a cleaner environment, and grow our economy. But I do say and \nalert everybody to this fact: We have had a really good legislative \nsession. Once we get to a bill, we have basically offered amendments on \nmost every bill. I think this bill is going to have trouble with that. \nWe have to complete our work by next Friday, so we will make sure the \namendments correctly relate to this bill and everybody will have an \nopportunity to offer those. We will do our very best to see that is the \ncase. But this bill is a tax bill, and there could be a lot of \nmischievous amendments offered if it were an open amendment process. I \nthink, with it being late in this year's session of Congress, everyone \nunderstands we can't do that. We have work we must complete.\n  The farm bill is a very bipartisan bill. I think we could seek \ncloture on the bill right now and probably do a pretty good job because \nit is really a bipartisan bill. I don't want to have to do it now, but \nI do want everyone to know we are not going to have an open amendment \nprocess, and I have explained that to the Republican leader.\n\n\n                                Pakistan\n\n  Mr. President, this weekend we have seen a crisis unfold in Pakistan. \nIt is an ongoing crisis which has become much more difficult. A leader \nwhom the administration considered a partner in the fight against \nterrorism and extremism has taken steps away from the path of \ndemocracy, and he has suspended fundamental human rights in the \nprocess. I have had great hope for Pakistan. Senator Daschle and I took \na trip to that part of the world right after Musharraf took power, and \nwe were impressed with him. We came back to the United States, and the \nState Department had told President Clinton he shouldn't go to \nPakistan. He was already headed for India. We prevailed upon him to go \nto Pakistan, and I am glad the President did go to Pakistan. But things \nhaven't worked out the way I would have hoped.\n\n  This unfolding crisis must be watched carefully, and we must be \nprepared to respond to protect our security and our national interests. \nI hope all sides will show restraint. Musharraf must keep the promise \nhe made when Senator Daschle and I met with him and when he took power \nalmost 8 years ago--to put Pakistan back on a path toward democracy.\n  I call upon General Musharraf to return to the constitutional rule of \nlaw, release the lawyers and other peaceful protestors he has \nimprisoned, and restore the path to free and fair elections as soon as \npossible.\n  This situation is also a reminder of why we must change the course in \nIraq. We have been so focused on Iraq that we have had this situation \ndevelop in Israel with the Palestinians. I was stunned this morning to \nhear the Secretary of State on the news say this is our first meeting, \nthe one that is going to take place in Annapolis. That isn't anything \nshe should boast about.\n  For 7 years, this administration basically ignored the crisis we have \nhad in the Middle East. We have a bad situation in Iran that we have \nignored--no diplomacy, only threats of war. We have this intractable \ncivil war in Iraq which is ongoing and now made more complicated as a \nresult of what is going on in northern Iraq with the Kurds. We have not \nfocused on our diplomacy. Look what has happened in Pakistan because we \nplaced all our emphasis on a person rather than on a country. By \nstaying so bogged down in the Iraq civil war, President Bush has made \nit harder to respond to the Pakistani problem and other challenges \nthroughout the world.\n  The Iraq war leaves Secretary Rice and other officials responsible \nfor the Middle East and South Asia with no strategic reserve to respond \nto humanitarian and other crisis situations. We are reminded that, \nwhile the administration has been focused on Iraq, it has failed to \ncraft an effective strategy for eliminating what a recent National \nIntelligence Estimate described as an al-Qaida safe haven in the \nAfghanistan-Pakistan border regions, and it has failed to catch Osama \nbin Laden or his No. 2--Zawahiri.\n  So today I also call upon President Bush to conduct an expedited end-\nto-end review of his national security strategy as it relates to the \nwar on terror and Pakistan, including a review of U.S. aid to Pakistan \nand how we are going to get our troops out of Iraq. I hope President \nBush will take a good look at the costs and missed opportunities caused \nby his stay-the-course approach in Iraq and take steps to craft a more \neffective strategy for addressing the threats and challenges America \nfaces across the globe.\n\n\n                           Order of Procedure\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that time for morning business \nbe a full hour.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/05/senate-section/article/S13740-1", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13740]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I have the honor of serving on our \nJudiciary Committee, which is charged with the responsibility of \nrecommending to this full body whether to confirm Judge Mukasey as the \nnext Attorney General of the United States. In that capacity I have had \nthe chance to sit through the confirmation hearings at which Judge \nMukasey testified before our committee for 2 days. I chaired the third \npanel of independent witnesses and had a chance to question national \nexperts in regard to the issues that I think are important and that \nmust be met by our next Attorney General. I had the opportunity to \npersonally meet with Judge Mukasey in my office to go over the \npriorities of the Department of Justice and how he would try to reverse \nsome of the problems in that Department. I had the chance to \nspecifically ask written questions to the nominee and got responses on \nthose written questions.\n  I must tell you, first, I do believe Judge Mukasey is an honorable \nperson. He has a distinguished record of public service, and he would \nrepresent a refreshing change within the Department of Justice. He has \nthe ability to restore morale and traditional professionalism, \nparticularly among the career attorneys at the Department of Justice.\n  But one of the critical issues in evaluating who should be our next \nAttorney General is whether that individual will exercise the \nindependence that is so required by the Attorney General of the United \nStates; in short, whether he will represent the people of our Nation \nand not just the President of the United States.\n  We all know the record of the former Attorney General, Alberto \nGonzales. We know about how partisan politics interfered with the \nselection and promotion of career attorneys at the Department of \nJustice. We all now know the story of the firing of the U.S. attorneys \nand how it appears that partisan politics in criminal investigations--\ncriminal investigations--may have interfered with the operation of the \nDepartment of Justice. So independence is a critically important factor \nin the next person to be the Attorney General of the United States.\n  Because of Judge Mukasey's response to the questions relating to \nwaterboarding, I have concern about his independence. Judge Mukasey \nrefused to say that waterboarding is torture. In reply to questions \nthat were asked, he responded that he would use independent judgment as \nto what constitutes torture. He said he would prosecute anyone who \nviolated our laws. He said, in fact, if his views conflicted with those \nof the President of the United States in a fundamental way, and if he \nwere unable to reconcile those differences, he would leave the office \nrather than compromise his views.\n  Let me read three questions I asked of the Attorney General nominee. \nI asked: As Attorney General, would you order the Justice Department to \nprosecute individuals who, under 18 U.S.C 2340 and 2340(a), committed \nacts of torture?\n  Judge Mukasey's answer:\n\n       The Department of Justice has an obligation to bring \n     prosecutions to enforce all valid criminal statutes and, as I \n     explained during the hearing, torture is prohibited by \n     federal law.\n\n  I then asked the nominee: Do you believe that any ``exceptional \ncircumstances'' exist that would justify torture?\n  His answer was no.\n  I then asked: As Attorney General, would you authorize the use of \ntorture in any circumstance?\n  Once again, his answer was no.\n  I cannot understand why Judge Mukasey will not tell us clearly that \nwaterboarding is illegal under our laws. The fact that he leaves open \nthat waterboarding could be permitted as an interrogation technique has \nme very concerned.\n  Judge Mukasey now acknowledges he understands what is generally meant \nby waterboarding. I gave him the benefit of the doubt during the \nhearing. He said: I am not familiar with the technique.\n  That is difficult to understand but--OK. He then had time to reflect \nand learn about waterboarding as generally understood, waterboarding \nthat has been condemned for literally hundreds of years--since the \nSpanish Inquisition. He now understands what is generally meant be \nwaterboarding. But during the confirmation hearing and in follow-up \nquestions he would not rule out the potential use. Questions asked \nduring the confirmation hearing did not ask about a specific technique \nthat may have been authorized by the President for interrogating \ndetainees. That is not what was asked. The question that was asked is \nabout waterboarding as generally understood. It was not a hypothetical \nquestion.\n  Waterboarding has been condemned by the United States. The United \nStates prosecuted Japanese soldiers for waterboarding as a war crime \nafter World War II. We brought charges as war crimes for those who \nwould try to use that torture technique against Americans.\n  In 2005, the Congress passed the McCain amendment which prohibits the \nuse of cruel, inhumane, and degrading treatment and punishment of \npersons under the detention, custody, and control of the U.S. \nGovernment. We also then required that the Army must use the field \nmanual while interrogating detainees.\n  In 2006, the Army Field Manual specifically prohibited waterboarding. \nDuring our final panel of witnesses, I had a chance to question Admiral \nHutson, who has a very distinguished record of service to our country--\nformer Navy Judge Advocate General, senior uniformed legal adviser to \nthe Secretary of the Navy and the Chief of Naval Operations. So we had \na chance to talk about waterboarding. He said waterboarding is one of \nthe most iconic examples of torture. It was devised during the Spanish \nInquisition. Its use has been repudiated for centuries.\n  Admiral Hutson said we look to the Attorney General as our chief law \nenforcement officer. He has to be absolutely unequivocal as to what \ntorture is and is not. We need clarity from our principal leaders.\n  So it appears to me that Judge Mukasey was yielding to the White \nHouse pressure on waterboarding in answering the questions of our \ncommittee. I find that very troubling. I am looking for an Attorney \nGeneral who will exercise independent judgment as to what the law of \nour country is, and that no one is above our law.\n  On November 1, 2007, President Bush implied if Judge Mukasey answered \nthe questions on waterboarding, he would give ``terrorists a window \ninto which techniques we may use and which ones we may not use.'' I \nwant the President of the United States and the Attorney General of the \nUnited States to tell the world, unequivocally, that the United States \nwill not permit the use of torture. I am not clear about the President. \nWe all remember his signing statements to the McCain amendment, which \nleaves questions as to whether torture could be allowed under some \ncircumstances. Now we are not clear, with Judge Mukasey's answers, as \nto whether waterboarding could be permitted under some circumstances as \na form of torture.\n\n  I think it is absolutely clear our leaders must make it apparent to \nall the United States will not use torture, nor will it ever tolerate \nany other country using torture or any individuals using torture \nagainst an American. If a foreign agent attempts to use waterboarding, \nas it is generally understood, or any other form of torture against an \nAmerican, I want our country to use every means at its disposal to hold \nthat offender accountable.\n  On November 1 the President also said Judge Mukasey could not ``go on \nthe record about the details of a classified program he has not been \nbriefed on.'' I agree with the President of the United States. Judge \nMukasey was not asked about specific practices of a classified program. \nHe was requested to give information about waterboarding as generally \nunderstood. He had an obligation to answer that question.\n  The 9/11 Commission, in one of its recommendations to Congress, said \nthe\n\n[[Page S13742]]\n\nUnited States should engage its friends to develop a common approach \ntoward the detention and humane treatment of captured terrorists. \nInstead, we have gone it alone. We have not sought the advice of the \ninternational community, and we are paying a heavy price for the manner \nin which we are proceeding. We are losing our support internationally \nas it relates to how we treat detainees. We are losing our ability as \nan international leader, as the leader in fighting for human rights \nadvancements throughout the world. We are losing our leadership and \ncredibility on this issue.\n  I serve as the Senate cochair of the U.S. Helsinki Commission and \ndelegate to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. \nThe OSCE-Helsinki process was started in 1975 between the countries in \nEurope, Central Asia, Canada, and the United States. It is best known \nfor its human rights dimensions. It fought during the Soviet Union \ndays, behind the Iron Curtain--fought to open the process and to defend \nhuman rights and to stand against torture. Today we are fighting in the \nemerging democracies to make it clear the human rights of all people \nmust be respected, and torture cannot be permitted while we are being \nquestioned by the Organization for Security for Cooperation in Europe \nas to what we are doing.\n  I am having a hard time finding the right answers, particularly on \nthe issue of torture. As I said at the beginning, Judge Mukasey is a \ngood person and an honest man. On the critical issue of standing up to \nthis administration as an independent adviser against torture, I have \nmy doubts. For that reason, I will be voting against his confirmation \nin the Judiciary Committee tomorrow.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Florida is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, the subject about which the \nSenator from Maryland speaks is a subject of enormous gravity to this \ncountry. We have been laboring with this issue in the Intelligence \nCommittee. The issue is coming to a head with regard to this nomination \nfor Attorney General. Clearly, the policy of this country has to be, \nclearly: There can be no torture.\n  At the same time, we have a world out there with a great deal of bad \nguys who are trying to do harm. It is important for us, when they are \nin our custody, that we get their cooperation in order to get the \ninformation in order to protect our country. How to strike that balance \nwith no torture while still able to adequately get the information in \nthe debriefing sessions--or interrogation, if you will--is the delicate \nbalance this country must face and answer that question.\n  America is a beacon of light to the world. We have to be different. \nThe people who crafted that Constitution of ours said we are going to \nbe different from the rest of the world, and we are going to protect \nfreedom of speech and of religion and of assembly and of the press. We \nare going to protect our citizens from intrusion into their privacy by \nthe Government, unless there is a check and balance of a separate \nbranch of Government, a judge in the judicial branch, granting an order \ncalled a warrant so the Government can invade the privacy of the \ncitizen.\n  All of these things are under assault because of the abuses we have \nseen in this administration in the last 6 years. Normally, there would \nnot be the abuses, but there are. That is what brings a lot of \nnecessarily delicate issues into the open, issues we would much prefer \nto be deciding privately, without the full glare of sunshine, if, in \nfact, the Government was obeying the law.\n  But that has not been the case. Thus, again, as the Senator from \nMaryland points out, we are coming to another very delicate situation; \nthis time with regard to the nomination of a very good man, as the \nSenator says.\n  But will he act unlike the previous Attorney General did? Will he act \nas the lawyer for the people instead of the lawyer for the President? \nTherein it makes it all the more difficult in some of the decisions we \nare making.\n\n\n                             global warming\n\n  I came here to speak about another subject, that is another one that \nis exceptionally important to the future not only of America but the \nfuture of planet Earth. And that is whether this delicate environment \nthat surrounds this planet in an atmosphere is going to go into cardiac \narrest which is going to be irreversible unless we do things now.\n  There is a step in the right direction, and I wish to thank Senator \nLieberman and Senator Warner for their efforts and their hard work in \nintroducing the climate change legislation called America's Climate \nSecurity Act. I am a cosponsor of this act. I am because it is acts \nsuch as this that will start us on a path to try to reverse the \ngreenhouse effect that is happening to the planet.\n  What is the greenhouse effect? It is simply when we start putting \ngreenhouse gases in excess into the atmosphere, gases such as carbon \ndioxide, CO2; such as nitrous oxide N2O. \nParticularly it is the carbon, carbon dioxide. They come from a variety \nof sources. Maybe 30 percent of the excess carbon dioxide is coming \nfrom our personal modes of transportation. Another 40 percent is coming \nfrom our electrical utilities plants. What happens is, if you get too \nmuch of these gases, such as CO2, in the air, as the Sun's \nrays come in and hit the Earth and bounce off the Earth, that heat that \nradiates out into space, these gases act like the glass top of a \ngreenhouse and trap in the heat, a greenhouse that stays perfectly warm \nduring the winter because of the Sun's heat coming in and cannot escape \nonce inside.\n  That is exactly how these greenhouse gases work. So if you get too \nmuch of a concentration high in the atmosphere, then the heat cannot \nradiate into space and the Earth starts to warm. So we have to go at \nthe root cause of the problem--lessening the amount of those gases that \nact as this greenhouse top surrounding the Earth.\n  That means cutting emissions from powerplants, from manufacturing \nplants and from transportation and cutting it significantly. This bill \ncalls for cutting the levels, cutting back to the levels that were \nemitted in 1990 by 2020.\n  Then it further says, 30 years after that, we would cut those \nemissions from the 1990 level another 65 percent. That is the way we \nare going to avert a catastrophic global warming catastrophic event.\n  Then the seas are going to continue to rise, the Earth is going to \ncontinue to warm. As the Earth warms, the pestilence increases, the \nstorms become more frequent and more ferocious, and if you live in a \nState as do I, a land we call paradise, but paradise is a peninsula \ncalled Florida, sticking down into the middle of oceans on both sides, \nthen you have the greater frequency of the storms, the higher intensity \nof the storms, and all the greater pestilence that comes along with the \nstorms.\n  So what this bill does is it sets an overall cap on the greenhouse \ngas emissions, that would, a matter of law, have to be met over that \nperiod of time, 2020, then 2050.\n  The way you would enforce it, the mechanism would be the buying and \nselling of credits that companies would have to have in order to get \nthe amount of emissions down to what is the reduced cap.\n  Now, there has already been a similar plan that has been tried, and \nthat was way back almost two decades ago, the plan on reducing acid \nrain.\n  It was buying and selling these credits--in some cases auctioning \nthem, under the new bill--and it worked. So we have to get something \ninto law and get on with the process of saving our planet.\n  Earlier this year, I went with the chairman of the Environment \nCommittee, Senator Boxer. She took Senators on the committee, she was \nkind enough to allow folks such as myself who were interested in this \nsubject to go. We went to Greenland. Greenland is the place that has \nthe biggest glacier. Why? It is an island that is 1,200 miles long from \nsouth to north, it is 500 miles wide. Hundreds of thousands of years \nago it was a piece of rock. Then what would happen each year is the \nwater in the Earth would evaporate, it would form clouds, the clouds \nwould be cooled, the clouds would turn, instead of to rain, to snow; \nthe snow would fall, and it would form a layer.\n  The next year the same thing would occur. When you do that over \nhundreds of thousands of years, the snow is packed each year, and that \nlayer that is 2 miles thick now becomes a glacier.\n  What is happening, and what we saw with our own eyes, is that within \na few\n\n[[Page S13743]]\n\nyears, already 6 miles of the glacier at its edge is receding. How it \nrecedes is, it breaks off, and in the particular fjord or river we went \nto, we could see these big chunks of ice falling off the glacier into \nthe fjord, floating down the fjord, and out into the Atlantic Ocean.\n\n  When they get into the Atlantic Ocean, they are what you have always \nheard, an iceberg. What we saw as we went around these icebergs in a \nlittle boat, huge mounds of ice, but that is only 10 percent of it \nabove the surface of the water. Ninety percent is underneath. Then they \nget on out into the Atlantic and they melt.\n  The long and short of it is, if that entire glacier on Greenland were \nto melt--this is going to surprise you--the seas of the entire planet \nwould rise 21 feet.\n  Now, obviously that is going to take a long period of time. But you \ncan imagine if we do not reverse what, in fact, is happening--and do \nnot give me this stuff that one person says global warming is true and \nanother person says it is not true and the press treats it as if one is \nbalancing against the other.\n  No; 99.99 percent of the scientists say global warming is a fact. A \nde minimis amount say it is not. Let's recognize the science, and this \nis where you have seen that major committee in the United Nations \nreceive one-half of the Nobel Prize, along with the former Vice \nPresident of the United States.\n  Global warming is a fact. You can imagine if seas start to rise. \nSuppose they rise, not 21 feet but 3 feet. Do you know what would \nhappen to the coast of Florida? To the coast of Louisiana? To parts \ncoming in around Hilton Head and Charleston and Houston and even all \nthe way up the eastern seaboard?\n  The stakes are too high. That is why I am cosponsoring this bill. \nThis bill made some progress last week when it was approved by a \nsubcommittee on the Environment and Public Works Committee. The full \ncommittee should be taking it up soon. I hope we get action and we can \nget out on the floor of the Senate and debate it.\n  I hope to be able to bring to this debate the information of a bunch \nof us, led by Senator Boxer, who are going to go to Bali, Indonesia, \nfor a global conference for world climate change to get the input of \nthe other nations of the world that have shown they are a lot more \nconcerned about this than the United States has been in the last few \nyears.\n  I wish to thank our colleagues, all who have been involved. I wish to \nthank Senator Boxer for her leadership. I wish to thank Senator Warner, \nwho did not have to do this; he is retiring from the Senate, the senior \nSenator from Virginia. He is a conservative Republican, but he knows \nthat planet Earth is in peril.\n  I wish to thank Senator Lieberman, who has been at the forefront of \nthese environmental issues for years. I am glad to add my voice to \ntheir clarion cry for immediate action before it is too late.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, that was simply the House bill that came \nover and was at the desk. On behalf of Senator Chambliss, myself, and \nothers, I offer the substitute amendment as the Senate-passed bill. \nThat is what is now pending at the desk.\n  Today begins the deliberation and amendments on the 2007 Food and \nEnergy Security Act, otherwise known as the farm bill.\n  I intend to take some time to lay out basically the farm bill and the \ndifferent titles, some of the things we did in committee, approaches \nthat were done in the past, and what we are looking at in this farm \nbill. So I will take some time this afternoon to do that.\n  As I understand it, under the previous order, there will be no \namendments in order today.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. HARKIN. It will be opening statements on the bill itself, and we \nwill proceed to amendments tomorrow at whatever time the Senate \nconvenes.\n  Mr. President, on behalf of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, \nNutrition, and Forestry, I am pleased to bring to the floor the Food \nand Energy Security Act of 2007, which enjoys broad bipartisan support \namong all our committee members. In fact, we reported it out by voice \nvote without a negative vote among the Senators who were present. We \nhad a quorum present.\n  I thank our ranking member, the senior Senator from Georgia, Saxby \nChambliss, for his leadership and partnership in producing the bill, \nalong with the chairman and ranking member of the Finance Committee, \nSenator Baucus and Senator Grassley, as well as chairman of the Budget \nCommittee, Senator Conrad.\n  We generally refer to this legislation as the farm bill. But that \ntitle doesn't do justice to the range and scope of the bill. Yes, the \nbill helps farmers and ranchers who produce an abundance of food and \nfiber and are contributing ever more to our Nation's energy security. \nThe bill also helps conserve and protect the environment on tens of \nmillions of acres of farmland, ranchland, and wetlands. It is the most \nimportant legislation to allow millions of low-income American families \nput food on the table. It is the single most important legislation for \nboosting economic growth in jobs and improving the quality of life in \nrural communities across our Nation.\n  We have faced a huge challenge in writing this legislation this year. \nWhen we wrote the last farm bill in 2002, we had about $73 billion of \nnew money over 10 years to invest. But for this bill, this year, we \nbarely had any funding above baseline. Fortunately, we have had some \nhelp from the Finance Committee in obtaining additional funds. We have \nalso reexamined all of the spending in our baseline to come up with \nbudget offsets. We have combined these funds and produced what I \nbelieve is a forward-looking bill to make historic investments in \nenergy, conservation, nutrition, rural development, and promoting \nbetter diets and health for all Americans. It also maintains a strong \nsafety net for America's farm producers.\n  The bill looks to the future and creates new opportunities in \nagriculture and rural communities. Yet I emphasize that this bill \ncomplies with the strict pay-as-you-go budget rules we adopted earlier \nthis year.\n  This legislation continues a strong system of farm income protection. \nIt is a truism that we have heard many times but ``no farms, no food.'' \nOur Nation needs programs that will help farm and ranch families \nsurvive the inevitable downturns in markets, disasters, and crop \nfailures. We need these programs so that the cycles of markets and \nweather do not force out of agriculture people who are so vital to grow \nfood, fiber and, increasingly, energy for our Nation.\n\n[[Page S13744]]\n\n  You will notice I referred to cycles in agriculture. That is why I \nhave long been a strong supporter of what is commonly called \ncountercyclical income protection programs for our farmers and \nranchers. That is a type of program that pays adequately when farm \nincome falls. Yet it is careful with taxpayers' dollars when farm \nincome is good. Because a countercyclical program is good common sense, \nI have never been a fan of direct or, as they came to be known in the \nmid-1990s, freedom-to-farm payments that were enacted in the 1996 farm \nbill.\n  Since the freedom-to-farm payments or the direct payments are not \ncountercyclical, what we have found is that they help too little when \ntimes are bad for farmers, but they are very hard to justify--direct \npayments to farmers--when we may be having record prices and high \nincomes. How can you justify giving sort of ``free money'' when times \nare good? So, in my view, a very positive feature of the bill is that \nwe continue the countercyclical income protection system we reinstated \nin the 2002 bill. We allow farmers at their option to choose a new \nprogram, called ``average crop revenue,'' modeled after legislation \nintroduced by Senators Durbin and Brown. This new choice for \nfarmers will make farm income protection stronger and more flexible. It \nwill allow farmers better to manage their farm's risk in today's \nuncertain and evolving farm economy.\n\n  Our legislation also includes other improvements in countercyclical \nincome protection. It is reinstituting a higher payment rate in the \nMilk Income Loss Contract program, or the MILC program, and adjusting \ncertain target prices and loans.\n  I will explain why I stress the countercyclical elements in this \nlegislation. The farm programs are supposed to be about income \nprotection, helping farm and ranch families survive cycles of hard \ntimes--the ravages of wind and weather, pestilence--and to stay in \nbusiness.\n  The farm programs are not supposed to be just about USDA commodity \nprogram payments and trying to maximize those payments regardless of \nincome. Now, it is true that for over 70 years Federal price and income \nsupports have been the dominant feature of U.S. food and agriculture \npolicy. Yet it is a mistake to suggest that farm program payments are \nsomehow the most important contributor to the past success of American \nagriculture or to its success in the future. A lot of times, people say \nthese farm programs in the past have been a great success. Look what \nthey have done to help us become the leader in the world in terms of \nagricultural production. Well, they have been helpful but not the most \nimportant.\n  The most vital elements in the success of American agriculture has \nbeen the skill, the dedication, and the hard work of the men and women \nand families on farms and ranches across the Nation, and also all of \nthe people who develop and supply technology and other production \nrequirements, such as all the new hybrids that have come in in the last \n30 to 40 years that increased production exponentially; and, of course, \nthe highly productive land and climate with which our Nation has been \nso blessed. Thanks to those factors, agricultural productivity--get \nthis--rose some 116 percent from 1960 to 2004, while in other U.S. \nindustries it rose 13 percent. So there has been a 116-percent increase \nin productivity of agriculture and only 13 percent in the rest of the \nAmerican economy.\n  So while this legislation we have today is vitally important, let us \nnot forget the true sources of America's agricultural strength and \nabundance. For those reasons, I strongly believe that, in addition to a \nsolid countercyclical farm income protection system, we must also make \ninvestments to help U.S. agriculture succeed in the future, as I will \nexplain in a moment.\n  One area in the bill where we are reaching out to help agricultural \nproducers is in initiatives for growers of what we call specialty \ncrops--fruits, vegetables, tree nuts, other horticultural or \nfloricultural crops. Past farm bills focused heavily on a few crops \nthat have come to be known as storable commodities, most notably \ncotton, rice, corn, soybeans, and wheat, which are, of course, vitally \nimportant. However, according to USDA, specialty crops now account for \nroughly 50 percent of the total value of U.S. crop production.\n  In this bill before us, we include a dramatic increase in our \nassistance to specialty crop producers but not in the form of subsidies \nor payments. They have not asked for those. This legislation will help \nour Nation's specialty crop growers address the very diverse challenges \nthey face in today's complex and global marketplace.\n  The programs within this bill will help America's specialty crop \nproducers gain access to overseas markets where they can promote and \nsell their products. It will also strengthen our national prevention \nand surveillance system for invasive pests and diseases, which will \nhelp protect the stability and health of fruits and vegetables in this \ncountry. And, of course, we increase research on specialty crops to \nprevent the spread of plant-based viruses. For instance, the Clean \nPlant Network, for which we include $20 million over the life of the \nbill, will be a tremendous help to our orchard and nursery industries. \nThe Clean Plant Network establishes a national system of diagnostic and \nresearch facilities to help ensure that our orchards and nurseries have \nthe safest plant materials possible to grow the fruits and vegetables \nwe need.\n  We also provide a significant amount of money in this bill to address \nthe trade-related challenges of U.S. specialty crop producers. The \ncurrent trade deficit for specialty crops in the United States is \nroughly $2.7 billion. In other words, we import $2.7 billion more in \nfruits and vegetables, horticulture, items such as that, than we \nexport.\n  The Market Access Program at USDA provides funding to nonprofit \nagricultural trade associations and agriculture cooperatives to help \npromote U.S. agricultural products overseas--in other words, to try to \nget that balance of payments more in line. The bill invests an \nadditional $94 million in the Market Access Program, which brings the \nprogram up to almost $240 million a year. Again, this program has been \ntremendously popular among specialty crop producers who receive nearly \n50 percent of the MAP funding.\n  The bill also makes crucial investments in the prevention of invasive \npests and diseases. A total of $200 million in new funding is provided \nfor a pest and disease program at USDA to enter into cooperative \nagreements with State departments of agriculture that conduct early \nplant pest detection and surveillance activities.\n  To some, the farm bill may seem an abstraction, removed from the \npulse of everyday life, but this is not the case. The farm bill touches \nthe lives of millions of Americans every single day, and nowhere is \nthis more evident than in the nutrition title of the farm bill.\n  In the nutrition sections of this bill, we strengthen America's \ncommitment to fighting hunger and promoting sound health and nutrition. \nBy strengthening food assistance to low-income Americans, the bill that \nis before us will help millions of Americans who currently live daily \nin the shadow of hunger. Because of the assistance this bill provides, \nmillions of Americans will put food on their tables, will be better \nable to afford childcare so they can enter the workforce, will be able \nto save modest sums for retirement or for the education of their \nchildren, and because of this bill, millions of low-income children in \nschools throughout America will be introduced--some perhaps for the \nfirst time--to fresh fruits and vegetables that science tells us are \ncritical to sound health and prevention of diet-related chronic \ndiseases.\n  The current USDA nutrition assistance programs need to be modernized \nand strengthened. Nowhere is that more evident than in the persistence \nof the term ``Food Stamp Program.'' We have all heard of food stamps, \neven though food stamps, the paper coupons, have long since gone by the \nwayside. So we renamed it the ``Food and Nutrition Program.'' It is no \nlonger the ``Food Stamp Program,'' it is the ``Food and Nutrition \nProgram.'' We update it in a number of important ways.\n  We made some progress in the 2002 farm bill, but the economic \nchallenges of low-income Americans, in many respects, multiplied in \nrecent years.\n  Since 1999, the number of Americans experiencing food insecurity has \nincreased from 31 million to 35 million. Similarly, between 2000 and \n2006, median household income in the United\n\n[[Page S13745]]\n\nStates, adjusted for inflation, actually decreased. Over the same \nperiod, the number and percentage of American children living in \npoverty increased. So USDA food assistance has not kept up with \ninflation or changes in the real world. For example, because of budget \ncuts enacted in the mid-1990s, the purchasing power of USDA food \nbenefits has continued to erode with each passing year. Similarly, \ndespite growing recognition that low-income Americans require the same \nincentives to save for their future as others, current rules all but \nforce low-income Americans to spend down their meager savings to rock \nbottom before they are eligible to receive food assistance during times \nof insecurity.\n  These punitive rules on family assets have not been meaningfully \naddressed since the late 1970s. Let's take the case of a single mother \nwho is working and has a couple of kids. She may be working at a low-\nincome job, but she has put away a little bit of money for a rainy day. \nShe loses her job. Something happens, and she is temporarily unemployed \nand needs to have food assistance for herself and her children. Right \nnow, she has over $2,000 in savings. She is ineligible for any food \nassistance. That $2,000 was set in the 1970s and has barely been \nincreased since. If it had kept up with inflation, that would be about \n$6,000 now. That is one of the items we address in this bill.\n  Finally, as more and more low-income women have entered the workforce \nin recent years, Congress has often spoken of the need to support \nfamilies during this transition from welfare to work, but our actions \nhave not suited and matched our rhetoric. For example, despite the fact \nthat childcare is critical to successful participation of women in the \nworkforce, when calculating income for a household to qualify for food \nassistance and to set benefit levels, no more than $175 per child per \nmonth can be counted as childcare costs despite the fact that the \naverage monthly cost of childcare in 2006 was well over $600.\n  So I am proud to say this bill addresses all of these issues. It \nstops the erosion and even increases food assistance for most recipient \nfamilies. It reforms the asset rules by increasing the asset limit \nmodestly. I wish we could have done more. We just didn't have the money \nfor it, but we did increase it. We also adjusted for inflation. We \nexempt tax-deferred retirement accounts and education savings accounts \nfrom the asset limit. We take that off the table.\n  It promotes work by allowing the full deduction of childcare costs. \nThey get to deduct that cost. There is no more $175 limit. Whatever \nyour childcare costs, you get to deduct it. I again thank the \nadministration. In their farm bill they proposed earlier this year, \nthis is also one of the key features of the administration's policy, to \ntake away that limit on the childcare deduction.\n  Fighting hunger and food insecurity is the central mission of the \nfarm bill's nutrition title, but it is not the only mission. In this \ntitle, we also seek to address poor health and nutrition among \nAmerica's children. Much has been said and written about the sad state \nof nutrition among our kids, manifested in rising rates of type 2 \ndiabetes, cardiovascular disease, and a national epidemic of childhood \nobesity.\n  In this bill, we act to improve child nutrition with a major \nexpansion of the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program for schools. I was \nable to initiate this program in the 2002 farm bill.\n  I have always believed that one of the reasons kids don't eat fresh \nfruits and vegetables is because they simply don't have the opportunity \nto do so. I figured, let's give them an opportunity and see what \nhappens. So we began by providing fresh fruits and vegetables--free, I \nmight add--free fresh fruits and vegetables to 100 schools in four \nStates and one Indian reservation. We wanted to test it: What would \nhappen if we gave free fresh fruits and vegetables to kids at school--\nnot in the lunchroom, but when they get the growlies at 9 o'clock in \nthe morning or in the afternoon when they get a little tired or antsy, \nkids need something to eat. What if they had fresh fruits and \nvegetables available at those times? What happened is the kids, the \nteachers, the principals, the parents all loved this program. Not one \nof the schools that has participated in this program--and it is all \nvoluntary, no one is forced into it--not one school that has \nparticipated in this program has asked to drop out. In fact, every \nschool that has participated has begged to stay in it.\n  By 2005, because other States were clamoring to get into the program, \nand other schools, we expanded to 10 States and two more Indian \nreservations. That is how successful it has been. In those States in \nwhich we do have the program, the schools that are not getting the free \nfresh fruits and vegetables are lining up saying: We want it also.\n  We have seen the positive effects it has had. Kids no longer are \neating junk food. Kids are no longer sneaking candy and cookies. They \nare no longer going to vending machines to get some sugary snack. They \nare eating fresh fruits and vegetables.\n  In this bill, we make a quantum leap forward for this program. The \nbill provides $1 billion--that is right, $1 billion--over 5 years to \nexpand the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program to reach nearly 4.5 \nmillion children nationwide, with a special focus on high-poverty \nschool districts.\n  I wish to emphasize that point. I have been to some of these schools \nwhere they have the free fresh fruit and vegetables program. I can \nremember being in one school where some of the fourth-grade kids had \nnever had a fresh apple in their entire lifetime--fourth grade; fresh \nbananas, they never had such a thing. I remember I was at a class one \ntime, and they had fresh pears. The kids didn't even know what they \nwere--kiwi fruit, strawberries. I remember I went to a school in Iowa \nonce--and our schools let out in the summer after the first crop of \nstrawberries is harvested. The principal told me that by 10 a.m. in the \nmorning, there wasn't a strawberry left in school. Kids eat these fresh \nfruits. I have actually seen with my own eyes kids eat fresh broccoli. \nThat may come as a surprise to some people, a shock, that kids actually \neat fresh broccoli. I have actually seen kids eat fresh spinach.\n  Because of the popularity of the program, because it has grown, some \nof the marketers are now packaging fruits and vegetables just for this \nprogram, so the kids get a little plastic package, they rip it open, \nand they have enough in there for a little snack. As I said, it has \ntaken off. It is providing better health, better nutrition for kids. \nThey study better. They behave better.\n  There was some reticence when we started this program. Teachers said: \nOh my gosh, kids will be throwing peels on the floor, apple cores at \neach other, making a mess of everything. This has not happened. In \nfact, teachers are now some of the strongest supporters of this \nprogram.\n  So when you go into these schools, you can see these kids eating \nthese foods, ripping open a package and getting little baby spinach \nleaves, and they have a little tin of ranch dip, they dip it and eat \nit. I always said I didn't like broccoli until I had fresh broccoli. \nWho likes cooked broccoli and cooked spinach? It is not good for you. \nIt may be good for you, but fresh is very good.\n  I emphasize this point because we are expanding this program. I have \na goal I have stated, and as long as I am here, I am going to keep \nfighting for that goal; that is, to make sure this program is available \nto every elementary school in America within 10 years. I think it will \ndo more to prevent childhood obesity, provide better health, plus when \nkids start eating these fruits and vegetables--and we have some \nanecdotal evidence of kids who are eating fresh fruits and vegetables, \nand they go home and ask their parents: Can we have some of this at \nhome or they go to the store with their parents, when they go shopping, \nand say: I had this in school, I really liked this fruit or I like \nthese vegetables, can we have this at home? It is going to do a lot for \nhelping get at this problem of childhood obesity and some of the \nchronic diseases, such as diabetes, among younger kids.\n  Now, I wish to talk a little bit about the energy title, another very \nimportant and kind of a new area for agriculture. The energy title will \nhelp farmers in rural communities across the country join in a major \ntransition in which our agricultural sector supplies clean biofuels and \nrenewable energy for all of America. It gives farmers a chance to add \nbiomass crops to their farming operations, with Federal\n\n[[Page S13746]]\n\nsupport to protect against the financial risks associated with the \ntransition. It supports rural communities with the development of \nbiorefineries for the production of biofuels and bioproducts. It helps \nfarmers and ranchers and rural small businesses that want to improve \ntheir own energy systems through grants and loan guarantees for energy \nefficiency improvements and renewable energy systems. It emphasizes a \nparticular opportunity--help for farmers and communities to install \nlivestock manure to energy facilities that address environmental and \nodor problems, while utilizing a valuable energy resource. It will make \ninvestments in research that will complement and enhance rural energy \nproduction opportunities. Members of the Senate are well aware of the \ndisastrous consequences of America's dependence on foreign oil. No less \nan authority than Alan Greenspan has said the war in Iraq is about oil. \nAt the same time, with oil prices relentlessly approaching $100 a \nbarrel, our dependence on foreign oil is a threat to both our national \nsecurity and the health of our economy.\n  The bigger picture is that new oil discoveries around the world are \nsteadily declining at the same time that global oil consumption is \nrising. I have a chart to indicate that. These are the billion barrels \nof oil per year in discoveries, and we can see in the 1930s, the 1950s, \na huge increase, the 1960s, the 1970s a little bump up there with \nAlaska, and then we keep coming down. We can see that global oil \ndiscoveries are rapidly, rapidly, rapidly declining. At the same time, \nwe superimposed on that this red line showing consumption. So as the \noil discoveries are going down, look at our consumption. It keeps going \nup and up and up.\n  Well, the Petroleum Council's report delivered to the Department of \nEnergy this past summer states that:\n\n       It is a hard truth that the global supply of oil and \n     natural gas from the conventional sources relied upon \n     historically is unlikely to meet the projected 50- to 60-\n     percent growth in demand over the next 25 years.\n\n  Well, our country needs energy. We need energy to grow and to \nproduce. We need energy for the new kinds of manufacturing we are going \nto have in this country, for transportation. It is an urgent national \npriority to accelerate our transition from oil to homegrown, farm-based \nrenewable sources of fuel and electrical power. If we reach our full \npotential in producing renewable biofuels using feedstocks from our \nfarms and forests, we can replace as much as 30 percent of our \ntransportation fuels by 2030--by 2030.\n  Right now, current ethanol production is about 7 billion gallons \nannually. I believe we are headed toward a production of 60 billion \ngallons of biofuels, requiring 50 to 100 million acres of crop lands \ndedicated to biomass crops by the year 2030. These charts show the \nsharp upward trajectory of biofuels over the past 5 years and with the \ncontributions we are making in this bill.\n  So here is what we have done in biofuels. It doesn't go back very \nfar. If you go back to about the late 1980s, early 1990s--millions of \ngallons. Not very much. But look at the sharp curve up as we came up in \nthe late 1990s into 2000 and 2005. Then let us look at the projections. \nHere we are at 2005, and here is 2030 at 60 billion gallons per year. \nSo that is the trajectory. That is the trajectory we are basically on \nand a lot of us are committed to. Senator Lugar and I have a bill in \nthat basically--and others have cosponsored it--to mandate we reach \nthat level by 2030.\n  Well, the energy title in this bill allocates $1.1 billion over 5 \nyears for new investments in farm-based energy. It is imperative we \naccelerate the transition of biofuels produced from cellulosic \nfeedstocks, in addition to grains and oilseeds, if we want to get to \nthat 60 billion gallons per year. And here, in addition to speeding up \nthe development and evaluation of conversion technologies, we also \nconfront a classic chicken-and-egg dilemma. Entrepreneurs would not \nbuild cellulosic biorefineries in the absence of reliable feedstock. \nProducers would not grow the cellulosic feedstocks unless and until \nthere are biorefineries to produce them. Well, in this bill we address \nthis dilemma very aggressively.\n  On the supply side, we allocate $130 million over 5 years to the \nbiomass crop transition program. We know it takes a few years to get \ncrops, such as switchgrass or miscanthus or soft pine or fast-growing \npoplars or whatever it might be, to get them started and established, \nso farmers are going to need financial assistance during the \ntransition. That is what we provide in the Senate bill.\n  On the other side, on the demand side, we allocate $300 million to \nsupport grants and loans for biorefinery pilot plants, loan guarantees \nfor commercial biorefineries, and support for repowering existing corn \nethanol plants and other facilities so they can process cellulosic \nethanol.\n  In addition, we continue the CCC Bioenergy Program with $245 million \nto support feedstock purchases for advanced biofuels production. We \ncontinue the section 9006 program of grants and loan guarantees that we \nput in the 2002 farm bill. This is for farmers and ranchers to purchase \nrenewable energy systems or energy efficiency systems for their own \nfarm or ranch. The budget for this is $230 million, double what we put \nin the farm bill in 2002. We are including about $140 million for \nbiomass research, including biomass crop experiments.\n  A large part of the future of biofuels lies in the use of cellulosic \nfeedstocks. Cellulosic fuels, biofuels, can be produced just about \neverywhere in the United States. This will expand biofuels production \nbeyond our major corn-producing regions and to places closer to where \nthe fuels are blended and consumed.\n  I will make this prediction. If we can preserve the Senate energy \nprovisions in conference--maybe get some additional funding for them, \nwhich we will try to do--I predict that within 5 years, by the end of \nthe life of this farm bill, we are going to see cellulosic biofuel \nrefineries sprouting up akin to mushrooms all over this country. That \nwill help restore our energy security and our national security. It is \ngood for the environment and good for farmers and the rural economy.\n  Now, let me talk a little bit about another important part of this \nfarm bill, and that is the conservation title. Agriculture and forest \nlands account for 69 percent of all the land in the United States. That \nmeans farmers, ranchers, and forest landowners are the first line of \ndefense for our environment. They are America's first conservationists. \nThe conservation title of this bill gives them the tools they need for \nvoluntary efforts to conserve oil, to protect water and air quality, to \nincrease wildlife habitat on their land, and maintain and improve our \nNation's natural resources for future generations.\n\n  The conservation programs are similar to a toolkit to address \nconservation needs, from the basic function of providing technical \nassistance on how best to, for instance, protect the waterway from \nerosion and runoff, to paying for easements, to protect wetlands and \ngrasslands or working farmland that is under the threat of development, \nto cost-share incentive payments and enhancement payments to help \nfarmers build and adopt new conservation practices.\n  This bill looks to the future in preserving our natural resources by \nallocating $4 billion in new budget authority for the conservation \ntitle. This is extraordinarily important to the future of farming in \nthe United States. I am pleased we were able to accomplish so much with \nrelatively limited funding. For example, the Wetlands Reserve Program \nhad no baseline to continue to enroll wetlands after this year, so we \nhad to put in new money for that. The Grassland Reserve Program was \nalso out of funds to enroll new land. We had to put new money in for \nthat. The Conservation Security Program's funding had been cut by \nbillions, almost $4 billion over the last 5 years, to pay for \nagricultural disasters and budget reconciliation. We needed to restore \nsufficient funding to allow the program to enroll more acres \nnationwide, and I am pleased to say we have successfully resolved all \nof these funding challenges.\n  In addition to maintaining or expanding existing programs, we \naddressed some new needs in this bill. For example, here in the mid-\nAtlantic area, where Washington, DC, is located, we devote $165 million \nto improving conservation to help clean up the Chesapeake Bay. This is \nmoney that will be used for upland treatment so all that runoff would \nnot be going into the Chesapeake Bay.\n  In the Southeast, in order to provide better wildlife habitat, we \nprovide\n\n[[Page S13747]]\n\nfunding to improve the management of trees planted on Conservation \nReserve Program acres. I am pleased to join with the committee's \nranking member, Senator Chambliss, who was the basic mover behind this.\n  The conservation title also establishes new incentives for producers \nto allow voluntary public access to their land for hunting, fishing, \nand other wildlife-related activities. Senator Conrad has been a leader \non this issue. I am pleased to have cosponsored his legislation, and we \nhave included it in this bill.\n  The conservation title also makes important policy changes. We have \nworked to streamline the process to acquire conservation easements in \nthe Wetland Reserve Program, the Farmland Protection Program, and the \nGrassland Reserve Program. That process has been paper heavy since the \nbeginning. In this bill, we have addressed that to cut down on the \npaperwork.\n  In this bill, we make significant improvements in the Conservation \nSecurity Program, which was created in the 2002 farm bill to reward \nfarmers and ranchers for good conservation practices on working lands. \nNow, this was new in the 2002 farm bill. In the past, most conservation \nprograms were lands that were taken out of production, in one way or \nthe other--wetlands, grasslands, the CRP and others. But as we saw more \nand more land coming into production, a lot of it for ethanol \nproduction, more and more marginal lands started coming in and we had \nto do something about that. In this bill, the program was renamed the \nConservation Stewardship Program to reflect the goal of the program to \npromote the long-term benefits to our Nation by adopting and \nmaintaining good conservation practices.\n  We have yet to realize the full potential of the Conservation \nStewardship Program because of tight restrictions on funding that \nexcluded many producers. Regulations only allowed certain farms and \nacres to be enrolled in certain designated watersheds every year. In \naddition, the process resulted in some kinds of crops and production \ntechniques being largely excluded from the program, such as organics, \nfor example. Well, the new Conservation Stewardship Program will \neliminate these shortcomings. It will grow rapidly, at a pace of more \nthan 13 million acres a year, which, with the 15 million already \nenrolled, will total 80 million acres in 5 years.\n  Acres will be allocated to States based not on watersheds but simply \non each State's share of the national eligible acres. Within each \nState, enrollment will be accomplished through a ranking process that \nwill prioritize producers who are already doing good conservation and \nwho are willing to do even more.\n  Again, I emphasize that this program we started in 2002 is going to \ngrow rapidly, as I said 80 million acres, and the idea behind it \nbasically is to reward farmers for being good conservationists--those \nfarmers who practice good tillage methods, conservation tillage, who \nput buffer strips along rivers and streams; those who apply the right \namount of fertilizer, not excessive amounts of fertilizer that can run \noff into our rivers and streams, polluting the Chesapeake Bay and other \nplaces.\n\n  So again, the idea is to reward good stewardship of our land, and I \nthink it is a good investment. I think it is one that will be broadly \nsupported by the American people. As I said, these kinds of \nconservation programs are more important than ever. The rising demand \nfor commodities is bringing millions of acres into production. A lot of \nland that was in the Conservation Reserve Program is now coming out.\n  We can't force people into the Conservation Reserve Program, and we \ndon't have enough money to bid everything back into it. So if that land \nis going to be planted for some kind of crop production, then we better \nhelp ensure it is done in a conserving manner. So we provide the \nincentives in the Conservation Stewardship Program to make sure they \nget the technical assistance, the cost-share, and the payments to \nprevent erosion and runoff.\n  As we look to the future, we have to look at these conservation \nprograms not only as a boost to the environment and cleaning up our \nenvironment but as a WTO, a World Trade Organization-compliant, non-\ntrade distorting way of assisting farmers and ranchers.\n  I got the idea for this Conservation Security Program--now renamed \nConservation Stewardship Program--traveling through Europe in the late \n1990s and looking at their farms and being amazed at the countryside. \nThen I looked at how much money European countries were giving to help \ntheir farmers--a lot more than we were--for conservation. I had to \nfigure this out. How were they providing so much money to farmers--more \nthan we were--but they didn't violate trade rules? Yet the money we \nwere giving to farmers violated trade rules.\n  It was simply they were making ``green payments'' to farmers--\npayments to their farmers for conservation--cleaning up rivers and \nstreams. Green payments. Green payments are under the ``green box'' of \nWTO, and it is WTO compliant. So we do not violate any of our \nagreements under WTO by providing farmers incentives for good \nconservation.\n  Now, I mentioned earlier that one element has been overlooked \nseriously in our farm bills in the past. We put a little bit in the \n2002 farm bill dealing with organics, and that was a cost-share for the \norganic certification. But the fact is, organics is the fastest growing \nsector in U.S. agriculture. The demand for organic products is so great \nthat it far outpaces our domestic supply. Much of that $2.7 billion of \nproducts, all agricultural products coming into this country over what \nwe send out, is organics. I have had people in the organics food \nbusiness, who sell organic foods, say they can't get it locally; they \ncannot get it in this country, so they have to import it. Well, we \ndon't have enough farmers getting into organic production, so imports \npick up the slack. In this bill, we make it a priority to help farmers \nwho are serious about getting into organic food production, and we help \nthem overcome the challenges of transitioning into this industry.\n  We include $80 million over 5 years for research into organic \nproduction and marketing. We include $5 million for price yields and \noverall data collection, which we don't even know about. We remove the \n5-percent surcharge arbitrarily charged to organic producers who want \nto reduce their risk by buying crop insurance. Crop insurance had a 5-\npercent surcharge on it. We removed that. We make EQIP more universally \navailable for farmers to transition into organic agriculture.\n  Now, one of the problems in organics that we have had is for a farmer \nto get certified to be organic, you have to have at least 3 years of \nnot using pesticides, that type of thing.\n  During that 3-year period the farmer cannot sell into the organic \nmarket, and receive higher prices, yet still is bearing the costs of \nmaking the transition to organic production.\n  So we have provided some cost-share assistance to help farmers adopt \nsound conservation practices that are part of the transition to organic \nproduction. If they are serious about becoming organic producers, we \nwill provide help in pursuing that opportunity.\n  Let's also talk about the assistance in this bill addressing global \nhunger and malnutrition through our food aid and development assistance \nprograms, another part of our bill. We are very proud that over the \nlast half century the United States has been the world's leading donor \nof food to hungry people. That is a source of great pride to us. U.S. \nprograms are estimated to have helped more than 3.5 billion people over \nthat period. I firmly believe our humanitarian activities throughout \nthe developing world continue to be an essential component of our long-\nterm effort to combat poverty and to build bridges of goodwill to \nforeign countries. It is a shocking fact that in the 21st century there \nis an estimated 800 million hungry people in the world, nearly half of \nthem children.\n  In April, the Government Accountability Office released a study on \nhow to improve the targeting and efficiency of U.S. international food \naid programs, a study that Senator Chambliss and I requested last year. \nI am pleased to report that the agencies involved in the delivery of \nU.S. food aid are on a path to adopt most of the recommendations made \nby the GAO. Some of the other recommendations, those that require \nstatutory changes, are addressed in this bill.\n  We set aside a specific amount of funding under title II food aid for \nnonemergency development assistance\n\n[[Page S13748]]\n\nprojects. The creation of this ``safe box,'' as it is called, is \nintended to send a strong message that it is not acceptable for USAID \nto use nonemergency program funding as the piggy bank to raid if \nregular appropriations for title II emergency programs are inadequate. \nIt is shortsighted to withdraw assistance from hungry people struggling \nto break the vicious circle of poverty in order to provide food to even \nhungrier or more desperate people. To me, this approach is like using \none family's seed corn to feed another family. In the end, both \nfamilies are left hungry, and the first family's efforts to lift \nthemselves out of poverty are hindered. So we address that in this \nbill.\n  The trade title also gives USAID authority for a pilot program to \nconduct local or regional cash purchases of food. For the last few \nyears, the President has requested authority to use up to 25 percent of \ntitle II funds for local or regional cash purchases, but this concept \nneeds careful testing before we consider adopting it on a larger scale. \nI also want to make clear that I see local cash purchases as a \ncomplement to donation of U.S. commodities, not as a substitute.\n  As I have already noted, the funding for this new farm bill is \nextremely tight, so we were limited in what we could do to increase \nresources for international food aid. However, the title containing \nfood aid provides an increase for the amount that can be spent in \ntransporting U.S. food commodities under the Food for Progress Program \nfrom the current $40 million annually to $48 million.\n  The Food for Progress Program is aimed at improving economies and \nhelping to build democratic institutions in developing countries and in \nEastern European countries transitioning to democracy. Obviously, we \nwould have liked to do more to increase funding for the Food for \nProgress Program.\n  I also would have liked to have provided mandatory funds for the \nexcellent McGovern-Dole International Food for Education and Child \nNutrition Program, which I helped to establish in law in the 2002 farm \nbill. The McGovern-Dole program is designed to encourage children in \ndeveloping countries to go to school and stay in school by providing \nthem free or subsidized food. It has a lot of similarities to the \nSchool Lunch Program in this country. In its brief lifetime, the \nprogram has helped 19 million kids attend and stay in school in \ndeveloping countries.\n  Think about it this way. In the United States, we provide free and \nreduced-price school lunches all over America and they help families a \ngreat deal. We may not think so much about the impact of that because \nin the overall economy of our nation food costs only about 10 percent \nof our disposable income on food. In some of the poorest countries, \nwhere food may consume perhaps 60 percent or more of disposable income, \nproviding free food to children who attend school is a very big benefit \nto that family. That food can be the magnet that gets children out of \nan abusive child labor situation and into school. So it is a great \nprogram.\n  I remember when both Senator Dole and Senator McGovern came to see me \nabout it in the late 1990s, trying to get it into the next farm bill, \nwhich we did, and their hopes and dreams for it. I still think if we \ncan put the money into this program and grow it, it could be one of the \nbest things we could do to fight hunger and poverty, to end child labor \nand to root out some of the harsh economic conditions, anger and \nfrustration that may even lead some to turn to terrorism.\n  Despite limited new funding, I am proud of the work we have done on \nfood aid and other trade issues in this bill.\n  We also in this bill help promote farmers markets, which are \nexpanding all over the country. I can remember barely 10 years ago in \nmy State of Iowa you could probably count the number of farmers markets \non both hands. Now they are all over. In the Washington, DC, area, and \nother metropolitan areas, in the last several years we have seen \nfarmers markets springing up all over the place. People want to \npurchase fresh, locally grown food. However, these are very challenging \nenterprises. They require grassroots organizing, planning and \nadvertising; farmers have to be recruited; there are regulatory and \nlogistical challenges.\n\n  In both the 2002 farm bill and this new farm bill, I have worked to \nhelp people overcome some of these barriers to establishing successful \nfarmers markets. In the 2002 farm bill we added a program called the \nFarmers Market Promotion Program to help people develop and organize \nfarmers markets and to enable direct producer-to-consumer market \nopportunities. In the legislation before us, we include $30 million for \nthe life of the bill for these types of activities.\n  Too often farmers can and want to expand production of foods to be \nsold locally, but they face difficulties finding markets. Larger retail \noutlets want consistent supplies and abundant quantity, which is \nsomething a small farmer just can't provide. This bill seeks to solve \nthis problem by fostering new opportunities for farmers to band \ntogether, providing funding through the value-added product market \ndevelopment grant program, as well as loans through the Business and \nIndustry Loan Program. The idea is to promote what we call aggregators, \nwhere farmers who grow produce--vegetables or fruits or whatever it \nmight be, or maybe they want to do some free-range chickens or organic \nmeat or something like that--can join together to tap into bigger \nmarkets. What we need are aggregators who can go out to this farmer and \nthat farmer and that farmer and say: OK, you bring your beets here and \nyou bring your beets and you bring your beets or you bring your carrots \nor you bring your eggs or whatever it is. We put them together, and \nthen we can sell them to larger buyers.\n  That is what we have done in this bill to promote and make it easier \nfor farmers to get their produce to farmers markets.\n  For rural communities, as we seek to promote new opportunities in \nproduction agriculture, we have to realize the success of our farm \nhouseholds is tied not only to what is produced on the farm but the \nstrength of the surrounding economy--rural economic development. \nCurrently, more than 80 percent of total farm household income comes \nfrom sources off the farm.\n  I have a chart that shows that. It is amazing when you look at it. \nThe percent of farm household income from off-farm sources 2 years ago: \nin the Northern Great Plains, 69.3 percent; in the Heartland, where I \nam from, Iowa, 66.7 percent; Mississippi Portland, 90.1 percent; \nSouthern Seaboard, 94.9 percent; Northern Crescent, 85.2 percent. I \nguess we would probably be the least, in the Heartland, 66.7 percent. \nSo even in our area, two-thirds of farming comes from off-farm income \nsources.\n  Again, 9 out of 10 people who live in rural America are not farmers. \nSo our committee has a responsibility for crafting public policies that \nsupport not only farmers but all of our citizens who live in small \ntowns and rural communities.\n  Rural America confronts unique challenges because of its low \npopulation density, the limited capacity of local governments and other \nspecial circumstances. In recent years we have come to appreciate that \nagriculture and rural development are closely intertwined. They have a \ncommon fate. We need to go forward with a policy framework that \nsupports both our farms and our rural economy.\n  For years many economic development leaders have been frustrated that \nwe have failed to create a more comprehensive approach to rural \neconomic development. That is why I am excited about the Rural \nCollaborative Investment Program in this bill, which received $135 \nmillion in funding over 5 years. This new program provides Federal \nsupport for regional collaboration. It is becoming clearer to us that \nno one rural town or county can go it alone. Rural areas must work \ntogether regionally to scale up investments, build competitive economic \nclusters, and overcome geographic disadvantages.\n  The Rural Collaborative Investment Program awards innovation grants \non a competitive basis to regions that creatively leverage these funds \nwith other Federal, State, private, and philanthropic resources.\n  It provides incentives for elected officials, leaders of the business \ncommunity, and nonprofit organizations to come together, to jointly \ndevelop plans that work best to improve the economy in their particular \narea.\n  Those who develop the best plans will receive significant resources \nfrom\n\n[[Page S13749]]\n\nUSDA to help implement their plans. Because of limited Federal funding, \nmany who compete for innovation grants will not get one, but they will \nstill come out winners because they will have gained valuable \nexperience in collaborating across county and town boundaries, and they \nwill have completed a plan of action tailored to their specific area.\n  Again, this is so essential. If we look at the fact that the majority \nof farm household income is coming from nonfarm income, what good does \nit do to help our farm families if all of the small towns dry up and \nblow away? Already in my own State of Iowa, kids who live on farms and \nin small towns are riding school buses longer and longer distances as \nschools consolidate.\n  Farm families cannot even buy the essentials for their families \nwithout driving long distances, because there is not enough business to \nsupport local stores. We have small towns in Iowa where churches no \nlonger exist. We have to do something to start enhancing the economic \nviability of our small towns and communities. That is what we do with \nthe Rural Collaborative Investment Program.\n  One other key element I want to point out is the promotion of \ncommunity foundations. You know, rural Americans possess hundreds of \nbillions of dollars in assets. Much of it is in land. Good valuable \nland. And, quite frankly, a large share of this, I know in my area, and \nin the upper Midwest--I do not know so much about some other parts of \nthe country, but I bet it holds true almost all over--a large share of \nthe asset value is held by people who are 65 years of age and older.\n  Well, these farmers, ranchers, businesspeople and others care deeply \nabout their communities. They care deeply about their rural way of \nlife. They care about the institution of the family farm. Many would be \nmore than happy to give a generous share of their wealth back to their \ncommunities if they had a credible agency to make good use of the gift.\n  That is exactly the role that community foundations play. They are \nthe perfect vehicle for bringing together local financing, local brain \npower, local leadership, to focus on solutions tailored to a given \ncommunity or group of communities.\n  The rural development title of this bill also provides $40 million \nfor a new microloan program championed by the Senator from Nebraska, \nMr. Nelson. This initiative provides support for organizations that \nhelp people of modest means acquire the expertise to start their own \nbusinesses. It provides small loans to these new entrepreneurs.\n  We provide $50 million in new funding for rural hospitals. Each \ndollar supports about $18 in direct loans, and generates even more \ndollars in the form of loan guarantees. This funding will help rural \nhospitals acquire the equipment they need to improve patient care and \nto computerize their records, for example. In talking about all of the \nneeds in rural America, one of the big needs is health care, and in \nmaking sure we have rural hospitals there with primary and emergency \ncare.\n  We also provide $40 million for the construction of daycare centers. \nAgain, demographics show many young families are leaving rural America. \nPoll after poll shows they want to stay there. But they need an off-\nfarm job, and to get that off-farm job, they need daycare, and there \nsimply is not much daycare to be had. Access to quality, affordable \ndaycare is a big part of the solution. It is urgently needed.\n  Another one of the big problems in rural America is the backlog of \nrequests for money for good drinking water and for wastewater systems. \nThis bill provides $135 million to reduce the backlog of these \napplications.\n  One other thing that is going to help a lot with rural jobs is the \nintroduction of broadband services to our small towns and communities; \nand not only to small towns and communities but to the farms \nthemselves. I like to think the extension of broadband to our farms and \nrural areas is every bit as essential today as the extension of \nelectric lines was to our farms and rural areas back in the rural \nelectrification days of the 1920s and 1930s.\n  The bill does that. We provide financial resources, we cut down on \npaperwork. We also cut down--basically we shift from financial \nassistance going to areas that already have broadband service. We do \nnot need that. We need to get it into areas that do not have it. \nBroadband is a basic utility, both for the kids who need it for their \nschoolwork, and for farmers and rural business people in order to do \nbusiness. I know of instances where in small communities, a small \nbusiness person was growing his insurance business, but he needed \naccess to broadband. There were, I forget exactly how many, less than \n10 people who worked there. But he was going to grow his business. He \nknew he could, but he knew he needed broadband access. If he had \nbroadband access, he could have stayed in that small town, maybe \nemployed 15 to 20 people. Since he could not do it, he moved to a \nlarger city, Des Moines, our capital. At least he stayed in Iowa, but I \nwould have much preferred if he could have stayed in that small town \nand community and had broadband service. We need to extend broadband as \nrapidly as possible.\n  Let me talk briefly about agricultural research, which has been so \nimportant for that 116 percent increase I talked about in agriculture \nproductivity since 1960.\n  The research title will increase competitive grant opportunities for \nbasic and applied agricultural research; it will strengthen the \nresearch, extension, and education programs administered by USDA \nthrough our land grant institutions. It will achieve these objectives \nby restructuring the grant administering agency at USDA and \ntransforming it into a national institute of food and agriculture. This \nwill improve, integrate, and streamline the management of competitive \nand infrastructure programs, and will require a roadmap to be led by \nthe Under Secretary for Research, Education and Economics, to refocus \nthe research mission at USDA.\n\n  As I have said, agricultural research has historically produced \nenormous benefits from relatively modest funding. In my experience, few \npeople appreciate the transformational impact of breakthroughs in \nagricultural research. To give one example, consider the work of an \nIowan, Dr. Norman Borlaug, beginning in the 1950s. His methods of high-\nvolume crossbreeding and shuttle breeding in order to develop disease-\nresistant wheat varieties were soon applied to other crops around the \nworld, fostering what was known as the ``green revolution'' which has \nsaved upwards of a billion lives.\n  Dr. Borlaug won the Nobel Peace Prize and recently won the \nCongressional Gold Medal in a very nice ceremony here in the Capitol. \nBut many people still do not realize how his successes in agricultural \nresearch have changed the world.\n  We are continuing to achieve great agronomic breakthroughs in \nagricultural research, but agricultural research is rapidly changing, \nand so we need to change the methodologies by which we fund and promote \nthis research. That is what we do in this bill.\n  With the changes included in this bill, we will elevate the \nvisibility of competitive research programs while strengthening our \ninfrastructure programs--such as the research, extension and education \nprograms--in place at our land grant universities. The National \nInstitute of Food and Agriculture will lay the groundwork for a more \nrobust agricultural research system, which we hope will lead to \nincreased funding in the future, funding, I might add, that has \nremained flat in the past 20 years in inflation-adjusted dollars. I \nwould also highlight that in the research title we provide $80 million \nfor specialty crops research, such as to advance breeding and \nmechanization, and to improve the safety--I emphasize the safety--of \nfruits and vegetables. We also provide $80 million for research in \norganic agriculture, which as I said earlier is one of the fastest \ngrowing parts of our agricultural economy.\n  The largest obstacle to farm entry for beginning farmers and ranchers \nis access to two things, credit and land. Since 1990, a portion of the \nfunding in the Farm Service Agency loan programs has been reserved for \nbeginning farmers and ranchers. This bill expands the credit \nopportunities for beginning farmers by increasing the funding set-\naside, and increasing the direct farm ownership and operating loan \nlimit for the first time in over 20 years. Socially disadvantaged \nfarmers face many of\n\n[[Page S13750]]\n\nthe same challenges as beginning farmers do, and so we increase \nopportunities for them by authorizing wider participation in Farm \nService Agency loan programs.\n  I am also proud of the fact that this is the first farm bill ever to \ninclude a livestock title dedicated to the needs of our livestock, \npoultry, and egg producers, and aimed at promoting animal health and \nexpanding market opportunities.\n  Consolidation and vertical integration of the livestock and poultry \nindustry has dramatically reduced the number of buyers, and in some \nregions there are only a few left. This lack of buyers has created an \nacute need for market reforms and more rigorous USDA enforcement of the \nPackers and Stockyards Act and the Agricultural Fair Practices Act.\n  To that end, this bill eliminates two layers of bureaucracy at USDA. \nIt designates a special counsel, so at long last we will have a high-\nlevel official at USDA dedicated to overseeing, managing, and enforcing \nthese two acts.\n  The bill would limit packer ownership of livestock in order to \nprovide stability to the marketplace for independent producers. It \nprovides basic fairness for producers using contracts, so that \ncompanies cannot force producers to travel great distances to settle \ndisputes; in other words, to travel clear across the country to where a \npacker's headquarters might be located.\n  In addition, this bill makes arbitration voluntary, so producers are \nnot forced into unfriendly terms, requiring mandatory arbitration, in \ntake-it-or-leave-it contracts.\n  Let me also mention that at the urging of Senator Durbin and others, \nthe bill requires the creation of a Congressional Bipartisan Food \nSafety Commission. This commission would be responsible for reviewing \nthe Nation's food safety system, and making recommendations on how best \nto modernize the current structure.\n  Over the last year we have had outbreaks of E. coli contamination in \nbagged spinach, lettuce, and numerous recalls of very large quantities \nof meat and meat products. Over the weekend and in today's paper I read \nthere are a million pounds of ground beef being recalled from stores in \nthis area, and I do not know what other areas of the country. We have \nhad repeated cases of contaminated food, everything from peanut butter \nto seafood to hamburger. So the work of this new Congressional \nBipartisan Food Safety Commission will both be timely and urgent. Our \nconsumers are basically demanding that.\n  In sum, I have sought to lay out the comprehensiveness of this bill. \nA lot of people are focused on payments to farmers. They think that is \nthe farm bill. That is a small part of the farm bill. It is \ncomprehensive. It addresses food safety, as I just mentioned. Food \nassistance to hungry people abroad, food assistance to hungry people in \nthis country, energy, rural economic development, conservation of our \nnation's resources.\n  In energy, the bill opens up new vistas for energy production in this \ncountry, biofuels, cellulosic biomass materials; all of this is covered \nin this bill. So this bill is a strong forward-looking bill. It will be \ngood for farmers, good for rural communities, good for our environment \nand good for our nation. It will promote our citizen's health, improve \nour energy security, and it is fiscally responsible. The bill won \nstrong bipartisan support in the committee, and it deserves the same \nbipartisan support of Senators here on the floor.\n  As we look ahead to consideration of the bill this week, I hopefully \ncan use the Senate's time productively. Obviously, this is the farm \nbill. We want to be productive. I encourage Senators, if they have \namendments--and I am not encouraging a lot of amendments--to bring \ntheir amendments to the floor in a timely fashion. Hopefully, we can \ncomplete our work this week and go to conference as soon as possible.\n  I assume the chairman of the Finance Committee, Mr. Baucus, in his \nopening remarks, will dwell more on the part of the substitute \namendment at the desk that includes provisions of the Finance Committee \npackage. It includes a permanent disaster assistance program, tax \ncredits that help offset the cost of conservation programs in the bill, \nand other tax provisions related to agriculture and energy. I expect \nSenators Baucus and Grassley will discuss these provisions at greater \nlength. However, I thank them both and the members of the Finance \nCommittee, including the occupant of the chair, for all of their \nsupport in helping the Agriculture Committee meet its goals and at the \nsame time stay within our budget guidelines.\n  I know I have taken a lot of time, but for those who may be watching \non monitors, people around the country watching on C-SPAN, and others \nwho think a farm bill is only about payments to farmers, I wanted to \nshow the comprehensiveness of this bill. It touches our lives every day \nin many ways, from the abundant food and fiber we enjoy to the safety \nof our food, to fruits and vegetables in schools, to the assistance to \na family down on their luck who need some food assistance to feed their \nchildren during a time where they may be out of work for a period. It \nprovides funding to help us meet our energy needs, to get us off of the \noil pipeline to foreign countries. It saves our soil, provides for \nclean water and increased wildlife habitat for hunters and fishermen \nand everyone who enjoys the outdoors. It provides more research into \nimproved agricultural technology and practices--how to do things \nbetter, how to be more productive, more safe. We have growing demands \non the land. Yet we have to make sure our productivity keeps going up. \nWe have seen tremendous strides in the past because of agricultural \nresearch and what we have accomplished there.\n  I want people to know, this legislation is not only a farm bill. This \nis a food and energy security bill covering everything--all the food we \neat and consume, all the food we produce, all the food we have in our \nfood assistance programs, and, yes, our energy needs as well. That is \nwhat this bill is. It is comprehensive. It is a good bill. I encourage \nthe support of all Senators for this legislation.\n  I thank my ranking member and good friend, Senator Chambliss, first \nfor his stewardship of this committee when he was chairman and for all \nof the hearings Senator Chambliss had last year all around the country. \nHe came to my State of Iowa. We had a great hearing in Iowa. He laid \nthe groundwork for this bill. It was a smooth transition this year, \nwhen our party took over the Senate through the election of last year. \nWe continued that groundwork Senator Chambliss laid for this bill.\n  People wonder why we took so long. Two reasons: One, the farm bill \nbills usually take a long time. I have often said this is my seventh \nfarm bill since the time I first entered the House back in 1975. It is \na very challenging bill to put all together, especially when one has \nthe budget constraints we had.\n  In 2002, that sailed through easily. We had $73 billion over \nbaseline. Under the leadership of Senator Conrad and the Budget \nCommittee, we decided this year we will not resort to deficit spending \nanymore. We will get out of the hole we are in. We are going to get out \nof the budget deficits we have had in the past. So we have a pay-go \nbudget, and we met our obligations with this bill in that regard. It \ntook some time to work it out. We also received help from the Finance \nCommittee.\n  The Finance Committee, for many reasons, had a lot of things on their \nplate, too, but once the Finance Committee acted, we had our funding \nthrough that action, we moved ahead aggressively to finalize the \nlegislation and put the bill together. We had tough negotiations, but \nfarm bills have always been tough negotiations. They have also been \ngood negotiations. They have been done in a spirit of making sure all \nthe pieces fit together.\n  That is what this farm bill does--it makes many pieces of the jigsaw \npuzzle fit together. It may not be everything I wanted in the beginning \nor everything Senator Chambliss wanted in the beginning or anybody \nelse, but that is what this is. It is kind of a grand compromise, if I \nmay say, to put all these things together and to fit them together so \nthe entire country benefits. I say that in the way of thanking Senator \nChambliss.\n  I see Senator Conrad in the Chamber. I thank him both in his capacity \nas chairman of the Budget Committee and as a senior member of the \nAgriculture Committee. He helped us put all these numbers together so \nthey work.\n\n[[Page S13751]]\n\n  Again, I close my remarks by thanking Senator Chambliss for his \nstewardship when he was chairman but also for being my partner in \nputting this legislation together as ranking member. It would be fine \nwith me if we could quickly vote and move this bill to conference. I \nthink Senator Chambliss might agree with me on that. But we will have \nsome amendments this week. I hope we can complete them in a timely \nfashion.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na letter dated November 5, 2007.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         U.S. Senate, Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \n           Forestry,\n                                 Washington, DC, November 5, 2007.\n       I certify that the information required by Senate Rule \n     XLIV, related to congressionally directed spending in S. 2302 \n     has been available on a publicly accessible website in a \n     searchable format for at least 48 hours before a vote on the \n     pending bill.\n                                                       Tom Harkin,\n                                                         Chairman.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Salazar). The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I begin by letting everybody know this \nis a mutual admiration society. Senator Harkin has been a great \nchairman of the Agriculture Committee. In previous years, back in 2002, \nwhen we had this farm bill up for debate, he was chairman then and did \na great job of leading us. I think a great product was produced. I was \nin the House then and had the privilege of working with him as well as \nother members of this committee, including my good friend, Senator \nConrad, about whom I will have more to say about in a minute. It was a \ngood product we produced back then. As chairman for the last 2 years, I \nhad the pleasure of going around the country and holding eight farm \nbill field hearings as well as a couple of other informal hearings. We \ntried to extend every courtesy to Senator Harkin. He had staff at each \none of those. We had a good working relationship for those 2 years.\n  During this year, when the seat change took place and Senator Harkin \nreassumed chairmanship, he extended every single courtesy to me he \npossibly could. It truly has been a good working relationship, not just \non production of this bill but on every other issue we had all year \nlong. Senator Harkin has been a great partner and a great friend for \nagriculture. That is what this is all about at the end of the day. It \nis not about the individual but about those farmers we represent and \nwho live and work all across this great country of ours.\n  I thank Senator Harkin for the courtesies he has extended to me. I \nthank him for the dialog we have had. Where we have had differences, he \nis exactly right: We have been able to talk through them and work them \nout. We have come up with a good product. I do concur with him that if \nwe could have a vote tonight, I would certainly be glad to see this \nbehind us to move to conference and begin the delicate and difficult \nchallenge ahead of conferencing this bill with the House. At the end of \nthe day, with his leadership, we are going to make that happen.\n  I see our friend, Senator Conrad. He and I forged a good friendship \nback in 2002, when we were in the conference committee, when I, as a \nMember of the House, and he, as a Member of this body, agreed on \nseveral things that we worked hard together on to make sure were \nincorporated into the 2002 farm bill.\n  As we moved into the process of the debate on this farm bill, he also \nhas been a great partner for American agriculture. We have had the \nopportunity, both with our staffs and without, to have numerous \ndiscussions, hours of discussion about the direction in which we ought \nto go. As I told the Presiding Officer the other day, the one thing I \nlearned about Senator Conrad early on was that when he tells you \nsomething, it is like money in the bank. You can know that what he said \nis his word and he doesn't budge from it. On difficult issues, we have \nhad to compromise and come to agreement. We have done that in a very \nprofessional way.\n  The product of all of that discussion is this farm bill which the \nthree of us have produced and filed here today. It is a good product, \nand it shows that when we do work together in a bipartisan way--and too \noften in this body we don't do that, but in this case we have--we can \nproduce what the American people want; that is, a good legislative \npackage.\n  I rise in support of the bipartisan Food and Energy Security Act of \n2007 that was overwhelmingly reported out of the Senate Agriculture \nCommittee on October 25, 2007. This bill is the result of many long \nhours of hard work on the part of my staff, the staffs of Chairman \nHarkin and Budget Committee Chairman Conrad.\n  In addition, I have met regularly with Republican members of the \nSenate Agriculture Committee and tried to address their thoughts and \nconcerns throughout the process. As a result of those outreach efforts, \nmany of the Republican members on the committee played a critical role \nin constructing this bill. I particularly thank Senator Crapo for all \nthe hard work he did in crafting the bipartisan conservation title.\n  In addition, our entire committee worked in a bipartisan fashion and \nlargely was able to accommodate the interests and priorities of almost \nevery member of the Agriculture Committee. I am extremely grateful we \nwere able to report this farm bill out of committee with all but one \nmember of the committee in agreement. It is indeed a luxury to pass a \nbill out of committee with 20 out of 21 members lending their support. \nParticularly in this time of increasing political differences and \nlegislative inactivity, it speaks highly of the men and women of our \ncommittee that we were able to have a constructive debate that has led \nto a bipartisan bill that will strengthen American agriculture.\n  It is my hope and expectation that we will engage in a similarly \nopen, bipartisan process as we consider the farm bill on the floor of \nthe Senate this week and probably into next week. Traditionally, Senate \nconsideration of farm bills has been conducted in an open manner. I see \nno reason to diverge from that course during this debate.\n  The substitute amendment we will consider beginning today is an \nextremely complex piece of legislation. I echo what Senator Harkin said \nearlier. We have a Finance Committee piece, and then we have the \nAgriculture Committee piece. They have been joined together. We would \nnot have been able to produce the Agriculture Committee piece without a \ncontribution from the Finance Committee. The work of Senator Baucus and \nSenator Grassley is extremely important and is melded into the work we \ndid on the Agriculture Committee.\n  It is complex. Farm bills in and of themselves are extremely complex. \nWhen you look at the commodity title where we talk about and use \nphrases that are not common to most Members of this Senate, most of \nthem don't understand when we start talking about marketing loans or \ncountercyclical payments because they are not used by Members of this \nbody in everyday, ongoing discussions. Likewise, the Finance Committee \npiece is extremely complex and involves offsets of some programs that \nmost of us don't deal with on a daily basis.\n  I am hopeful that the process will move in the course that it \nnormally moves along with respect to farm bills. That is we have a free \nand open debate, everybody has the opportunity to come in and talk \nabout any interest they have in the farm bill and to be able to offer \namendments to any portion of the farm bill.\n\n  At the end of the day, when all of the votes are counted, I am very \nconfident we are going to come out of here with a very positive, \nforward-leaning, reform-minded, forward-thinking farm bill that will \nallow us to go to conference with the House and come out of that \nconference with a farm bill that provides a safety net, makes the \nreforms in the right areas of agricultural policy where we need those \nreforms, and, at the same time, provides the kind of programs we need \nin nutrition, in school lunch, in energy, as well as in conservation, \nresearch, and the other critical portions of this bill.\n  We will need to carefully and methodically consider all proposals put \nforth by all Senators, both on the agricultural and finance-related \nprovisions of the bill. It would be counterproductive to attempt to \ncircumvent\n\n[[Page S13752]]\n\nour careful deliberative process by restricting the consideration of \nany proposal that is offered. I believe in an open farm bill debate, \nand I will not support any circumvention of the normal process with \nrespect to amendments that anyone may want to offer.\n  It is my sincere hope the Senate will agree with our committee and \nsupport this farm bill that will strengthen the Nation's food security, \nprotect the livelihood of our farmers and ranchers, preserve our \nefforts to remain good stewards of the environment, and enhance our \nNation's energy security efforts.\n  I consider a safe, affordable, and abundant food supply a critical \nnational security interest. I realize many people today are far removed \nfrom the farm, and it is hard for them to comprehend the complexities \nof production agriculture and how vitally important it is to the Nation \nthat our agricultural industry can support the diet of American \ncitizens without relying on imported foods and products.\n  Free market advocates will say we will always be able to buy what we \nneed from other countries. That is true. But I do not want to take that \nchance. I do not want to rely on other countries for my food, as we do \nnow for energy.\n  Senator Harkin just put up some charts that talked about the \nproduction of oil. We could have put up similar charts that talk about \nthe production of food. But, at the end of the day, the bottom line is \nthat American farmers and ranchers produce the safest, most abundant, \nhighest quality food supply in the world. When the consumer buys those \nproducts at the marketplace, Americans pay less out of every disposable \ndollar than any other country in the world for that safe, abundant, and \nhigh-quality food supply.\n  Now, despite challenging budgetary constraints, we were able to \nallocate $3.1 billion in new spending for all farm programs over the \nlife of this bill, thanks in large part to the efforts of Chairman \nBaucus and Ranking Member Grassley of the Finance Committee. Do I wish \nwe had more resources? Sure. But we find ourselves in a different \nsituation today compared to the last time Congress passed a farm bill.\n  It is ironic that the strong prices we are experiencing today in farm \ncountry would make our jobs more difficult in drafting a new farm bill. \nThat being said, key agricultural priorities, including specialty \ncrops, nutrition, conservation, and energy programs all received \nadditional funding, allowing these critical agricultural sectors to \nrealize unprecedented gains that will stimulate production and benefit \nnot only the farmers and ranchers who produce agricultural products, \nbut also the consumers and food aid participants who enjoy them at an \naffordable price.\n  Americans enjoy the safest, most affordable, and most abundant food \nsupply in the world--and all of this being done using less than 1 \npercent of the Federal budget being spent. As a fiscal conservative, I \ncan support that kind of investment any time.\n  Let me point out that the largest funding increase in this farm bill \ngoes to nutrition. I think in the last farm bill we spent 28 percent of \nthe budget on the commodity title alone. In this farm bill, we are \nspending approximately 14 percent on the commodity title. We are \nincreasing the nutrition title by over $5 billion, and that is no small \naccomplishment. The additional resources were made available by \nreductions in other areas of the bill, including the commodity and crop \ninsurance programs, which have always been the heart and soul of \nproduction agriculture.\n  Senators should understand the delicate compromise this entails, and \nfurther efforts to take funds from the farm safety net could stall this \nbill. The nutrition title is a vital part of this farm bill, and the \ncommittee-passed bill makes important improvements to the Food Stamp \nProgram that have long been on the agenda of the antihunger community.\n  Senator Harkin alluded to the fact we have increased the asset limit \nfrom $2,000 to $3,500. He is exactly right. That is a critical aspect \nof this bill with regard to the nutrition title. I have been a \nsupporter of trying to increase that to $4,000, which on a cost-of-\nliving scale over the last 20 years that is what it should be. We had \nhoped to do that. I actually have a bill--it is a stand-alone bill--to \ndo that. But, unfortunately, with the limited funds we have we were not \nable to do that.\n  But when we did find some additional money, kind of at the end of the \nday just before we finished the writing of this bill, Senator Harkin \nand I agreed, very quickly, that where we ought to put that money is in \nthe nutrition title to make sure we can do things such as make some of \nthe programs permanent, as well as raise the asset limit, and make sure \nwe have a Food Stamp Program which benefits farmers and ranchers as \nmuch as it does the beneficiaries that will be meaningful and will be \nworkable.\n  I especially thank my dear friend, Bill Bolling, the executive \ndirector of the Atlanta Community Food Bank, for not only his counsel \nas we went through the preparation of this farm bill, but also for \nhosting the committee's nutrition hearing at his facility this past \nApril. This provided us a great opportunity to better understand the \nneeds of food banks all across America, as well as hear firsthand \ntestimony from Georgians who rely on the food assistance programs that \nare an important part of this farm bill.\n  This bill takes important steps to improve the food purchasing power \nof food stamp participants and makes the Food Stamp Program more \naccessible to working families with low incomes. By raising the asset \nlimit, exempting certain IRS-approved savings accounts, increasing the \nstandard deduction, and increasing the minimum benefit for food stamps, \nthis legislation will better enable low-income Americans to afford the \nfood and nutrition they need to lead productive lives.\n  This bill also substantially increases the Federal funding for the \nEmergency Food Assistance Program from $140 million annually to $250 \nmillion annually. These additional resources will help people in need, \nas well as the local food pantries that provide these important \nservices in communities throughout the country. In addition, the farm \nbill promotes healthier diets by expanding access to farmers markets, \nas well as expanding the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program to all \nStates by targeting benefits to low-income children.\n  Again, Senator Harkin is exactly right. We have farmers markets \npopping up all over. We have a great system in our State of Georgia \nthat is led by our Commissioner of Agriculture, Tommy Irvin, who has \nmade sure we have very active and viable farmers markets in virtually \nevery area of our State and that farms have access to those markets. It \nis not just in the metropolitan areas, where the price may be a little \nbit better, but in the rural parts of Georgia.\n  Where I live, there is not a community I can think of or a county I \ncan think of that does not have a very active and viable farmers \nmarket, where we sell fresh fruits and vegetables and whatever is in \nseason. Whether it is watermelons, cantaloupes, or snap beans, the \nfarmers markets have all of those products readily available for the \nconsumer.\n  The committee has once again wisely decided to include an energy \ntitle in this farm bill. That is not by accident. In 2002, the Congress \npassed a farm bill that for the first time contained an energy title, \nand we have expanded this important title in the 2007 bill by including \nprograms to stimulate the production of cellulosic crops that can be \nconverted into energy. The Southeast has not been a participant in this \narena to date, but with the expansion of these programs to include \ncellulosic feedstocks, southeastern farmers will hopefully be able to \nmake fuel from agricultural products, all the way from kudzu to peanut \nhulls.\n  Mr. President, 100 percent of the ethanol manufactured in this \ncountry today comes from corn. We do not grow corn in the southeastern \npart of our country, nor do we grow it in the western part of our \ncountry in the abundance it is grown in the Midwest. There are reasons \nfor that. But we have the ability because of our long growing season \nboth in the West as well as in the Southeast to grow virtually any crop \nthat is out there.\n  So by providing funding for the additional research, by providing \nfunding for those investors who want to manufacture ethanol from \nsomething besides\n\n[[Page S13753]]\n\ncorn, they now are going to have that funding available to them to \ninvest in the cellulosic production of ethanol. At the same time we are \ngoing to encourage farmers to think outside the box, to not just grow \nthe crops that automatically come to mind when you think of ``The \nFarmer in the Dell'' or ``Old MacDonald.''\n  We are going to have farmers now producing all sorts of alternative \ncrops that can be used in the production of ethanol. I will cite just \none instance of that. In Georgia, we have the first cellulosic ethanol \nplant that has been committed for construction in our part of the \nworld. The investor in this particular cellulosic-producing ethanol \nfacility is going to take a crop we grow with great abundance in the \nSoutheast--and that is pine trees--and he has developed a system that \nwill allow them to take pine trees and convert those pine trees into \nethanol. The good news is, when he sticks that pine tree in that \ncylinder for the manufacture of ethanol, nothing escapes. Nothing comes \nout in the form of emissions into the air. Everything is used and \nrecycled. So it is an amazing process, and it is exactly the type of \nentrepreneurial exercise that we are encouraging in this farm bill.\n  Through the inclusion of this title, we continue to push forward the \nnecessary research, development, and promotion of renewable fuels that \nwill enable America's farmers and ranchers to contribute to the \nNation's expanding alternative energy industry. Notably, the energy \ntitle receives the largest percentage increase compared to the farm \nbill baseline, an increase of over $1 billion.\n  Importantly, this bill takes a fresh look at our commodity programs \nwhile continuing the traditional safety net so critical to America's \nfarmers. In addition, we have created a program whereby farmers may \nchoose to manage the inherent risks of agricultural production through \na new type of revenue assurance program. I am pleased farmers will have \nthe option to utilize this new Average Crop Revenue Program.\n  Senator Harkin has been instrumental in crafting this program. \nSenators Durbin and Brown have been instrumental. I particularly \ncompliment Senator Roberts for the great effort he put into digesting \nthis new program that is extremely complex but has the potential of \noffering farmers and ranchers a new option. It is one of those options \nwhere we as a committee and we as a body have been thinking outside the \nbox relative to programs of agricultural policy that benefit farmers \nand ranchers. I think with the amendment we have in place now in this \nbill we are going to encourage farmers and ranchers to think about some \nalternative to the conventional programs we have always had.\n  I understand several Members have an interest in offering amendments \nto further limit payments to the hard-working farmers and ranchers in \nthis country. However, I want the Senate to realize the committee-\nreported bill includes the most significant reforms to payment \nlimitations we have seen in the history of American farm policy. Any \namendment that attempts to make Draconian reforms is going to be met \nwith my strong opposition.\n  I urge my colleagues to compare this bill with current law and \nrecognize the dramatic changes. As my good friend, Senator Conrad, was \nquoted in the press the other day as saying, the changes in this bill \nrepresent the ``most significant reform'' in the long-fought battle \nover payment limitations. He is exactly right. He went on further to \nsay:\n\n       All payments will be attributed to an actual, living, \n     breathing human [being] rather than some paper entity.\n\n  Because now we are going to have attribution. We have eliminated \nthree entity, and we have changed the numbers dramatically.\n  Many of the proponents of significant reform to agricultural policy \nwill argue that only a small percentage of Americans receive any \nbenefit from farm programs. Agriculture economists at the University of \nGeorgia recently released a study on the Community Economic Analysis \nand Impacts of Georgia Cotton Production. This study focused on one \ncotton-producing county in the southern part of our State. The cotton \nproduction in this one county alone has a $36 million impact on U.S. \noutput and almost a $9 million impact on labor income in the United \nStates. Another interesting result from this study was that each dollar \nreceived in Government payments generated $1.37 of new tax revenue in \nthe U.S. economy. Let me repeat that. This study concluded that for \nevery dollar received in Government payments, that $1 generated $1.37 \nof new tax revenue in the U.S. economy.\n\n  The following excerpt came from the October edition of ``Southern \nFarmer'' magazine. By extrapolating the results of the University of \nGeorgia study, the columnist Steve Ford notes:\n\n       In summary, if cotton subsidies paid to farmers are $2 \n     billion, $1.2 billion is returned to the federal treasury \n     through tax revenue from economic activity generated by \n     cotton farmers. Economic activity generated by a net \n     investment of $800 million grows the U.S. economy by $28 \n     billion, provides another $800 million in state and local tax \n     revenue, and generates a $7 billion payroll and 230,000 jobs. \n     This investment generates a 3,400 percent return.\n\n  Although the study only focused on one small county in Georgia, when \nexpanded, the national impact of the cotton industry and the cotton \nprogram is astounding. I hope my colleagues understand our farm program \nbenefits all Americans, not just cotton farmers in south Georgia.\n  It is vitally important to the farmers and ranchers of Georgia, as \nwell as to farmers and ranchers all across this great Nation, that we \nuphold the strength of the safety net American agriculture depends on \nin this farm bill. The agriculture and food sector represents over 15 \npercent of the gross domestic product of the United States. This bill \nrequires our attention and commitment to the farmers and ranchers who \nput food on our plates every day. If we go down the path of crippling \nour farm programs in response to the newspaper editorials, the \ninevitable result will be the outsourcing of the production of our food \nand fiber.\n  While U.S. agriculture exports continue to grow, agriculture imports \nincreased by 10 percent and we are fast approaching a point in time \nwhen exports will equal imports. This is the one segment of our economy \nthat has consistently and continually over the last several decades \nprovided a positive balance of trade for our economy. If we let that \nslip away from us, it is going to be a huge mistake. Let the current \nenergy crisis be a warning sign to every Member of this body. If \nAmerica becomes as dependent on foreign nations to supply our food and \nfiber as currently is the case with petroleum, we will threaten the \nsecurity of this Nation and leave our children's health and diets to \nthe political whims of foreign nations.\n  Let me say that at the end of the day, the reason we are here is to \nrepresent the hard-working men and women who get dirt under their \nfingernails each and every day to provide the safest, most affordable, \nand highest quality agriculture products in the world. I hope my \ncolleagues keep those Americans in mind when they debate this critical \npiece of legislation.\n  I wish to also discuss several important provisions in the \nconservation title of the Food and Energy Security Act of 2007. I would \nlike to highlight 5 areas: conservation technical assistance, the \nConservation Reserve Wildlife Habitat Program, forest conservation, \nclimate change, and partnerships and cooperation.\n  U.S. agriculture delivers safe, reliable, high quality food, feed, \nand fiber to the Nation and to the world, but it also delivers much \nmore. Through their careful stewardship, farmers, ranchers, and private \nforest landowners also deliver clean water, productive wildlife \nhabitat, and healthy landscapes.\n  In the 1930s, this Nation made a historic commitment to a \nconservation partnership with farmers and ranchers. Rooted in our \nnational experience with the devastation of soil erosion at that time, \nthe conservation movement began with the purpose of keeping productive \ntopsoil--and a productive agriculture--in place. Conservation \ntechnology was harnessed to meet that challenge.\n  The Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 also was historic \nas it renewed our commitment to the Nation's working lands. Working \nland--the cropland, grazing land, and forest land that is used to \nproduce our food, feed, and fiber--accounts for nearly 1.3 billion \nacres, or two-thirds of this Nation's land area. Since the enactment\n\n[[Page S13754]]\n\nof the 2002 farm bill, conservation measures have been applied on more \nthan 70 million acres of cropland and 125 million acres of grazing \nland. In addition, more than one million acres of wetlands have been \ncreated, restored or enhanced.\n  In 1935, Congress created the Soil Conservation Service SCS, within \nthe U.S. Department of Agriculture, USDA, to lead conservation efforts \nat the federal level. SCS was renamed the Natural Resources \nConservation Service, NRCS, in 1994. NRCS provides technical, \nscientifically sound advice and assistance to farmers and ranchers to \naddress their local resource concerns. This technical assistance is the \nfoundation of conservation.\n  In the 1980s, Congress began to seriously focus on conservation. \nDuring the 1990s, Congress accelerated the investment in conservation \nby creating additional programs, such as the Environmental Quality \nIncentives Program, EQIP, to share the cost of installing conservation \npractices with farmers and ranchers. These programs are commonly called \nfinancial assistance or cost-share programs. NRCS was given the \nresponsibility of managing most of these programs in addition to \nmaintaining its traditional leadership role in the technical aspects of \nconservation.\n  In response to the popularity of the financial assistance programs \nand their dramatic increases in funding, NRCS has had to focus almost \nentirely on implementing them. While the financial assistance programs \nhave increased the adoption of conservation practices and awareness of \nthe benefits of conservation across the country, this shift in focus \nhas potential negative consequences for NRCS's ability to maintain its \ntechnical base and ensure scientifically valid technical assistance to \nfarmers and ranchers.\n  Congress is expected to continue to support financial assistance \nprograms well into the future. But in order to help farmers and \nranchers put meaningful conservation on the ground, Congress must also \nmaintain NRCS's core technical functions and capabilities--the science, \ntechnology development and transfer and resource assessments--that \nsupport the programs. Both parts of the portfolio are equally \nimportant.\n  In addition to continuing the investment in financial assistance \nprograms, the Food and Energy Security Act of 2007 also recognizes that \nthe success of the conservation partnership was built on a foundation \nof proven conservation science, technical assistance, and technology. \nThe legislation updates, clarifies, and consolidates statutes governing \ntechnical assistance for easy reference. It defines technical \nassistance to ensure a common understanding by Congress, stakeholders, \nfarmers and ranchers, and NRCS. The Act reauthorizes the Soil and Water \nResources Conservation Act and reaffirms its purpose of informing the \ndirection of conservation policy. It better incorporates monitoring and \nevaluation into the conservation planning process and conservation \nprograms to reflect increasing demands for a better understanding of \nthe real-world environmental effects of conservation policy and \nprograms.\n  Especially important to my home State of Georgia and other \nsoutheastern states is the creation of a new program within the \nConservation Reserve Program (CRP). It will help improve wildlife \nhabitat on CRP acres planted to softwood pine trees. The program is \ncalled the Conservation Reserve Wildlife Habitat Program.\n  Currently, there are about 1.5 million CRP acres in pines in the \nSoutheast. Most of these plantings are extremely dense and have few \nwildlife benefits. The program provides cost-share and incentive \npayments to landowners to better manage their pine stands, for example, \nthrough the appropriate use of thinning and prescribed fire. Wildlife \nhabitat quality can be rapidly restored in pine forests with the use of \nthese and other forest management strategies. This program will be a \nsignificant tool to help reverse the decline of northern bobwhite \nquails, certain songbirds and other at-risk species in the Southeast.\n  I sincerely thank the Georgia Department of Natural Resources, \nGeorgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission, National Association of \nConservation Districts, and the National Wild Turkey Federation for all \nof their help developing the program. This was a true grassroots \neffort.\n  The Nation's forest resources are a sometimes overlooked but \ncritically important part of our environment and economy. In the United \nStates, approximately 262 million acres of forest are owned by families \nor individuals. Nearly one million acres of these privately owned \nforest acres are developed each year. U.S. paper and wood processing \ngenerates 1.2 million jobs and $230 billion in annual sales. More than \n75 million acres of forests are part of a farm. U.S. forest lands \nprovide two-thirds of the Nation's drinking water, and a single tree \ncan absorb more than 10 pounds of carbon dioxide per year. \nUnfortunately, 27 million acres of private forest are at risk of insect \nand disease, and 90 million acres are at risk of wildfire.\n  The Food and Energy Security Act of 2007 helps private forestland \nowners improve their land and plan for the future. The conservation \ntitle places an increased emphasis on forest resources by defining non-\nindustrial private forest land in the Food Security Act of 1985 and \nclarifying that technical assistance is available for forest land \nconservation. Forest management practices and conservation plan \ndevelopment are added to EQIP, as is fire pre-suppression. The \nConservation Innovation Grant program encourages forestry projects and \nemphasizes the development and transfer of innovative conservation \ntechnologies.\n  One particular area I wanted to address in the 2007 farm bill was how \nagriculture and individual farmers can help tackle climate change. \nWhile I am not sure we understand all of the science of climate change, \nthere are some reasonable steps we can take to begin mitigating its \neffects and ensure agriculture can meaningfully participate in any \nfuture emission reduction program developed by Congress.\n  Agriculture accounts for about 6 percent of all greenhouse gas (GHG) \nemissions in the United States as measured on a million metric ton \ncarbon equivalent. Since 1995, emissions from the agriculture sector \nhave trended downward. The two primary types of agricultural emissions \nare methane and nitrous oxide. Methane is released as part of the \nnatural digestive process of animals and manure management at livestock \noperations. Fertilizer and manure application to soils are the source \nof nitrous oxide. Carbon captured and stored in U.S. soils partially \noffsets these emissions, sequestering about one-tenth of all emissions \ngenerated by the agriculture sector.\n\n  Currently, there are many land management and farm conservation \npractices that reduce GHG emissions and/or sequester carbon. Examples \ninclude land retirement, conservation tillage, and manure and livestock \nfeed management practices. These practices are supported through \nexisting farm bill conservation programs. But looking ahead to the \nfuture, there are additional opportunities for agriculture to further \nreduce emissions and sequester carbon. USDA estimates carbon uptake in \nagricultural soils could double by 2012, and over the long term \nagriculture could sequester 2 to 14 percent more carbon dioxide.\n  I have been encouraged by Federal, state, and private efforts over \nthe past few years to include agriculture in carbon credit trading \nprograms. However, it is time to go beyond the minimum standards that \nhave been set and develop more robust certification, measurement and \nverification standards. The key area that needs to be addressed is the \nmeasurement and verification of offsets generated by agriculture. Other \nquestions that need to be answered are how to distinguish between \nemissions mitigation and emissions reductions that would occur anyway, \nwhat activities should be eligible, and how the actions are measured, \nmonitored, and verified.\n  I am very pleased the Food and Energy Security Act of 2007 addresses \nthese issues by directing the Secretary of Agriculture to establish \nuniform standards; design accounting procedures; establish a protocol \nto report environmental benefits; establish a registry to report and \nmaintain the benefits; and establish a process to verify that a farmer, \nrancher or forest land owner has implemented the conservation or land \nmanagement activity. The Secretary is required to coordinate and\n\n[[Page S13755]]\n\nleverage existing activities in environmental services markets but to \nfocus first on carbon markets.\n  For several years, farm, conservation, wildlife and environmental \ngroups have promoted cooperative conservation and debated ways to ``get \nmore bang for the buck'' from the Federal investment in conservation. \nThe 2002 farm bill included an important provision to encourage \ncooperative conservation through its partnerships and cooperation \nprovisions. Partnerships and cooperation is the next step in locally \nled conservation as it promotes conservation on a landscape or regional \nlevel. Unfortunately, the provisions were not implemented due to a lack \nof specificity in the bill language regarding the relationship with \npartners and how funding would flow.\n  The Farm and Energy Security Act of 2007 resolves these issues and \nsignificantly improves partnerships and cooperation. The new provisions \nauthorize the Secretary to undertake a competitive process to designate \nspecial projects to address conservation issues related to agricultural \nand non-industrial private forest land management and production. The \nSecretary may enter into agreements with eligible partners to provide \ntechnical and financial assistance to producers to implement on-the-\nground conservation to achieve the objectives of the special project.\n  The concept of partnerships and cooperation is based on the highly \nsuccessful Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program (CREP). In a CREP, \na state and the Farm Service Agency agree to focus CRP resources on a \nspecific area within a state to address a specific conservation need. \nThe state usually agrees to provide some funding and technical \nresources to the CREP. With the new partnerships and cooperation, all \nconservation programs, not just CRP, could be leveraged to address \nspecific conservation needs and to produce watershed or regional \nconservation objectives.\n  I would like to provide an example for how the partnerships and \ncooperation authority could be used. A cannery has closed, and nearby \norchards are going out of business. A local watershed council pulls \ntogether several partners, such as a state university, a wildlife \norganization and an organic growers' cooperative. They agree to work \ntogether to improve water quality and wildlife habitat while working \nwith interested local producers to transition their orchards to organic \ngrass-based cattle operations.\n  The watershed council files an application with USDA proposing to \nconduct local producer outreach; provide training on transitioning to a \nnew agricultural sector, including organic certification and cattle \nmanagement workshops; assist with tree removal; and assist in \nimplementing habitat diversity practices with workshops, labor, and \nseed. The council asks for designation of these resources: $10 million \nin EQIP; $250,000 in the Wildlife Habitat Incentives Program (WHIP); \n1,000 acres of Continuous Conservation Reserve Program (CCRP); and \n20,000 acres in Grassland Reserve Program easements (GRP).\n  The State Conservationist and State Executive Director agree with the \nproposal and set aside the approved resources, which will go to \nproducers participating in the project. When the producer applies for \nthe programs, they certify that they are a project participant. If they \nare qualified, they bypass the regular program ranking processes and \nenter into a contract in the identified program(s). Each program in \nthis example stands on its own and all program rules apply. What is \ndifferent is the streamlined application and the process that works to \nmake the programs seamless in application.\n  In closing, I would like to repeat a story of an old man down on a \nhill farm in the South, who sat on his front porch as a newcomer passed \nby. To make talk, the newcomer said, ``Mister, how does the land lie \naround here?'' The old man replied, ``Well, I don't know about the land \na-lying; it's these real estate people who do the lying.''\n  W.C. Lowdermilk, the Assistant Chief of the Soil Conservation Service \nin the 1930s said:\n\n       In a very real sense the land does not lie; it bears a \n     record of what men write on it. In a larger sense, a Nation \n     writes its record on the land. This record is easy to read by \n     those who understand the simple language of the land.\n\n  Conservation leads to prosperous, healthy societies and stable, self-\nsufficient countries. It sustains the agricultural productivity that \nallows for division of labor and the growth and longevity of a society.\n  In 1938 and 1939, Mr. Lowdermilk studied the record of agriculture in \ncountries where land had been cultivated for many centuries. He sought \nto learn if the experience of these older civilizations could help in \nsolving the serious soil erosion and land productivity problems in the \nUnited States, then struggling with repair of the Dust Bowl and the \ngullied South. He found that careful land stewardship through \nterracing, crop rotation and other soil conservation measures enabled \nsocieties to flourish for centuries. But neglect of the land, \nmanifested as soil erosion, deforestation, and overgrazing, helped to \ntopple empires and destroy entire civilizations. He concluded that \nAmerica's future was tied to conservation and that this calling fell to \nthe Nation as well as the farmer and landowner.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to have helped develop the conservation \ntitle of the Food and Energy Security Act of 2007. I look forward to \nseeing its resources and programs used by this Nation's farmers, \nranchers, and forest landowners for generations to come.\n  The 2007 Senate farm bill includes a new title not contained in bills \nin the past of provisions regarding the livestock marketplace. I want \nto state very clearly that I have tremendous concerns with this title \nand do not support the vast majority of provisions included.\n  I know without question that the entire United States Senate is \nconcerned about farmers and ranchers and their ability to succeed in \nthe marketplace. The livestock industry plays a critical role in the \nhealth of rural America. Livestock and related industries account for \napproximately one half of the total farm-gate receipts to U.S. \nagricultural producers, employ half a million Americans, and create \napproximately $100 billion in economic activity. It is therefore \nclearly important that we make certain the livestock industry continues \nto thrive and make every effort to sustain the economic viability of \nthis critical sector of our economy.\n  In our efforts to assist constituents in the livestock marketplace, \nwe must exert extreme caution in how we attempt to address the \nagriculture sector. Our focus must be on expanding the options of \nproducers, rather than restricting their options and penalizing those \nsuccessful segments of the industry.\n  It is for this reason that I have serious concerns with some of the \nprovisions in this livestock title. The approach taken in this title is \nan attempt to regulate the industry to profitability, rather than \nstimulate innovation and encourage stronger relationships between the \nvarious industry segments.\n  I am pleased that industry--including livestock producers, packers, \nand retailers--were able to find a compromise on the issue of Mandatory \nCountry of Origin Labeling. While I have long supported a voluntary \nprogram, I believe the compromise included in this bill will allow all \nlivestock market participants to benefit from the program without being \nburdened by unworkable regulations and excessive fines. But outside of \nthis provision, there is very little in this title that I support.\n  The livestock title includes a provision that would ban the use of \nmandatory arbitration in livestock contracts unless both parties agree, \nafter the dispute arises, to utilize arbitration. Being from the great \nState of Georgia, I understand that poultry contract growers must be \nafforded the right to enter into fair and balanced contracts and to \nhave fair and just means to settle disputes when they arise. But I am \nconcerned that this provision will lead to increased litigation and \nwill not benefit our poultry industry in the long run.\n  The U.S. Chamber of Commerce opposes the anti-arbitration provisions \nin the title, because: The long-term effects of such provisions, if \nenacted, would cause serious damage to the general use and availability \nof alternative dispute resolution as well as weaken the Federal \nArbitration Act.\n\n[[Page S13756]]\n\n  Wisely, the House of Representatives has taken a different approach \nto this issue and attempted to strengthen the arbitration process in \norder to ensure that producers are treated fairly. I prefer the \napproach utilized by the House, but I recognize that many of the \nmembers of the Agriculture Committee view this issue differently.\n  I also would like to briefly address another provision that greatly \ntroubles me. The livestock title creates a special counsel for \nagricultural competition at the Department of Agriculture who will \nabsorb all of the responsibilities for enforcing the Packers and \nStockyards Act and the Agricultural Fair Practices Act. While I \nunderstand the issues that Members are attempting to address by \ncreating this position, I believe we are creating yet another level of \nbureaucracy at the Department that may in fact make enforcement of the \nPackers and Stockyards Act even more difficult.\n\n  The most troubling aspect of this special counsel provision is that \nhe is given the power to both investigate and prosecute violations \nunder the Packers and Stockyards Act and Agricultural Fair Practices \nAct. What we effectively do in this legislation is create an Office of \nInspector General within the Grain Inspection, Packers and Stockyards \nAdministration (GIPSA), and then give that office the power to \nprosecute as well. This is simply bad policy, that sets a bad \nprecedent, and will potentially lead to overzealous prosecutions and \nconfuse the current roles in the Department of Agriculture.\n  USDA is strongly opposed to this Special Counsel provision because it \nwill alter the current structure of USDA in an attempt to address \nproblems that the Department is already addressing. In fiscal year \n2007, USDA has handled more enforcement cases of the Packers and \nStockyards Act than in any year in the recent past. As a result of \nthese efforts, violators were assessed civil penalties totaling over \n$450,000 this past fiscal year. It is evident that GIPSA is making \ntremendous progress in their enforcement efforts. Rather than build on \nthese recent accomplishments, this provision will likely hamper \nenforcement efforts at GIPSA and create confusion in the livestock \nmarketplace.\n  The livestock title of this farm bill attempts to create a one-size-\nfits-all livestock marketplace where all producers are treated the same \nregardless of economics or free market principles. This approach is \nsimply not reflective of the industry today. Producers have made \ntremendous investments to improve the genetics, quality, and grades of \ntheir livestock in an effort to command a greater return for their \nproducts. And, contrary to the popular sentiment reflected in this \nlivestock title, many producers are experiencing great success in their \nefforts.\n  One producer from Mason City, IA, eloquently summed up his view of \nthe livestock marketplace in a letter to me and Senator Harkin. The \nproducer stated: We don't share the grim view of our industry that \nothers hold. We want you to know that our industry is doing well. We \nare able to prosper under the current law and regulations that apply to \nour businesses. For many producers, the stability that arises out of \nthe contracts they strike with packing companies are the key to their \nfinancial viability, helping them to obtain credit and avoid the \nharshest consequences of volatility in the markets.\n  I commend this producer and others like him who have worked hard to \nsecure their position in today's livestock marketplace.\n  The Georgia Cattlemen's Association also strongly opposes the \nprovisions included in this title. These hard-working men and women \nhave made substantial investments in their businesses in order to \ncompete in today's livestock marketplace. The supposed reforms in this \nlivestock title neglect their hard-fought efforts to secure markets for \ntheir superior products. Perhaps 15 years ago, these reforms would have \nmade sense. But today's marketplace has evolved and my Georgia \nproducers and many producers across this country have displayed the \nAmerican spirit and dedication necessary to evolve with that \nmarketplace and enjoy prosperity.\n  Rather than reduce the options available to these hard-working \nAmericans, it certainly would make more sense to provide them with \nevery option at their disposal so that they can continue to compete in \nthis evolving marketplace. Attempts to drag the livestock marketplace \nback to the way business was conducted 15 or 30 years ago will threaten \nthe livelihood of farmers and ranchers, drive down consumer demand for \nspecialized products, and increase costs--not only to packers, but to \nthe producers this livestock title attempts to serve.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to speak in \nsupport of the Food and Energy Security Act of 2007. First, I thank the \nvery able chairman of the Agriculture Committee, Senator Harkin, and \nthe ranking member, Senator Chambliss, for their leadership on this \nbill. We wouldn't be here today without their leadership. I, for one, \ndeeply appreciate the time and the effort they have poured into this \nbill. This has been months of determined effort to produce a consensus \nbill that can command a supermajority in the Senate. It certainly did \nin the committee. It passed without a dissenting vote.\n  First, Chairman Harkin. I applaud his vision for a new direction for \nfarm policy in America. Make no mistake, this is a very different farm \nbill because of Chairman Harkin's determination, leadership, and \nvision. This farm bill goes in a new direction with a much greater \ncommitment to conservation, one that I think over time will prove to \nhave been very wise, because we all know what is happening in the \nworld. We have to do more through the conservation elements of the \nprogram in order to be sustainable over time.\n  In addition to that, Chairman Harkin has played a lead role in \ncreating a new option for farmers with the State Revenue Assurance \nPlan. Of course, he has been a champion for rural development and for \nreform. Make no mistake, this bill is the beginning of significant \nreform. If anybody had told us 5 years ago we could get the elimination \nof the three-entity rule and direct attribution, we would have thought \nthe skies had opened up and there was a whole new day. The fact is it \nis in this bill.\n  I also applaud Senator Harkin's staff. Mark Halverson, his staff \ndirector, who you can see is now somewhat gray-haired. Anybody who has \ngone through what he has goes to gray, because this is tough. This is \nhard to do. The regional differences are deep across the country, as \nare the philosophical differences.\n  Senator Chambliss, the ranking member. We couldn't ask for a better \nranking member than Senator Chambliss. He did a terrific job as \nchairman, but he proved his mettle in helping us bring this farm bill \nto the floor. He is a consummate professional. I have worked with a lot \nof people over the years on farm legislation. It is always difficult; \nIt is always contentious. Yet we have produced some very good bills. I \nthink this one is by far the best. Senator Chambliss played an \nabsolutely essential role. Make no mistake, he fought for his people. \nHe did it effectively and in a collegial way, and that is what we would \nhope for in the Senate. He always had his eye on the ball, and that was \nto produce a result for American agriculture.\n  I also salute his staff, the very professional Martha Scott and \nBernie Hubert, who were terrific to work with every step of the way; \noutstanding individuals who reflect well on Senator Chambliss and \nreflect well on the body.\n  Additionally, I thank the outstanding work of the chairman of the \nFinance Committee, Chairman Baucus, and the ranking member, Senator \nGrassley, because without their help, it would have been infinitely \nmore difficult to write this bill. Let's say right at the beginning \nthat we have $8 billion of new resources here; in other words, we are \n$8 billion above the so-called baseline. The only reason we could do \nthat was because of the help of the Finance Committee. That has made a \nprofound difference. As a result, and as a result of the exceptional \nleadership of Chairman Harkin and Ranking Member Chambliss, this bill \nsignificantly improves commodity programs and energy. We are now \nembarked on a massive effort to reduce our dependence on foreign oil. \nIt is in this bill. It is critically important. There are also\n\n[[Page S13757]]\n\nnew resources for nutrition. Changes that have not been made in \nnutrition in over 30 years have been made in this bill, and people can \nbe proud of it; over $5 billion of new resources for nutrition. We \nshould recall, to all those who are listening, this isn't just a food \nand energy security bill; this is also at root a nutrition bill. Sixty-\nsix percent of the money in this bill is for nutrition in America. That \naffects every city and town, every farm gate, every ranch gate in \nAmerica. Sixty-six percent of the money in this bill is for nutrition. \nFor all of those critics--and there are legions of them out there--\nespecially in some parts of the media who have never bothered to \nactually look at this bill or read this bill or research what is in it, \nthey should know that 66 percent of this bill is for nutrition. The \nthing that draws most of their attack, the so-called commodity \nprograms, less than 14 percent; less than $1 in every $7 in this bill \nis for commodities.\n  Conservation. Because of Senator Harkin's vision and leadership, this \nis by far the most ambitious conservation program ever included in farm \nlegislation, and he is right. He is right to take us in that direction. \nThe people who are the critics should know that conservation and \nnutrition are at the centerpiece of this legislation, and rural \ndevelopment programs as well.\n  This legislation is good for farm and ranch families. It is good for \nrural communities and Main Street businesses. It is an enormous win for \nconsumers and taxpayers. This legislation is the product of countless \nhours of deliberation that represents a broad consensus.\n  Let me also say the occupant of the chair, Senator Salazar of \nColorado, played a key role time after time after time in bringing \npeople together. At the end of the day, what you learn in a legislative \nbody is you have to have an idea, a kernel of an idea for legislation, \nand it then has to be sold to so many people, and that is the difficult \npart. Bringing people together is an extraordinary skill. The occupant \nof the chair, Senator Salazar, has it in spades. I have told others we \nare lucky to have somebody of his character and somebody of his ability \nto talk to others, even when they disagree, to find areas of agreement. \nThat has been his great gift on this bill.\n  There are so many others whom I want to single out. Senator Debbie \nStabenow of Michigan, who is such a passionate advocate for specialty \ncrops. My goodness, Chairman Harkin, if we heard once, we heard 100 \ntimes from her about specialty crops, and boy, she has delivered for \nthose people in this bill, over $2.5 billion of new resources for \nspecialty crops. When you include everything, what a major advance for \nspecialty crops, and there is nothing better than this fresh fruit and \nvegetable program. Of course, the chairman is the champion of that \nprogram, but we are going to go from 14 States that have this fresh \nfruit and vegetable program for kids in schools, and it is going to go \nto all 50 States, and a dramatic increase in resources. Because we \nknow--we can see--what is happening in America. We can see what is \nhappening with obesity. We can see there has to be change, and there is \ndramatic change in this bill--change that I think every Member of this \nbody can be proud of. I mentioned Senator Baucus and the role he played \nas chairman of the Finance Committee. I can look down that table at \nothers who have contributed. This was a team effort, if ever there was \na team effort, on both the Republican and Democratic sides.\n\n  We appreciate the efforts of so many of our colleagues. I think of \nour friend from Arkansas, who was so passionate about defending her \npeople, Blanche Lambert Lincoln. It is tough when you are in a minority \nsituation. But she was absolutely determined that her people not be \nhurt. She worked tirelessly to make certain that was the outcome. So I \nappreciate the efforts of so many.\n  Ben Nelson of Nebraska, who comes from a farm State much like mine, \nwas so determined, as well, that we write a farm bill that could get \nthrough the committee on a strong bipartisan vote and get through the \nfloor on a supermajority, which we have done.\n  I thank Amy Klobuchar, who was so determined to make certain we would \nlook at cellulosic, recognizing that corn ethanol could not meet the \nambitious national goals set by the Congress of the United States, and \nthat we had to turn toward cellulosic. She was right there with ideas, \nadvice, and also a willingness to go colleague to colleague to persuade \nthem of the need. All of these people have made enormous contributions.\n  Of course, Senator Leahy's contribution on MILC programs, the former \nchairman of the committee. We deeply appreciate his contribution as \nwell.\n  It is difficult to write this bill because, as the chairman said, we \nhave a lot less money this time than last time. Let me put that in \nterms people will more easily understand, in visual terms. The red line \non the chart is the old CBO baseline, what the farm bill would cost. \nThe green bars are what this bill has actually cost and is projected to \ncost. If you net it all out, you find that the 2002 farm bill cost \nabout $20 billion less than the Congressional Budget Office said it \nwould in August of 2002.\n  Looking forward, we have $22 billion less in baseline to write this \nfarm bill than was estimated by the CBO in 2002. I took a call from Mr. \nChuck Connor, Acting Secretary, telling me they are going to \nrecommend--or say tomorrow that they would recommend a Presidential \nveto of this legislation. They do it on cost grounds. They have a \nnumber they throw out there that has no relationship to reality. It is \nan imagining on their part. It is their sort of make-believe writing up \nof the numbers.\n  The fact is we have $22 billion less in baseline to write this bill \nthan was predicted when we wrote the last one--$22 billion less. So we \nare $8 billion over the baseline and every penny of it paid for. That \nis a fact. It is also true that this bill was difficult to write not \nonly because we had less money but because the financial circumstances \nof the country changed dramatically. The debt of the country increased \nfrom $5.8 trillion at the end of 2001 to $8.9 trillion at the end of \nthis year. So we were writing this bill in a totally different \nenvironment than the last one. Back then, there were surpluses as far \nas the eye could see. Now it is red ink, debt. That profoundly changed \nthe circumstance.\n  In addition to that, we also face a very hostile media environment, \nespecially from the leading newspaper in this town, which hasn't seen a \nsingle initiative for farm and ranch families in this country that they \nlike. They have not been positive about one single thing. These \nheadlines say: ``Agriwelfare.'' ``Aid is a Bumper Crop to Farmers.'' \n``Aid to Ranchers was Diverted for Big Profits.'' ``No Drought Required \nfor Federal Aid.''\n  There are some elements of truth in every story, but the thing they \nmiss is the much larger story. What does the food policy in this \ncountry lead to? I will tell you: the lowest cost food in the history \nof the world. That is what this food policy leads to--the most \nplentiful and the safest supplies and the most ambitious nutrition \nprograms of any country in the free world. That is what is here.\n  Do you see one word of that printed in the Washington Post? Do you \nsee one word on the positive things that are here? Not one. They take \nevery little anomaly, every little exception, blow it into a big \nheadline, and take things out of context. They ought to be ashamed of \nthemselves. They take stories from people who have dedicated their \ncareers to dismantling the farm programs of the United States, which \nare the envy of the world.\n  Here is what happened to food expenditures as a share of disposable \npersonal income in our country. In 1929, 23 cents out of every dollar \nwent to buy food. Today it is 10 cents. That includes, by the way, \neating out. We are down to 10 cents of every dollar going for food in \nthis country.\n  There is a lot to be proud of in the agricultural policy of the \nUnited States. I would put this at the top: Who pays the least for food \nin the entire world? Who pays the smallest part of their disposable \nincome for food? We do. America pays the least. By the way, these \ncomparisons are looking in the other countries at food purchased for \nhome consumption. Our number is home consumption and eating out. Look. \nIndonesia, 55 cents out of every dollar goes to buy food. In the \nPhilippines, it is 38 cents. In China, it is 26 cents. In France, it is \n15 cents. In Japan, it is 14 cents. Remember, their numbers are food \nconsumed in the home. Our number--10 percent--is food\n\n[[Page S13758]]\n\nconsumed at home and food outside the home. What a dramatic difference \nit is, what our people are paying out of their disposable income for \nfood and what everybody else in the world is paying. We can be proud of \nthat.\n  We look at our major competitors--again, the Washington Post never \nwrites this story. Never. You know, we are not in this world alone. \nThere happen to be other countries. We happen to have tough \ncompetition. The Europeans are our leading competitors in agriculture. \nIn fact, they are about equal with us in terms of market share. Yet \nlook at what they do for their producers versus what we do for ours. \nThis is a 5-year baseline in the 2007 farm bill. This is what we are \ndoing for nutrition. We are providing five times as much for nutrition \nover the 5 years as we are for commodities--five times as much for \nnutrition as for commodities.\n\n  The Washington Post, why don't you write that story and tell people \nthe whole story? The other element I wished to mention that I was \nleading up to was what is happening with what the Europeans, our \nleading competitors, do for their producers versus what we do for ours. \nWashington Post, why don't you write this story? European Union, $134 \nbillion--and this is after their cap reform. This is what they are \nspending on farm supports, more than three times greater than the \nUnited States at $43 billion. I don't see the Washington Post telling \nthis story. I don't see them ever helping the American people to \nunderstand what we are up against in the real world--that our major \ncompetitors are spending more than three times as much as we are to \nsupport their producers.\n  What happens if you pull the rug out from under our producers? What \nwould happen? Mass bankruptcy, that is what would happen. Is that what \nwe want to do in this country? Do you want to bankrupt American \nagriculture? Do you want to bankrupt farm and ranch families? I don't \nthink so. So people need to think a little more carefully than some of \nthese columns I have seen written do. They owe it to the American \npeople to tell the whole story of what American food policy has meant.\n  I am going to also look at what our European friends are doing on \nexport subsidies. This is a pie chart of what the Europeans are doing \non export subsidies. They account for 87 percent of the export \nsubsidies in the world--the Europeans. The United States is this little \nsliver, 1 percent. The European Union is outgunning us 87 to 1. These \nare the hard realities that those of us who have a responsibility for \nwriting agricultural policy have to cope with. Those of us who have \nactual responsibility, those of us who will be held accountable, the \npeople in this Chamber, have to deal with reality, not fantasy, not \nmisrepresentations, not the exceptions. We have to deal with what is \nright at the heart of the effect of American farm policy.\n  I would like to read one paragraph from the Wall Street Journal \narticle from September 28 of this year. That article said this:\n\n       The prospect for a long boom is riveting economists because \n     the declining real price of grain has long been one of the \n     unsung forces behind the development of the global economy. \n     Thanks to steadily improving seeds, synthetic fertilizer and \n     more powerful farm equipment, the productivity of farmers in \n     the West and Asia has stayed so far ahead of population \n     growth that prices of corn and wheat, adjusted for inflation, \n     had dropped 75 percent and 69 percent, respectively, since \n     1974.\n\n  Let me repeat that:\n\n       Thanks to steadily improving seeds, synthetic fertilizer \n     and more powerful farm equipment, the productivity of farmers \n     in the West and Asia has stayed so far ahead of population \n     growth that prices of corn and wheat, adjusted for inflation, \n     had dropped 75 percent and 69 percent, respectively, since \n     1974. Among other things, falling grain prices made food more \n     affordable for the world's poor, helping shrink the \n     percentage of the world's population that is malnourished.\n\n  You never see that report in the Washington Post--not once, no. To \ncharacterize this bill and this policy as a giveaway to farmers is not \naccurate or warranted. Total farm bill outlays for the commodity, \nconservation, nutrition, energy, and other priorities are estimated to \nrepresent less than 2 percent of total Federal outlays. Here is total \nFederal outlays. Here is what is going to the farm bill. This farm bill \nis going to be less than 2 percent of total Federal expenditure, and \nthe commodity provisions that draw the fire are one-quarter of 1 \npercent.\n  We used to talk about the farm bill--the last farm bill being 3 \npercent of Federal outlays. Now we are down to less than 2 percent. \nThose who run out and--as the administration apparently will do \ntomorrow--chastise this bill for its spending, why don't they put it in \nperspective and level with the American people? Why don't they tell the \nwhole story? Why don't they tell them that the old farm bill used to \nconsume 3 percent of the Federal budget? This is down to 2 percent, and \nthe commodity programs that used to be one-third of 1 percent are down \nto one-quarter of 1 percent. Why not tell the whole story? Why not give \npeople the facts from which they can make a reasoned judgment?\n  We know the European Union is spending three times as much to help \ntheir producers as we spend to support ours. We know they are \noutspending us on export subsidies 87 to 1. We know the European Union \nis not the only culprit and that Brazil, Argentina, and China are \ngaining unfair market advantage through hidden subsidies.\n  I know what this means to my State. My State of North Dakota, \naccording to North Dakota State University, says that without the farm \nbill, net farm income in North Dakota would have decreased from $77,000 \nper farm to about $13,000 per farm--a reduction of $64,000. That is how \nsignificant this is. The average net farm income for all farms was \n$77,000. Without the provisions of the farm bill, net farm income would \naverage $13,000. The 2002 farm bill decreases the income variability by \n47 percent. These are facts.\n  So I conclude that our current farm policy is working not just for \nfarmers but for consumers and taxpayers. But that is not just my \nconclusion. Over the past 2 years, I have engaged in long conversations \nwith people all across my State. They told me the 2002 farm bill had \nbeen a great success, and they recommended that we build on those \nsuccesses by maintaining and rebalancing commodity programs, by \npromoting energy production in America so we are less dependent on \nforeign sources, so that instead of turning to the Middle East, we can \nlook to the Midwest. Wouldn't that be great for America? We are \nspending almost $300 billion a year importing foreign oil. How much \nbetter would our country be if that money could be spent here rather \nthan sending it to places all over the world?\n  The people back home have told me that ensuring predictable help is \navailable for producers stricken by disastrous weather should be part \nof the farm bill, that we should enhance the conservation of our land \nand provide new resources for nutrition. All of those items are in this \nfarm bill, and those who wrote it deserve to be proud.\n  Let me briefly talk about what I see as the high points of the bill \nbefore us.\n  In the commodity programs, this bill strengthens the producer safety \nnet by rebalancing support for many crops. It leaves direct payments \nuntouched. It increases loan rates for key American commodities, such \nas wheat, barley, sunflowers, and canola. It provides higher target \nprices for wheat, barley, oats, soybeans, and minor oil seeds that have \nfor many years been treated less generously, less fairly than other \ncommodities. Finally, it provides a new target price program for the \npulse crops.\n  The Sugar Program sees modest improvements. There is a new sugar loan \nrate, a sugar-to-ethanol program modeled after what they do in Brazil \nthat has led them to energy independence. They were at one time far \nmore dependent than we are. They were getting 80 percent of their \nenergy supplies from abroad. They are now on the brink of energy \nindependence. There is a higher sugar storage rate, and the bill \nimproves the safety net for dairy producers.\n  Specialty crop growers are getting a substantial boost under this \nbill. There is $2.5 billion of increased funding for nutrition, \nresearch, production, and market promotion programs that will further \ngrow our fruit and vegetable industry.\n  There are also reforms to eliminate abuse and make farm programs more \ntransparent. These include elimination of the three-entity rule and the \nrequirement for direct attribution of farm program payments. If \nsomebody is listening and says: What does that mean? very simply, it \nmeans there is\n\n[[Page S13759]]\n\ngoing to have to be a living, breathing human out there getting farm \nprogram payments. They are not going to be able to hide behind a \nmishmash of legalisms, they are not going to be able to hide behind \npaper entities and nobody knows who gets the money.\n  This bill provides a new State revenue-based countercyclical program \nand contains a supplemental agricultural disaster assistance program \nthat was crafted as part of the Senate Finance Committee work.\n  In particular, I again recognize Senator Baucus for his leadership on \ntaking a concept advanced by the National Association of State \nDepartments of Agriculture and making it a reality. It is extremely \nwell thought out.\n  We are also aware of the tremendous financial pain caused by \ndroughts, floods, hurricanes, and other acts of nature. When disasters \noccur, we respond, but sometimes those responses come much later than \nthey should. A standing disaster assistance program sets us on a \npredictable and logical path to deal with disaster-related conditions \nfor our farmers and ranchers.\n  In North Dakota 2 years ago, we faced conditions such as massive \nflooding, water as far as the eye could see, and there was no relief \nfor 2 long years. That should not happen in America.\n  This supplemental disaster program has the following elements: a \nsupplemental revenue assistance program that provides payments when the \nwhole farm revenue falls below the whole farm revenue guarantee; an \nimproved noninsured assistance program to more fairly protect crops \nthat are not currently covered by crop insurance. Some crops are not \ncovered by crop insurance. That doesn't mean there is not a program. \nUnder the current law, the most people can hope to recover is 27.5 \npercent of what they lose--27.5 percent. That is the most they can \npossibly recover of losses they might suffer because of a natural \ndisaster, 27.5 percent. Under this program, they will be able to do \nbetter.\n  There is a livestock loss assistance program to indemnify producers \nwhen deaths occur due to disaster-related conditions, a tree assistance \nprogram to help restore and replace damaged orchards and vineyards, and \na speciality crop pest and disease prevention program to reduce the \nlikelihood of disaster-related losses due to pest infestation.\n  The supplemental disaster program was built on sound principles \nauthored by the State commissioners of agriculture: One, a predictable \nagriculture disaster program; two, it covers program crops, speciality \ncrops, forage, and livestock; three, it provides assistance as a \npercentage of the difference between actual and expected whole farm \ncrop revenue; it complements crop insurance and noninsured assistance \nprograms. In fact, it creates an incentive to buy up. That is exactly \nwhat we should be doing, and that is in this bill.\n\n  This program is designed to be made available soon after a disaster \nhits, not after the auction signs go up. This picture is from my \nhometown newspaper earlier this year. ``First the drought, then the \nauction.'' This picture is showing a farm auction in North Dakota from \nthe perspective of this fellow's boot. I have been to these auctions. I \nhave watched the mother of the family crying at the kitchen table after \nlosing a farm that was in the family for five generations. I have seen \nfarmers and their kids and the looks of agony on their faces as \neverything they have known is taken in a few hours. I have seen it. \nAnybody who has felt the emotion knows what I am talking about--\nincredibly good and decent people who lost it all, not because of \nsomething they did but because of the vagaries of Mother Nature, \nbecause of disease, because of movements in a market that are the most \ndifficult to predict, other than the energy markets, of any market in \nthis country.\n  If we want farm and ranch families to just be wiped out by natural \ndisasters, we can do that, but that isn't America. When Katrina hit, \nAmericans rushed to help out. My wife and I called the Red Cross to \nmake our donation, and the man answering the phone told me he had never \nseen such an outpouring in his life of just average citizens digging in \ntheir own pockets to help people in another part of the country. That \nis America.\n  There is a history in farm country: If your neighbor gets sick and \nthe crop needs to be harvested, all the neighbors come together and go \nout and harvest that farmer's crop. If a barn burns down, they don't \nwait for the insurance settlement; the neighbors get together and they \nbuild that barn back up. That is a good thing. That is right at the \nheart of what makes America a great place.\n  Let me briefly talk about the energy title that helps us reduce our \ndependence on foreign oil. The reason the bill is called the Food and \nEnergy Security Act is because it makes smart investments in breaking \nour long-term dependence on foreign oil. That is why the energy title \nis the most exciting piece of this legislation, to me. It focuses on \ndeveloping cellulosic ethanol. We cannot reach the level of ethanol use \nCongress has called for without it. There are simply limits to what \ncorn-based ethanol can produce. With a cellulosic ethanol industry that \ncan turn prairie grass or wood waste into fuel, we will be able to take \nfull advantage of the agricultural abundance of our country. We have \nset ourselves on a path to freedom from relying on foreign despots for \nthe energy we need.\n  This energy title will provide more than $2.5 billion, including the \nFinance Committee tax credits, to encourage production of advanced \nbiofuels and renewable energy. The farm bill assists with biofuel and \nrenewable energy production in several ways: It provides assistance for \nthe establishment of renewable biomass crops; it includes grants and \nloan guarantees to develop advanced biofuels refineries; it provides an \nincentive for increased production of advanced biofuels; it helps \nfarmers and rural small businesses invest in energy efficiency and \nrenewable energy technologies; and it accelerates research and \ndevelopment of advanced biofuels.\n  I think this is the most exciting part of this bill. It is in every \nAmerican's interest that we do this and we do it sooner rather than \nlater. It is in this bill. It deserves people's support.\n  The conservation title enhances the conservation of our land with a \n$4.5 billion expansion from our current conservation efforts. It fully \nfunds successful programs, such as the Wetlands Reserve Program, which \nis important environmentally, and the Grasslands Reserve Program. It \nalso maintains the overall acreage limit for the Conservation Reserve \nProgram.\n  Additionally, $20 million is provided to fund the Open Fields \nInitiative that I offered with Senator Roberts. Open Fields underwrites \nState programs that offer incentives to farmers and ranchers who \nvoluntarily open their land to hunting, fishing, and people who might \njust want to take a walk or look at birds.\n  I am proud this bill boosts nutrition funding by almost $5.3 billion \nover 5 years. That is more than $1 billion higher than the House adds \nfor nutrition. In fact, nutrition gets a bigger increase than any other \narea in this bill. Within that total, $1 billion for the fresh fruit \nand vegetable program that the chairman has championed is going to make \na difference to kids in every State in the Union. Previously, we could \nonly provide assistance to 14 States. Now every State in the Nation \nwill be able to have a fresh fruit and vegetable program. We have also \nincreased funding for the Emergency Food Assistance Program by $550 \nmillion over 5 years. This additional funding will allow food banks to \nserve those most in need. Who among us has not heard from our food \nbanks that they are having an increasing difficulty meeting the demands \nmade on them?\n\n  Finally, we have updated a number of food stamp policies for the \nfirst time in 30 years. These changes represent an additional $3.7 \nbillion for that program.\n  In addition to all the important improvements I noted, this bill is \nfully paid for. It complies with the new pay-go budget discipline, and \nthat has not been easy. We will hear from the administration tomorrow \nthat somehow we have come up with $36 billion or $38 billion of new \nmoney. They arrived at that total by the most creative accounting I \nhave ever seen.\n  The fact is this bill is $8 billion over baseline. The further fact \nis that this bill allowed us $22 billion less than we had when we wrote \nthe last farm bill. Anybody who suggests this isn't fiscally \nresponsible is not looking very hard.\n\n[[Page S13760]]\n\n  When the 2002 farm bill was written, the Ag Committee had $73.5 \nbillion in new resources to utilize in addressing the challenges of \nthat bill. As many in this body remember, that was not an easy process. \nWell, this year the Agriculture Committee, working in close cooperation \nwith the Senate Finance Committee, had only $8 billion above baseline \nin new funding resources. And as I have indicated, even with that, we \nwere $22 billion below on a baseline basis of what was available for \nwriting the last farm bill. At the same time, by rebalancing and \nreformulating the commodity title and establishing a standing \nAgriculture Disaster Assistance Program, the committee has been able to \nmaintain and improve the economic safety net for our farmers, including \nthose who produce specialty crops. At the same time, the adjustments \nmade in the commodity title, when coupled with the funding made \navailable by the Finance Committee, allow this legislation to provide \nabout $10.7 billion that is used to address other priorities within the \njurisdiction of the Agriculture Committee.\n  So hear me now. Hear me now. We have reduced the commodity portion. \nWe have reduced crop insurance. Commodities provide 34 percent, crop \ninsurance provides 32 percent, and the Finance Committee provided 28 \npercent. Those are the funding sources to increase conservation by 39.4 \npercent of the total, nutrition got 46.8 percent of the increases, \nenergy 9 percent, and other 4.7 percent. So this is where the money \ncame from. It came from commodities and crop insurance and it went to \nconservation and nutrition. That is a fact.\n  That is not the only fact we ought to draw people's attention to. We \nalso ought to point out that if you look ahead on this farm bill to \nwhere all the money goes--you look at this whole bill and where the \nmoney goes--66 percent goes to nutrition, conservation 9 percent, crop \ninsurance 7.6 percent, commodity programs 13.6 percent--a dramatic \nreduction from the previous farm bill. And that is a fact. That is a \nfact. I think in the last farm bill commodities were at about 15 \npercent.\n  So this has been no easy task, but the farm bill we are considering \nrepresents a tremendous effort by Chairman Harkin, by Ranking Member \nChambliss, as well as by Chairman Baucus and Ranking Member Grassley. I \ntell you, I have never seen a better team effort in this Chamber, a \nmore bipartisan effort than was made on this farm bill. When has a farm \nbill ever come out of the committee--with 21 Members of the Senate on \nthat committee--when has a farm bill ever come out without a dissenting \nvote? I have been here 21 years. I have never seen that kind of \nbipartisan support as we saw for this bill. And why? Because it is \ndeserved. It is deserved because this bill breaks new ground. It is the \nbeginning of reform. It commits substantial new resources to nutrition \nthat is already by far the biggest part of farm legislation, and it has \nthe hope for America being able to reduce its dependence on foreign \nenergy. That is right at the heart of this bill. That is why we call it \nthe Food and Energy Security Act.\n  I commend the leaders for their hard work. It has been the result of \nmonths of bipartisan collaboration. And, as I have said, it is fully \npaid for. Over the next several days, I expect we will hear some \ncolleagues unfairly criticize the bill for providing an economic safety \nnet for our producers. Let me remind my colleagues that current law is \nestimated by CBO to spend almost 15 percent of total mandatory outlays \nfor the commodity programs, with 66 percent of the estimated outlays \ngoing to support food stamps and other nutrition programs to the needy, \nand just under 8 percent of the outlays are for resource conservation \nprograms.\n  Under the bill proposed by the Senate Agriculture Committee, the \namount for commodity programs is reduced more than 11 percent to 13.6 \npercent of total outlays. Spending for nutrition programs remains at \nabout two-thirds of total outlays, and conservation spending is \nincreased nearly 17 percent to 9 percent of total estimated spending.\n  In closing, this farm bill represents an investment in American \nagriculture that will benefit our producers, our rural communities, our \nMain Street businesses, taxpayers, and consumers, and particularly the \nmost needy among us. It deserves the support of every Senator.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, before I make my comments on the farm \nbill, I want to follow up on something that the Senator from North \nDakota said about the bipartisanship of this bill, and that is to \nremind people who might be listening that what they see on the evening \nnews about dissension within Congress does not present a very clear \npicture of the way Congress operates.\n  We can all say there is too much partisanship, but in the final \nanalysis, at least as far as the Senate goes, nothing is ever going to \nget done here unless it is bipartisan. So I compliment the Senator from \nNorth Dakota for speaking about the bipartisanship of the farm bill \nthat is now before the Senate, but I take that opportunity to remind \npeople when you have 51 Democrats and 49 Republicans and you have a \nfilibuster, it takes 60 votes to move forward to stop a filibuster and \nto get finality on a bill. We would never get anything done in the \nSenate if it weren't at least somewhat bipartisan.\n  I say to the American people who watch television at night and get \nfed up because there is talk about too much partisanship going on in \nthe Congress and too many things being done to make one party look \nbetter than the other party and vice versa, this farm bill is an \nexample of how things get done in the Senate because parties must work \ntogether or nothing would get done. This farm bill will be passed by \nthe Senate for the reason that it is bipartisan.\n  I thank my colleagues who have worked so hard on this bill, \nparticularly the leadership of the Senate Agriculture Committee, and \nSenator Harkin for his leadership in this area. It is a lot of hard \nwork to bring a bill to the floor that supports rural America when you \nconsider only about 2 percent of the people in this country are \nproducing the food that the other 98 percent eat.\n  While this bill isn't perfect, it is something that will help the \nfamily farmers. The most important job the committee has to do every 5 \nyears is to write a farm bill. It is not all we do. We operate in a lot \nof different areas. But one of the most important things the \nAgriculture Committee does is provide a safety net for farmers, and we \ngenerally review and rewrite that piece of legislation every 5 or 6 \nyears.\n  I am glad that in addition to the Agriculture Committee being \ninvolved in this bill, as the Senator from North Dakota has pointed \nout, the Finance Committee has had a part of the action, because we \nwere able to contribute to that process and free up over $3 billion for \nthe Agriculture Committee to spend on priorities that are very \nimportant for the Agriculture Committee.\n  What is more, for the first time I am aware of, we will be merging \nour agricultural tax policy with the Agriculture Committee's \nauthorization and spending policy. This bipartisan tax package frees up \nconservation dollars for programs that we have backlogs in, closes tax \nloopholes, provides support for our growing cellulosic technology for \nethanol, encourages rural economic development, and helps family \nfarmers to get started in the business of agriculture.\n  I have never been a big proponent for a permanent disaster program, \nbut there are a few key items I want to point out about the bill that \nis before us. This program will set up a permanent system to administer \ndisaster aid. We won't have to go through the trouble then of setting \nup a new way to administer a disaster program every time we do an ad \nhoc disaster package, as we have done from year to year as disasters \nmight happen.\n  Also, what is most important to me about this part of the farm bill \nthat comes from the Finance Committee is that it is tied directly to \ncrop insurance. We want to promote farmers managing their own risk, and \none way to do that is through the crop insurance program. Now, the crop \ninsurance program might not cover all disasters, so that is why this \nprogram is set up. But as a precondition to participating in the \ndisaster program that is in the Finance Committee's provisions that\n\n[[Page S13761]]\n\nare going to go into this farm bill is that each farmer who wants to \nbenefit from it has crop insurance.\n  In my home State of Iowa, we have a very successful crop insurance \nsystem. I like that farmers have to take risk mitigation into their own \nhands. Tying the two together was the only way it would work. I know \nthis body will be looking at additional provisions that might affect \nthe crop insurance program. I am not opposed to changes, but I urge my \ncolleagues to be careful that we don't undermine a successful risk tool \nfor our farmers. I believe we should give producers as many tools as \npossible to provide them an adequate safety net. An optional revenue \nprotection program is a step in the right direction. Farmers should be \nable to make the best choices for their individual operations based \nupon the level of risk management that they, as their own manager, \ndecide they need. I am glad to see that option included in the farm \nbill, and I look forward to anybody suggesting improvements in that \nprogram.\n  One of the most important titles in the Agriculture Committee bill, \nand it is added for the first time to a farm bill, is the livestock \ncompetition title. I am glad to see a compromise on legislation that we \ncall COOL--an acronym for country-of-origin labeling--and I look \nforward to the law being implemented quickly. This COOL legislation was \nactually passed 5 years ago, but it has been held up by action on \nseparate appropriations bills over the years so that this law has never \nbeen implemented. Hopefully, once and for all, it will be implemented, \nbecause it is a darned good time to let consumers know where their food \ncomes from. The country of origin of their food is as important as \ntheir knowing the country of origin of any other product they might buy \nas a consumer in the United States. That is the law for every other \nproduct that consumers buy--that they know what country it comes from--\nso why not the same requirement for food as well?\n  We have also put a ban on mandatory arbitration in production \ncontracts. This isn't to say a producer can't agree to arbitration once \na dispute arises. In fact, I am very much a supporter of the process \ncalled arbitration, but I am very much opposed to mandatory \narbitration. Because of this legislation, processors can no longer \nforce these arbitration clauses on farmers who have no choice but to \nsign the contract for lack of competition.\n  I am also very pleased that my amendment to ban packer ownership for \nowning or feeding livestock has been accepted into this package by \nSenator Harkin and other leaders on the committee. This is very good \nnews for small livestock producers who deserve to make sure the \ncompetitive marketplace is working. One of the things that brings this \nabout is the meat processing industry has said very clearly from time \nto time: Why do they own livestock? They own livestock--they say, in \ntheir words--because when prices are high, they can kill their own \nlivestock. When prices are low, they buy from the farmer. I think it is \neasy to see how demoralizing that is to the family farmer when he sees, \nworking hard to produce a product, that somehow he can be undercut by \nthe vertical integration of meat packers owning their own livestock.\n  While this does not accomplish all that we need in this area of \nenhanced competition for the family farmer, it is an important first \nstep toward remedying the biggest problem facing farmers today, the \nproblem of concentration in agriculture, particularly in agribusiness. \nSenator Harkin and I, along with other Members of this body, will be \noffering additional reforms that are critical to a vibrant future in \nthe livestock industry. I call on my fellow Senators to support the \nlivestock title and these additional reforms.\n  Another issue I have been working to address through the farm bill \nrelates to the administrative rules issued by a department unrelated to \nagriculture, the Department of Homeland Security--well, related in the \nsense that they have responsibilities to make sure that products coming \ninto our country are safe. But this regulation I am talking about is \ntheir attempt to regulate stored quantities of propane energy sources.\n  Earlier this year, the Department of Homeland Security issued \nregulations that required registration of all propane tanks storing \n7,500 pounds of propane. These regulations were unduly burdensome and \ndisproportionately impacting rural American homeowners, farmers, and \nrural small businesses. Senator Harkin included a provision in the farm \nbill that I authored that would reduce this impact on rural Americans.\n  Coincidentally, after the provision was included, the Department of \nHomeland Security stepped up and increased the threshold quantity of \npropane, exempting many small homeowners, farmers, and small businesses \nby excluding tanks smaller than 10,000 pounds of propane and raising \nthe threshold to 60,000 pounds per large tanks. That is a movement in \nthe right direction. This change in regulation by the Department of \nHomeland Security is welcome, but the Department should have alerted \neveryone in advance and eliminated the need for us to include a \nprovision in this bill at all. That said, we are currently working on \nsome new language that would ensure that the Department of Homeland \nSecurity reports to Congress on the impact its new rule will have and \nensure that rural Americans are not disproportionately impacted.\n  As a family farmer on the Agriculture Committee, I have made it my \njob to look out for small- and medium-sized family farmers. However, \nthe position of the family farmer has become increasingly weaker as \nthere has been consolidation in agribusiness, and it seems to have \nreached an alltime high. Farmers today have fewer buyers for their \nproducts and fewer suppliers to buy their inputs from. It seems this \nconcentration is more now than ever before. The result is an increasing \nloss of family farms and the smallest farm share of the consumer dollar \nin history. It is important for us to remember that family farmers \nultimately derive their income from the agricultural marketplace, not \nfrom the farm belt. Family farmers have, unfortunately, been in a \nposition of weakness in selling their products to large processors and \nin buying their imports from large suppliers.\n  I have been fighting for real payment limitations since the last farm \nbill. I have, to some extent, over a period of decades in Congress, \nhelped to pass farm bills. Senator Dorgan of North Dakota and I realize \nthat a hard cap on payments is a most effective tool in helping our \nsmall farmers get a level playing field with the corporate megafarms. \nAsk a taxpayer if a quarter of a million dollars is enough for a \nfarmer. That is what our cap is going to be. I think we would all know \nthe answer to that question would be very positive.\n  The family farmer continues to struggle with land prices literally \nskyrocketing. Landlords know what kind of payments the farmer is \ngetting and takes that into account in the rent they charge. We cannot \nsit idly by and do nothing while family farmers suffer. I certainly am \nnot going to. That is why I pushed for reform in our laws that has an \neffect on family farmers and particularly in helping young farmers get \nstarted in farming.\n  The time for real reform is now. Our family farmers deserve it. I \nthink we have a good start on a good package for rural America. An \nadequate safety net will assure us a safe and abundant food supply. It \nis critical to our economic and energy independence for the future. I \nlook forward to the debate over the next few days to improve this bill, \nand I would like to highlight the issue of a hard cap on farm payments.\n  Presently, we have 10 percent of the large farmers in America getting \n72 percent of all the money we put into a farm bill. There is nothing \nwrong with big farmers getting bigger, but there is something wrong \nwhen we have subsidies and farm programs going to big farmers who are \ngetting bigger partly because of subsidies. What we want to do is \nmaintain urban support for a farm safety net for farmers. It seems, in \norder to maintain that safety net, we are going to have to maintain \ncredibility with urban taxpayers and urban consumers. We cannot do that \nvery easily when big farmers--10 percent--are getting 72 percent of the \nbenefits out of it because the taxpayers in the cities are going to \nstart raising the question: What is this farm safety net all about if \nit is only helping the biggest of farmers? To get a farm bill\n\n[[Page S13762]]\n\nthrough the House of Representatives, where urban representation is so \nall-powerful, it is very important for us to take that into \nconsideration.\n  Another factor we need to take into consideration is the extent, as I \nhave already alluded to, this drives up the cash rent, so it is very \ndifficult for a generation of new farmers to start farming when they \nhave the unfair competition of 10 percent of biggest farmers getting 72 \npercent of the benefits out of the farm program.\n  Then it seems to me we ought to take into consideration what has been \nthe history of the safety net for family farmers. It generally has been \ntargeted toward medium- and small-sized farmers. Why? Because these are \nthe people, when they have an opportunity to farm and things happen \nthat are beyond their control--that could be a natural disaster; that \ncould be Nixon freezing beef prices, as he did; it could be, in the \nsame administration, prohibiting the export of soybeans when they got \n$13 a bushel, driving it down to maybe $3 a bushel in just a matter of \na few days. You can have international war. You can have energy at a \nhigh price as it is now because of OPEC. All of these are beyond the \ncontrol of the family farmer. The small- and medium-sized farmer does \nnot have the ability to withstand some of these things that are beyond \nhis control. But there is a certain level of efficiency, a certain \nlevel of bigness in farming where you have enough staying power so that \nyou can withstand some of that.\n\n  We, through payment limits, have tended to target the farm program \ntoward small- and medium-sized farmers. It is quite obvious that when \n10 percent of the biggest farmers get 72 percent of the benefit out of \nthe farm program, that targeting is no longer the case. What Senator \nDorgan and I are trying to do in our amendments that will come up \nshortly is to make sure we keep that targeting and safety net what it \nreally is--a safety net to help people when they have problems beyond \ntheir own control, to overcome them, to survive in business, to keep \nproducing. Why? Because we have come to the conclusion, after a century \nand a half, that the family farmer is the most efficient food-producing \ninstitution anywhere in the world. We ought to maintain it. We ought to \nkeep it strong. This legislation will do that. Some improvements we can \nmake in that legislation in the areas of payment caps will help even \nmore so.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to come to the floor of the \nSenate to support the farm bill. I believe the committee has produced a \ngood bill. I believe, as my colleagues Senator Conrad and Senator \nGrassley have said, and before them Senator Harkin and Chambliss--they \nhave talked about the need for a farm bill, No. 1, and, No. 2, the \nability to produce a bill that gives farmers some hope.\n  It is late in the year. My hope is we can pass a bill here, go to \nconference with the House, and give farmers and their lenders and \nothers some certainty by the end of this year about what the rules will \nbe, what the farm program will be as they begin to think about getting \ninto the fields in the spring. They are already planning for spring \nplanting, and they need to understand what the rules are.\n  This is a very important debate. I congratulate and say to my \ncolleagues: You have done a good job. It has been bipartisan. I, like \nmy colleague from Iowa, Senator Grassley, believe we can improve it in \na couple of places. I believe we can do that, but I support this bill.\n  I want to try to give some description to what this is about. It is \nnot just about statistics. It is not just about theory. It is about \npeople who populate this country, living out on the land by themselves, \nunder a yard light, trying to raise a family, trying to raise a crop, \nrisking everything. They are called family farmers and ranchers. In \nmost cases, they live out in the country alone. It is them against the \nodds. They are having to confront uncertain weather, uncertain \ncommodity prices, and uncertain international events that can affect \nwhether they can make a living or not--all of these things.\n  We are here in suits and ties, and we debate. What a wonderful thing. \nUnlike us, the farmers take a shower after work. We take a shower \nbefore work, and then we put on a suit and tie. But the family farmers \nin this country, in most cases they get up and do chores. They say it \nis doing chores--5, 6 in the morning, get up, get out, and get busy. \nThey work hard all day, and they are out there by themselves. They are \na sole proprietor running their own business, living under a yard \nlight, hoping things go well. They plant a crop; they plant a seed in \nthe ground. They hope it will grow. Maybe it will. They hope they don't \nget too much rain. They hope they get enough rain. They hope if the \nseed grows it doesn't develop some sort of plant disease. They hope it \ndoesn't hail, and they hope at some point they will be able to harvest \nit. And when they harvest it, they hope there will be a price at the \nelevator that gives them half a shot at making a profit.\n  These are all hopes. The only way a farmer can live is on hope--hope \nthat things will be better, hope that tomorrow is going to be better. \nThese are families who live on hope.\n  This piece of legislation, this farm bill, gives those families some \nassurance, a safety net, to get them over difficult times.\n  When price swings move up and down, this safety net is a bridge over \nthose price valleys that say to family farmers: We think you matter to \nthis country. We think the fact that you exist makes a difference. We \nthink the fact that families produce America's food makes a difference \nto this country.\n  Now, family farms produce a lot more than crops. They also produce \ncommunities. I come from one of those communities, 300 people. The \narteries that fed life into that small community were the family \nfarmers all around it. On Saturday nights, you could not find a parking \nplace on Main Street because family farmers came to town to talk about \nthe weather, talk about the crops, visit with neighbors. It is what a \nrural lifestyle is about. It is about producing communities.\n  An author named Critchfield once described family values in America. \nHe said: Family farms are the very seedbed of family values.\n  And those family values roll from the family farms to small towns to \nbig towns to nurture and refresh the value system of this country.\n  There is a poet in North Dakota who is a farmer and rancher named \nRodney Nelson. Rodney wrote a piece that asked, plaintively: What is it \nworth? It says exactly what should be said here. He asked this \nquestion: What is it worth for a kid to know how to plow a field? What \nis it worth for a kid to know how to grease a combine? What is it worth \nfor a kid to know how to pour cement? What is it worth for a kid to \nknow how to weld a seam? What is it worth for a kid to know how to \nbuild a lean-to? What is it worth? He said: All of those skills you \nlearn on the family farm. It is the only university in our country \nwhere they teach all of those skills. What is it worth to the country, \nhe asks?\n  It is a good question. I hope the answer is rooted in a farm bill \nthat says to those family farms: We want you to have a chance to \ncontinue because we think you add great value to our country, to our \nculture.\n  There are many who do not have the foggiest notion of what family \nfarming is about. I remember I took a Congressman with me from the east \ncoast to come to North Dakota on a trip some while ago. We went to \nNorth Dakota, and one of the stops was at a dairy barn, George Doll's \ndairy barn, north of New Salem, ND.\n  We stood in that dairy barn with the soft light of the late afternoon \ncoming through the boards on that barn. The cattle came in to be \nmilked. The milk cows came in and went to their assigned stanchions, \nand George Doll and his wife began milking 80 cows.\n  And my colleague from the east coast, in a blue pin-stripped suit, \nobserved this standing in that dairy barn, and realized this is a lot \nof work. So, finally, he said to me: How often do they do this, Byron?\n  I said: Well, they do this twice a day. They do this in the morning \nand again in the evening.\n  I said to George: What time do you get up?\n  He said: We start about 5 in the morning, then we do it about 5 in \nthe evening.\n  Then he watched for a while more and then he said to George, he said:\n\n[[Page S13763]]\n\nGeorge, do you have to do this on weekends?\n  He did not know you milk cows 7 days a week, twice a day. He did not \nknow that. There would have been no reason to know that milk comes from \nanywhere but a carton, unless you go to a farm that is milking cows and \nsee what kind of work it is.\n  So it seems to me there is much to be said about the value system, in \ntalking about family farming.\n  Now, I wish to make one other point. Some talk about agriculture. I \nprefer to talk about family farming. If this is not about family farms, \nwe do not need the bill. We would have probably separate pieces of \nlegislation dealing with nutrition and so on, food stamps.\n  But it seems to me the question of a safety net is almost exclusively \nthe question: Do we want to try to help family farmers through tough \ntimes? The big corporate agrifactories, they can make it through tough \ntimes. If you have a real tough time, price depressions and other \nthings, the big corporate agrifactories, they can make it through \nthere, but the family farms get washed away. So we developed instead a \nsafety net. That safety net is rooted in the legislation before us, \nwhich incidentally I think improves the safety net.\n  That is why I like this bill. It also includes a disaster title. That \nis why I like this bill. I think it was important to do. I had included \na separate piece of legislation calling for a disaster title. I am very \npleased this bill contains a disaster title.\n  Now, my colleague from Iowa indicated he felt there should be some \nadditional reform, as do I, so we will offer, perhaps tomorrow or \nperhaps a day later, a piece of legislation that will provide some \nfurther limitations on payments.\n  Why would we do that? Because I worry what is going to happen is we \nare going to erode the support for the farm program if we do not \nprovide the reforms and changes that are necessary. One of those \nreforms, and part of that change is payment limitations, so that we are \nstructuring this to try to provide the most help to family-sized farms.\n  I do not have anything against big corporate agrifactories. If they \nwant to farm two or three counties, God bless them. But I do not think \nthe Federal Government has a responsibility to be their banker. They \nare big enough to be a big corporate agrifactory, and they have got the \nfinancial strength to get through tough times.\n  We ought to provide a safety net to help those families through tough \ntimes to stay on the land. So the proposal we offer is a proposal that \ndoes say a couple of important things: One, there is a \npayment limitation of $250,000, a hard cap.\n\n  I will admit the piece of legislation that has come to the floor of \nthe Senate includes some significant improvements. It eliminates the \nthree entity rule, which is a significant reform. It has an adjusted \ngross income requirement, of sorts. So it does make some progress in a \ncouple of areas. But it does not, for example, cap payments for all of \nthe payments. It has been said that the committee bill caps payments at \n$200,000.\n  But it leaves out the LDP, the marketing loan, or loan deficiency \npayment. Because it exempts marketing loans and makes them unlimited, \nevery single bushel of commodity in America has effectively an \nunlimited price support.\n  Well, there needs to be a limitation on that, on the direct payment, \nthe countercyclical payment, and the marketing loan, which produces an \nLDP. There ought to be a limitation.\n  Second, it seems to me reasonable that we would limit farm program \npayments to those who are actively involved in farming. That ought not \nbe radical. An arts patron from San Francisco, I will not use her name, \nbut a patron of the arts in San Francisco gets $1.2 million in support \npayments over three years. An arts patron who has nothing to do with \nfarming, her grandfather had something to do with farming, but she does \nnot, she collects $1.2 million from the farm program.\n  Is that sort of thing going to ruin the reputation of the farm \nprogram at some point? I think it will. Another related problem is what \nthey call cowboy starter kits. They have a situation in rice country \nwhere, going back to 1985, if you grew rice on the land, you now own \nthat land, and it is still rural land, you do not have to produce rice \nfor a quarter century, you get a farm program payment. You do not have \nto be a farmer to get the payment.\n  In Texas, north of Houston, they were selling cowboy starter kits. \nTen acres of land, put a house on 1 acre, run a horse on 9 acres. You \nhave never farmed, you do not have to farm, and you have 9 acres you \ncan get farm program price supports because they grew rice on it 20 \nyears ago. That is not justifiable.\n  One of the ways to shut that done, of course, very simply and very \neffectively, is to say: If you are going to get benefits, you have to \nhave some real tangible connection to farming.\n  So my colleague, Senator Grassley, and I will offer an amendment that \nis very simple. It is not at amendment that is attempting to undo this \nimportant piece of legislation, it is an attempt to improve it and \nimprove it in a way that will give it even more credibility.\n  A payment limitation of $250,000 and a requirement that you have \nactive involvement in farming if you are going to get a farm program \nbenefit. So that is what we would intend to do. My hope is that working \nwith Senator Harkin and Senator Chambliss, we will be able to offer \nthat, perhaps tomorrow.\n  I would be willing to come in the morning, and with my colleague, if \nhe is available, I see he is still on the floor, and perhaps we can \nreach agreement, offer an amendment, and have that debate.\n  At any rate, it is my hope to be helpful to both the chairman and \nranking member to move this legislation. We are going to have a couple \nof these discussions where there will be disagreement, we will have a \nvote, we will see what the view of the Senate is. But I want this piece \nof legislation to be done. I would like to improve it some. But I give \nthis bill good marks. I am going to be a supporter on the floor of the \nSenate, working to try to get this through the Senate, get it passed, \nget it to conference so we can tell family farmers: Here is what we are \ngoing to do. Here are the rules.\n  I might say, finally, I hope when we have completed our work, I hope \nthe President will be supportive as well. That is another part of this \nprocess. I know many are working with the President for that support.\n  As I have indicated earlier, I know there are thousands, tens of \nthousands, hundreds of thousands of farmers out around the country \nwaiting for an answer. What will the farm program be as they begin to \nthink about getting into the fields next spring? They can hardly wait. \nThat is the nature of being a farmer.\n  I mean they want to get on a tractor, they want to get moving, they \nwant to plant some seeds, they want to buy some cattle. That is the way \nit is because they live on hope.\n  My expectation is we can give them much greater hope if we pass a \npiece of legislation that says to them: This country wants to invest in \nyour future. If you are a farmer living out there alone, trying to \nraise a crop and a family and you run through a tough patch, you run \nthrough some tough times, we want to help you.\n  The farm bill says to those farmers: You are not alone. This country \nbelieves in the merit and value of having a network of family farms \npopulating this country, producing food for a hungry country.\n  Having said all that, let me again thank my colleagues for the bill \nthey have produced. I look forward to being here tomorrow with my \ncolleague, Senator Grassley, and offering an amendment. Then further, \nworking this week, perhaps by the end of this week or at least into \nnext week, to get this piece of legislation through and get a final \nvote on it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 10 \nminutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/05/senate-section/article/S13763-1", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13763-S13765]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           IMMIGRATION REFORM\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, earlier this year, the Senate tried to \nsolve the very complex and emotional issue\n\n[[Page S13764]]\n\nof immigration reform. The immigration bill we considered included \nborder security, interior enforcement, and amnesty.\n  It also included many needed reforms to our legal immigration \nprocess. I said throughout the debate that Congress needs a long-term \nsolution to the immigration issue. We cannot pass a bandaid approach \nthat includes a path to citizenship for law breakers; rather, Congress \nneeds to improve our legal immigration channels.\n  I firmly believe companies want to hire legal workers, and people \nwant to enter the United States legally. If we fix our visa policies, \nwe can restore integrity to our immigration system, and all parties can \nbenefit. But if we cannot pass a comprehensive bill--and I think as \ntime goes on it is going to look more difficult as we go into an \nelection year--if we cannot pass such a comprehensive bill, I think \nthat we should consider passing legislation we can agree on.\n  I am taking the floor at this time to talk about the H-1B visa \nprovisions that were included in the immigration bill and ask my \ncolleagues to take a second look at these needed reforms.\n  Many companies use H-1B programs. It has served a valuable purpose. \nBut we need to reevaluate how this program operates and work to make it \nmore effective. The H-1B program was officially created in 1990, \nalthough we have brought foreign workers legally into our country for \nover 30 years.\n  It was brought into existence to serve American employers that needed \nhigh-tech workers. It was created to file a void in the U.S. labor \nforce. The visa holders were intended to file jobs for a temporary \namount of time, while the country invested in American workers to pick \nup the skills our economy needed.\n  We attached fees to the visas that now bring in millions of dollars. \nThese fees and the dollars that come with it are invested in training \ngrants to educate our own workforce. We use the funds to put kids \nthrough school for science, technology, engineering, and math skills. \nWe provide students with scholarships with the hope that they will \nreplace imported foreign workers.\n\n  Unfortunately, the H-1B program is so popular, it is now replacing \nthe U.S. labor force rather than supplementing it. The high-tech and \nbusiness community is begging Congress to raise or eliminate the annual \ncap that currently stands at 85,000 visas each year. These numbers do \nnot include and account for those who are exempt from the cap. For \ninstance, we don't count employees at institutions of higher education \nor nonprofit research organizations. We don't count those who change \njobs or renew their H-1B visa. My point is, we have many more than \n85,000 H-1B visas distributed each year. I am here to tell my \ncolleagues that increasing the visa supply is not the only solution to \nthe so-called shortage of high-tech workers.\n  Since March of this year, the Senator from Illinois, Mr. Durbin, and \nI have taken a good look at the H-1B visa program. We have raised \nissues with the Citizenship and Immigration Service as well as the \nDepartment of Labor. We have asked questions of companies that use the \nH-1B visa, and I have raised issues with attorneys who advise their \nclients on how to get around the permanent employment regulations. I \nwould like to share what I have learned. I want to give some fraud and \nabuse examples. Unfortunately, there are some bad apples in the H-1B \nvisa program.\n  In 2005, a man was charged with fraud and misuse of visas, money \nlaundering, and mail fraud for his participation in a multistate scam \nto smuggle Indian and Pakistani nationals into the United States with \nfraudulently obtained H-1B visas. The man created fictitious companies, \noften renting only a cubicle simply to have a mailing address. He \nfabricated tax returns and submitted over 1,000 false visa petitions.\n  Another man pled guilty last August to charges of fraud and \nconspiracy. This man and an attorney charged foreign nationals \nthousands of dollars to fraudulently obtain H-1B visas. He provided \nfalse documents to substantiate their H-1B petitions. The Programmer's \nGuild, a group representing U.S. worker interests, filed over 300 \ndiscrimination complaints in the first half of 2006 against companies \nthat posted ``H-1B visa holder only'' ads on job boards. Anyone can go \non the Internet and find jobs that target H-1B visa holders.\n  There are more than just national anecdotes, however. Everyday \nAmericans are affected. Since looking into the H-1B visa program, some \nof my constituents have come to me and spoken out against abuses they \nsee. One of my constituents has shared copies of e-mails showing how he \nis often bombarded with requests by companies that want to lease their \nH-1B workers to that Iowan. There are companies with H-1B workers who \nare so-called ``on the bench,'' meaning they are ready to be deployed \nto a project. Hundreds of foreign workers are standing by waiting for \nwork. Some call these H-1B ``factory firms.'' This Iowan even said one \ncompany went so far as to require him to sign a memorandum of \nunderstanding that helps the H-1B factory firm justify to the Federal \nGovernment that they have adequate business opportunity that requires \nadditional visa holders. It is a complete falsification of the market \njustification for additional H-1B workers.\n  These firms are making a commodity out of H-1B workers. They have \nvisa holders but are looking for work. It is supposed to be the other \nway around. There should be a shortage or a need, first and foremost. \nThen and only then do we allow foreign workers to fill these jobs \ntemporarily.\n  Another constituent sent me a letter saying that he saw firsthand how \nforeign workers were brought in while Iowans with similar \nqualifications were let go. He tells me he is a computer professional \nwith over 20 years experience. He was laid off and has yet to find a \njob. He states:\n\n       I believe [my employer] has a history of hiring H-1B \n     computer personnel at the expense of qualified American \n     citizens.\n\n  Another Iowan from Cedar Falls wrote in support of our review of the \nH-1B program. He is a computer programmer with a master's degree and \nover 20 years of work experience in that field. He says:\n\n       Despite all of my qualifications, in the last four years I \n     have applied to over 3,700 positions and have received no job \n     offers.\n\n  He believes he is in constant competition with H-1B visa holders.\n  I received a letter from a man in Arizona who works for a company \nthat employs dozens of H-1B workers. When he asked his supervisor why \nso many foreign nationals were being hired, the head of human resources \nsaid:\n\n       If the company has an American and a person from India, \n     both with the same skill set, the company will hire the \n     person from India because they can pay them less.\n\n  These are firsthand stories from U.S. workers. I ask those begging \nfor an increase in foreign workers to explain these cases to me. Why \nare Americans struggling to get jobs as software developers, data \nprocessors, and program analysts?\n  Senator Durbin and I inquired with several foreign-based companies \nthat use the H-1B program. Rather than sending a letter to all \ncompanies that use the program, which would be over 200 companies, we \ndecided to start our investigation with foreign-based entities. Our \nintention was to learn how foreign companies are using our visas. We \nlearned that the top nine foreign-based companies used 20,000 visas in \n2006. Think of what a high percentage that is of the 85,000, just nine \nforeign-based companies, 20,000 visas in the year 2006. I say that \ntwice for emphasis. It just so happens that Indian companies are using \none-third of the available visas we allocate each year, but there is \nmore to learn. We are not done asking questions. We, meaning Senator \nDurbin and I, continue to talk to U.S.-based companies and companies in \nour own States that use the program.\n  The Citizenship and Immigration Service also has concerns. Our review \nhas prompted discussion among the executive branch, businesses, labor \nunions, and workers, and workers are the ones we are concerned about. \nSo we are not the only ones asking questions. The U.S. Citizenship and \nImmigration Service is also worried about fraud in the program. This \nagency's investigative arm, that subdivision called the Fraud Detection \nand National Security unit, is doing a fraud assessment of the H-1B and \nL visa programs. I asked the unit to brief my staff on their work, and \nthey reported they are not finished with analyzing the data. Senator \nCollins of Maine and I put the agency on\n\n[[Page S13765]]\n\nnotice that we are anxiously awaiting this report so we may continue \nour quest to reform the program appropriately. In the meantime, the \nbill Senator Durbin and I introduced includes measures to rein in the \nabuse. It goes a long ways to close some loopholes to protect American \nworkers. It is our hope that these measures will bring the program back \nto its original mission; that is, to help U.S.-based companies find \nhighly skilled workers to fill the shortage for a temporary period of \ntime. That is what the H-1B visa program is all about.\n\n  Under current law, companies can bring in foreign workers on an H-1B \nvisa without first attempting to hire an American. Our bill would \nrequire every employer to attest that it is not displacing a U.S. \nworker by hiring an H-1B visa holder and that the employer has taken \ngood-faith steps to recruit U.S. workers for the jobs in which an H-1B \nvisa holder is being sought. Why would anyone oppose this measure? Our \nbill also gives more oversight and investigative authority to the \nDepartment of Labor. Right now the Department may only review labor \ncertification for ``clear indication of fraud and misrepresentation.'' \nThe Secretary of Labor is unable to review applications for anything \nbut what the law calls incompleteness and cannot initiate an \ninvestigation unless requested. This means the Labor Department in \neffect is required to turn a blind eye to information that is \nsuspicious.\n  To remedy this problem, our bill provides the Department of Labor the \nability to initiate an investigation on its own and gives the \nDepartment of Labor more time to review applications. The Department \ncould also do random audits of any company that uses the program. Aside \nfrom these measures, our bill would prohibit employers to only \nadvertise available jobs to H-1B visa holders. It would encourage \ninformation sharing between the Department of Labor and the Department \nof Homeland Security. It would double the penalties for employer \nnoncompliance with the H-1B program requirements.\n  I am happy to report that most of these commonsense solutions were \nincluded in the immigration bill. I challenge any of my colleagues to \noppose these needed reforms before we talk about increasing the number \nof H-1B visas or at the very least in conjunction with that process.\n  Today I take the floor to tell my colleagues that I am willing to \nwork on this issue before the end of the year. I know businesses want \nmore visas. I know groups that represent workers and visa holders want \nreforms. I know the American people want a sensible system in place \nthat gives their children a chance at these highly skilled jobs. Some \nof my colleagues think the solution is increasing the annual cap on H-\n1B visas and doing nothing else. Before we agree to import more foreign \nworkers, let's restore integrity in this H-1B program. The system needs \na makeover. I am willing to consider an increase in the H-1B visa \nsupply, but only if reforms are included. We must fix the loopholes \nbefore we just allow more foreign workers to come in and take jobs that \nAmericans want to do. I would think my colleagues would want this \nprogram to work as it was intended by its original authors. My \ncolleagues should want to protect the jobs of our various \nconstituencies and help our businesses find the workers they truly \nneed.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

CON. RES. 21\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, section 307 of S. Con. Res. 21, the 2008 \nbudget resolution, permits the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee \nto revise the allocations, aggregates, and other appropriate levels for \nlegislation, including one or more bills and amendments, that \nreauthorizes the 2002 farm bill or similar or related programs, \nprovides for revenue changes, or any combination thereof. Section 307 \nauthorizes the revisions provided that certain conditions are met, \nincluding that amounts provided in the legislation for the above \npurposes not exceed $20 billion over the period of fiscal years 2007 \nthrough 2012 and that the legislation not worsen the deficit over the \nperiod of the total of fiscal years 2007 through 2012 or the period of \nthe total of fiscal years 2007 through 2017.\n  The Senate is considering an amendment in the nature of a substitute \nto H.R. 2419 that consolidates the following: S. 2302, the Food and \nEnergy Security Act of 2007, which was reported by the Senate Committee \non Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry on November 2, 2007; S. 2242, \nthe Heartland, Habitat, Harvest, and Horticulture Act of 2007, which \nwas reported by the Senate Committee on Finance on October 25, 2007; \nand a number of technical and other corrections made to both bills. I \nfind that the consolidated legislation satisfies the conditions of the \ndeficit-neutral reserve fund for the farm bill. I am pleased to report \nto the Senate that this legislation is fully paid for over both the \n2007 through 2012 time period and the 2007 through 2017 time period. \nTherefore, pursuant to section 307, I am adjusting the aggregates in \nthe 2008 budget resolution, as well as the allocation provided to the \nSenate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have the following revisions to S. Con. \nRes. 21 printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008--S.

McGovern\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today with a heavy heart and deep \nsense of gratitude to honor the life of a brave soldier from Idaville, \nIN. CPT Timothy McGovern, 28 years old, died October 31 in Mosul, Iraq. \nCaptain McGovern died of injuries he sustained when an improvised \nexplosive device detonated near his vehicle. With an optimistic future \nbefore him, Timothy risked everything to fight for the values Americans \nhold close to our hearts, in a land halfway around the world.\n  Timothy was a graduate of Twin Lakes High School and Purdue \nUniversity, where he began his military service in the Reserve Officers \nTraining Corps. At Twin Lakes, he was a leader on the football team and \nran on the track team. His football coach and uncle, Mike Wright, said \nthat he could depend on Timothy on the field because of his \nintelligence and positive attitude. He always supported his teammates. \nLater in life, he would support his fellow soldiers.\n  Timothy wanted to be a soldier nearly all his life, and he believed \nstrongly in the goals of our engagement in Iraq. Two weeks before his \ndeath, Timothy spoke to a local radio station about the positive impact \nAmericans at home can have on the morale of the soldiers abroad, \nsaying, ``Any support they get, any letters they get, anything like \nthat is great for morale and lets the soldiers here know that people \nstill care about them and care about what they're doing.''\n  Timothy was serving a second tour of duty when he died. He was a \nmember of the 2nd Battalion, 7th Cavalry Regiment, 1st Cavalry Division \nfrom Fort Bliss, TX. For his service and sacrifice, he was awarded the \nPurple Heart and the Bronze Star. Timothy is survived by his parents, \nLTC Colonel Bill McGovern and Jonell McGovern, and his sister, Miranda.\n  Today, I join Timothy's family and friends in mourning his death. \nWhile we struggle to bear our sorrow over this loss, we can also take \npride in the example he set, bravely fighting to make the world a safer \nplace. It is his courage and strength of character that people will \nremember when they think of Timothy. Today and always, Timothy will be \nremembered by family members, friends, and fellow Hoosiers as a true \nAmerican hero, and we honor the sacrifice he made while dutifully \nserving his country.\n  As I search for words to do justice in honoring Timothy's sacrifice, \nI am reminded of President Lincoln's remarks as he addressed the \nfamilies of the fallen soldiers in Gettysburg: ``We cannot dedicate, we \ncannot consecrate, we cannot hallow this ground. The brave men, living \nand dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor \npower to add or detract. The world will little note nor long remember \nwhat we say here, but it can never forget what they did here.'' This \nstatement is just as true today as it was nearly 150 years ago, as I am \ncertain that the impact of Timothy's actions will live on far longer \nthat any record of these words.\n  It is my sad duty to enter the name of CPT Timothy I. McGovern in the \nofficial Record of the U.S. Senate for his service to this country and \nfor his profound commitment to freedom, democracy, and peace. When I \nthink about this just cause in which we are engaged and the unfortunate \npain that comes with the loss of our heroes, I hope that families like \nTimothy's can find comfort in the words of the prophet Isaiah, who \nsaid, ``He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord God will wipe \naway tears from off all faces.''\n  May God grant strength and peace to those who mourn, and may God be \nwith all of you, as I know He is with Timothy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/05/senate-section/article/S13766-2", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13766]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         HEALTHY AMERICANS ACT\n\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, as I travel and talk to folks across \nMinnesota, one thing is abundantly clear--Minnesotans, like most \nAmericans, are more concerned about health care than just about any \nother issue--and for good reason.\n  As a Nation, we are spending about $2.2 trillion on health care each \nyear, about 16 percent of GDP. This is more than twice what many other \ndeveloped countries spend, yet 47 million of our fellow Americans are \nuninsured. And even those with insurance are worried. Worried about the \nescalating cost of premiums, whether their children will be covered, or \nwhether they will lose their health plan at work.\n  One thing we can all agree on is that inaction is not an option. As \nthese concerns grow and the costs continue to increase, the problem \nwill only get more complex and more difficult to solve. The time for \nsolutions is now.\n  It is in the spirit of finding a solution to our Nation's health care \ncrisis that I recently joined four of my Republican colleagues as a \ncosponsor of Senator Ron Wyden's Healthy Americans Act. While this is \ncertainly not a perfect solution, it is not ``Government-run'' or \n``single-payer'' health care. It is a private market, consumer-focused \nproposal that serves as a good place to start the discussion. Yet, as a \ncosponsor, I think it is also important that I point out some of the \nareas where I disagree with this legislation.\n  One area of concern has to do with transitioning people from \nemployer-based insurance to the private market. The Healthy Americans \nAct severs the ties between employment and health insurance and shifts \neveryone into the individual market. Instead, I think the Government \nshould level the playing field regarding taxation of health benefits, \nso workers can leave their employer, start a new business, change jobs, \nor spend more time at home with their family without risking their \nhealth care coverage.\n  Another area where I strongly disagree with Senator Wyden is his \nrequirement that health insurance companies cover abortions. I have \nnever wavered in my support for pro-life policies. While I am willing \nto work with Senator Wyden on this bill in the interest of improving \naccess to health insurance, I will absolutely not support passage of \nany legislation that requires coverage of abortions. This is one area \nof the bill that must be reconsidered.\n  I have also expressed concerns to my colleagues about using the \nFederal Employees Health Benefits Plan, FEHBP, as the standard for \nhealth insurance. While I certainly believe people should have access \nto this level of coverage, I don't think it should be the only option. \nMy vision of health reform does not include this one-size-fits-all \napproach. Instead, I support giving people access to a variety of \nhealth insurance options and the ability to make informed choices.\n  While these are a few of the areas where I disagree with Senator \nWyden, there are definitely provisions in this bill that I will work to \npreserve or even expand upon. I am pleased that the legislation focuses \non more than just expanding coverage but also on reforming the health \ncare system and providing peace of mind that a person's coverage won't \nend when his or her employment situation changes. The Healthy Americans \nAct provides incentives for preventive health care, expands wellness \nprograms, and emphasizes important cost containment measures. It also \npromotes greater adoption of health information technology and enacts \nvital medical malpractice reforms.\n  As you can probably see, the Healthy Americans Act is a work in \nprogress. But as I said before, it is a good place to start the \ndiscussion. That is why I look forward to working with Senator Wyden \nand all of the cosponsors of the Healthy Americans Act to make sure we \ncome up with a proposal that provides the health care choices we all \nwant, the quality we need, and the health care security the American \npeople deserve.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/05/senate-section/article/S13766-3", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13766-S13767]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         NATIONAL ADOPTION DAY\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I wish to acknowledge National Adoption \nAwareness Month and National Adoption Day on Nov. 17, 2007. With over \n114,000 children available for adoption out of the U.S. foster care \nsystem, I think it is crucial to celebrate those lawyers, social \nworkers, officials and, most importantly, parents who help many \nchildren move from foster homes to adoptive families.\n  Adoption has personally touched my life this year as two new children \nhave been welcomed as members of my family. My son Brendan and his wife \nJana recently adopted Trualem, age 11, and Peneal, age 8, from \nEthiopia. I am now a proud grandfather of five, and our family is \nlarger and richer with them in it.\n\n[[Page S13767]]\n\n  National Adoption Day was started in 2000 by the Alliance for \nChildren's Rights, the Freddie Mac Foundation, and the Dave Thomas \nFoundation for Adoption and helped complete foster care adoptions in \nnine jurisdictions in its first year. National Adoption Day has quickly \ngrown since that time. In 2006, a milestone was surpassed, as National \nAdoption Day was celebrated in all 50 States, the District of Columbia, \nand Puerto Rico for the first time. In total last year, over 3,300 \nadoptions were finalized on National Adoption Day.\n  I am committed to assisting children in the United States to find \nstable, loving, and permanent homes. Additionally, I support the goals \nof National Adoption Day to encourage others to adopt children from \nfoster care, to build stronger ties between local adoption agencies, \ncourts, and adoption advocacy organizations, and to continue to \nresearch and learn more about families wanting to adopt and the \nchildren waiting to be adopted.\n  I am proud that Members of the Senate continue to support ways to \nmake adoption easier and more affordable. Since the cost of adoption \ncan be very high, we ought to do what we can to lessen this initial \nburden for the exceptional people who provide caring homes for \nchildren. Adoption proceedings and legal fees for some domestic \nadoptions can cost more than $40,000. To ease some of this burden, \nCongress adopted a $10,000 tax credit for adoption expenses. If we ask \nindividuals to care for and adopt children, we must provide some relief \nfrom the financial burdens associated with that care. The adoption tax \ncredit is an effective vehicle to provide this relief, and it is \nvitally important that this tax credit does not expire at the end of \n2010.\n  In keeping with the celebration of adoption, this year I am proud to \nrecognize Audrey Kirkpatrick as an Angel in Adoption. Audrey is a \nsocial worker with Catholic Social Services in Rapid City, SD. She is \nan integral part of Catholic Social Services offering her knowledge to \nfellow employees and often her services to birth mothers and adoptive \nfamilies 24 hours per day.\n  I am also proud to recognize the Amiotte family, whose portrait is \ndisplayed in my front office as a part of the Voice of Adoption \nAdoptive Family Portrait Project. David and Malinda Amiotte began their \nfoster care experience not planning to adopt. However, after meeting \nand growing attached to biological siblings Medina and David, and \nbiological sisters JoAnne and Karen, David and Malinda wanted to keep \nthese sibling groups together. Despite challenges with the legal \nprocess, adoptions for all of their children have been finalized, and I \nwish them many years of happiness in the future.\n  The commitment of adoptive parents in South Dakota and throughout our \ncountry to provide children with safe, permanent, and loving homes \nwill, of course, have a positive impact on their lives. As we celebrate \nNational Adoption Awareness Month and National Adoption Day, I call on \nmy colleagues to continue supporting efforts to make adoption easier \nfor parents, children, and other important participants in the adoption \nprocess.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/05/senate-section/article/S13767-1", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13767]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      DISCRIMINATION AGAINST WOMEN\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I would like to add my voice to the \ngrowing chorus, in the Senate and across the world, supporting Senate \nratification of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of \nDiscrimination Against Women.\n  While we have made great strides towards eradicating blatant \ndiscrimination based on race or social class in our country, far too \nmany women around the world continue to face oppression and violence \nsimply because of their gender.\n  While it may be easy to believe that this only is a foreign problem, \none that does not exist in our homes, this is simply not the case. An \nestimated 30 percent of American women experience some form of assault \nin their lifetime. And even if women do not experience violence, \ndiscrimination can take many other forms. Hundreds of millions of women \nacross the globe are living their lives facing oppression. Despite all \nthe advancements towards social equality, there still exists a strong \nundercurrent of gender-based prejudice.\n  Beyond simply striking it from our laws, we must also strike it from \nour hearts and demonstrate that ending discrimination means recognizing \nbasic rights. All women should have access to health care. All women \nshould have access to education. And all women should be allowed to \nlive their lives free of fear.\n  The United States has always represented a beacon of hope and \nopportunity to oppressed peoples around the world. While our Nation is \namong the best in ensuring equal rights and opportunities to women, we \nmust never grow complacent in this constant struggle or believe that we \nhave conquered sex-based discrimination.\n  That is why I believe it is so important that the Senate ratify the \nConvention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against \nWomen. Ratification of this Convention represents a step towards \nempowerment, not just of American women but women everywhere.\n  Ratification also presents an opportunity to reassert American values \nto the world. At a time when our Nation's image abroad is under assault \nand our commitment to fundamental human rights and norms has been \nquestioned, it is critical that we reaffirm our repudiation of \ndiscrimination in all forms.\n  The full realization of women's rights is vital to the development \nand well-being of people of all nations. The United States becoming a \nmember of this convention is an important step toward that reality.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in calling for the prompt \nratification of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of \nDiscrimination Against Women.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/05/senate-section/article/S13767-2", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13767]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                  CHESHIRE HIGH SCHOOL GIRLS SWIM TEAM\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I offer my heartfelt congratulations \nto some of Connecticut's finest high school athletes: the girls swim \nteam of Cheshire High School. Cheshire High recently set a national \nrecord with an astounding 235 dual meet wins in a row.\n  With its victory, Cheshire High breaks a record that had been held \nfor 13 years by Elkhart Central High in Indiana--one of the longest-\nstanding, most respected marks in high school swimming. Even more \nincredibly, the Connecticut streak dates back all the way to 1986, \nbefore any members of the current team were born.\n  Their record-setting night brought together parents who decorated the \npool, painted their faces, and dressed up as the school's Ram mascot; \nmore than 200 paying spectators; and the support of an entire \ncommunity. For a town still struggling to overcome the memory of last \nJuly's notorious home-invasion murders, it was a joyous community \ncelebration; I hope it will go a little way toward restoring the spirit \nof this Connecticut town.\n  For their teamwork and success, I applaud the Cheshire High swimmers:\n  Megan Aitro, Tara Aitro, Olivia Amato, Alexandria Barry, Jessica \nBauer, Kailee Brown, Bridget Carmichael, Alyssa Carofano, Tina Chang, \nKatherine Collins, Kayla DeLuca, Adriana DiCenzo, Nicole Dicks, Rachael \nDioses, Kelly Dolyak, Danielle Forrest, Amy Hudak, Kathryn Hummel, \nKimberly Jerome, Jasmine Liu, Samantha Loignon, Shirin Lowell, Sofia \nMartone, Alexandra Maurice, Mairin McKinlay, Jessica Metcalf, Melissa \nMetcalf, Michaela Morr, Jessica Morse, Megan Mostoller, Stephanie \nNguyen, Catherine Patrell, Brianna Perazella, Lauren Piccolino, Emilie \nPtaszynski, Elissa Rosenfield, Sarah Schulefand, Morgan Schwenn, Meghan \nShanahan, Sydney Smith, Jennifer Thompson, Margaret Tooley, Emma \nVelcofsky, and Elizabeth Visconti.\n  Congratulations are due as well their assistant coaches, William \nLapman and Kristen Shanley, and their dedicated coach, Ed Aston, whom \nhis team pulled, fully dressed, into the pool once the record was \nbroken.\n  It is a true team, and town, achievement; and if I could list here \nthe names of all 278 athletes who contributed their part to the streak, \nI certainly would. Instead I simply extend my admiration and my best \nwishes for many more wins to come.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/05/senate-section/article/S13768-1", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13768]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S13768]]\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:03 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 2262.

A bill to amend title I of the Omnibus Crime Control and \nSafe Streets Act of 1968 to provide grants for the improved mental \nhealth treatment and services provided to offenders with mental \nillnesses, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleagues, Senator \nKennedy, Senator Leahy, and Senator Specter to introduce the Mentally \nIll Offender Treatment and Crime Reduction Reauthorization and \nImprovement Act of 2007. This bill will reauthorize and improve several \nprograms intended to provide Federal support for collaborations between \ncriminal justice and mental health systems.\n  It is estimated that approximately 16 percent of adult U.S. jail and \nprison inmates suffer from mental illness and the numbers are even \nhigher in the juvenile justice system. Many of these individuals are \nnot violent or habitual criminals. Most have been charged or convicted \nof nonviolent crimes that are a direct consequence of not having \nreceived needed treatment and supportive services for their mental \nillness.\n  The presence of defendants with mental illnesses in the criminal \njustice system imposes substantial costs on that system and can cause \nsignificant harm to defendants. In response to this problem, a number \nof communities around the country are implementing mental health \ncourts, a specialty-court model that utilizes a separate docket, \ncoupled with regular judicial supervision, to respond to individuals \nwith mental illnesses who come in contact with the justice system.\n  This past spring, I visited the courtroom of Judge Michael Vigil in \nthe First Judicial Court of Santa Fe, NM. Judge Vigil operates a mental \nhealth court that helps individuals who have been involved in \nnonviolent crimes that do not involve weapons and who have been \ndiagnosed with a mental illness. It is a 14-month program that attempts \nto keep defendants with mental illness out of jail. The court meets \nevery Friday for about an hour. Defendants are required to attend \nindividually designed therapy sessions, take their medications, and \nsubmit to random drug tests and breathalyzer tests. The appearances \nbefore Judge Vigil are akin to ``check-ups'' to make sure the defendant \nis on course, taking his or her medications, and that the defendant is \nin good health. If a participant violates the rules, they are \nsanctioned. If the violations are serious enough, the defendant can be \nremoved from the program and sentenced to jail.\n  The day I visited Judge Vigil's court, I witnessed a participant \ngraduate from the program. I spoke with the defendant and his mother \nafter the hearing. They told me how this program\n\n[[Page S13770]]\n\nhad helped turn his life around. Participation in this program had kept \nhim out of jail and more importantly helped him access treatment, \nhousing, and other critical supports. By addressing the mental illness \nthat contributed to his criminal act, this man received the services he \nneeded to hopefully prevent him from repeating his crime or committing \na more serious crime. Furthermore, the program helped reduce the burden \non the judicial system allowing for resources to be focused on violent \ncriminals.\n  Many communities are not prepared to meet the comprehensive treatment \nand needs of individuals with mental illness when they enter the \ncriminal justice system. The bill we are introducing today is intended \nto help provide resources to help States and counties design and \nimplement collaborative efforts between criminal justice and mental \nhealth structures. The bill will reauthorize the Mentally Ill Offender \nTreatment and Crime Reduction grant program and reauthorize the Mental \nHealth Courts Program. It will create a new grant program to help law \nenforcement identify and respond to incidents involving persons with \nmental illness and it will fund a study and report on the prevalence of \nmentally ill offenders in the criminal justice system. All of these \nreforms will help to address this problem from both a public safety and \na public health point of view. This will help save taxpayers money, \nimprove public safety, and link individuals with the treatment they \nneed to become productive members of their community.\n\n  Certainly, not every crime committed by an individual diagnosed with \na mental illness is attributable to their illness or to the failure of \npublic mental health. Mental health courts are not a panacea for \naddressing the needs of the growing number of people with mental \nillnesses who come in contact with the criminal justice system. But \nthey should be one part of the solution. Evidence has shown that in \ncommunities where mental health and criminal justice interests work \ncollaboratively on solutions it can make a significant impact in \nfostering recovery, improving treatment outcomes and decreasing \nrecidivism.\n  I want to thank my good friends for working with me on this very \nimportant issue. I appreciate their commitment to advancing these \nimportant programs and I look forward to working with them to pass this \nlegislation this Congress.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There geing no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows.\n\n                                S. 2304\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, it is a privilege to join my colleague \nfrom New Mexico in introducing the Mentally Ill Offender Treatment and \nCrime Reduction Reauthorization and Improvement Act of 2007. This \nbipartisan, bicameral legislation will authorize continued Federal \nsupport for cooperation between the criminal justice and mental health \nsystems on jail diversion, correctional treatment, and community \nreentry of offenders with a mental illness, and cross-training of \ncriminal justice and mental health personnel. With full funding, this \nproposal has the potential to achieve significant reforms in the \ntreatment of offenders diagnosed with a mental illness.\n  I commend Senator Domenici for his leadership on this bill and on \nmany other initiatives to improve our Nation's mental health systems. I \nalso welcome the support and leadership of Representatives Scott and \nForbes in the House of Representatives. We all agree that this \nlegislation can promote cooperative initiatives that will significantly \nreduce recidivism and improve treatment outcomes.\n  Based on the most recent studies by the Bureau of Justice, more than \nhalf of all prison and jail inmates had a mental health problem in \n2005, including 56 percent of inmates in State prisons, 45 percent of \nFederal prisoners and 64 percent of jail inmates. The high rate of \nsymptoms of mental illness among jail inmates may reflect the role of \nlocal jails in the criminal justice system, which operate as locally-\nrun correctional facilities that receive offenders pending arraignment, \ntrial, conviction or sentencing. Among other functions, local jails \nalso hold mentally ill persons pending their relocation in appropriate \nmental health facilities.\n  Far too often, individuals encounter the criminal justice system when \nwhat is really needed is treatment and support for mental illness. \nFamilies often resort to the police in desperation in order to obtain \ntreatment for a loved one suffering from an extreme episode of a mental \nillness. During such extreme distress, families may face no other \nalternative, because persons with symptoms such as paranoia, \nexaggerated actions or impaired judgment may be unable to recognize the \nneed for treatment.\n  It is unconscionable, and may well be unconstitutional, for these \nvulnerable individuals to be further marginalized once they are \nincarcerated. Too often, they are denied even minimal treatment because \nof inadequate resources.\n  Most mentally ill offenders who come into contact with the criminal \njustice system are charged with low-level, nonviolent crimes. Once \nbehind bars, they may well face an environment that further exacerbates \nsymptoms of mental illness, which might otherwise be manageable with \nproper treatment. Caught in a revolving door, they may soon be back in \nprison as a result of insufficient and inadequate transitional services \nwhen they are released.\n  This bill reauthorizes critical programs to move away from troubled \nsystems that often result in the escalating incarceration of \nindividuals with mental illness. Through this legislation, State and \nlocal correctional facilities will be able to create appropriate, cost-\neffective solutions. Low-level, nonviolent mentally ill offenders will \nhave greater access to continuity of care.\n  Congress must also address an unfunded mandate that has been imposed \non the States for decades. In Estelle v. Gamble in 1967, the Supreme \nCourt held that deliberate indifference to serious medical needs of \ninmates is unconstitutional, ``whether the indifference is manifested \nby prison doctors in their response to the prisoner's needs or by \nprison guards in intentionally denying or delaying access to medical \ncare or intentionally interfering with the treatment once prescribed.'' \nIn Ruiz v. Estelle in 1980, the Supreme Court established minimum \nstandards for mental health services in correctional settings. Yet more \nthan twenty years later, Federal, State, and local facilities still do \nnot have nearly enough resources to come even close to meeting these \nconstitutional requirements.\n  Congress must do its part to assist State and local governments in \nmeeting this burden. We cannot tolerate a system that fails to meet \nconstitutional safeguards, or that fails to dedicate resources \neffectively so that people will get help instead of jail time. As a \nresult of State budget cuts, more and more communities are looking to \nthe Federal Government for support.\n  This call for change can not be ignored. We have seen too many news \nstories reflecting the need for action on this issue. A New York Times \neditorial by Bernard Harcourt on January 15, 2007, highlighted problems \nfacing the mentally ill behind bars, noting two extreme examples in \ndifferent parts of the country. In August 2006, a prison inmate, \ndescribed by authorities as ``floridly psychotic,'' died in Michigan \nshackled to a concrete slab, waiting for a mental health transfer that \nnever happened. Six months later, the head of Florida's social services \ndepartment resigned in the face of charges for failing to transfer \nseverely mentally ill jail inmates to State hospitals.\n  To date, we have seen only a fraction of the possible potential under \nthis legislation, because only 50 planning and implementation grants \nhave been awarded. Because of limited Federal funding, only 11 percent \nof applicants were able to receive one of these grants for which there \nis high demand. In Massachusetts, the Norfolk District Attorney's \noffice received one of the planning grants. Right now, the office is \nworking hard to implement a program to ensure that a trained mental \nhealth professional will serve in police departments, so that a \nqualified person on the scene can assist in a situation involving a \nmentally ill person.\n  The program will also reduce the likelihood that a mentally ill \nperson charged with a low-level crime will be inappropriately jailed, \nand will give such persons the treatment they need and provide life \nskills training, housing placement, vocational training and job \nplacement. Several local mental health centers have already expressed \ntheir support for the program and their willingness to cooperate in \nproviding valuable services to this long-neglected population.\n  The expanded funding in this bill could help support ongoing efforts \nlike\n\n[[Page S13772]]\n\nthe Massachusetts Mental Health Diversion & Integration Program, \nMMHDIP, which is part of the Center for Mental Health Services Research \nat the University of Massachusetts Medical School. The center for \nMental Health Services Research has supported a series of research and \ntraining programs to assist persons with mental illness who come in \ncontact with the criminal justice system and have worked with police \ndepartments in Boston, Worcester, and Attleboro. The center is also \nworking on programs to develop evidence on which future practices may \nbe based. They also disseminate best practices for crisis intervention \nand risk management to police, courts, probation, prosecutors, defense \nattorneys, schools, and social service providers. The goal of the \nprogram is to reduce reliance on the criminal justice system as an \naccess point for social service provision, thereby freeing police and \nother portions of the criminal justice system to more effectively \nfulfill their public safety function.\n  The current programs in Massachusetts reflect the continuing legacy \nof the nationwide movement that began when Dorothea Dix entered an East \nCambridge Jail in 1841. Discovering that the mentally ill inmates were \nbeing housed together in terrible conditions without any heat, Dorothea \nbegan documenting prison conditions for the mentally ill throughout our \nCommonwealth. Her advocacy, and her determination to pursue ideas that \nseemed radical at the time, achieved significant reforms in \nMassachusetts. She went on to lead the first national legislation to \nprovide for the mentally ill. Today, we are still a long way to achieve \nthe goals set forth by Dorothea so many years ago.\n  In every State, interactions between law enforcement and individuals \nsuffering from mental illness continue to rise and the need for \neffective solutions is critical. This legislation will continue to \n``foster local collaborations'' between law enforcement and mental \nhealth providers. What works in one community will not necessarily work \nor be desired in another--solutions must take into account the existing \nproblem as well as the social and political dynamics within each \ncommunity. With so many complex issues involved at the intersection of \nmental illness and the criminal justice system, no magic solution will \nsolve the problems faced in communities across America. This bill \nencourages funding for specialized programs that will most effectively \naddress the needs of these local communities. With this legislation, \nCongress will join local communities in their response to this problem.\n  In addition, members of State and local law enforcement need access \nto training and other alternatives to improve safety and \nresponsiveness. The bill reauthorizes the Mentally Ill Offender \nTreatment Program and increases the funding to $75 million a year. The \nlegislation also authorizes $10 million for grants to States and local \ngovernments to train law enforcement personnel on procedures to \nidentify and respond more appropriately to persons with mental \nillnesses, and to develop specialized receiving centers to assess \nindividuals in custody.\n  In his last public bill signing in 1963, President Kennedy signed a \n$3 billion authorization bill to create a national network of community \nmental health facilities across the country. With the escalation of the \nVietnam War, not one penny of the $3 billion was ever appropriated. \nNow, decades later, we face a crisis in which far too many mentally ill \nindividuals are facing jail time rather than treatment.\n  Last year, more than 1 million persons with serious mental illnesses \nwere arrested. Noting the breadth of this national problem, Judge \nLeifman of the Criminal Division of the Miami-Dade County Court has \nstated that, ``Jails and prisons have become the asylums of the new \nmillennium.''\n  The broad support for this legislation--ranging from the Council of \nState Governments, the National Alliance on Mental Illness, the \nNational Sheriffs Association, the Bazelon Center for Mental Health \nLaw, the National Council for Community Behavioral Healthcare, the \nNational Alliance for the Mentally Ill, the Council of State \nGovernments, the Campaign for Mental Health Reform and Mental Health \nAmerica--demonstrates that it will provide much-needed support to help \nsolve this complex problem. The courts, law enforcement, corrections \nand mental health communities have all come together in support of this \nlegislation, and Congress must respond.\n  Individuals and their loved ones struggle with countless challenges \nand barriers during a mental health crisis. With this bill, Congress \ncan provide significant support to needed cooperation efforts between \nlaw enforcement and mental health experts. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this legislation, so that we can achieve its enactment before \nthe end of this current session of Congress.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I have joined today with Senators Domenici, Kennedy, and \nSpecter to introduce legislation to reauthorize the Mentally Ill \nOffender Treatment and Crime Reduction Act. I was a sponsor of the \noriginal authorization of this act in 2004, and I am proud that these \nprograms have helped our State and local governments reduce crime by \nproviding more effective treatment for the mentally ill.\n  All too often, people with mental illness rotate repeatedly between \nthe criminal justice system and the streets of our communities, \ncommitting a series of minor offenses. Offenders find themselves in \nprisons or jails, where little or no appropriate medical care is \navailable for them. This bill gives State and local governments the \ntools to break this cycle, for the good of law enforcement, corrections \nofficers, the public's safety, and mentally ill offenders. More than 16 \npercent of adults incarcerated in U.S. jails and prisons have a mental \nillness, about 20 percent of youth in the juvenile justice system have \nserious mental health problems, and almost half the inmates in prison \nwith a mental illness were incarcerated for committing a nonviolent \ncrime. This is a serious problem that I hear about often when I talk \nwith law enforcement officials and others in Vermont.\n  Under this bill, State and local governments can apply for funding to \ncreate or expand mental health courts or other court-based programs, \nwhich can divert qualified offenders from prison to receive treatment; \ncreate or expand programs to provide specialized training for criminal \njustice and mental health system personnel; create or expand local \ntreatment programs that serve individuals with mental illness or co-\noccurring mental illness and substance abuse disorders; and promote and \nprovide mental health treatment for those incarcerated in or released \nfrom a penal or correctional institution.\n  The grants created under this program have been in high demand, but \nonly about 11 percent of the applications submitted have been able to \nreceive funding due to inadequate Federal funds. This bill would \nincrease funding of these programs and authorize $75 million to help \ncommunities address the needs of the mentally ill in our justice \nsystem. The bill also provides $10 million for law enforcement training \ngrant programs to help law enforcement recognize and respond to \nincidents involving mentally ill persons.\n  This legislation brings together law enforcement, corrections, and \nmental health professionals to help respond to the needs of our \ncommunities. They know that the states have been dealing with the \nunique problems created by mentally ill offenders for many years, and \nthat a federal support is invaluable. I look forward to working with \nthem, and with Senators Domenici, Kennedy, Specter, and other Members, \nto see this bill enacted this Congress.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WHITEHOUSE (for himself, Mr. Leahy, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. \n        Feingold, Mr. Nelson of Florida, Mr. Brown, Ms. Klobuchar, Mrs. \n        Clinton, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Menendez, Mr. Obama, Mr. Schumer, and \n        Mr. Dodd):\n  S. 2305. A bill to prevent voter caging, to the Committee on Rules \nand Administration.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, it is an unfortunate reality that with \nso much at stake in the ballot box, organized efforts to suppress the \nvote go nearly as far back as the right to vote itself. These efforts \nhave cast a shadow over what Justice Earl Warren called ``the essence \nof a Democratic society'': the right to vote freely for the candidate \nof one's choice.\n\n[[Page S13773]]\n\n  The first voter suppression in America was direct: blanket \nrestrictions based on race, based on gender, based on class. Over the \nyears, these overt efforts were eventually replaced by more indirect \nand nefarious means: poll taxes, literacy tests, Whites-only primaries, \nand myriad other disenfranchisement laws aimed directly at minority \nvoters. These crafty legal obstacles were often supplemented by blunt \nphysical violence. But despite the many and varied efforts to impede \nthe franchise, American democracy has shown an extraordinary \nresilience--and the American people have shown an abiding dedication, \nsometimes paying with life and limb, to defend the right of their \nfellow citizens to vote.\n  This Senate, of course, has a checkered past on voting rights. For \nmany years, the Senate is where civil rights bills came to die, stalled \nby filibusters and tangled in parliamentary technique. Eventually, of \ncourse, the tide turned, and Congress ushered in a series of laws that \nremain among the most important ever enacted: the 24th amendment \nbanning poll taxes; the Civil Rights Act; and the Voting Rights Act of \n1965, which banned literacy tests, authorized the Attorney General to \nappoint Federal voting examiners to ensure fair administration of \nelections, and required the Federal Government to ``pre-clear'' certain \nchanges in the voting laws of local jurisdictions.\n  That law has been improved and reauthorized a number of times--as \nrecently as last year--and is a cornerstone of our democracy. \nNevertheless, as we all know, efforts to suppress the vote persist and \ncontinue to erode the promise of democracy for many Americans. For \nexample, in the last election cycle, we saw organized efforts to \ndeceive voters by sending out fliers with false information about the \nlocation of polling places or with phony endorsements, we saw threats \nthat immigrants could be imprisoned if they voted.\n  The Judiciary Committee, under the wise leadership of Chairman Leahy, \nhas responded with the Deceptive Practices and Voter Intimidation \nPrevention Act, which would criminalize various forms of voter \nintimidation and election misinformation.\n  In recent years, we have also seen the rise of another voter \nsuppression tactic, which has come to be known as ``vote caging.'' \nCaging is a voter suppression tactic whereby a political campaign sends \nmail marked ``do not forward/return to sender'' to a targeted group of \nvoters--often targeted into minority neighborhoods. The campaign then \nchallenges the right of those citizens whose mail was returned as \n``undeliverable'' on the grounds that the voter does not live at the \nregistered address. Of course, as the Presiding Officer knows, there \nare many reasons why a piece of mail might be ``returned to sender'' \nthat have nothing whatsoever to do with the voter's eligibility. For \nexample, a voter might be an active member of the armed services and \nstationed far from home or a student lawfully registered at their \nparents' address. Even a typographical error during entry of the \nvoter's registration information might result in a ``false negative.'' \nNevertheless, these individuals end up facing a challenge to their vote \nand possibly losing their right to vote.\n  Caging came into the media spotlight this summer during Congress's \ninvestigation into the political dismissal of U.S. attorneys, but this \npractice is not new, and it is not rare. In fact, since 1982, the \nRepublican National Committee has been operating under a consent \ndecree, filed in New Jersey U.S. District Court, which states that the \nRNC shall ``refrain from undertaking any ballot security activities in \npolling places or election districts where the racial or ethnic \ncomposition of such districts is a factor in the decision to conduct, \nor the actual conduct of, such activities.''\n  This consent decree was entered into after the Republican National \nCommittee, during the 1981 New Jersey gubernatorial election, initiated \na massive voter-caging operation, sending mailers marked ``do not \nforward'' to voters in predominantly African-American and Latino \nneighborhoods throughout the State. The Republican National Committee \nthen compiled a caging list based solely on the returned letters and \nchallenged these voters at the polls. They did it again in Louisiana, \nin 1986, when the Republican National Committee hired a consultant to \nsend 350,000 pieces of mail marked ``do not forward'' to districts that \nwere mostly African American, and the consent decree was then modified \nto require the U.S. District Court in New Jersey to preclear any so-\ncalled ballot security programs undertaken by the Republican National \nCommittee.\n  However, in part because the Federal consent decree does not apply to \nState parties or other campaigns, caging has continued. During the past \nfew election cycles, there has been credible evidence of caging in \nOhio, in Florida, in Pennsylvania, and elsewhere. Not every caging \noperation has been successful, but the failure of a voter suppression \nattempt is no excuse for it. Therefore, I am introducing the Caging \nProhibition Act, which would prohibit challenging a person's \neligibility to vote--or to register to vote--based on a caging list. \nSimply put, eligible voters should not fear their right to vote might \nbe challenged at the polls because a single piece of mail never reached \nthem.\n  The bill would also require any private party who challenges the \nright of another citizen to vote--or to register to vote--to set forth \nin writing, under penalty of perjury, the specific grounds for the \nalleged ineligibility. The principle here is simple: If you are going \nto challenge one of your fellow citizen's right to vote, you should at \nleast have cause and be willing to stand behind it.\n  I am very proud of the extraordinary group of Senators who have \nagreed to be original cosponsors of this piece of legislation: Chairman \nLeahy of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Feinstein, Senator Dodd, \nSenator Kerry, Senator Feingold, Senator Schumer, Senator Nelson of \nFlorida, Senator Clinton, Senator Obama, Senator Menendez, Senator \nBrown, and Senator Klobuchar. I was proud to work closely with the \nBrennan Center for Social Justice and the Lawyers Committee for Civil \nRights Under Law to develop the language of this bill. I would also \nlike to thank People for the American Way for its support of this \nlegislation.\n  In the 1964 case of Reynolds v. Sims, the U.S. Supreme Court stated:\n\n       [T]he right to exercise the franchise in a free and \n     unimpaired matter is preservative of other basic civil and \n     political rights. . . .\n\n  In other words, every right we have depends upon the right to vote. \nOrganized voter-suppression efforts, including vote-caging schemes, \ninfringe on this right and undermine our democracy. Congress should \nrise to the occasion and say ``enough is enough'' to vote caging.\n  I thank my many distinguished colleagues who have cosponsored this \nbill, and I ask my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join us in \nstopping this nefarious voter suppression activity.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/05/senate-section/article/S13773-1", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13773-S13774]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n    SENATE RESOLUTION 366--DESIGNATING NOVEMBER 2007 AS ``NATIONAL \n      METHAMPHETAMINE AWARENESS MONTH'', TO INCREASE AWARENESS OF \n                         METHAMPHETAMINE ABUSE\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS (for himself, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Alexander, Mr. Biden, Mr. \nBingaman, Mr. Bond, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. Corker, Mr. Crapo, Mr. Domenici, \nMr. Graham, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Levin, Mrs. Lincoln, Ms. Murkowski, Mr. \nRoberts, Mr. Salazar, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Smith, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Tester, \nMr. Thune, Mr. Conrad, and Mrs. Dole) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleague \nSenator Grassley, as well as Senators Alexander, Biden, Bingaman, Bond, \nCantwell, Corker, Crapo, Domenici, Graham, Kerry, Levin, Lincoln, \nMurkowski, Roberts, Salazar, Schumer, Smith, Stabenow, Tester, and \nThune in submitting a resolution designating November 2007 as National \nMethamphetamine Awareness Month.\n  It is the sense of the Senate to increase awareness of \nmethamphetamine and call upon the people of the U.S. to observe this \nmonth with appropriate methamphetamine educational programs and \noutreach activities.\n  Methamphetamine is devastating families and communities across the \nNation.\n  It has been more than 1 year since enactment of the Combat \nMethamphetamine Epidemic Act. Methamphetamine lab seizures declined 42 \npercent nationwide last year, as a result of regulations on the sale of \npseudoephedrine and ephedrine. These are the over the counter drugs \nwhich are often used in the production of methamphetamine.\n  But our work is not done. Methamphetamine is still the number one law \nenforcement problem. The National Association of Counties found that \nmethamphetamine is the number one illegal drug problem for 47 percent \nof the counties in the country.\n  Four out of five county sheriffs report that while local \nmethamphetamine production is down, methamphetamine abuse is not.\n  Methamphetamine users are changing. Three-fifths of the Nation's \nsheriffs report increased methamphetamine use by women. Half of the \nNation's sheriffs report increased use by teens.\n  Surveys on methamphetamine abuse among teens show that many of the \nrespondents said the drug was easy to get, and believed there was \nlittle risk in trying it. Methamphetamine is still far too readily \navailable.\n  As a result, local social service and health care resources are \nstretched thin, and more and more children are being sent to foster \nhomes.\n  These issues are even more apparent within tribal communities. I am \nvery concerned that the highest rates of methamphetamine use among all \nethnic groups occur within the Native American communities.\n  Last year, Carl Venne, Crow Tribal Chairman, testified before the \nFinance Committee. Chairman Venne told of the grave effects of meth on \nthe Apsaalooka Nation. He said, ``There is no entity or organization on \nthe Crow Reservation that is exempt from the devastating destruction of \nMeth.''\n  And while the regulations under the Combat Meth Act have stifled meth \nproduction here in the United States, the production has shifted to \nkeep up with the ever-growing demand. Most illegal methamphetamine \navailable in the U.S. is produced in large clandestine laboratories in \nMexico and smuggled into this country. We must do more to break the \nmeth supply chain at the border.\n  We must do more to end the demand for this devastating drug. We need \nto redouble our efforts and intensify methamphetamine education, \nprevention, and treatment. In this way, we show our resolve to bring to \nan end the problem of meth.\n  Thus, I stand here today, asking my fellow colleagues on both sides \nof the aisle to join us in support of designating November 2007 \nNational Methamphetamine Awareness Month.\n  Conducting educational programs and outreach activities in November \nwill give us an opportunity to talk with folks at home and focus on \nways to fight methamphetamine across America.\n  I urge everyone to join us in support of this legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/05/senate-section/article/S13774-1", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13774]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 3499.
