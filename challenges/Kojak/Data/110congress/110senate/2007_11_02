Mr. President, I had a long meeting last night with the \nSpeaker of the House and Senate Members, which lasted several hours. It \nis very clear that next week is going to be a very difficult week. The \nfollowing week is going to be very difficult--important but difficult.\n  The reason I mention this is we had the obligation, procedurally, to \nvote this morning at 1 a.m., but we were able to work that out as a \nresult of a unanimous consent request, which was very helpful. It \navoided the necessity of our working this weekend. We only have one \nweekend left until Thanksgiving. I hope we can work everything out.\n\n[[Page S13718]]\n\n  I don't think we can. I have a very busy, difficult schedule next \nweekend, but I am not sure I am going to meet the obligations I have \nalready committed myself to--I want everybody else to understand--\nincluding parades and other events on Veterans Day. What do we have to \ndo? We have to send appropriations bills to the President. At least the \nLabor/HHS bill, which is now tied in with the VA military \nconstruction--we need to send that to the President. We have a time \nschedule to do that.\n  We have to do the Defense appropriations bill. It is something we \nhave to consider getting to the President as soon as possible. We have \nto do a continuing resolution. There is some talk about doing a bridge \nfund for Iraq. Chairman Byrd is talking about marking up in a week or \n10 days the supplemental appropriations bill. We have numerous other \nthings. It is very difficult.\n  Monday is not a vote day, so we have 4 days next week. So I say, with \nall sincerity, I am going to call our Presidential candidates and let \nthem know they better look at their schedules because these are not \nvotes you can miss--Defense appropriations; the first appropriations \nbill, Labor/HHS, with benefits for veterans tied into it, which we need \nto do before Veterans Day; the CR, which funds our Government; and \nwhatever we decide to do with the bridge funds or the supplemental \nappropriations bill.\n  So everyone should be alerted to the fact that they better have their \nschedules somewhat loose for this coming weekend and, I repeat, Monday. \nThere is always a way, it seems, to try to work out some of these \ndifficulties. I hope we can find a way to not do it next Saturday, \nSunday, and Monday, but we have to be prepared.\n  The things I have talked about doing are not things we can do some \nother time. We have to do them before we leave for the Thanksgiving \nholiday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/02/senate-section/article/S13718-1", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13718]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, yesterday I voted with great enthusiasm for \nthe SCHIP reauthorization bill. I think the present version is \ncommendable and a version we should support. I particularly thank \nLeader Reid, Chairman Baucus, and Senator Rockefeller for their \nefforts, and I commend them.\n  The bill provides an additional $35 billion to preserve coverage for \nall 6.6 million children currently enrolled, and it expands coverage to \nan additional 4 million children.\n  The President and House Republicans have already denied these \nchildren access to health care once, by first vetoing the legislation \nand then sustaining the veto in the House of Representatives. I hope \nthis version can pass without a veto. If it is vetoed, I hope the veto \ncan be overridden.\n  The President's proposal, rather than expanding coverage, would in \nfact dramatically restrict coverage, dropping 1.4 million children and \npregnant women. That is according to the Congressional Budget Office. \nSo there is a very stark choice between an administration that wants to \nrestrict coverage for children and this legislation, which would \nmaintain, and indeed expand, that coverage to cover 10 million children \nin the United States.\n  With respect to Rhode Island, this bill adds an additional $75 \nmillion in Federal funds on the table. It has to be matched, but this \nwould allow the State of Rhode Island to maintain its program of health \ncare for children. The bill would prevent shortfalls that have \nperiodically cropped up, where the State found itself expending all of \nits funds and hoping there would be a redistribution of funds from \nother States that have not used their funds.\n  Last year, and again early this year, I fought for $56 million in \nFederal funds to cover Rhode Island's shortfall. But these 11th-hour \nstopgap measures are not sustainable. The legislation we passed \nyesterday would prevent my State from being in a constant situation of \nshortfalls, hoping that other States have excess funds, and depending \nupon individuals in our delegation to get those funds for Rhode Island.\n  If President Bush and the House Republicans fail to enact this bill--\nif he vetoes it, and they sustain that veto--21 States will be at risk \nof shortfalls, totaling $1.6 billion. Rhode Island will have a \nshortfall of $44.1 million, beginning next March. We can predict that \ntoday. I don't know where my State would get that $44 million. It is in \na severe budget crisis. State leaders are talking about trying to find \n$100 million to $200 million in cuts, which in our budget is a \nsignificant amount of money. So the idea that they would have to come \nup with $44 million on top of that is something that would be a very \ndifficult challenge for Rhode Island.\n  If Republicans do not enact this bill, we must fully fund an \nextension that covers these shortfalls. We will be back next spring \nscrambling to find money to keep these programs functioning. I hope we \ncan prevail at this juncture to create a program and funding that will \nbe sustainable, predictable, and supportive of efforts in my State, and \nmany States across the country, to reach out and insure children for \ntheir health care needs.\n  The President's opposition is not based on fact or common sense or, \nindeed, even common decency; it seems to be based on ideology. He says \nfamilies would switch from private insurance to government-run health \ncare. But the number of uninsured is rising because private insurance \nis too expensive. In Rhode Island, the average family premium for a \nyear is $11,924. If you look at a typical working family in Rhode \nIsland, it is struggling now to pay its mortgage. We have seen what is \nhappening in the mortgage market, where many of these families, in \norder to get into a home, signed up for what are termed an ``exotic'' \nmortgage. In my State, foreclosures are at record-high levels. People \ncannot keep up with their mortgage payments. Then, added to that \ndilemma, wages have essentially been flat over the last 5 to 6 years, \nmortgage payments are going up, the price of gasoline is now reaching \nsignificant heights, and it is estimated that this winter heating oil \nin New England will be 20 percent more expensive than last winter. Are \nyou then going to tell them: Oh, just go out and buy private health \ninsurance for $11,000 a year?\n  That makes no sense for working families in Rhode Island. They are \nstruggling to keep their homes and, literally, to keep the lights on \nand keep it a little warm during the wintertime. For many of these \npeople, private health insurance, at $11,000 a year, is way beyond \ntheir reach. So to sit there and seriously insist that this is a real \nchoice for these families--a choice of getting into a public program or \nbuying private insurance--verges on the ridiculous.\n  Without the SCHIP program, thousands of families in my State--and \nmillions of children across the country--will not have health care. \nThere is no choice.\n  There is also the President's argument that this is socialized \nmedicine. I believe that is a gross misrepresentation. In Rhode Island, \nchildren are enrolled in private plans, and enrollees can choose their \ndoctor. In fact, there is another program like this, called Medicare. I \ndon't see the President rallying against Medicare, saying how it is \nsocialized medicine. In fact, I can recall he proposed--and this \nCongress supported--one of the largest expansions of Medicare by \nadopting a drug benefit. That costs the Federal Government billions of \ndollars, and there is no discussion about that.\n  These arguments are baseless. The President says this bill costs too \nmuch. In fact, this bill is fully paid for; it is one of the few things \nin the last 6 to 7 years that has been fully paid for. It is paid for \nby a cigarette tax, and it is in sharp contrast to the President's \nrepeated request for money for Iraq and Afghanistan, which is not paid \nfor. He is spending about $12 billion a month. Of that money, over the \nlast several\n\n[[Page S13719]]\n\nyears in Iraq, we have invested in items such as building Iraqi health \ncare clinics and providing health care for Iraqis. In trying to \nreestablish stability in that country, the President recognizes that to \nhave a decent, well-ordered society, you have to have access to health \ncare for citizens. The problem is, he doesn't seem to recognize it here \nas much. So I believe we have to support this legislation.\n\n  The President also says the bill doesn't target low-income children. \nIn fact, 80 percent of newly insured children would be from families \nbelow 200 percent of poverty. That is a pretty good target.\n  He talks about the bill expanding coverage to families making $80,000 \na year. That was always a misrepresentation. But we make it clear in \nthis bill that eligibility is capped at 300 percent of poverty; that \nis, families making $60,000 a year. That sounds like a lot, but if you \nare in a major urban area, with rents costing $1,000 to $1,500 to \n$1,800 a month for just a fairly--and I emphasize ``fairly''--decent \ntwo-bedroom apartment for your family, when you do the math, these \npeople are not in a situation of excess wealth by any means.\n  In Rhode Island, 10,000 children remain uninsured. We can do much \nbetter. The Rhode Island program provides family-based health \ninsurance. Rhode Island does enroll parents in this health care \nprogram. They found that it helps when the whole family is part of the \ndelivery system. It has enhanced their ability to recruit children into \nthe system. It has enhanced, in their view, health outcomes because now \nwe have a family engaged rather than an individual child.\n  I think it is appropriate in Rhode Island that we have such a \nforward-thinking and progressive approach because the basic SCHIP \nprogram was, in many respects, the work of Senator John H. Chafee, my \ncolleague, a former Republican Senator who was succeeded by his son \nLincoln Chafee in this Chamber. Senator Chafee, who was a pragmatic, \nhardnosed Republican whose values were to provide opportunity to all \ncitizens in the nation, understood that if we could deliver effective \nhealth care to children in this country, we would go a long way to give \nthem the physical tools to be successful in school, to succeed in the \nworkplace, and ultimately to be citizens of this great country. He \nfought hard for this program. He didn't do it on an ideological basis; \nhe did it on a very pragmatic, practical basis. His success has been \ndemonstrated over the last 10 years because we have given more children \naccess to health care.\n  There are countless stories that will be forever unknown to us, but \nthey will be decisive in the lives of children because this program has \nmade a difference in their lives. Where they would have suffered with \nan undiagnosed disease that would have impaired their ability to thrive \nin school and work, because they had simple, preventive health care \nearly on, they have been successful in school, and they will be \nsuccessful in life. Families have been relieved of one of the most \ngrievous fears they carry, and that is: Oh, my gosh, what happens if my \nchild gets sick; I have no health care coverage--the gnawing fear at \nnight that something could happen the next day and you have no way to \nprotect your child because you cannot afford to get them health care. \nThat fear has been relieved.\n  There is a very popular commercial from one of the credit card \ncompanies: Such and such an item, $10; such and such an item, $9; \nhaving the ability to do this, priceless. For families, having the \nconfidence that they have health care is priceless, and this bill has \nhelped them.\n  I hope the President will sign this bill, and if he doesn't--if he \ncontinues to roam through his ideological warehouse and pick out \ndifferent odds and ends to justify this veto--then I hope the House \nRepublicans have the courage to stand up and say: No, we are going to \ndo what is right for the children of America, not just what is \npolitically convenient for the President.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/02/senate-section/article/S13719-1", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13719-S13721]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        FIGHTING FOR THE PEOPLE\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I have had the opportunity, similar to \nall my colleagues throughout the week and in previous times, to have \nheard on the floor the lament from the distinguished Republican leader \nof the Senate and other Republican colleagues about how they wished we \nhad the appropriations bills done or how more should be done. I come to \nthe floor today to talk about the reality of what is happening.\n  We know, in politics, unfortunately, folks decide on a message and \nkeep saying it over and over again, hoping in fact someone will believe \nit, even if it doesn't jibe with what the actual facts are.\n  We also know, at the beginning of the year, folks all over this \ncountry--people working hard every day who care about their families \nand expect to have services that work and expect to have someone eyeing \nthe fiscal situation in the country and challenging what is happening \nin the war and caring about their children and so on--looked for a new \ndirection. They voted for a new direction for this country, a new set \nof priorities.\n  People working hard every day want to know somebody is out there \nfighting for them. I am proud to say I am part of a group of people, a \ngroup of Democrats who understand that people are feeling squeezed on \nall sides--higher gas prices, higher health care costs, they are seeing \ntuition go up for their children, their jobs being threatened. In my \nhome State of Michigan, we have 7.5 percent unemployment. People are \nlosing jobs, they are losing incomes. People are looking around saying: \nWho is fighting for us? We play by the rules. We love our country. We \nsend our husbands and wives and sons and daughters to defend our \ncountry. Who, in fact, is on our side, looking out for us and making \nsure the rules in this country create a way for everybody to work hard \nand succeed and, in fact, there is competency and integrity in \nGovernment?\n  That is what we came into this year, in January. We came into this \nnew year understanding, as a new majority, we are here to fight for \nmiddle-class Americans who work hard every day and those working hard \nto get into the middle class, those who want to have the American dream \navailable for themselves and their families. People who believe right \nnow our American way of life is slipping want us to fight for them. I \nam proud to say that is exactly what we have done.\n  It has not been easy because our colleagues on the other side of the \naisle, I understand, have lost the majority. Unfortunately, their \npolitical strategy is to try to stop us from actually making a \ndifference in the lives of middle-class Americans, so when we get to \nthe end of the term, they can say: See, there is no difference between \nDemocrats and Republicans--when, in fact, we all know there are \nsubstantial differences in priorities, in views of America, and whose \nside we are on.\n  As a strategy, we have seen filibuster after filibuster and something \ncalled ``cloture'' in the Senate which, to the average person, \nbasically means we are seeing filibusters, a requirement for 60 votes \nrather than just a majority, which is how we should be operating under \nthe democratic process.\n  We have seen a historic number. Never before, in fact, have we seen, \nat this point in time, 52 filibusters--52 and counting. My guess is \nnext week it will be 53 and 54 and 55 and 56 and go on and on in \nefforts to slow things down, efforts to slow down the new direction we \nbelieve in, that we are fighting for, to slow down those things that \nwill make a real difference in the lives of Americans.\n  We understand the strategy. We operate under this every week. We come \nto the floor and have to fight to get beyond a filibuster. I am proud \nto say we have done that. As we come to the end of our first year as a \nmajority, we are, in fact, changing the direction of this country. We \nare, in fact, getting results for Americans, for middle-class \nAmericans, who work hard every day and want somebody to be fighting for \nthem, for an opportunity for them and\n\n[[Page S13720]]\n\ntheir children to have the American dream. I am very proud of that, \ndespite 52 filibusters.\n  We have a leader who is tenacious, who is determined, who is smart--\nwho comes to the floor every day and spends his time trying to make \nsure we can stop the filibusters and refocus on getting results for \nmiddle-class Americans. That is what we have done. I wish to take a \nmoment today to share some of the results we are getting. Is it slower \nthan we would like? Yes, when you are trying to battle 52 filibusters, \nthings are slower than we would like to have happen. But we are not \ngoing to stop because this is not about politics. This should not be \nabout election year strategy. This is about people every day in this \ncountry who see the American dream slipping away from them, who are \nworried their children will not have the same opportunities for our \ngreat American life that we have had. They are saying to us we want you \nto go in and fight for us and the greatness of America. We want to make \nsure that opportunity is there for everybody. That is what America is \nall about.\n  We are, in fact, getting results for middle-class Americans every \nsingle day, those folks who believe--and for good reason have believed \nfor the past 6 years under this President and the former Congress--that \nnobody is looking out for them and the opportunities they need. We are, \nin fact, getting results for middle-class Americans.\n  We started this year--it is amazing to me to hear colleagues speak \nabout how there is not a budget so far, when in fact they didn't even \ndo a budget at all last year, not at all. We got to the end of the \nyear: No budget. So we came in as a new majority and we had to go back \nand clean things up from the previous majority. We had to go back, \nfigure out a way to get a budget for the current year that was already \ngoing, that had already been in place for 3 or 4 months. We, in fact, \ndid that, and we did a number of things in that process, in putting \nthat budget together--even though it was a continuation budget for the \nrest of the year, to complete the business that had not been done in \nthe last Congress. But we also did a few things in that process. We \nsaid, even though this is a short-term continuation budget, there are \ntoo many young people struggling to go to college, so we put in a Pell \nincrease. We said, there are too many veterans who have served us \nproudly, who are coming back from Iraq and Afghanistan and don't have \nthe health care they need, so we put in some additional dollars for \nveterans health care into that budget.\n  We passed that continuation budget and then we went to work on the \nbudget that, in fact, we are responsible for. After having done the \nwork of our Republican colleagues, we put in place the budget we are \nnow working on for this coming year. We did several things. We said: \nFirst of all, we know in the last 6 years we have seen record deficits \nmount. In 2001, when President Bush came into office, when I first \nbecame a member of the Budget Committee, we saw the largest budget \nsurpluses in the history of the country. That was squandered and turned \ninto the largest deficits, which affect Social Security, which \njeopardize Medicare and puts incredible pressure on critical safety net \nissues and programs for Americans, for families, and for seniors. So we \nsaid we are going to stop the digging. We know there is a hole that has \nbeen created. We are going to stop the digging and start taking us out \nof that hole by being fiscally responsible.\n  We put back in place something that was in place during President \nClinton's years, which was to pay for spending. What a novel idea. That \nis something I try to teach my children, something we all should live \nby: Pay as you go; if you add something, you need to subtract something \nelse to pay for it. So we said fiscal responsibility is important, and \nwithin that we put together a budget resolution that targeted those \nthings middle-class Americans want to have us place as priorities: \nEducation, No. 1; keeping our promise to our veterans, the second top \npriority; and children's health care, for moms and dads who are working \nhard every single day and could stay home and not work and qualify for \nMedicaid, but they choose to work.\n  We value work. We as a party, we as a majority, value work and want \nto support work. Families working hard for minimum wage in low-wage \njobs, who cannot afford insurance, who don't have it on the job, ought \nto at least know their children can get the health insurance they need.\n  That is what we have been debating. That was a third priority for us, \nchildren's health care.\n  Then we said we are going to go back and we are going to restore the \ncuts in police officers on the streets. Our families, our communities \nwant to know that their children are safe, that their homes are safe, \nthat they are safe. We restored the COPS--police officers and \nfirefighters, those things that are fundamental in America--safety.\n  We put together this budget resolution, and we are now in the \nprocess, despite filibuster after filibuster, to put the actual budget \nin place, the appropriations for next year.\n  But we have also done other things, despite 52 filibusters. We have \nraised the minimum wage which has not been raised for close to 10 \nyears. Those same families--who appreciate and need to know their \nchildren can get health insurance--have not had a raise in the minimum \nwage for about 10 years, so we raised the minimum wage.\n  We then took a look at what we need to do in education and not only \nmeeting the obligations and the promises of the laws put in place under \nLeave No Child Behind and the standards, but we said part of the \nAmerican dream, a very important part, is being able to go to college.\n  So we have passed, on a bipartisan basis, and the President signed \nit, and we are very grateful for that--we have passed the largest \nincrease in aid for students going to college since the GI bill, the \nlargest financial aid since the GI bill.\n  We gave the second Pell grant increase this year--the second. We have \ndone it twice now this year, to bring back the value of the Pell grant \nfor low-income students. We have cut in half the rates for subsidized \nloans. We do not believe young people or older people who are going to \nschool and getting the skills they need to compete in a global economy \nand make America stronger should be able--we do not believe they should \ncome out with this huge debt that takes years and years and years to \npay back.\n  We want to help them, both on interest rates, and we made a number of \nchanges that make that loan process more manageable. We have targeted \nteachers and are encouraging teachers teaching students with high \nachievement to receive extra support for going into math and science \nand other areas that are needed in certain parts of our communities.\n  We have also put a loan forgiveness program in place. Bottom line, we \nhave passed, and we, in fact, have said, education is important, and we \nhave now done it, the largest increase in student financial aid since \nthe GI bill.\n  We also did something else on a bipartisan basis. We passed the \nAmerica COMPETES Act, a major focus in investment. By the way, fully \npaid for, all of those things are fully paid for. A major investment in \nmath and science and technology, both in terms of education and in \nterms of research--this was, again, bipartisan and something that we \nwere proud to place as a priority for this Senate. So education is at \nthe top of the list.\n  We have passed cuts in taxes for small businesses as part of an \neffort to spur--we know the economy, the majority of the jobs, are \ncreated by small businesses. We want to support our small businesses \nand farmers as well as larger businesses. We have done that through \nvarious tax cuts. We have passed changes in the FDA to improve safety. \nWe have passed a mental health parity bill to say mental health \nservices should be available just as physical health services are \navailable, through the health care system. If you have insurance, both \nshould be available.\n  We have reauthorized Head Start because we know education is not just \nabout college, it is about children and whether they are prepared to \nstart at the beginning of education. We have focused on Head Start.\n  We know it is incredibly important that we keep us safe both at home \nand abroad. I am very proud of the fact that after years of trying, \nunder the previous Congress, Democrats have been able to lead the \neffort to pass the 9/11 Commission recommendations. One\n\n[[Page S13721]]\n\narea of major focus for me has been on making sure the radios work, \nmaking sure that police and fire and homeland security and the State \ndepartments can all communicate. We have addressed that and passed \nfunding efforts to be able to focus on that.\n  In addition, we have, as I mentioned earlier, focused on our \nveterans. It is shameful that we have not seen the resources put forth \nto support our veterans as they have been coming home from Iraq and \nAfghanistan, as well as our older veterans from other wars.\n  We, as Democrats, have made that a top priority. I am very proud of \nthat. I know in meeting with veterans organizations that they have \nworked closely with us. And for the first time--for the first time--\nthose veterans organizations have been listened to and have been a part \nof the process. We are funding the needed services in health care, \nrehabilitation, other areas, at the level that our veterans \norganizations have indicated we should be funding them.\n  So we have veterans as a top priority. We are seeing changes. We have \nalso addressed what happened at Walter Reed through the Wounded Warrior \nAct. I am so proud that my colleague, the senior Senator from Michigan, \nhas led that effort to be able to focus on wounded warriors and those \nwho get caught between the military system and the VA system.\n  I will just mention a couple of other things because I could go on \nfor a long time. There is a lot we have been getting done. Despite 52 \nfilibusters and counting, there is a lot that we have been getting \ndone, from ethics and lobbying reform, to help with the gulf coast \nrevitalization, folks down in New Orleans and Mississippi, those areas \nthat have been so devastated; reinvestment in our bridges and \ninfrastructure; and our continuing effort to fight to change the \ndirection in Iraq and to focus on counterterrorism and those things \nthat will keep us safe.\n  We have held the President accountable. The Attorney General position \nhas changed because the political efforts going on in the Attorney \nGeneral's Office were brought forward and publicized. The light of day \nwas shone. In fact, the Attorney General was forced to step down \nbecause of the questions and bringing to light what was happening in \nthat department.\n\n  So there is a whole range of areas of accountability where tough \nquestions have been asked about war profiteering, about other areas \nwhere we need to change the priorities of this Government to reflect \nwhat Americans are concerned about.\n  People work too hard for their money. They want to know that public \nservices work. They want to know that we are fiscally responsible. They \nwant to know that we are focused on the things that directly affect \nthem and their families. We have a great country. I am very proud to be \npart of a majority that understands what is happening in this country \ntoday; that we are in a fight for our way of life in a global economy.\n  We want this to be a race up, through education, innovation, fair \ntrade laws, changing the way we fund health care, supporting our \nbusinesses that want to stay in the United States and do business here \nand employ here. We do not want a race to the bottom, a strategy that \nhas been used by this President and the former Congress, saying: If you \nonly work for less, we can be competitive. If you only lose your health \ncare and lose your pension, we can be competitive. We do not care about \nsafety standards. We let lead toys in or we let toothpaste in or dog \nfood in because we are not worried about our trade laws. Somehow we can \nbe competitive if we lose our standard of living.\n  We do not buy that. This caucus does not buy that. This Democratic \nSenate and House is fighting for our American way of life. We have \nplaced the priorities of the middle-class Americans at the top of the \nlist. They have had to wait too long for that to happen. And despite \nover and over again, filibuster after filibuster after filibuster to \nslow things down, with the determination, the tenacity of our Senate \nmajority leader, and the support of our Members, we are getting \nresults. We are getting results every day for middle-class Americans.\n  We will not lose our focus. I do not care if there are another 50 \nfilibusters or if there are another 100 filibusters, we are going to \nkeep focused on those things that have created the American dream, that \nhave created the greatest country in the world.\n  We are going to make sure middle-class Americans know we are here \nfighting for those things they care about for their families.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The junior Senator from Tennessee.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/02/senate-section/article/S13721-1", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13721-S13722]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO BENJAMIN HOOKS\n\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I rise today to honor an exceptional \nTennessean and a pioneer in the civil rights movement. Benjamin Hooks \nwas born in Memphis, TN, in 1925, the fifth of seven children by Robert \nand Bessie Hooks.\n  He grew up in a loving family who taught him to succeed in both \neducation and life. After high school, Dr. Hooks began his higher \neducation by taking pre-law classes at LeMoyne College in Memphis. \nPrior to finishing his degree, he was drafted into the Army, honorably \nserving our country in World War II. When he returned home, he went to \ngraduate school at Howard University and afterwards received a law \ndegree from DePaul University in Chicago.\n  As Dr. Hooks went through life and excelled in various endeavors, \nthere was one experience that greatly molded the future direction of \nhis life: being born into and growing up in the scourge of racial \nsegregation. After Dr. Hooks graduated college, he returned home and \nvowed to do his part to end racial segregation.\n  Initially, he fought the fight by becoming one of the first African-\nAmerican lawyers in Tennessee. It was during this time he met and \nmarried Ms. Frances Dancy. Frances was a school teacher and guidance \ncounselor. Eventually, her career took a different path, and she became \nher husband's assistant, adviser, and traveling companion. They had one \ndaughter together, Patricia Hooks Gray.\n  As Dr. Hooks continued to practice law, he was called to fight for \ncivil rights from another forum, the ministry. In 1956, he was ordained \na Baptist minister and began to preach regularly at the Middle Baptist \nChurch in Memphis, TN. It was there he joined Dr. Martin Luther King, \nJr.'s Southern Christian Leadership Conference and became a pioneer in \nthe NAACP-sponsored restaurant sit-ins and other boycotts.\n  Through these efforts, he became a respected voice in the community \nand in the State. In 1965, Gov. Frank Clement appointed him to become \nthe first African-American criminal court judge in Tennessee history.\n  His efforts as a preacher, judge, and civil rights pioneer eventually \nled Hooks to Washington, DC, to become the first African-American \nappointee to the Federal Communications Commission. There he continued \nthe civil rights fight by addressing numerous minority representation \nissues in the communications industry.\n  In 1976, he was elected as the executive director of the NAACP, where \nhe led that organization for more than 15 years. As a director, he \nhelped to increase membership and fundraising efforts, as well as plan \nfor the organization's future for 17 years.\n  He also broadened the scope of the NAACP by exploring national issues \nsuch as energy, the environment, the criminal justice system, welfare, \nand national health insurance.\n  Throughout his work as a civil rights advocate, he has received \nnumerous awards, including the Humanitarian Award from the National \nConference of Christians and Jews, and the Freedom Award from the \nNational Civil Rights Museum.\n  The University of Memphis created the Benjamin L. Hooks Institute for \nSocial Change, honoring Benjamin Hooks. The Hooks Institute works to \nadvance understanding of the civil rights movement through teaching, \nresearch, and community programs and put an emphasis on social \nmovements, race relations, strong communities, public education, \neffective public participation, and social and economic justice.\n  On Monday, I am pleased that Dr. Hooks will receive one more honor, \none of the highest civilian awards: the Presidential Medal of Freedom. \nThis medal is given to individuals who have\n\n[[Page S13722]]\n\nmade an especially meritorious contribution to society.\n  Dr. Hooks is a living example of that type of person. His life is an \nexample that even while facing adversity through hard work, you can \naccomplish revolutionary change. His legacy will not only continue in \nour State but also throughout our Nation.\n  So it is only fitting that through this award he once again joins the \nranks of other civil rights pioneers such as Martin Luther King, Jr., \nClarence M. Mitchell, Leon Howard Sullivan, and Roy Wilkins.\n  It is an honor and a privilege to serve in the Senate on behalf of \nTennesseans such as Dr. Hooks, who have exemplified the great courage \nthat has not only positively affected our State but our country as \nwell.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Klobuchar). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/02/senate-section/article/S13722-1", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13722]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        CONSUMER PRODUCT SAFETY\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I thank the Presiding Officer, the \nSenator from Minnesota, for the work she has done on the issue I will \ntalk about today--consumer product safety.\n  This year, our Nation has witnessed recall after recall after recall \nof contaminated products--toys, vitamins, pet food, tires, the list \ngoes on and on. Our fundamentally flawed trade policy, mixed with an \nindifferent--or worse--consumer protection agency, has eroded nearly 40 \nyears of safety standards in our Nation. In the past, until the last \nfew years, our safety standards assured parents they could trust that \ntheir children's toys were lead free.\n  We are now trying to strengthen the Consumer Protection Safety \nCommission. I am a cosponsor of the legislation authored by Senator \nPryor that will help strengthen that agency--the agency charged with \nkeeping our families safe from contaminated products--whether it is \ntoys or other products.\n  Earlier this week, however, a New York Times story revealed that the \nCPSC Acting Chairwoman, Nancy Nord, is actively working against these \nimprovements, lobbying Congress to kill this bill. That is shameful.\n  This morning's Washington Post revealed that, in addition to fighting \nagency improvements, Chairwoman Nord has enjoyed trips across the \ncountry and around the world, paid for by the very toy companies she is \nresponsible for regulating. That is outrageous.\n  These were trips paid for by the toy industry, the industry that is \nnow under scrutiny for cutting corners--cutting corners that earn big \nprofits for industry CEOs and sends toxic toys into our children's \nbedrooms.\n  Parents have the right to trust that their children's toys are safe. \nEvery American has the right to trust that their Government is doing \nits job to keep us safe. Sadly, that does not appear to be the case \nwith the CPSC.\n  Now, Chairwoman Nord claims her agency simply doesn't have the \nresources to do the job right. She claims the legislation now working \nits way through Congress would overburden her agency. Why then, one \nmust ask, did Chairwoman Nord fail to ask for more money when she met \nwith the Appropriations Committee earlier this year? The 2008 budget \nshe defended before Congress doesn't even account for inflation. It \nleaves this agency less well equipped to prevent harm to children and \nto the rest of us. She stood up before the House Financial Services \nAppropriations Subcommittee and defended this budget, never once \nasserting the need for additional resources.\n  What better opportunity could Chairwoman Nord have had to improve her \nagency? What better opportunity could she have had to protect our \nfamilies? But she failed.\n  The CPSC budget is half what it was when it was created in the \n1970s--in the days when most toys and consumer products were made in \nthis country. We imported last year $288 billion worth of products from \nChina, tens of billions of dollars of products and toys from China and \nother countries that don't have a regulatory system or a Consumer \nProduct Safety Commission or a system in place to protect consumers.\n  During this time, the CPSC staff dwindled from nearly 1,000 to 420. \nWe must increase funding and staff to the CPSC. We need to increase \ncoordination between the CPSC and Customs officials. We must give the \nCPSC the authority to examine and approve other nations' regulatory \nsystems before imports from those countries show up in our children's \nbedrooms.\n  We need a leader at the CPSC who supports these goals. It is clear \nthat Chairwoman Nord does not. She has been given the responsibility of \ndoing everything in her power to keep our families safe and our \nchildren safe. Instead, Chairwoman Nord supports an abysmal agency \nbudget request, is actively working against efforts to strengthen her \nagency, and takes trips funded by manufacturers.\n  Chairwoman Nancy Nord should step down. It is time to put a \nchairperson in place who is not satisfied with: We are doing the best \nwe can.\n  We need a chairperson who fights for the authority and the resources \nthe CPSC needs to do the job it is supposed to do--protect our \nfamilies.\n  We need real leadership at the CPSC--leadership that doesn't side \nwith manufacturers over consumer safety, leadership that stands up to \nindustry pressure, leadership that puts our children and our families \nfirst.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/02/senate-section/article/S13722-2", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13722-S13723]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nRECOGNIZING THE 60TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE AIR FORCE AND NELLIS AIR FORCE \n                                  BASE\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I rise today to commemorate the 60th \nanniversary of the U.S. Air Force. As you are well aware, the Air Force \nwas created by the National Security Act of 1947, the very same law \nthat established the Department of Defense, the National Security \nCouncil, and the Central Intelligence Agency.\n  Like many of my colleagues in this distinguished Chamber, I represent \na State with a rich history of involvement with and support for the \nU.S. Air Force. Less than 6 months after the Air Force was officially \nfounded on September 18, 1947, the Las Vegas Air Force Base was \nreactivated to host a pilot training wing. With the onset of the Korean \nwar, its mission changed from an advanced single-engine school to one \nof training jet fighter pilots for the then Far East Air Forces. And \nthus began a long tradition of air combat training programs held at \nthis site that has earned this Air Force base the proud nickname ``Home \nof the Fighter Pilot.''\n  No single airman in Nevada history exemplified the meaning behind \nthis slogan more than LT William H. Nellis. Born in Santa Rita, NM, in \n1916, as a young man Lieutenant Nellis moved to my hometown of \nSearchlight, Nevada, where his father--like so many other respectable \nNevadans--worked as a hard rock miner. When World War II began, \nLieutenant Nellis was already married with 2 children, but this \npassionate young man knew he could not remain uninvolved in America's \neffort to rid the world of foreign oppression. After seeing a newsreel \nabout the Army Air Corps, the precursor to the U.S. Air Force, he \ndecided to enlist.\n  During the course of his valiant service, Lieutenant Nellis flew 69 \nmissions over Europe and was shot down twice, surviving each crash and \nmaking his way back to Allied lines. Unwavering in his patriotism, he \ncontinued to volunteer to fly, doing what he saw as his duty for the \ngreat cause. Sadly, Lieutenant Nellis' last flight would come on \nDecember 27, 1944. During the Battle of the Bulge, an engagement that \nwould cost the lives of nearly 20,000 Americans, Lieutenant Nellis was \nkilled in action while flying with the 513th Fighter Squadron, 406 \nFighter Group over Bastogne.\n  To honor this great Nevadan and a true American hero, the Las Vegas \nAir Force Base was renamed in his honor on May 20, 1950. Ever since, \nNellis Air Force Base has been a stalwart of Nevada's military \ninfrastructure and has provided U.S. airmen with the very best aerial \ncombat training in the world.\n  As the pinnacle of advanced air combat aviation training, Nellis Air \nForce Base has provided invaluable service to the United States and its \nefforts in the global war on terror. The mission statement at Nellis \nsums it up best,\n\n[[Page S13723]]\n\n``The crews do not come to learn how to fly, but instead how to be the \nbest combat aviators in the world.''\n  As we celebrate this historic occasion, we must never forget the \nimportance of places like Nellis Air Force Base. I know many of my \ncolleagues here in the U.S. Senate share my belief that America's \nability to project its military might in the skies around the world is \na direct result of the expert training programs at facilities like \nNellis. Today we honor all of the men and women who have served proudly \nin the U.S. Air Force over the past 60 years. We owe them a tremendous \namount of gratitude for their courageous sacrifices in defending the \nnation that we all work so hard to preserve.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/02/senate-section/article/S13723-1", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13723]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                APPROPRIATIONS SUBCOMMITTEE ASSIGNMENTS\n\n  Mr. BYRD.

Madam President, it has been a little over a year since I \nlast spoke in this Chamber about the fragile peace process in Sri \nLanka. I want to take a moment to discuss the situation today because \nin the past year we have seen human rights in that small island nation \nsteadily deteriorate. I also want to correct some confusion that may \nhave occurred as a result of statements reported in the press regarding \nthe Senate's action in connection with the fiscal year 2008 State, \nForeign Operations appropriations bill. That bill passed the Senate by \na vote of 81 to 12 on September 6, 2007, and we are waiting to begin \nconference discussions with the House of Representatives.\n  Over the years, I have been a strong supporter of U.S.-Sri Lankan \nrelations. A good friend, Ambassador James Spain, served there, and the \nAmerican people acted quickly to provide emergency assistance for Sri \nLanka after the December 2004 tsunami devastated Sri Lanka's east, \nnorth, and southern coasts, claiming tens of thousands of lives. Beyond \nthat, we have long supported the Sri Lankan Government's efforts to \nrespond to acts of terrorism by the LTTE, which has been designated by \nthe Department of State and the European Union as a foreign terrorist \norganization because of its attacks against civilians, assassinations \nof political leaders, forced recruitment of children, and other crimes.\n  We deplore these tactics. However, we are also aware that the LTTE \nhas, at times, shown a willingness to participate in serious \nnegotiations, as well as to respond to human rights concerns. These \novertures should be pursued. We also recognize that the LTTE should not \nbe equated with the Tamil community. There are many ethnic Tamils \nliving in and outside of Sri Lanka who do not condone acts of violence \nand terrorism against civilians. Many have been victims of the LTTE \nthemselves.\n  At the same time, our aid to the Sri Lankan Government is not a blank \ncheck. We have been increasingly concerned with reports of abuses by \nSri Lankan Government forces--not from the LTTE or their supporters as \nsome have inaccurately claimed but from the United Nations, the \nDepartment of State, and international human rights organizations. \nThese reports are not ``disinformation'' or ``misinformation'' as some \nSri Lankan officials have alleged. Rather, they contain specific, \ndocumented, consistent information indicating a steady increase in \nserious human rights violations by both Sri Lankan Government forces \nand the LTTE since the collapse of the ceasefire. While the first acts \nof aggression were attributed to the LTTE, these reports also implicate \nGovernment forces in attacks on civilians, extrajudicial executions, \ntorture, and forced disappearances. There is also evidence that Sri \nLankan Government forces have stood by while allied paramilitary \norganizations have carried out abuses, including forcibly recruiting \nchild soldiers. With few exceptions, the Sri Lankan Government has yet \nto bring the perpetrators, including members of Government security \nforces, to justice.\n  It is important to note that the Sri Lankan Government's respect for \nhuman rights and the rule of law has deteriorated even outside \nconflict-affected areas. The Millennium Challenge Corporation suspended \nmore than $11 million intended for Sri Lanka because of the \ndeteriorating security situation and the Government's worsening \nperformance on human rights. Freedom House, whose assessments of \npolitical rights and civil liberties are factored into the Millennium \nChallenge Corporation's analysis, stated ``The serious human rights \nabuses and excessive restrictions on freedom of speech and association \nby the government of Sri Lanka merit the country's removal from a list \nof eligible recipients for U.S. Millennium Challenge Account \nassistance.'' We want to see a Millennium Challenge compact for Sri \nLanka, but these problems must first be recognized and effectively \naddressed.\n  An international human rights field presence, under the auspices of \nthe United Nations, could do much to improve the situation. Given the \ngravity and scale of the violations witnessed in Sri Lanka, and \nparticularly the inability of the Sri Lankan Government to monitor the \nabuses taking place in areas held by the LTTE, such a presence would \nhelp protect lives, document abuses by all sides, and support the \nGovernment and civil society in protecting the civilian population. The\n\n[[Page S13724]]\n\nDepartment of State has publicly endorsed such a role for the United \nNations.\n  It is due to this information, from reputable sources, that the \nSenate attached three conditions to our assistance to the Sri Lankan \nmilitary in the fiscal year 2008 State, Foreign Operations \nappropriations bill. Anyone who reviews those conditions should agree \nthat they are reasonable and appropriate. They would require the Sri \nLankan Government to be bringing to justice members of the military who \nhave been credibly alleged to have committed gross violations of human \nrights; end unreasonable restrictions on access in the country by \nhumanitarian organizations and journalists; and agree to the \nestablishment of a field presence of the Office of the U.N. High \nCommissioner for Human Rights in Sri Lanka.\n  It is regrettable that rather than explain why the Sri Lankan \nGovernment should not meet such reasonable standards when it is seeking \nmillions of dollars in U.S. taxpayer assistance, some Sri Lankan \nofficials have attacked our motives and falsely attributed our actions \nto LTTE propaganda. Others have insisted that they are meeting these \nstandards already, when the facts clearly indicate that far more needs \nto be done.\n  We want Sri Lanka to succeed in stopping terrorism, and we recognize \nthat military force can be necessary against terrorist tactics. But \nthere is no military solution to the Sri Lankan conflict, which has \ndragged on for more than two decades. Thousands of innocent people--\nSinhalese, Tamils, and Muslims--have been killed. More than 1,000 are \nreported to have ``disappeared'' in just the past 12 to 18 months, and \nmany more before that. Hundreds of thousands of civilians have been \ndisplaced by the fighting. Families on both sides of the conflict have \nsuffered terribly, and the country remains divided and no closer to \npeace.\n  Every time a Sri Lankan soldier violates international humanitarian \nlaw it alienates the very people in the Tamil community whose support \nthe Government needs to combat terrorism. Our country has experienced a \nsimilar problem in Iraq, where killings of civilians have hurt our \nmission, tarnished our image and weakened the support of our allies.\n  I would hope that the Sri Lankan Government would see our action for \nwhat it is. We want to help, but not unconditionally. I believe the \nUnited States could and should play a more active role, with other key \npartners, in helping to facilitate negotiations on a political \nsettlement. But rhetoric about human rights and the appointment of \nineffectual commissions of inquiry that have no credibility, only goes \nso far. The situation remains grave and those responsible for abuses \nare rarely punished, making a peace agreement more difficult to \nachieve. A field presence of the Office of the High Commissioner for \nHuman Rights, with sufficient mandate and capability to conduct full \nand unfettered monitoring throughout the country, communicate its \nfindings to all sides of the conflict and the public, and provide \nadvice and technical assistance, is overdue. Also urgently needed is \ngreater access for humanitarian organizations to assist civilians \ncaught in the crossfire and for journalists to report the facts.\n  The Sri Lankan people have suffered the consequences of ethnic \ndiscrimination, violence, and injustice for the better part of their \ncountry's history. We cannot solve Sri Lanka's conflict; only the Sri \nLankan people can. But we can and want to continue helping if the \nGovernment demonstrates that it takes our concerns seriously.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/02/senate-section/article/S13724-1", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13724]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                 TRIBUTE TO JACK SPALDING SCHRODER, JR.\n\n Mr. ISAKSON. Madam President, today I honor in the Record of \nthe Senate Jack Spalding Schroder, Jr. of Atlanta, who is a great \nGeorgian and a great American. I honor Jack upon his retirement from \nAlston & Bird and for his work on behalf of the Georgia Hospital \nAssociation.\n  For nearly 32 years, Jack has served as lead legal counsel for the \nGeorgia Hospital Association as an employee of Alston & Bird and its \npredecessor. He has served alongside three different association \npresidents, beginning with Seldon Brown in 1975, and he has authored \nnumerous articles on hospitals and healthcare. He helped pave the way \nin the 1980s for public, not-for-profit hospitals to transfer \nleadership to not-for-profit governing boards that reduced political \npressures and enhanced fundraising abilities. His efforts culminated in \na major judicial victory at the Georgia Supreme Court.\n  Jack helped craft Georgia's first-ever Certificate of Need law, a law \ndesigned to control rising health care costs and preserve access to \nhospital services for all Georgians. In the past 10 years, while \npolitical pressures have forced other states to abandon Certificate of \nNeed, Jack has been instrumental in helping Georgia preserve its \nsuccessful Certificate of Need program.\n  Jack also helped shape important pieces of indigent care-related \nlegislation that were designed to preserve access to care for hundreds \nof thousands of indigent patients while strengthening Georgia's local, \ncommunity hospitals.\n  In addition to his role as lead legal counsel for the Georgia \nHospital Association, Jack has served as president of the Georgia \nAcademy of Health Care Attorneys as well as on the boards of a number \nof prominent health care law groups such as the Atlanta Bar Association \nand the American Health Lawyers Association.\n  Jack has served as a tireless advocate for enhancing Georgia \nhospitals' ability to provide quality, cost-effective health care \nservices to every Georgia resident. He and his wife Karen have earned \nthe many happy years of retirement ahead of them.\n  It gives me a great deal of pleasure and it is a privilege to \nrecognize on the floor of the U.S. Senate the contributions of Jack \nSchroder to the health care industry, to the Georgia Hospital \nAssociation and to the State of Georgia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/02/senate-section/article/S13724-2", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13724]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               RECOGNITION OF MOUNT MORIAH BAPTIST CHURCH\n\n Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Madam President, I wish to pay tribute \nto a historic church celebrating its 120th anniversary on November 10 \nto 11, 2007. Mount Moriah Baptist Church in Omaha, NE, was founded in \n1887 and continues to thrive as it serves a vast congregation within \nthe minority community living in Nebraska's largest city.\n  This anniversary is a significant achievement, especially for an \ninstitution born during a time of racial bigotry and hatred in America. \nThe church's founding required the strength, courage, and faith of \nearly African-American leaders, who recognized the importance of their \nmission to create a church which has now succeeded in delivering the \nWord of God to generations in three different centuries.\n  Mount Moriah Baptist Church has an interesting history. It was first \norganized in 1867, but due to the lack of a Black presence, membership \ndeclined. Then in 1887, the Reverend Amos Johnson organized a new \nbaptist church with just seven members. A name was not immediately \nselected for the newly organized body. Finally, in 1888, the \nparishioners settled on Mount Pisgah Baptist Church. However, in 1897, \nthe Enterprise newspaper reported the resignation of the Reverend R. \nJanuary, who asked some of the church members to form a new \ncongregation. The remaining members reorganized their congregation as \nthe Mount Moriah Missionary Baptist Church.\n  Mount Moriah, whose name means ``prepared for God,'' has had to \nsurvive numerous challenges, including several changes in location and \na fire which caused significant damage during the mid-1920s. In 1956, \nduring the administration of Reverend St. Clair, who served for 20 \nyears, the church underwent extensive renovations.\n  Today, 12 decades after it was formed, Mount Moriah Baptist Church \nremains a focal point in Omaha, NE, just as its namesake, Mount Moriah \nin Jerusalem, has always been a focal point in biblical history.\n  I wish to commend Rev. Ralph B. Lassiter, Sr., and the congregation \nof Mount Moriah Baptist Church of Omaha, NE, for continuing the long \nand glorious tradition of teaching the Bible and its meaning and \ntraining the faithful how to live its message. Your service is truly \nadmirable.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/02/senate-section/article/S13725-1", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13725]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S13725]]\n                    MEASURES PLACED ON THE CALENDAR\n\n  The following bills were read the second time, and placed on the \ncalendar:\n\n       S. 2293.

Res. 365\n\n       Whereas the people of the United States have sincere \n     appreciation and respect for the individuals who serve in the \n     Armed Forces;\n       Whereas in order to recognize their sacrifices, including \n     time out from their civilian careers while serving in the \n     Armed Forces, Congress enacted the Veterans' Preference Act \n     of 1944 to restore veterans to a more favorable competitive \n     position for Federal Government employment;\n       Whereas, although veterans acquire skills and qualities \n     during their military service that make them ideal candidates \n     for employment, some veterans need assistance in readjusting \n     to civilian life, evidenced by the fact that the unemployment \n     rate of young veterans is more than twice the national rate;\n       Whereas it is acknowledged that the dignity, pride, and \n     satisfaction of a civilian job are essential to the smooth \n     and full reintegration into civilian life of those who have \n     answered our Nation's call to arms; and\n       Whereas all citizens and all employers benefit from the \n     service of members of the Armed Forces and thus bear some \n     responsibility to assist in the reintegration of former \n     servicemembers into civilian life: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) urges all employers, private sector as well as State, \n     county, and local government, to target veterans for \n     recruitment and to afford qualified veterans hiring \n     preference similar to the benefits provided by chapter 33 of \n     title 5, United States Code, to preference eligibles, as \n     defined in section 2108 of such title; and\n       (2) encourages the President to issue a proclamation in \n     connection with Veterans Day, November 11, 2007, calling upon \n     all employers to make a special effort to target veterans for \n     recruitment and to provide preference in hiring for qualified \n     veterans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/02/senate-section/article/S13726-2", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13726-S13734]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    FOREIGN TRAVEL FINANCIAL REPORTS\n\n  In accordance with the appropriate provisions of law, the Secretary \nof the Senate herewith submits the following reports for standing \ncommittees of the Senate, certain joint committees of the Congress, \ndelegations and groups, and select and special committees of the \nSenate, relating to expenses incurred in the performance of authorized \nforeign travel:\n\n      CONSOLIDATED REPORT OF EXPENDITURE OF FUNDS FOR FOREIGN TRAVEL BY MEMBERS AND EMPLOYEES OF THE U.S. SENATE, UNDER AUTHORITY OF SEC. 22, P.L. 95-384--22 U.S.C. 1754(b), COMMITTEE ON\n                                                          AGRICULTURE, NUTRITION AND FORESTRY FOR TRAVEL FROM JULY 1 TO SEPT. 30, 2007\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                                  Per diem               Transportation             Miscellaneous                 Total\n                                                                                         -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                                       U.S. dollar               U.S. dollar               U.S. dollar               U.S. dollar\n              Name and country                             Name of currency                 Foreign     equivalent    Foreign     equivalent    Foreign     equivalent    Foreign     equivalent\n                                                                                            currency     or U.S.      currency     or U.S.      currency     or U.S.      currency     or U.S.\n                                                                                                         currency                  currency                  currency                  currency\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nElizabeth Croker:\n    Canada.................................

Madam President, I urge my colleagues to support S. 1163, \nas amended, the Blinded Veterans Paired Organ Act of 2007. This bill \nwould expand benefit eligibility for veterans with service-connected \nvision impairment and enhance the burial and memorial benefits offered \nby the Department of Veterans Affairs.\n  This legislation, which I introduced in April of this year, has \nsubsequently been amended and reported favorably by the Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs. As amended, S. 1163 would modify the standard that \nthe Department of Veterans Affairs uses when determining blindness and \nimprove compensation for veterans who experience impairment of vision \nin both eyes. The measure would also enhance burial and memorial \nbenefits for veterans, and further maintain the integrity of veterans \nbenefits by making certain that those in receipt of certain needs-based \nbenefits qualify for such benefits.\n  Vision impairment is a serious disability that frequently results \nfrom injuries sustained on the battlefield. We are all aware that \ntraumatic brain injuries caused by roadside bombs on the Iraqi highways \nare one of the greatest dangers that our service men and women face in \nIraq. These injuries are frequently accompanied by damage to the \nindividual's vision. As of August of this year, VA had granted service-\nconnection for vision impairment to 230 veterans of the conflicts in \nIraq and Afghanistan. These veterans face significant readjustment \nchallenges when they return to civilian life. Often, they find that \nthey cannot resume the same occupations or daily activities that were \nstaples of their lives before their injuries.\n  This bill would enhance disability compensation benefits for two \ndistinct groups of veterans with impaired vision due to service--those \nwith service-connected blindness in one eye who subsequently suffer \nloss of vision in the other eye later in life and those who receive \nspecial monthly compensation for multiple disabilities, including \nvision impairment. In both cases, this legislation would amend the \nvision impairment criteria used by VA so as to encompass veterans with \n20/200 vision or less, the standard for blindness used by the Social \nSecurity Administration and the American Medical Association.\n  Earlier this session, the House passed a companion bill, H.R. 797, \nthe Dr. James Allen Veteran Vision Equity Act, which would make the \nsame change to the paired organ vision criteria as S. 1163. I take this \nopportunity to acknowledge the sponsor of that bill, Representative \nTammy Baldwin of Wisconsin. A long-time ophthalmologist at the VA \nhospital in Madison, WI, Dr. James Allen, brought the issue to \nRepresentative Baldwin's attention several years ago and she has since \nworked to make the necessary change on behalf of blinded veterans. \nRepresentative Baldwin and Dr. Allen deserve thanks and credit for \ntheir efforts on behalf of veterans.\n  The amended bill also includes several provisions that would enhance \nburial and memorial benefits for veterans. I will briefly describe \nthem.\n  The amended bill would permanently authorize VA to provide government \nheadstones or markers for the privately-marked graves of veterans \ninterred at private cemeteries. Current law authorizes VA to furnish, \nupon request, an appropriate headstone or marker for the grave of an \neligible individual who died after September 10, 2001, and who is \nburied in a private cemetery, notwithstanding that the grave is marked \nby a headstone or marker furnished at private expense. Thus, in some \ncases, an individual's grave may have two markers--one privately-\npurchased and one furnished by VA. Prior to 2001, this authority had \nbeen suspended for 11 years, making those who died between November 1, \n1990, and September 10, 2001, ineligible for the benefit. Furthermore, \nthe current authority is only temporary, set to expire on December 31, \n2007. This bill would address these temporal constraints by eliminating \nthe sunset and making the authority permanent, and by making the \nauthority retroactive to cover the 11-year gap in current law. In \naddition, this bill would give VA the authority to furnish a new \nmedallion or other device that could be placed on an existing grave \nmarker in a private cemetery to signify that the deceased was a \nveteran, in lieu of providing a second marker or headstone.\n  The amended bill would also repeal the current 2-year window within \nwhich States must file for reimbursement from VA for the interment or \ninurnment of the unclaimed remains of deceased veterans. To assist \nStates in meeting some or all of their cemetery operations and \nmaintenance expenses, current law requires VA to pay to States a $300 \nplot allowance for the interment or inurnment of eligible veterans and \nreserve component members. In order to receive plot allowance revenue, \nStates must currently submit claims within 2 years after the permanent \nburial or cremation of the remains has occurred. However, the 2-year \nwindow within which States must file can prove difficult to meet in \nsituations in which remains are not identified as those of a veteran \nuntil after the 2-year period has expired.\n  Finally, the amended bill would authorize $5 million to cover a \nportion of the operational and maintenance expenses of State cemeteries \nunder criteria to be determined by VA. The need to incentivize greater \nparticipation by States in the State cemetery grant program was \ndiscussed in a December 19, 2000, VA-contracted report entitled An \nAssessment of the Burial Benefits Administered by the Department of \nVeterans Affairs. The report found that an option for better serving \nveterans and their families was to ``provide maintenance support to \nState veterans cemeteries.''\n  I am pleased to advise my colleagues that the provisions in this bill \nare paid for by utilizing the National Directory for New Hires to make \ncertain that those in receipt of certain needs-based benefits qualify \nfor such benefits. The savings from this provision more than pays for \nthe expansion of benefits to veterans that are included in this bill.\n  This is a sensible bill that would provide small but important \nimprovements to benefits of great importance to many veterans and their \nfamilies. I urge my colleagues to support its passage.\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \ncommittee-reported substitute be agreed to; that the bill, as amended, \nbe read a third time; that the Veterans' Affairs Committee then be \ndischarged of H.R. 797, the House companion, and the Senate then \nproceed to its consideration; that all after the enacting clause be \nstricken, and the text of S. 1163 be inserted in lieu thereof; that the \nbill be advanced to third reading, passed, and the motion to reconsider \nbe laid upon the table; that S. 1163 be returned to the calendar; and \nthat any statements relating to the bill be printed in the Record, \nwithout intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
