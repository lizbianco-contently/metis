Under the previous order, the \nSenate will resume consideration of H.R. 3548, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 3548) to amend the Supplemental Appropriations \n     Act, 2008, to provide for the temporary availability of \n     certain additional emergency unemployment compensation, and \n     for other purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Reid (for Baucus/Reid) amendment No. 2712, in the nature of \n     a substitute.\n       Reid amendment No. 2713 (to amendment No. 2712), to change \n     the enactment date.\n       Reid amendment No. 2714 (to amendment No. 2713), of a \n     perfecting nature.\n       Reid amendment No. 2715 (to the language proposed to be \n     stricken by amendment No. 2712), to change the enactment \n     date.\n       Reid amendment No. 2716 (to amendment No. 2715), of a \n     perfecting nature.\n       Reid motion to commit the bill to the Committee on Finance, \n     with instructions to report back forthwith, with Reid \n     amendment No. 2717, to change the enactment date.\n       Reid amendment No. 2718 (to the instructions (amendment No. \n     2717) of the motion to commit), of a perfecting nature.\n       Reid amendment No. 2719 (to amendment No. 2718), of a \n     perfecting nature.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Illinois such \ntime as he desires.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the Finance \nCommittee. He will be discussing a matter of grave importance in \nIllinois and all across the Nation, the extension of unemployment \nbenefits, which we have been trying to bring to the floor for 27 days. \nOur Republican colleagues have opposed it, stopped it, delayed it, and \ndemanded every vote they can think of to stop the extension of \nunemployment benefits, even though there are millions of Americans out \nof work and desperately looking for jobs. Many of them have exhausted \ntheir family savings trying to avoid foreclosure, to feed their \nfamilies, and they need these benefits desperately. But we have been \nheld up time and again because several Republican Senators have \ninsisted on amendments that have nothing to do with unemployment and \nnothing or little to do with the economy. I hope today we can break \nthrough that. I hope we can find bipartisan support to extend the \nunemployment benefits.\n\n  I thank the Senator from Montana for yielding a moment to me.\n  I wish to respond to my friend--and he is my friend--my colleague, \nSenator Grassley of Iowa, my neighboring State. He and I have worked on \nmany things together. Our political views differ, that is for sure, but \nI believe he is a hard-working, good representative of his State. In \nfact, when I said that once on the floor, he ended up quoting it in one \nof his campaign brochures, which got me in trouble with the Iowa \nDemocratic Party. But so be it. I like him, and I hope he feels the \nsame.\n  We have worked together on many issues, but for the Senator from Iowa \nto come to the floor and be critical of a bill saying it is too many \npages--that is what I have heard over and over again from the \nRepublican side. They have argued that health care reform in the Senate \nis going to run over 1,000 pages in length, and they say it over and \nover again.\n  I don't know historically what major legislation considered on the \nSenate floor is comprised in the number of pages, but we have had some \npretty big bills in the past--in the Senate Appropriations Committee \nand other places--because those bills take on big issues and big \nsubjects. Nothing is bigger than our health care system in America. To \ntalk about 1,000 pages really does not do justice to the enormity of \nthe task we are tackling, to try to bring costs under control so people \nand businesses across America have secure and stable health care.\n  We ought to make sure as well that the health insurance companies \nstop exploiting those who have health insurance policies. We want to \neliminate preexisting conditions as an exclusion. We want to make sure \nwhen you are sick, your health care will be there; that when you change \njobs, you can take your health care with you. We want to make sure your \nchildren are covered for longer periods of time than they are now under \ncurrent law. It takes a few pages to put that together. You cannot put \nit in a few sentences if you want to change the law and make it work.\n  So to come here and criticize the bill which has not been presented \nin a final form as I stand here I don't think makes a very strong case.\n  I asked the other day for the Republicans to tell me how many pages \ntheir health care reform bill is. The Senator from Tennessee said they \nwere working on several different bills but they would be shorter in \nlength. The closest we can come to the Republican health care reform \nbill I hold in my hand. It is 2\\1/2\\ pages long, and it consists of a \npress release from Mitch McConnell, the Senate Republican leader. That \nis as far as the Republicans have gone in writing health care reform \nfor the American people. It is a press release. In this press release, \nthere are no positive things they stand for, only criticisms of our \nefforts to write a health care reform bill.\n  To my right is the Senator from Montana, the chairman of the Senate \nFinance Committee. He has spent the better part of a year--at least a \nyear--trying to put together a health care bill. He has engaged others \nin trying to bring them into this conversation. Unfortunately, at the \nend of the day, only one Republican Senator, Ms. Snowe of Maine, joined \nSenate Democrats in voting for health care reforms. So far, she is the \nonly Republican in the House or the Senate who has voted for health \ncare reform even at the committee level. The Republicans have been \nstanding on the sidelines while we have been trying our best to put \ntogether good legislation which will bring the cost of health care \ndown, protect those beneficiaries who are denied coverage under their \nhealth insurance plans, and extend the reach of competition and choice \nso more Americans have places to turn. When the Senator from Iowa \ncomplains about so-called rationing, I think he overstates the case.\n  We know there is too much money spent on the current health care \nsystem. There is duplication, waste, and fraud, and we want it to come \nto an end. If Medicare is going to be on sound financial footing, if we \ncan say to seniors today and for years to come that they can count on \nMedicare being there when they need it, we have to cut out unnecessary \nspending.\n  One of the areas in that particular program that is highly \ncontroversial is called Medicare Advantage.\n  Medicare Advantage was proposed by the insurance industry. They said \nyears ago: The government has tried to run Medicare for 40 years, but \nthey haven't done a very good job. Why don't you let the private \ninsurance companies offer a Medicare plan. We will show you what you \ncan do when you use the genius of the insurance industry in America to \noffer Medicare.\n  We took them up on their challenge and said to them: Present the \ninsurance policy to seniors that will provide Medicare benefits.\n\n[[Page S10980]]\n\n  They called it Medicare Advantage, and there are literally millions \nof these policies all across America today.\n  We stepped back after a number of years and said: How did they do?\n  They challenged the government and said: We can do it better.\n  Some did. But we also found Medicare Advantage plans that were \novercharging the government 14 percent more than the cost of basic \nMedicare the government offered. So instead of bringing the costs down, \nthe costs went up 14 percent. We were creating a subsidy to private \nhealth insurance companies to offer Medicare plans. That is a waste of \ndollars. The health insurance industry, although they used those \ndollars to their own benefit, are not helping Medicare, and they are \nnot helping the taxpayers of this country.\n  The recent news about profits of the insurance giant Humana explains \nwhy the major health insurance companies and most of the Republicans \noppose health care reform and why they have gone to such great lengths \nto defeat our efforts.\n  Last quarter, Humana saw their profits rise 65 percent, mostly due to \nthe participation in the Medicare Advantage Program, the subsidies the \ntaxpayers are sending them. This one company made $301 million in \nprofits in the last 3 months alone, and they did it, by their own \nadmission, on the backs of Medicare and Medicare Advantage \nbeneficiaries.\n  The insurance industry is making billions by gaming the Medicare \nAdvantage system at the expense of seniors' traditional Medicare \ncoverage, and taxpayers are picking up the bill. For some reason, the \nSenate Republicans feel the need to defend them at every turn. When you \nhear the opposition to health care reform, it is inspired not \nexclusively but to a great extent by the opposition to health care \nreform from the private health insurance companies.\n  Why are these companies opposed to health care reform? Because it \nmeans competition. A public option plan that is available around this \ncountry will create in many parts in our country the first real \ncompetition for health insurance. It means consumers have a fighting \nchance to get a lower monthly premium because there will be a not-for-\nprofit company there offering health insurance benefits. It is a \ncompany that is not focused on the bottom line of showing profits for \nshareholders. It will be a company that is not marketing and spending a \nfortune on advertising. It will be a company that is not spending so \nmuch on administrative help to say no to those covered by insurance \npolicies. This will lower costs, and this is what drives the private \nhealth insurance companies wild.\n  Secondly, they hate to hear two words--McCarran-Ferguson--because \nthey refer to a law passed by Congress 64 years ago which exempted the \ninsurance industry and health insurance industry from antitrust \nregulations. Currently under the law, health insurance companies can \nlegally conspire and collude to establish the premiums they will charge \nall across America. There is no real competition. When they set \npremiums, they have sat down and agreed on what they are going to \ncharge. And they can allocate markets. They can make sure they dominate \nmarkets so there is no real choice there for consumers.\n  I think McCarran-Ferguson is outdated. It is a travesty under the law \nto allow it continue, and it should end. You will not hear one single \nRepublican Senator say that--at least I haven't yet. I hope they join \nus in calling for real health insurance reform, in ending McCarran-\nFerguson protection and exclusions based on preexisting conditions, for \nexample, and giving real choice to consumers across this country. \nInstead, what we hear from them is the language of the health insurance \ncompanies opposing fundamental health insurance reform.\n  The American people have run out of patience with those who tolerate \nand encourage the current system--a system that fails us, as premiums \ngo up even as wages do not; a system that, unfortunately, is not \noffering health care protection for millions of Americans working for \nbusinesses that even last year offered health insurance protection but \nthey just cannot afford to do it anymore.\n  We are going to keep pressing forward. The Republican plan consists \nof a three-page press release. It will take more than that to bring \nmeaningful change to health care in America.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, we are now on the provision to extend \nunemployment insurance, as well as extend the home buyers tax credit, \nas well as expand the net operating loss provision. I wish to speak \nabout that provision because I think it is so important that it pass.\n  The British mathematical physicist Lord Kelvin once said:\n\n       Until you can measure something and express it in numbers, \n     you have only the beginning of understanding.\n\n  The numbers now measure the beginning of a recovery, and we are \nbeginning to understand the depth of the great recession of 2008 and \n2009. It has been the longest recession since World War II. The numbers \nshow that the American economy has been shrinking from the middle of \nlast year to the middle of this year--shrinking. For January through \nMarch, it declined at a 6.4-percent annual rate. It has been the \nsharpest decline in 27 years. But last week, the Commerce Department \nreported that from July through September, the numbers show the economy \ngrew at a 3.5-percent annual rate.\n  When economists talk about the end of a recession, however, they mean \nthe time when things stop getting worse, not necessarily getting better \nbut stop getting worse. For most Americans, it will still be some time \nbefore things start getting better. Even though the economists can \nmeasure some improvement and express it in the numbers, we still have \nonly the beginning of a recovery.\n  Economists say that the stimulus package we passed last winter is \npart of the reason for the growth. On Friday, the Obama administration \nreported that the stimulus package has created or saved more than \n640,000 jobs so far. Economists also credit consumer spending for the \nlatest growth. In particular, economists credit automobile and housing \nsales. From July through September, housing sales rose at a 23.4-\npercent annual rate. The home buyer tax credit played a big part in \nthat growth. That is one of the provisions we are considering in the \namendment before us today.\n  It will still take some time for the job picture to improve. Job \ngrowth turns around more slowly than the economy as a whole. Economists \ncall this a lagging indicator. Last month, the jobless rate reached 9.8 \npercent. That is the highest rate in 26 years. Economists expect this \nweek's report will show that unemployment rose again this month. \nEconomists will say jobs will still be hard to find well into 2010.\n  Last week, the Labor Department reported that 530,000 people filed \ntheir first jobless claims. That number has been heading down, but at \nmore than half a million people, it is still far too high.\n  We still need to do more to help the economy recover, and we still \nneed to do more to help Americans get and keep good jobs. The extension \nof unemployment benefits and the tax relief in this legislation are \npart of the answer. I hope that today the Senate can act to bring \nrelief to millions of Americans waiting for this important legislation. \nUnemployment insurance is a vital lifeline for millions of Americans. \nIt is a lifeline many families and communities continue to need just to \nkeep afloat.\n  Along with the rest of the Nation, my State of Montana has felt the \neffects of this great recession. Our unemployment rate is up to 6.5 \npercent, and although it is not as high as the national average, many \nin my State are suffering. This is particularly true in the Montana \nmining, lumber, and construction industries. The national demand for \nlumber is expected to fall below 30 million board feet this year. The \namount of lumber used to build new homes is expected to drop from 28 \nbillion board feet to about 5 billion board feet, and that hits Montana \nvery hard.\n  When we help unemployed Americans, let's remember, we help their \ncommunities. When we help our unemployed neighbors, we also help keep \nopen the neighborhood grocery store and the neighborhood gas station.\n\n[[Page S10981]]\n\nWhen we help our unemployed neighbors, we also help our economy and \nourselves.\n  I am gratified that a majority of my colleagues appear to agree that \nit is important to extend unemployment benefits. I am also hopeful that \nwe will deliver those benefits very soon.\n  The amendment before us today also includes an extension of the \nFederal unemployment tax. This extension covers the cost of the \nextended unemployment benefits. The Federal unemployment tax has been \nextended every year since 1982.\n  The amendment before us today would also provide tax relief to help \nour economy recover. The pending amendment would extend the home buyers \ntax credit and provide employers important tax relief.\n  The home buyers tax credit has helped millions of Americans to buy \ntheir first homes. The tax credit has boosted demand and it has helped \nreduce the inventory of unsold homes. This, in turn, has helped to \nbring much needed stability to the housing market.\n  But in the housing market, like the labor market, we are not yet in \nthe clear. The housing market is still recovering from the implosion of \nthe subprime mortgage market. In many parts of the country, housing \nprices remain at record lows and foreclosures continue as Americans \ncontinue to lose their jobs and the means to pay their mortgages.\n  That is why it is important to extend the home buyers tax credit. In \nthe amendment before us today, we have raised the income limitations to \nopen the tax credit to millions more who are thinking about buying a \nhome. Our amendment also extends the credit to include home buyers \nseeking to move up to a new home--not just for first-time home buyers \nbut those who want to move up to a new home. For those who have lived \nin their current residence for 5 years or more, they would be eligible \nfor a $6,500 tax credit if they want to buy a new home. It is $8,000 \nfor first-time buyers and a $6,500 tax credit for those who want to \nmove up--for those who have stayed in their current residence for 5 \nyears.\n  The home buyers tax credit would be extended to April 30 of next \nyear. We also include new binding contract language. This language \nwould effectively make the credit available until June 30 of next year, \nas long as the home buyer entered into a binding contract before May 1.\n  I think this temporary extension of the home buyers tax credit is the \nright approach. It would provide a much needed stimulus of the housing \nmarket, and it would remain fiscally responsible.\n  Our amendment also would add net operating loss relief for \nbusinesses. Under current law, small businesses are able to carry back \ntheir 2008 losses to profitable years for up to 5 years. Senator Snowe \nand I worked together on a bill that would expand this provision to all \nbusinesses. The amendment before us today includes that legislation. It \nwould provide all businesses with the ability to carry back losses from \n2008 and 2009 for 5 years--not just 2 years but 5 years. That is 3 \nyears longer than under current law. This type of relief will help \nsmall and large businesses alike.\n  This tax relief is paid for also in a fiscally responsible manner. \nOur amendment would delay a tax break for multinational corporations, \nmany of which would benefit from the expanded NOL relief. We also \nincluded increases and penalties for taxpayers who fail to timely file \npartners and S corporation returns. We believe these provisions will \nincrease compliance with the tax law and also help us close the tax \ngap.\n  This package provides timely and essential relief to American \nfamilies and businesses that have been affected by our economy. Our \namendment would extend benefits to the unemployed Americans who are \nhurting the most and would help home buyers to buy homes. It would \nprovide support for all businesses that are having trouble meeting \ntheir payroll in these tough economic times.\n  This amendment would help to speed the recovery from the great \nrecession. It would help to improve our economy, and it would help the \nAmerican people. I urge my colleagues to support the legislation and \nvote for cloture on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, a few moments ago, the Senator from \nIllinois was on the Senate floor essentially responding to comments \nthat had been made by the Senator from Iowa, Mr. Grassley, regarding \nthe health care debate and the legislation that has been reported out \nof the House and that is going to be voted on this week--legislation \nwhich is 1,990 pages long.\n  The Senator from Illinois asked: Where is the Republican bill, if \nthey do not like the Democratic bill? Well, there are a number of \nRepublican bills out there, but I would say to the Senator from \nIllinois or anybody on the Democratic side who is waiting for \nRepublicans to produce a 2,000-page bill, it is not likely to happen. \nWe don't believe legislating with 2,000-page bills makes a lot of sense \nwhen we are talking about one-sixth of the American economy. We believe \nit makes a lot more sense to approach that in a way that fixes and \naddresses the problems that exist with the health care economy in this \ncountry today in a step-by-step way, not with a huge, massive expansion \nof the Federal Government in Washington, DC.\n  The bill that came out of the House last week--at least according to \nthe CBO--was a $1 trillion increase in spending. But that is before it \nis fully implemented. When it is fully implemented, it will be $2 \ntrillion in additional spending--a massive expansion of the Federal \nGovernment in Washington, DC, with massive tax increases on small \nbusinesses and working families in this country, massive cuts to \nMedicare Programs upon which seniors across this country rely and \ndepend. And that doesn't even include what happens if those cuts in \nMedicare don't happen. And we have reason to believe based on \nhistorical patterns they would not happen. Then it probably gets \nborrowed, and we add more trillions of dollars to the Federal debt--a \ndebt which is already growing at $1 trillion a year every year for the \nnext 10 years.\n  So we have a massive expansion of government--a $2 trillion expansion \nof government, massive tax increases, massive cuts to Medicare, and \nperhaps massive borrowing and additions to the Federal debt. That is \nwhat happens with the 2,000-page bill which is being proposed by the \nDemocratic leadership in the House of Representatives.\n  So if the Senator from Illinois or anybody on the other side is \nwaiting for Republicans to produce a 2,000-page bill that expands the \ngovernment by $2 trillion and raises taxes on small businesses--which \nare the economic engine of our economy and that will create the jobs \nand get us back on a path toward recovery--I would suggest they are \ngoing to be waiting a very long time.\n  That isn't to say for 1 minute that there aren't lots of ideas that \nRepublicans are putting forward that will help drive the cost of health \ncare down--contrary to the big government schemes put forward by the \nother side which, in addition to raising taxes, cutting Medicare, and \nborrowing more--if you can believe this--increases the cost of health \ncare by raising premiums for everybody who currently has health \ninsurance in this country.\n  So the 2,000-page bill isn't coming from us. We have a lot of great \nideas that we will have an opportunity to debate and amendments we can \noffer, if and when we get on this bill. But the 2,000-page bills--the \nmassive expansion of the Federal Government in Washington, DC--is not \nthe way we believe we should fix and address the health care economy.\n  That brings me to my point because in contrast to a 1,990-page bill \nsome are calling reform--which doesn't reform but certainly wrecks one-\nsixth of the American economy--I have a simple one-page amendment. It \nis four lines long. I would like to have the opportunity to offer it to \nthe underlying legislation that is a matter of debate on the \nunemployment insurance extension, which I think most people on both \nsides of this aisle support. I think both Republicans and Democrats in \nthe Senate believe it makes sense for us to extend unemployment \nbenefits coverage to people who are losing it, and the underlying bill \nwould do that by 14 weeks.\n  We also believe when a bill comes before the Senate, under the \nhistorical practices of the Senate, typically it is\n\n[[Page S10982]]\n\nopen to amendment. That is what makes the Senate different from the \nHouse of Representatives. Our Founders, in their infinite wisdom, \nconceived of two institutions--one, the House of Representatives; two, \nthe Senate. The Senate has a more deliberative role. In doing so, it \nallows for open consideration and debate and votes on amendments.\n  What has happened today is that the majority leader has decided to \nfill the tree; in other words, not to allow votes on any amendments. So \nmy one-page amendment, which is very simple and straightforward, isn't \ngoing to get voted on.\n  Mr. President, all my amendment does is end, on December 31 of this \nyear, TARP. If the Congress doesn't take action, the Treasury Secretary \ncan extend TARP. What is important to note about that is TARP has over \n$200 billion that hasn't been spent, and with payments that have come \nback into that fund, over $300 billion in funds that are unexpended. If \nwe don't spend those--and it doesn't become a political slush fund to \nbe spent on other priorities the Federal Government in Washington comes \nup with--that goes to pay down the Federal debt.\n\n  I can't think of anything more important now than trying to pay down \nthe Federal debt. If we are worrying about trying to help the economy \nrecover and helping taxpayers, let's take the unobligated balance in \nthe TARP fund, end that program at the end of the year, and use those \nproceeds to apply to the Federal debt so we can start making a dent in \nthese massive deficits and this massive debt building in Washington, \nDC.\n  So that is all my amendment does. It just ends TARP at the end of the \nyear. I think it is significant that since Congress created TARP, \nCongress ought to have a say in whether it gets extended. If we are \ngoing to have that say, it has to happen between now and the end of the \nyear.\n  I couldn't find many opportunities between now and the end of the \nyear to get this amendment offered, and as we had this piece of \nlegislation moving through the Senate, the sort of natural inclination \nof this institution is to allow for amendments to be considered. So I \noffered that amendment so that Congress can be on the record as to \nwhether we think TARP ought to be extended or whether it ought to be \nended and those unobligated balances be used to pay down the Federal \ndebt, which, as I said, is growing at $1 trillion a year for the next \n10 years.\n  So I think it is a very straightforward, simple amendment, and simple \nenough that it can be put on one page. It doesn't take 1,990 pages to \nexplain this. That is all it does. I think it is important to the \ntaxpayers that we have this vote and that the Senate be on the record, \nthat we be heard with respect to whether we think TARP ought to be \nextended or not, since Congress created TARP a year ago to bring \nstabilization to the financial services industry of this country.\n  That having been accomplished, it seems to me the next step ought to \nbe to focus on getting the Federal debt under control and paying down \nthe debt. We can do that by taking those unexpended balances and the \nunobligated balances in TARP and put those toward the Federal debt.\n  What is being done today is filling the tree and preventing us from \nhaving votes in the Senate. It has been done before; it is not like \nthis is entirely new. But it is important to bear in mind what my \ncolleagues on the other side have said in the past when it was done \nback when the Republicans were in charge of the Senate. I want to quote \nwhat some of the Democrats who are in leadership positions in the \nSenate today said back then.\n  This is in February of 2006.\n\n       This is a very bad practice. It runs against the basic \n     nature of the Senate.\n\n  That was Senator Harry Reid. \n\n       This is a bad way, in my opinion, to run the Senate.\n\n  Harry Reid in March of 2006.\n\n       I have a right, under the procedures of the Senate, to \n     offer this amendment. I should have the right to offer it at \n     the moment, but I am not because there is--I guess the word \n     ``obstruction'' is to be used--obstruction at the moment is \n     the tree is filled so that no one can offer an amendment.\n\n  That was Senator Byron Dorgan back in February 2006.\n\n       If you don't want to cast controversial votes, don't run \n     for the Senate. That is what this is all about. You have to \n     face the music and face the voters.\n\n  That was the Senator from Illinois, Dick Durbin, back in May of 2006.\n  Those are just a few examples of what my colleagues on the other side \nhave said about the very practice that is being employed by the leader \ntoday to prevent Republicans from offering amendments. Those are \nstatements, as I said, made by Members of the now majority back when \nthey were in the minority.\n  So we are going to have a cloture vote at 5 o'clock--in a few \nminutes--on whether to proceed to this substitute that is pending \nbefore us and whether we are going to allow this practice of filling \nthe amendment tree to be used to prevent not only Members on the \nRepublican side but Members on the Democratic side from offering \namendments.\n  Filling the tree is, as I said, not without precedent. It has been \ndone. But it has been used rarely, historically, up until now. This \nwill mark the 22nd time the Democratic leader has filled the amendment \ntree in an attempt to prevent an open and fair debate and a vote on \namendments that are offered by the Senate.\n  I served as a Member of the House of Representatives for three terms. \nThere, the Rules Committee regulates what legislation comes to the \nfloor, what amendments are made in order, how much time is allocated to \neach amendment, and it is an orderly process. That is the way the House \nwas designed by our Founders.\n  The Senate is a very different institution. The Senate is supposed to \nbe the place where we have open debate, where we have a fair process \nthat allows amendments to be heard and allows amendments to be voted \non. I think we have been very reasonable in seeking to offer amendments \nto the underlying unemployment insurance bill. But as I said, Mr. \nPresident, the majority leader has chosen to ``fill the amendment \ntree'' and thereby prevent those amendments from being offered, those \namendments from being debated, and those amendments from being voted \non.\n  Mr. President, I know the Senator from Nebraska is here as well. He \nalso has an amendment he would like to offer that would offset in a \ndifferent way the extension of the unemployment coverage to the people \nwho are losing their coverage and should have their benefits extended \nby the additional 14 weeks. His is an amendment I also think should be \nvoted on in the Senate.\n  But I would like an opportunity to have this amendment voted on. It \nis one page. But we will not have that opportunity because the majority \nleader has opted to fill the amendment tree and prevent votes on those \namendments.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I wish to make a couple of points, not get \ninto a knockdown, drag-out argument with my good friend from South \nDakota.\n  First, he is saying the Democratic side is limiting his opportunity \nto offer amendments. I want to remind my friend that actually there has \nbeen a lot of to and fro here. The majority leader has offered many \nother opportunities for your side to offer amendments, back and forth, \nbut it has gotten to the point where the leader had to draw the line \nand say we have to get moving here, we have to get moving on extending \nunemployment insurance. The point is, there were many opportunities to \noffer amendments, both ways. We have to get moving here and get \nunemployment insurance extended.\n  The other main point I think is important, just to raise it, \nbasically suggesting this bill is not paid for. The Congressional \nBudget Office is the gold standard here. The Congressional Budget \nOffice says at least the Finance Committee bill--we don't have another \nbill before us yet in the Senate, but the Finance Committee bill, the \ncommittee I chair--the CBO said the Finance Committee bill was deficit \nneutral for 10 years. That is their assessment. The CBO is the gold \nstandard. They make these determinations. That is what they said.\n  They also concluded that the Finance Committee bill would reduce the \ndeficit in future years--reduce the deficit\n\n[[Page S10983]]\n\nin future years--and significantly reduce the deficit in subsequent 10-\nyear intervals.\n  I must say, they also made another very interesting conclusion that \nrebuts the charge that this health care legislation is more government. \nThe fact is, the Congressional Budget Office concluded, in a letter to \nour committee, the bill would ``reduce the Government's overall \ncommitment to health care.''\n  Reduce the Federal Government's overall commitment to health care--\nnot the same, not increase, but reduce. That is the Congressional \nBudget Office, in a letter: Reduce it. They gave a percentage. I think \nreduce it by a quarter or half percent GDP over time.\n  We do not have legislation before us now because the leader is \nmelding two bills together, the HELP Committee and Finance Committee \nbills. Then we have to go to conference and so on and so forth, but it \nwould be my hope, be my expectation, be my interest, to see that \ncontinues, namely that the bill we pass out of this body is deficit \nneutral, when it comes back from conference it is deficit neutral over \n10 years, actually does reduce the budget deficit over time, and \nactually reduces the Federal Government's commitment to health care. \nThat is, the Federal Government would be paying less in health care \nover time. I hope that will be the case and that will be my \nexpectation. That is something I will strive for.\n  I want to make it clear: not more government, less government--\naccording to CBO anyway. Also the proposal out of the Finance Committee \nwas deficit neutral.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is recognized.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, may I inquire how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There remains 4 minutes 12 seconds.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, I rise today to speak to the amendment \nprocess with this unemployment bill. It is a very important point that \nwe are making this afternoon.\n  A few hours ago the very distinguished Member from Illinois, the \nsenior Senator, got up and talked about how the unemployment insurance \nbill had been stalled by Republicans. He claimed that Republicans had \nbeen stalling it for 4 weeks. I rise today to respectfully disagree \nwith that. We have come forward with a series of amendments. That is \nwhat the Senate is about. The other side has resisted votes on the \namendments. So we started this process of trying to scale this back. We \nstarted out with eight amendments. The majority leader said, no, it \ncould only be six. So Republicans got together and said we will come \nback with only three Republican amendments. Then, lo and behold, there \nwas an objection to that.\n  Let me repeat: We said eight, they said six, we said three, and they \nsaid no.\n  It turns out there is one significant vote and it is the Senator from \nSouth Dakota who I think very appropriately and, I think, wisely put an \namendment forward that would put TARP to an end at the end of the year.\n  I am new to this process. But I have to tell you, in the first weeks \nI was here when we were voting on amendments I said to myself: This is \nthe most remarkable institution. Somebody from the minority could \nliterally come with an idea from a citizen back home, put that idea out \nhere, and get a vote on that. There cannot be anything like this \nanywhere in the world.\n  What is happening today, if I might point out, is that this is being \nthwarted by filling the tree. For those who are listening to this and \nsaying what does this filling the tree mean, all it means is that the \nmajority leader, who is in control of the process, simply puts all the \namendments out there and there is no opportunity for anybody else to \noffer an amendment. It is called filling the tree.\n  Look at what is happening. This is what does concern me as a Member \nof this great institution. If you go back through the history of \nmajority leaders, you can see what has happened. Tom Daschle, when he \nwas majority leader, I think used this once. Bill Frist, when he was \nmajority leader, used this I think it was 12 times, if I remember \ncorrectly.\n  Today, this will be 22 times that the majority leader has done this. \nWhat this graph means is if you have an amendment, as I do, that \nbasically says I like what you are doing here. I don't have any problem \nwith extending unemployment. I voted for the tax credit for homes. I \nvoted, or I would vote, for the loss carryback. I talked about it on \nthe campaign trail. But I have an amendment that says we should pay for \nthis the way we did originally, with stimulus funding. That is simple. \nThis is not complicated. All I am asking is for a vote on that. I think \nthat makes a tremendous amount of sense.\n  What I am saying is if we are going to act like a Senate, if we are \ngoing to give each Member the ability to make their case, then what we \nhave to do is stop this and bring these issues to a vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I intend to vote in favor of the H.R. 3548, \nthe Unemployment Compensation Extension Act.\n  When the Bureau of Labor Statistics recently released jobless figures \nfor September, they showed an estimated 287,300 people unemployed in my \nhome State of Arizona. The State's unemployment rate now stands at 9.1 \npercent--the highest since 1983.\n  And as if that weren't bad enough, the Bureau reports that Arizona's \nunemployment rate approaches 17.2 percent when the number of people who \nare underemployed are taken into account, along with those who are so \ndiscouraged that they have given up on their job search.\n  The construction industry in Arizona has been particularly hard hit. \nA report in the East Valley Tribune earlier this week noted that while \nthere were nearly 248,000 people employed in construction in June of \n2006, that number had declined to just 137,700 by September. That is a \ndecline of 44 percent. The State's trade and transportation sector is \noff 15 percent from its peak, and manufacturing is down nearly as much.\n  The unemployed need the support that this benefit extension will \nprovide. It is a shame, though, that we couldn't have passed this \nlegislation sooner to speed the delivery of these benefits to those who \nneed them.\n  The House of Representatives passed its version of the unemployment \nbenefits extension bill on September 22, but it was not until 2\\1/2\\ \nweeks later, on October 8, that the majority leader finally brought a \ndifferent version before the Senate for consideration. Senators were \nthen given just an hour and a half to review the bill and vote, with no \nopportunity to consider amendments.\n  In other words, the majority leader proposed that Senators either \npass his bill or no bill at all.\n  And that is a problem because there are changes that should be made \nto the bill, yet there is no opportunity for Senators of either party \nto offer amendments. Acting in my capacity as minority whip, I objected \non behalf of other Senators to the leader's short-circuited procedure, \nfully expecting that we could promptly come to an agreement to allow \nvotes on a limited number of amendments and then vote on final passage. \nHad the leader agreed, we could have disposed of the bill nearly 3 \nweeks ago, and it would probably be law by now.\n  Instead, the majority leader continued to insist that Senators vote \non his bill and only his bill, without amendment.\n  Only within the last few days has there been some willingness to work \nwith us on the important amendments Senators wanted to address. For \nexample, both Republican and Democratic Senators want to include an \nextension of the homebuyer tax credit, which some credit with reviving \nthe homebuilding industry.\n  Another colleague would like to offer an amendment to better use E-\nVerify to prevent fraudulent claims of unemployment benefits. This \namendment would help ensure that people who claim benefits are who they \nsay they are.\n  In addition, colleagues want to offer amendments on net operating \nloss as a stimulus to struggling companies. Others would sunset the \nTARP program, provide nongovernment management of the TARP, and prevent \nTARP recipients from providing funds to ACORN.\n  Another amendment proposes an alternative offset for the $2.4 billion \ncost of extending unemployment benefits. The majority's version offsets \nthe cost by extending the Federal unemployment surtax, but imposing a \ndirect tax\n\n[[Page S10984]]\n\non job creation is perhaps one of the worst things we could do when the \neconomy continues to lose jobs. The alternative that some Senators \nwould like to offer would offset the cost of the bill with unspent \nfunds from the so-called stimulus package instead.\n  How these amendments will be addressed is not yet clear; we do not \nhave the right to offer any of them under the majority leader's closed \nprocess.\n  We should also recognize that we are engaged in this exercise of \nextending unemployment benefits for one simple reason: Our economy \ncontinues to lose more jobs than it is producing. That is because the \nPresident's stimulus program is simply not working as intended.\n  According to an October 29 Associated Press report, the Obama \nadministration is overstating the impact of the stimulus and the number \nof jobs the program has created. According to the AP report, ``the \nreview found some counts were more than 10 times as high as the actual \nnumber of jobs; some jobs were credited to stimulus spending when, in \nfact, none were produced.''\n  AP went on to note that ``there's no evidence the White House sought \nto inflate job numbers in the report, but the administration embraced \nthe flawed figures the moment they were released.''\n  An October 21 report in the Phoenix Business Journal recalled that \nwhile President Obama projected that the stimulus bill would create \n70,000 new jobs in Arizona, the State has actually lost 77,300 jobs \nsince the stimulus was signed into law.\n  If the stimulus isn't working, we ought to consider alternatives or \nat least try to put some of the remaining unspent funds to better use.\n  After all, we can and should extend unemployment benefits, but unless \nnew jobs are being created, the unemployed will be no better off once \nthe additional benefits we are providing run out.\n  Mr. President, I wish the majority leader had allowed this bill to \nmove forward sooner under an open process. We could have passed it \nweeks ago. But I intend to vote for it today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, how much time is remaining on each side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time remaining is 7 minutes 8 seconds on \nthe Democratic side, and 4 seconds on the Republican side.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Four seconds. That is interesting.\n  I want to set the record straight for my good friend from Nebraska. I \ndon't know how wise it would be to pay for this unemployment extension \nby stopping stimulus payments. Our economy is still coming out, still \nin recovery. We are by no means out of the woods yet. I think it would \nnot make sense to pay for the extension of unemployment insurance \nbenefits by going back to stimulus money and stopping the payment of \nstimulus dollars. I do not know exactly how many stimulus dollars are \nnot yet spent, but I think it is significant and I think it would be \nunwise for us to stop them at this point.\n  Beyond that, I think we should get on, vote, and pass this \nlegislation. People are out of jobs. There is a record number of people \nseeking unemployment. There are, I think, about 15 million Americans \nchasing 3 million jobs. They can't find jobs, can't get them; they are \nunavailable. It seems to me it only makes sense for us to extend the \nunderlying unemployment insurance for another 14 weeks for all States \nand 6 weeks for those high unemployment States.\n  I mentioned earlier how important it is for us to keep spending \nstimulus dollars. I chuckled when I heard my good friend talk about \nfilling the tree. Frankly, in my State we need not to fill up trees, we \nneed to fell more trees so we can get more jobs in our State, and that \nis one reason for the extension of the home buyer's tax credit.\n  The people in our home States, as we know, are more worried about \njobs than anything else. That is what it comes down to is jobs, good-\npaying jobs. With this legislation, hopefully, if we get enough cloture \nvotes so we can invoke cloture and get to the passage of the \nlegislation, it is about jobs--extending the homeowners tax credit, it \nis expanding the net operating loss provision, which is so important to \nso many companies. Add to that, it is extending unemployment insurance \nto those people who need benefits because they are out of work, looking \nfor jobs.\n  Let me repeat two figures I mentioned earlier: There are about 15 \nmillion people in our country unemployed who are looking for about 3 \nmillion jobs. That is about one out of five. That is unconscionable in \na country such as ours.\n  Let's get on with this, let's pass this legislation so people can get \nsome help.\n  I yield the remainder of my time. I guess there is only 4 seconds \nleft on this side. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask all remaining time be yielded back \nand I ask consent we proceed to the vote on the underlying measure.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I thank the Chair.\n\n\n                             CLOTURE MOTION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Pursuant to rule XXII, the Chair lays before \nthe Senate the pending cloture motion, which the clerk will report.\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     hereby move to bring to a close debate on the Baucus-Reid \n     amendment No. 2712 to H.R. 3548, the Unemployment \n     Compensation Extension Act of 2009.\n         Max Baucus, Byron L.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, the Senate has just voted on a motion to \nadvance the Unemployment Compensation Extension Act. This is the second \ntime--that is right, the second time--we voted on this critical \nlegislation. But, unfortunately, opponents of the extension are still \nholding it up.\n  The bill under consideration today incorporates important ideas from \nboth sides of the aisle. When the House bill included additional weeks \nonly for workers in States with unemployment rates above 8.5 percent, \nthe chairman and the majority leader allowed us to work out a \ncompromise that would support jobless workers in all 50 States.\n  An amendment by Senator Isakson to extend the home buyers tax credit \nhas now been incorporated into the Senate bill, as well as an important \namendment from Senator Bunning to extend the carryback of net operating \nlosses for up to 5 years. Both of these are good ideas that will help \nhomeowners, help our housing market, and provide relief to businesses \nthat are trying to weather this economic recession. Both have now been \nincluded in the Unemployment Compensation Extension Act.\n  Now it is time for all of us to stop playing politics and to focus on \nthe critical issue we started to address a month ago: the devastating \nrates of unemployment and the nearly 2 million Americans who are \nexhausting their benefits at the rate of 7,000 a day.\n  This is good legislation. It is legislation that provides at least 14 \nadditional weeks of unemployment insurance for those Americans who have \nbeen hardest hit by this recession and those whose benefits are \nstarting to be exhausted. I was pleased that once again the motion to \nadvance this bill received broad bipartisan support. The vote was 85 to \n2. The first vote was 87 to 13. It should receive this kind of support \nbecause unemployment isn't a New England problem or a Montana problem \nor a southern problem; it isn't a Republican or an Independent or a \nDemocratic problem; it is a hardship that hits every community in every \nState in every part of our country.\n\n  Last week, I spoke about my constituent Jane McDermott from Stoddard, \nNH. Jane wrote me last week that without this extension, she doesn't \nknow how she is going to pay for the gas she needs to get out and look \nfor a job, she doesn't know how she is going to pay for groceries for \nher family or any of the other family necessities. I was hoping that \ntoday Jane would get the news she has been waiting for--that this \nextension will be put into effect and that she, along with millions of \nother Americans who need it, will get the help to be able to continue \nto look for a job and continue to get the family necessities while she \ndoes that.\n  I think it is time--again, way past time--for us to put politics \naside. We shouldn't make Jane or any of the other hundreds of thousands \nof Americans who have been waiting for this extension wait one more \nday.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor with the hopes that we will get an \nagreement today, tomorrow, as soon as possible, to help the people who \nneed help. Thank you.\n  I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Scusa, who lost his life as the result of an attack in \nKamdesh, Afghanistan, on October 3, 2009.\n  As a child in Crete, NE, Michael Scusa had his sights set on a \nmilitary career. He joined the U.S. Army in 2005, immediately following \nhis high school graduation in Villas, NJ, where he had been living with \nhis mother. After basic training in Kentucky, Scusa was assigned to \nFort Carson, CO.\n  While stationed at Fort Carson, Sergeant Scusa met his wife Alyssa. \nShe describes her husband as a man with a wonderful sense of humor who \nalways brightened other people's spirits. He never complained and \nalways wore a smile. The two had been married for 2 years and had a son \nConnor, named after one of Scusa's close friends who was also killed \nwhile serving his country. Scusa was deployed to Afghanistan when \nConnor was just 8 months old.\n  Sergeant Scusa had been in Afghanistan for 5 months and was on his \nsecond tour overseas, having deployed to Iraq from October 2006 to \nDecember 2007. He and seven other soldiers out of\n\n[[Page S10987]]\n\nFort Carson, all of the 3rd Squadron, 61st Cavalry Regiment, 4th \nBrigade Combat Team, 4th Infantry Division, were killed in combat while \nbravely defending their outpost against a coordinated attack by \nhundreds of insurgents in the mountainous Nuristan Provence. Over the \ncourse of his service, Sergeant Scusa received an array of honors and \nawards, including a Bronze Star, Purple Heart and Army Good Conduct \nMedal; and he was posthumously promoted from specialist to sergeant.\n  Upon his wishes, Sergeant Scusa has been laid to rest in Colorado in \norder to be near his wife and son. He also leaves behind his mother \nCindy; father and stepmother George and Kelley; sisters Susan and Kami; \nbrothers John and Jimmy; and numerous other family members and friends.\n  Sergeant Scusa passed away making the ultimate and most valiant \nsacrifice. My condolences and prayers go out to his family and friends. \nHis heroism and selflessness will remain an inspiration for all of us.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/02/senate-section/article/S10985-2", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10985-S10987]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG.

We \nwant them to know the country pledges to preserve the memory of our \nfallen soldiers who gave their lives for our country.\n\n\n                       Sergeant Michael P. Scusa\n\n  Mr. Ben NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Army \nSGT Michael P. Scusa, who lost his life as the result of an attack in \nKamdesh, Afghanistan, on October 3, 2009.\n  As a child in Crete, NE, Michael Scusa had his sights set on a \nmilitary career. He joined the U.S. Army in 2005, immediately following \nhis high school graduation in Villas, NJ, where he had been living with \nhis mother. After basic training in Kentucky, Scusa was assigned to \nFort Carson, CO.\n  While stationed at Fort Carson, Sergeant Scusa met his wife Alyssa. \nShe describes her husband as a man with a wonderful sense of humor who \nalways brightened other people's spirits. He never complained and \nalways wore a smile. The two had been married for 2 years and had a son \nConnor, named after one of Scusa's close friends who was also killed \nwhile serving his country. Scusa was deployed to Afghanistan when \nConnor was just 8 months old.\n  Sergeant Scusa had been in Afghanistan for 5 months and was on his \nsecond tour overseas, having deployed to Iraq from October 2006 to \nDecember 2007. He and seven other soldiers out of\n\n[[Page S10987]]\n\nFort Carson, all of the 3rd Squadron, 61st Cavalry Regiment, 4th \nBrigade Combat Team, 4th Infantry Division, were killed in combat while \nbravely defending their outpost against a coordinated attack by \nhundreds of insurgents in the mountainous Nuristan Provence. Over the \ncourse of his service, Sergeant Scusa received an array of honors and \nawards, including a Bronze Star, Purple Heart and Army Good Conduct \nMedal; and he was posthumously promoted from specialist to sergeant.\n  Upon his wishes, Sergeant Scusa has been laid to rest in Colorado in \norder to be near his wife and son. He also leaves behind his mother \nCindy; father and stepmother George and Kelley; sisters Susan and Kami; \nbrothers John and Jimmy; and numerous other family members and friends.\n  Sergeant Scusa passed away making the ultimate and most valiant \nsacrifice. My condolences and prayers go out to his family and friends. \nHis heroism and selflessness will remain an inspiration for all of us.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/02/senate-section/article/S10985-3", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10985]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              APPOINTMENT OF ACTING PRESIDENT PRO TEMPORE\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
