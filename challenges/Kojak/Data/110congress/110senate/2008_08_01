Mr. President, I had the good fortune in the Senate of \nserving with David Pryor, the Senator from Arkansas. He was a member of \nthe Finance Committee and other very responsible positions, including \nthe Ethics Committee. He was, I believe, what the stereotype of a \nSenator should be. He worked hard and he is very smart. He was so easy \nto get along with. I do not think I have ever served with a better \nlegislator in my life than David Pryor.\n  Unfortunately for Arkansas and our country, he was taken ill. He had \na very severe heart attack and decided not to run for reelection. He is \ndoing well. He is healthy. I talk to him on occasion. Whenever I go to \nArkansas, I see him. But what a wonderful man to know.\n  The reason I mention that, fortunately for the people of Arkansas, \nhis son Mark has replaced him. Mark has all the same characteristics as \nhis dad. He is a man with a lot of humility. He works very hard. He \nknows the legislative process. He was attorney general of the State of \nArkansas. He is an outstanding lawyer.\n  There were a lot of reasons we were able to complete that most \nsignificant legislation last night, the Consumer Product Safety \nModernization Act. But it is the most sweeping improvement of the law \nthat has taken place since the law was passed some 40 years ago. It was \ndone under the direction of Senator Inouye. But Senator Inouye gives \ncredit to Mark Pryor who worked so hard to arrive at the solution he \ndid, which was a piece of legislation that passed overwhelmingly in \nthis body.\n  So, Mr. President, with that brief background, I ask unanimous \nconsent that Senator Pryor be designated as Acting President pro \ntempore of the Senate for the purpose of signing the conference report \nto accompany H.R. 4040, the Consumer Product Safety Modernization Act.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/08/01/senate-section/article/S7984-11", "month": "08", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7984-S7987]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2009--MOTION TO \n                           PROCEED--Continued\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, what is the parliamentary state?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senate is on the motion to \nproceed to S. 3001, with Senators permitted to speak for up to 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. HATCH. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Will the Chair please let me know when 9 minutes has expired.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator will be notified.\n\n\n                         United States Economy\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, yesterday the Government released the \nsecond quarter performance of the U.S. economy, and I am sorry to say \nthe report looks dismal. I, along with the rest of Americans, am \noutraged that Congress will depart shortly for a 5-week recess without \naddressing the most pressing issue of this Congress: our ailing economy \nand in particular energy. During this past month, we have passed bills \nto provide $50 billion for support of international programs to combat \nHIV/AIDS, for Medicare, and to improve FISA. This past week, we finally \npassed a bill that addresses a sector of\n\n[[Page S7985]]\n\nour economy by revamping Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. I certainly \nbelieve we can and should have done more than that.\n\n  In November of 2006, my party lost the majority in Congress, in both \nthe House of Representatives and in the Senate. The Democrats ran on a \nplatform of change, what they called ``A New Direction For America.'' \nThe Democrats pledged to push forward a 100-hour agenda that touted a \nchange in ethics, an increase in the minimum wage, and a rollback in \nsubsidies for the oil and gas industry. Look where that ``direction'' \nhas led us. The price of energy has skyrocketed, the housing market has \ndeteriorated, and the unemployment rate is on the rise. Across the \nNation, we are feeling the effects of the crumbling economy. Yesterday, \nBennigans and Steak & Ale restaurants have filed for bankruptcy, and \nStarbucks has recently announced the closing of 600 stores across \nAmerica. It is time for the majority to wake up and smell the coffee.\n  Viewing this chart, it is no wonder why the congressional approval \nratings are at an alltime low, at 12 percent. Congressional approval: \n12 percent. Congress has failed to act when Americans need it the most.\n  At the end of 2006, when the Republicans controlled Congress, the \naverage retail price of regular unleaded gasoline, according to the \nEnergy Information Administration, was $2.59. Look where it is today.\n  In June of this year, the average price of regular unleaded gasoline \nhit an average of $4.06. Our friends on the other side have done \nabsolutely nothing to address the rising costs of energy, and we are \ngoing home without having done so. We have proposed increasing the \nsupply off our coasts, extending the expiring energy tax incentives, \nand reducing our dependence on foreign oil by providing alternative \nenergy resources. The majority refuses to provide any solid bipartisan \nsolutions because they keep insisting on their perverse let's-grow-the-\nGovernment, pay-as-you-go rules and combating the oil and gas industry \nas though they are the evil cause of everything. The fact is the \nGovernment does not produce one drop of oil. It does not drill one \nexploration well. It does not refine even 1 gallon of gasoline, and it \ndoesn't build 1 foot of pipeline. Somehow, though, my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle think every answer to dropping gas prices is \nmore Government--more Government moratoria on drilling, more taxes on \nenergy companies, more regulation of the commodity markets, more \nmoratoriums on the development of oil shale, where we have somewhere \nbetween 800 billion and 2 trillion barrels of oil that can be \nrecovered. It is doable. Estonia has been doing it for the last 80 \nyears. Brazil has been doing it for the last three decades. We can do \nit, but there is a moratorium that doesn't expire until September, and \nnow the Democrats want to put another moratorium on it--just on \npreparing the rules pursuant to which we can develop these vast \nresources that would help bring prices down. It wouldn't happen \novernight, but I tell you one thing, if we went and tried to do all \nthese things and we announced we were going to do them, I believe gas \nprices would automatically come down quite a bit more than they are \nright now.\n  This past week, the majority leader brought a bill to the floor to \ncurtail oil price speculation, and while this was a start, my party \ntried to amend this bill to provide real solutions, ranging from \nexpanding offshore drilling to boosting oil shale production. We were \nprevented from offering these various amendments, which was an \nopportunity to increase energy supply and to send the rest of the world \na message that we are going to get serious about helping ourselves \ninstead of sending $700 billion every year off some shore for offshore \noil.\n  Across the Capitol, the House refuses to even bring up legislation \ninvolving offshore drilling. I do not know how I can return home to my \nhome State of Utah and explain to constituents such as Bill Howard, a \nfarmer who has to increase the price of his cattle and hogs to combat \nfuel costs, that we cannot do anything about the soaring gas prices \nunless it is paid for and hurts the oil and gas industry. Americans \nneed affordable energy now.\n  If we look at the results of Democratic policies on job growth in our \ncountry, we are met with the same disappointment. Here is where we are. \nThe unemployment rate in 2006 was 4.4 percent. Today it is up to 5.5 \npercent.\n  Less jobs means people spend less. When we spend less, companies \nstart cutting back, laying off employees, and reducing employee \nsalaries. This causes us to spend even less and the vicious economic \ncycle continues. We need to put more money back into the taxpayers' \npockets over a long period of time in order to create a virtuous \neconomic cycle. Among the tax extenders bill, which has failed to pass \nthe Senate again and again, is the research tax credit. Seventy percent \nof research tax credit dollars are used for wages of R employees. \nThat is creating jobs. I have been the champion of the R tax credit, \nalong with Senator Baucus, for years.\n  We should provide tax relief not through economic stimulus packages \nor on a year-to-year basis but over a long period of time so the \ntaxpayers can depend on this relief. That is why it is so important \nthat when we talk about economic stimulus, we should look at solutions \nrather than rebate checks and bailouts, such as repealing the \nalternative minimum tax and making certain tax cuts permanent such as \nthe research tax credit.\n  Looking toward the housing market, we still are puzzled why the \nmajority has not provided solutions to help the economy. We have been \nhit hard by the housing market in my home State. St. George, in the \nsouthwestern part of Utah, and Provo, UT, were among the top ten \nfastest-growing metro areas in the United States between 2000 and 2006, \nwith a growth of 39.8 percent and 25.9 percent respectively. As you can \nsee, our economy has all kinds of foreclosures; in Utah we are up to \n141 percent. That is twice the national increase from a year ago.\n  Last week, my friends on the other side of the aisle pushed through a \nhousing bill that some estimate will provide a temporary financial \nhousing lifeline by benefiting only 13 percent of the estimated 300,000 \nhomeowners who will likely lose their homes in the next year. I \nsupported earlier versions of the bill, but as it moved through the \nprocess and took on new provisions, my reservations grew. There is more \nto be said about the bill than I have time for now, but I have a \nstatement in the Record on the subject. Let me say I think too many \npeople and organizations that do not deserve it will be bailed out by \nwhat is now housing law.\n  I am also concerned that some of the provisions in the bill are \nshortsighted. For example, we created a new regulator for Fannie Mae \nand Freddie Mac, which is fine, but then we created what could possibly \nbecome a huge taxpayer-funded backstop, to put it nicely. Some have \nproposed that we cut the Government's ties to Fannie and Freddie, make \nthem truly private companies, and incentivize more competition. Maybe \nwe need to start the discussion now so taxpayers are not on the hook \nshould future crises arise. We are on the brink of a recession and we \nneed leadership.\n  The Democrats' ``New Direction For America'' has led us down a road \nto economic hardship and Americans deserve to have the economy driving \non all cylinders. With the government-sponsored housing enterprises, \nhigh energy and food prices, and the instability of financial \ninstitutions, we are in a state of economic slowdown. But there is \nhope.\n  Much like today, when I came to the Senate over 30 years ago, the \nunemployment rate was rising, inflation was accelerating, and the GDP \nwas beginning to decline. The economy was a major problem facing \nAmericans. In response, we provided long-term solutions to our ailing \neconomy by lowering taxes and increasing investment and growth. While \nthe economy today is bleak, I believe there is hope because we have \nbeen here before. However, I do not know why the majority has not \naddressed this dire situation before adjourning.\n  There are some real problems facing the American economy, and \ntogether we can deal with them.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has 1 minute remaining.\n  Mr. HATCH. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Most of these problems are self-inflicted, due to some major \nfinancial\n\n[[Page S7986]]\n\nmistakes in our country. Congress has passed some legislation aimed at \nimproving our economy, but these short-term, bandaid solutions will \neventually exacerbate the increasing deficit, and we will find \nourselves back in the same situation. More spending certainly is not \nthe answer.\n  When we return from our August recess, I encourage Congress to debate \nhow we can fix our ailing economy. I believe we can take steps toward \nreducing unemployment, slowing inflation, and increasing investment and \ngrowth. I also believe we need to look at reforming our Tax Code. Our \ntax system has become burdensome and overly complicated. It discourages \ninvestment at a time when we desperately need it most. For too long we \nhave delayed addressing our economy, and we owe a lot better service to \nour fellow Americans.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Rhode Island is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I ask unanimous consent to speak for 10 minutes as in \nmorning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                          Oil Company Profits\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Let me begin by saying, as we leave for our August \nrecess very shortly, what a pleasure it has been for me to serve with \nthe distinguished Senator from Utah on the Judiciary Committee during \nthese first months of my first term in this body. I would respond to \nwhat he has said by suggesting that if he and his colleagues would \nactually let us lead, we would be able to solve a lot of the problems \nhe discussed and that were indicated on those graphs. However, instead \nof letting us lead, they have embarked on a strategy of creating \ngridlock in this institution with--I think at this point we are at 92 \nor more filibusters--which is the world record in the history of this \ncountry--and climbing. I think what has happened to this body is my \ncolleagues on the other side have made the decision that the record of \nGeorge Bush is hopeless, the Republican message is shot, and their only \nsalvation is to call down a pox on both our Houses and try to disable \nthis institution, try to prevent us from doing essentially anything. It \nalso has the added benefit of allowing the Executive more leeway, and \nit confers more power on George Bush, which I think is a mistake, given \nthe way the record has shown his judgments have worked out.\n  For instance, take a look at what has happened in the Bush economy \nevery day and getting worse and worse. Since George Bush and Dick \nCheney took office in 2001, wages in America have remained stagnant, as \nthe very distinguished Senator from Ohio knows very well. Wages in \nAmerica remain stagnant, oil and gas prices have risen sharply, and \ntroubles in the housing market have made it harder and harder for \nfamilies to stay in their homes. One would not have thought very long \nago that America was a country in which tens of thousands of Americans \nwould be thrown out of their own homes, but there we are.\n  Even those well off enough to own stock have seen the consequences of \nthe Bush economy. In the Clinton years, the Dow Jones industrial \naverage climbed 129 percent. In the Bush years, it has climbed exactly \n0.7 percent. I ask my colleagues on the other side of the aisle whether \nthey think their investor friends would prefer 129 percent capital \ngains and then paying a fair tax on those capital gains or whether they \nwould prefer having big fights about what the capital gains tax rate \nis, but nobody makes any money.\n  While American families and American workers struggle in the Bush \neconomy, there is one special, favored industry that is laughing all \nthe way to the bank. Eight years of two oilmen in the White House has \nbrought over $4-a-gallon gasoline for American consumers and absolutely \ngrotesque profits for the biggest oil companies.\n  Yesterday, once again, the largest of these international giants--\nExxonMobil--announced recordbreaking profits. ExxonMobil's second-\nquarter profits were the highest in the company's history. They were \nthe highest in the history of the entire oil industry. In fact, Exxon's \n$11.7 billion profits for this last quarter were the highest corporate \nprofits in the history of the United States. These profits, indeed, are \nthe highest in the history of the universe as we know it.\n  Think about that: $11.7 billion in just 3 months. The U.S. Department \nof Transportation estimates that there are 250 million passenger \nvehicles in the United States. Exxon's $11.7 billion second-quarter \nprofits amount to a quarterly tax of $47 on every car and truck in the \ncountry. That is just for one quarter. If you have ever wondered where \nthe $60 or the $80 or even the $100 that it might cost to fill your \ntank goes, take a look at this. Gas prices are definitely going up; \nthere is no doubt about that. We all experience the pain at the pump. \nBut compared to how gas prices are going up, look at what is happening \nto oil company profits. As gas prices have risen, oil company profits \nhave soared. If Exxon continues to reap profits at this level, in 2008 \nalone, you will pay for every car a $188 oil profits fee to ExxonMobil \nper car--$188 on every car in America--for the profit.\n  That is not counting the hundreds of billions of dollars raked in by \nthe four other major international oil companies doing business in our \ncountry.\n  We are facing a true energy crisis. Instead of working with us to \nsolve it, our colleagues on the other side of the aisle continue to \nfight for oil company profits.\n  Drilling off of our pristine coasts--and I come from the ocean State \nof Rhode Island--won't produce a drop of oil for a decade and won't \nsignificantly lower gas prices even then. These facts have no affect on \nour colleagues. Make no mistake about it, more drilling means higher \nprofits for Exxon, Shell, BP, and especially for Dick Cheney's former \nemployer, Halliburton, which provides drilling products and services.\n  Exxon is committed to an oil economy that has no future for this \ncountry. They earned $11.7 billion in profits in the last 3 months, but \nin the 4 years between 2003 and 2007, Exxon spent just $20 million on \nresearch and development of alternative and renewable transportation \nfuel technologies. That is $20 million in 4 years, which is $5 million \na year. That $5 million a year is $1.25 million a quarter. If you \ncompare $1.25 million a quarter to $11.7 billion in profits, what you \nfind out is that for every $10,000 in profit ExxonMobil makes, it \nspends $1 on alternative fuels. I am sure that in Ohio the Presiding \nOfficer is seeing the same advertisements we are seeing in Rhode \nIsland--wonderful Exxon ads with scientists and molecules, telling us \nhow they are investing in the future. But it is $1 for every $10,000 \nthey put in their pockets.\n  A recent Wall Street Journal article reported that the big oil \ncompanies spent $52.5 million on advertisements to burnish their images \nin the first quarter of the year. That is an annualized rate of $200 \nmillion in ads. Of course, many of these environmental ads say: We are \ngreen now, just watch us. Well, if you assume that of that $52.5 \nmillion, a quarter of it was Exxon, that is $12.5 million. If you \nassume that just a quarter of that 12.5 was spent on green ads and the \nrest on other stuff, that is $3 million. That means they spend three \ntimes as much advertising their green research as they do actually \ndoing their green research. It is the biggest sham in the world.\n  I hope when Americans see these ads in magazines and elsewhere they \nknow they are being had. It is $1 in research, $3 in advertising about \nit, and $10,000 in profits. That is the ratio. That is not a ratio \nanybody should be very proud of. If only Exxon and the other oil giants \nwould devote some of their advertising budget to R, then we might be \nbetter off. We don't need sham solutions. We need results.\n  Yesterday, I signed on to a letter authored by our assistant majority \nleader, Senator Durbin of Illinois, to request of President Bush to \nrelease about 10 percent--or 70 million barrels--from the Strategic \nPetroleum Reserve. That sale would immediately lower gas prices and \ngenerate over $8 billion, which is money that could be used to invest \nin alternative sources of energy for real--not the phony show \nExxonMobil is putting on--so that we can finally move away from our \noil-addicted economy. But so far, no action. Indeed, yesterday, we \ntried to pass a Defense authorization bill to support our troops in the \nfield, in harm's way. The Republicans voted against the bill, \nabandoning our troops for big oil. Big\n\n[[Page S7987]]\n\noil is making big money, and that is the Republicans' priority. I urge \nPresident Bush to end the rhetoric, put the troops first, get off of \nbig oil's wagon, and let's get together to solve this problem for real.\n  I thank the chair and yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader is \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/08/01/senate-section/article/S7987-1", "month": "08", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7987-S8003]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         FAILURE OF LEADERSHIP\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, all across America today, people are \nlooking to Capitol Hill with astonishment. They are wondering how it is \neven possible that lawmakers who have been hearing from their \nconstituents for months about the burden of record-high gas prices \ncould fail to work out a sensible response.\n  I don't blame them. High gas prices have triggered a crisis in \nAmerican homes and in the broader economy, and the American people have \na right to expect their elected representatives to do something about \nit.\n  Every crisis is a call for leadership, and this one was no different. \nThis was an opportunity for the Democrats who control Congress to \ndemonstrate courage and resolve. They squandered it. In their hunt for \nmore seats in Congress and control of the White House, they took the \npath of least resistance. They decided that they could increase their \nhold on Congress by avoiding tough votes, and then blaming the mess \nthat followed on a party that wasn't even in charge.\n  While Republicans were working out a legislation solution that \naddressed high gas prices head on, Democrats embarked on a concerted \neffort of pointing fingers and casting blame. Americans were looking \nfor answers, and the Democrat answer was to make everyone accountable \nbut themselves.\n  First came the energy producers, who were threatened with higher \ntaxes that would have passed along to consumers, making the problem \nworse. Then came the foreign oil producers, who were threatened with \nlawsuits unless they increased production, even though America sits on \nmassive energy reserves that dwarf their own.\n  Finally, it was the speculators. Citing the testimony of a lawyer \nwhose previous statements on energy provoked a stinging bipartisan \nrebuke, the Democrats claimed that writing a few new regulations for \nspeculators would solve the energy crisis. Republicans agree that we \nneed greater transparency in the market and more cops on the beat. But \nthe notion that speculators alone have led to a dramatic surge in gas \nprices is, according to every serious person, completely and totally \nabsurd.\n  The chairman of the Federal Reserve has rejected the idea that \nspeculators alone were the cause of the oil shock. Warren Buffett, a \nprominent Democrat and perhaps the most successful investor of our \ngeneration, has said speculators alone are not the problem. The 27-\nmember International Energy Agency said speculators alone are not the \nproblem. T. Boone Pickens, who has been cited by both sides in this \ndebate, has said unequivocally that speculators alone were not the \nproblem.\n  When asked about high gas prices, all the experts seem to agree on \ntwo things: first, that speculators alone are not the problem. And \nsecond, that the high price of gas is primarily the result of increased \ndemand and static supply. Increase supply, and the price of gas will go \ndown. Keep it static and prices will continue to rise. That is why even \nthe liberal New York Times derided the Democrats' speculators-only \napproach as a ``misbegotten plan.''\n  Republicans didn't invent the law of supply and demand. It's as old \nas commerce itself. And it has the virtue of being perfectly \nstraightforward: any serious proposal for bringing down high gas prices \nwould have to increase supply. And any serious proposal that aims to \ndecrease our dependence on Middle East oil would have to increase \nsupply here at home.\n  Every expert in America tells us that Americans will be dependent on \nfossil-fuels for decades to come. And until the day when we're all \nplugging in our cars or using alternative fuels, Americans can't be \nexpected to shoulder the crushing burden of ever increasing gas prices. \nCongress has a responsibility to act, and that action must involve a \ncomprehensive approach.\n  This is why Republicans put together a solution to this crisis that \nseeks, first of all, to accelerate the day when America will no longer \nbe dependent on foreign sources of oil. We do this in our plan by \naddressing not only the principal cause of rising fuel prices--\ninsufficient supply--but also by promoting new energy technologies, \nsuch as plug-in hybrid cars and trucks.\n  We heard the concerns of the American people, brought together the \nbest ideas from both sides of the aisle, and pressed forward, confident \nthat here was a solution that would be embraced by Americans and \nacceptable to a majority in Congress who could claim shared credit for \nthe result. But, in the end, the Democrat Leadership showed it would \nrather cast blame than share success.\n  Americans are wondering why the Democrat Leadership voted to leave \ntown last night without proposing a comprehensive solution of their own \nto $4-a-gallon gasoline. And they deserve an honest answer. The moment \nthat gas prices became a major issue here in Washington, Democrats \nstarted to build a protective blockade around their Presidential \nnominee.\n  Rather than come up with a comprehensive solution that would do \nsomething to lower the price of gas, they set out to insulate their \ncandidate from ever having to take a difficult vote on the issue. They \nhave done this because their nominee opposes expanding the domestic \nenergy supply. Recall that his initial response to high energy costs \nwas that Americans would have to learn to turn their air conditioners \ndown and consume fewer calories.\n  He has stated publicly that high gas prices are only a problem \nbecause America didn't have enough time to adjust to them. And just \nthis week the junior Senator from Illinois unveiled his own \ncomprehensive solution to the high price of gas: ``We could save all \nthe oil that they're talking about getting off drilling,'' he said, \n``If everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune-\nups.''\n  This is the proposal of the man that Democrats in Congress want to \nlead us through the Nation's energy crisis: regular tune-ups. This is \nthe answer the junior Senator from Illinois has proposed to the \npatients at the Woodland Dialysis Center in Elizabethtown, KY, who are \nnow limiting their treatments because they can't afford the cost of \ngetting to them. This is Senator Obama's answer to $4-a-gallon gas: \nissue some new regulations and go to Jiffy Lube.\n  Add it to the growing list of laughably inadequate proposals that our \nDemocrat friends have brought forward over the last few months. Some of \nthem wanted to sue foreign countries as a way of forcing them to open \nup their supplies. Others proposed tax incentives for riding bicycles \nto work. But Senate Democrats really outdid themselves earlier this \nsummer when they showed off a two-seat, electric-powered Tessla \nRoadster. It gets excellent mileage, and any American family can buy \none of its own for a mere $109,000. These are the kinds of solutions we \nhave heard from the other side.\n  Over the last few weeks, the time for real action arrived. And when \nit did, the Democratic leadership blocked and stalled every attempt to \nadvance a real solution to the energy crisis. They canceled \nappropriations hearings out of fear that a deep-sea exploration \namendment to lower gas prices would be offered. They offered a \nspeculation-only bill, which no serious person thinks is in itself the \nanswer to $4-a-gallon gas. And then over the last 7 days, they tried to \ntake us off the issue of high gas prices seven times. Seven times they \nhave tried to take us off the issue of high gas prices, taunting \nRepublicans for standing on principle rather than taking the bait. In \nevery case, Republicans refused to turn their backs on the people at \nthe pump.\n\n  These last few weeks were a time for decision, and the Democrats made \ntheirs. When Americans demanded action, the Democrats played games. \nThey changed the topic so the man they want to lead our country would \nnot have to make a public decision about high gas prices.\n  Some on the other side may think this kind of behavior is acceptable. \nThey might think it makes sense to block the Senate minority from \noffering a balanced solution to high gas\n\n[[Page S7988]]\n\nprices in order to protect one Senator and the 20 percent of Americans \nwho think we should not use more energy from American soil. We couldn't \ndisagree more.\n  When faced with a crisis, the Democratic leadership opted instead to \nfollow the political playbook of the senior Senator from New York who \nrecently told a reporter that Democrats should wait until after \nInauguration Day--when he hopes to see a Democrat in the White House--\nbefore doing anything about high gas prices.\n  This is precisely the kind of statement that frustrates the American \npeople. They have waited for a solution long enough. They should not \nhave to wait another day.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                       Midwestern Disaster Relief\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, for the benefit of leaders' offices, \nafter I am done speaking about the flood situation in Iowa, I have been \nasked by the leader to make a unanimous consent request in regard to E-\nVerify. So I want to notice the offices about what I am going to do. It \nwill be down the road, in half an hour or so.\n  Mr. President, last night I came to the floor to ask for unanimous \nconsent on the tax bill we referred to as the Midwest flood disaster \ntax relief package. I was denied unanimous consent to bring that up. I \ndid not make a long justification for the necessity of doing that, but \nI wish to speak to that point now. I am not going to further ask \nunanimous consent the same as I did last night; I am just going to \nspeak about why I did it last night and why it was essential.\n  There is one thing I want to put in the Record at this point, and it \nis in regard to one of the points that was made by the Senator from \nIllinois last night, Mr. Durbin, the Democratic whip. He said one of \nthe reasons for denying my request for the tax relief package I am \ntalking about for flood victims in the Midwest is because similar \nprovisions were contained in S. 3335, the Jobs, Energy, Families, and \nDisaster Relief Act of 2008, and that bill did not get 60 votes. \nObviously, it didn't get 60 votes for the reason a lot of other bills \nhave not gotten 60 votes on the floor of the Senate: We in the minority \nwant to stay on the No. 1 problem affecting this country; that is, the \nhigh cost of gasoline and the energy crisis that is facing the Nation. \nWe want the majority party to give us opportunities to offer amendments \nto increase the supply of energy in this country as opposed to paying \n$140 a barrel to buy oil and import it from overseas, giving money to \nnations that want to train terrorists to kill Americans. That is the \nreason S. 3335 did not get 60 votes. So we are technically on the \nEnergy bill.\n  But one of the things he said about that bill was to leave the \nimpression that S. 3335 did everything that needs to be done for the \ndisaster relief in the Midwest, and it doesn't, and I made that point \nlast night, so I am not going to repeat that.\n  But even if S. 3335 had passed, we had previously had a Statement of \nAdministration Policy, and I am only going to quote one sentence from a \nlonger Statement of Administration Policy that I am going to put in the \nRecord, and that sentence is this: ``However, due to other objections \nto the bill, should it be presented to the President in its current \nform, his senior advisers would recommend a veto.'' So I think that \nwhen we are under a situation where we have the trauma of floods and \npeople being homeless because of the flooding situation in the Midwest, \nit doesn't do much good to pass a piece of legislation that is going to \nbe vetoed by the White House anyway.\n  The point I was trying to make last night is that we shouldn't be \nadjourning for our summer August break and not taking care of things in \nthe Midwest the very same way we took care of the situation for New \nOrleans caused by Katrina. Of course, the point is that the legislation \nwe seek for the Midwest is the same as the legislation we sought and we \nactually accomplished for New Orleans.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe full Statement of Administration Policy from which I quoted.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n         Executive Office of the President, Office of Management \n           and Budget,\n                                    Washington, DC, July 30, 2008.\n\n                   Statement of Administration Policy\n\n\n    S. 3335--Jobs, Energy, Families, and Disaster Relief Act of 2008\n\n       The Administration supports responsible and timely \n     alternative minimum tax (AMT) relief as proposed in the \n     President's Budget. Congress should act quickly to protect 26 \n     million American taxpayers from an unwelcome tax increase and \n     to avoid repeating the unnecessary administrative complexity \n     caused by congressional delay in 2007. In addition, the \n     Administration supports the extension of the tax credit for \n     research and experimentation (R) expenses, incentives for \n     charitable giving, subpart F active financing and look-\n     through exceptions, and the new markets tax credit. In its FY \n     2009 Budget, the Administration proposed that several of \n     these provisions be made permanent, including the R tax \n     credit. However, due to other objections to the bill, should \n     it be presented to the President in its current form, his \n     senior advisors would recommend a veto.\n       The Administration strongly supports continuation of tax \n     incentives for renewable energy, and in fact the President \n     recently proposed a more effective approach that would reform \n     today's complicated mix of incentives to make the \n     commercialization and use of new, lower emission technologies \n     more competitive. The President's proposal would consolidate \n     this mix into a single expanded program that would be carbon-\n     weighted, technology-neutral, and long-lasting. This policy \n     would make lower emission power sources less expensive \n     relative to higher emission sources while taking into account \n     our Nation's energy security needs. It would take the \n     government out of picking technology winners and losers in \n     this emerging market. And it would provide a positive and \n     reliable market signal for technology investment and \n     investment in domestic manufacturing capacity and \n     infrastructure.\n       Overall, the Administration does not believe that efforts \n     to avoid tax increases on Americans need to be coupled with \n     provisions to increase revenue. Although the Senate has \n     avoided pairing AMT relief with tax increases, the bill \n     contains a host of objectionable provisions. The \n     Administration strongly opposes the provision in the bill \n     that would subject U.S. companies to continued double \n     taxation by further delaying the effect of new rules for \n     allocating worldwide interest for foreign tax credit \n     purposes. The Administration also strongly opposes the \n     provision in the bill that would treat U.S. citizens with \n     deferred compensation from certain employers--in all \n     industries--more unfavorably than other U.S. citizens. \n     Together, these provisions would increase tax burdens, \n     undermine the competitiveness of U.S. workers and businesses, \n     and could have adverse effects on the U.S. economy. The \n     Administration also opposes the continued expansion of tax-\n     credit bonds and the reinstatement of the exclusion from tax \n     of amounts received under qualified group legal services \n     plans. The Administration urges Congress to eliminate all \n     such provisions from the final bill.\n       The Administration also strongly opposes the provision in \n     the bill to increase cash balances in the Highway Account of \n     the Highway Trust Fund by transferring $8 billion from the \n     General Fund. It is a longstanding principle that highway \n     construction and maintenance should be funded by those who \n     use the highway system. Instead, this provision is both a \n     gimmick and a dangerous precedent that shifts costs from \n     users to taxpayers at large. Moreover, the provision would \n     unnecessarily increase the deficit and would place any hope \n     of future, responsible constraints on highway spending in \n     jeopardy. This provision is unnecessary, because the \n     Administration has proposed a responsible alternative that \n     protects taxpayers.\n       Finally, the Administration objects to a budget gimmick in \n     the bill that would raise revenues by modifying the tax \n     treatment of deferred compensation over the current budget \n     window, but allow this provision to expire so that it, like \n     the new rules for allocating worldwide interest for foreign \n     tax credit purposes, will return to be available as a \n     ``revenue-raiser'' in next year's ten-year budget window. \n     These types of gimmicks, done for so-called ``pay as you go'' \n     reasons, harm the integrity of the tax code and increase \n     uncertainty for taxpayers.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, before I speak to the point, just so you \nknow, in Iowa the flood situation is very much in the headlines. I \nthink one of the problems we are having in the Midwest, in getting \nCongress to pay attention to the problems that remain from the flooding \nof June, is that it is not constantly on television. It is not on \ntelevision all the time. Of course, for 2 months, 3 months, the \nsituation\n\n[[Page S7989]]\n\nin New Orleans was constantly on television, and Congress responded.\n  Mr. President, I see the whip here, and maybe I said something to \nwhich he wants to react. If he does, I would be happy to yield for that \npurpose.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I will wait until the Senator has completed. I would like \nto make a statement.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Anyway, we have here in the Des Moines Register a \nheadline that says, ``Storm Hit One in Five School Districts,'' and \nthen it has reports on how much it is going to cost to fix the schools. \nWe have another headline here that says, ``At Least $30 Million Needed \nto Repair Roads,'' as an example.\n  Then we have a statement that was printed in the Davenport newspaper \nthat was written by Charlotte Eby. I am not going to quote the whole \nthing. I just want to speak to parts of it.\n\n       While Congress puts off consideration of the flood relief \n     bill, it looks like the Iowa legislature will be rolling up \n     its sleeves to help out Iowa flood victims.\n\n  It speaks about a growing sense that the Iowa legislature has to step \nin.\n\n       The delay of a Federal response by Congress could also push \n     back the State response, a development that left Iowans \n     angry.\n\n  It quotes the minority leader of the Iowa senate. Ron Wieck, \nRepublican of Sioux City, said action cannot wait, and if that means a \nspecial session, he is for it. It doesn't quote him, but it says he is \nappalled that Congress will go home for the summer recess without \npassing a Federal flood relief package when floods left people in the \nMidwest homeless.\n  Then the last paragraph is not anybody's quote except the author's, \nCharlotte Eby:\n\n       Maybe the U.S. Senate majority leader Harry Reid and House \n     speaker Nancy Pelosi ought to walk the streets of Cedar \n     Rapids. They would think twice about heading home for their \n     August recess without lending a helping hand.\n\n  Then I have a quote from Congressman King, who went to Cedar Rapids, \nI think, as recently as Monday of this week. He says:\n\n       This is Katrina. I have walked into and out of those \n     buildings (in New Orleans) and I tell you, you wouldn't be \n     able to tell the difference.\n\n  He means telling the difference between the destruction that went on \nin New Orleans in the 2005 hurricane and what happened in Cedar Rapids \nin June when it was hit by a 500-year flood.\n  I do applaud Senator Obama because he was in Cedar Rapids yesterday \ncampaigning, and he was also very attentive to the problems of Cedar \nRapids in his town meeting. He said he came there and wanted to listen. \nI have not heard reports on what questions he received, what complaints \nhe received. He may have been talking just to a friendly audience--I \ndon't know. But he did say that he was there to listen, and I hope \nafter he has listened to the situation in Cedar Rapids that he will \ntell friends in the Congress of the United States that we need to act \nquickly. I hope he would say we should have acted this week--which \naction now, of course, is impossible because we are breaking for our \nsummer break.\n  I am here once again to discuss the plight of my fellow Iowans and \nmany others throughout the Midwest following a series of deadly \ntornadoes, storms, and floods. It is a multiple disaster, tornadoes and \nfloods, and not just floods. Iowa has 99 counties. Of those, 80 \ncounties have been designated as a disaster area by FEMA.\n  When looking at a map of Iowa, it is much easier to count the few \ncounties that are not disaster areas than the vast majority that are \ndisaster areas. Every weekend except for this past weekend since we \nwere in session, I have been back in Iowa to meet with people affected \nby the storm and to see the devastation for myself. As I noted last \nweek, estimates of damage are in the billions of dollars and are \nclimbing every day.\n  I thought nothing could match my frustration at seeing so many Iowans \nin such great need, but the fact that we have not been able to act upon \nboth the appropriations bill, as well as this tax bill, has frustrated \nme. It seems because we do not see the storm on television all the time \nthat there is an apparent lack of desire to help the Midwest recover \nfrom these deadly tornadoes, storms, and floods, quite contrary to the \nquick action that Congress took after Katrina.\n  Before I go further, I want to display a few pictures of the \nflooding. The first will show one of many railroad bridges that was \nseverely damaged. Businesses such as the one in this picture rely on \nthis railroad track, this bridge, to receive their inputs and move \ntheir goods. Throughout Iowa there are similar bridges that are \ndamaged. Iowa railroads play a vital part in moving our agricultural \nproducts and goods, to do it efficiently, and obviously in a more \nenergy-efficient way. This infrastructure is important for Iowa's \ninterstate commerce and international trade.\n  I have another picture that shows the museum of art at the University \nof Iowa, Iowa City. This is the museum of art. I believe I have heard \nfrom the university officials that this building is going to have to be \ntorn down.\n  The next picture shows flooding along the Iowa River. You can see the \ntops of buildings. These are homes and businesses of people who just \nwant their lives back. They are not asking for anything extraordinary \nor excessive, but they are in need of help to recover and rebuild. They \nare, in a sense, asking for the same help that New Orleans got after \nKatrina.\n  I would like to use the phrase ``so that they can get things back to \nnormal.'' However, it is very difficult to use that phrase. It will \ntake years before Iowa recovers, and it will not be the same, although \nwe will still be a very strong State.\n  I can share, for example, the story of my hometown of New Hartford, a \ncommunity of 670 just west of Waterloo, IA. An F5 tornado ripped \nthrough this area, destroying a whole section of town. The floods then \ncame and inundated the town. Out of 270 homes in New Hartford, IA, 240 \nhad damage or were destroyed. Businesses were also harshly affected. \nMany of them are trying to decide if they want to stay in business or \nif they can afford to stay in business. Several have already decided \nnot to reopen.\n  The town I lived around all my life as a farm boy--and still as a \nfarmer--will never be back to normal. It won't ever be the same. I \nthink we will have a thriving community but, quite frankly, it won't be \nthe same.\n  The next chart shows you a picture of downtown Cedar Rapids. I am \ntalking about a 500-year flood. The previous flood record was about 19 \nfeet. Levees could take up to 22 feet. But I think this flood got as \nhigh as 31 feet and has been referred to as a 500-year flood.\n  As you look at this picture, think of all the homes and businesses \nthat are severely damaged and destroyed. Downtown Cedar Rapids is not \ngoing to be the same. Since Cedar Rapids and other places in Iowa are \nnot popular as vacation spots as are other cities, you probably haven't \nseen or heard much of the devastation except for the week of television \nwhen it was actually underwater. I can assure everyone that the people \nof Iowa and the Midwest deserve the same consideration that was given \nto the people of New York after 9/11 and the people of the gulf coast \nafter the hurricanes of 2005.\n  Last week I touched on how the response to the Midwest disasters has \nbeen different from the response to other disasters. I would like to \nelaborate on that point. These are some of the same points I made last \nnight, but I only took about 2 minutes to make these points.\n  On August 29, Hurricane Katrina made landfall on the gulf coast, \ncausing widespread devastation. The Congress was in recess at the time; \nhowever, the Republican Congress and the Senate Finance Committee \nsprang into action immediately at the staff level, even before we got \nback the day after Labor Day. We immediately started working with the \nGovernors of the affected States and set out goals that we hoped to \naccomplish when we finally came back into session.\n  On September 28, 2005, less than a month----\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is speaking under a 10-\nminute limit.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I ask unanimous consent to continue my speech for as \nmuch time as I might consume.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would like to respond when the Senator is finished. Can \nhe give some indication when he might finish?\n\n[[Page S7990]]\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Yes. About 7 or 8 minutes, I think.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I have no objection.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. On September 28, less than a month after Hurricane \nKatrina, I chaired a hearing entitled, ``Hurricane Katrina: Community \nRebuilding Needs and Effectiveness of Past Proposals.'' Governor Blanco \nof Louisiana, Governor Barbour of Mississippi, and Governor Riley of \nAlabama all participated.\n\n  On October 6, 2005, I chaired another hearing titled ``The Future of \nthe Gulf Coast Using Tax Policy to Help Rebuild Businesses and \nCommunities and Support Families.'' Treasury Secretary Snow testified \nat that hearing.\n  Congress also passed tax legislation very quickly. The Katrina \nEmergency Relief Act of 2005 was signed by the President on September \n23, 2005. This unoffset package cost more than $6 billion. That package \nwas followed up by the Gulf Opportunity Zone Act of 2005, which was \nsigned by President Bush in December of 2005. This unoffset package was \nscored to cost around $8.6 billion. Neither of these packages were \nsubject to a rollcall vote in the Senate, but both were passed by \nunanimous consent.\n  I want to make it clear that we did the right thing by setting aside \nour planned agenda to help the people affected by hurricanes as quickly \nas we could. Some of the people still living on the gulf coast still \nneed our help, and we should be helping them, and some of these tax \nprovisions in what we call the extenders package continue some of that \nhelp. Passing these bills without offsets was also the right thing to \ndo. As any of my staffers can tell you, I am very careful with the \nmoney. However, when people are suffering from a massive natural \ndisaster, it is no time to be a cheapskate.\n  I am also very frustrated by the desire of some House Democrats to \noffset this tax relief package for Iowans and other Midwesterners \nbecause that is a double standard. We did not demand offsets when we \nwere trying to help New Orleans. I am not asking for anything more than \nthe same consideration that was given to the victims of other major \ndisasters.\n  I have learned lessons from previous tax disaster packages. We \nlearned we need to tailor the relief so more is targeted specifically \nfor those who suffered damages and really need the assistance. \nTherefore, the package I introduced, that I tried to get unanimous \nconsent on last night, called the Midwestern Disaster Tax Relief Act of \n2008, provides targeted assistance to families and businesses in 10 \nStates throughout the central United States to help those who suffered \ndamage from these deadly storms and floods, to help them rebuild their \nlives.\n  The estimated cost of the bill is less than $4 billion. We need to be \nprudent with our Federal money, and as I stated, my tax package is \ntargeted to those who suffered loss and is a reasonable cost to help \nthese victims of the storms and floods in the 10 States that were \naffected. From that standpoint, that is something we have learned in \nthe last 3 years from the package that was passed after Katrina.\n  There were people who took advantage of some provisions who were not \nharmed by the natural disaster, so we have tailored this bill so that \nonly people who were harmed by the flood situation are the ones we will \nhelp. We had Senators Harkin, Bond, McCaskill, Coleman, Klobuchar, \nDurbin, Obama, Roberts, Brownback, Lugar, and Bayh all as original \ncosponsors of this bill. In the House, the Iowa Congressional \nDelegation introduced a companion bill, and the list of the original \ncosponsors to this bill shows this is a very bipartisan package. We all \nrecognize the need for targeted relief for the Midwest. The problem \nseems to be the ability to get the bill up in a timely fashion like we \ndid in the case of New Orleans. I have been hearing that the Democratic \nleadership in the House is insisting that the package be offset, which \nis completely different than how we responded to disasters in the past \nwhen we didn't worry about offsets. Normally when we have emergencies, \nthey are emergencies; you get the bill passed to help the people who \nneed it.\n  Just yesterday the Senate voted against cloture on an extenders \npackage put forward by Senate Democrats. It purported to include \ndisaster relief. I am taken aback that the Senate Democrats would \npoliticize the suffering of so many people just to try to get an \nextenders bill passed. The disaster relief in that bill was watered \ndown. It provided substantially less assistance for Iowa and the other \nStates in the central portion of the United States.\n  The Senator from Illinois is here, and I hope he hears that because I \nwant to emphasize that that bill is quite a bit different and doesn't \ndo as much good. It is not targeted. It is not helping people who need \nto be helped right now.\n  Its authors were apparently motivated by the twin misconceptions that \nthe Midwestern disasters are not as severe as they really are and that \nwe should undertake generic tax relief at the expense of the Midwest.\n  When I say the proponents of the Democratic extender package think \nthe disaster is not as severe as they are, I say that noting that their \npackage provided less assistance to the Midwest than my bipartisan tax-\ntargeted disaster tax bill did provide.\n  The Democratic disaster package also had a higher revenue score than \nmy package. I told you we tried to scale this back so we did not make \nthe same mistakes we did in the case of Katrina, where a lot of people \nwho did not get hurt by the disaster were able to take advantage of \nit--not our intention. But because we probably hastened it through to \nget help to Katrina victims, some people took advantage of it.\n  We tailored this so only people who have a disaster can benefit from \nit. It had a higher revenue score, as I said, than the Democratic \nalternative. They included the whole country instead of disasters that \nhave not occurred. I am not arguing that we should look at putting \ngeneric assistance into the Tax Code to assist States when Federal \ndisasters are declared the future. It seems to me that is a worthy \nthing for us to be discussing.\n  However, I do not think it is right to slow down the help for the \nMidwest because you want a broader national policy. People in the \nMidwest and Iowa are suffering now and have been for almost 2 months. \nThey have experienced a severe event that was well above the 500-year \nflood level. This is an extraordinary disaster. We need the help right \nnow.\n  The proper time to make a thorough a review of how we generally \nrespond to disasters should not come at the expense of a specific \nmassive natural disaster that has occurred and the people need \nimmediate assistance. The author of the disaster package put forward in \nthe Democrat's extender bill may have meant well, but I cannot help but \nfeel that Iowa and the Midwest would be getting the short end of the \nstick.\n  Their disaster package also included a provision that only benefitted \nNew York, at a cost of more than $1 billion. This is the second-largest \nprovision in that disaster relief package, when people are literally \ntrying to rebuild their homes, their businesses, and lives in the \nMidwest. It is simply insulting and disgraceful to use the misery of \nothers to play politics and gamesmanship at a time when we should be \nable to put politics aside, as we did in September 2005, to help people \ngoing through extraordinarily difficult times.\n  However, there are apparently some who, because we do not see this on \ntelevision or because they have other agendas, want to take advantage \nto get more. At the same time, I am trying to get help for my \nconstituents.\n  The correct question to put is simply: How can I help?\n  The best course of action would be for the House and Senate to pass \nthe Midwestern Disaster Tax Relief Act of 2008 and do it as we did in \nSeptember 2005; do it by unanimous consent.\n  We can discuss general disaster response as well, but right now the \npeople of Iowa are suffering and the Midwest is suffering as well. We \nhave a moral obligation to help them as we helped the people and \ncitizens of New York after 9/11 and the gulf coast when they needed \nhelp.\n  If anyone honestly believes Iowans do not deserve our help, then \nplease come down to the floor, state your views, talk about it. I will \nencourage anyone who has doubts about the severity of this disaster to \ndo like Senator Obama did yesterday, come to Iowa and I will be glad to \ntake you around when you can come.\n  I am ready to yield the floor, but I had previously made a statement \nthat\n\n[[Page S7991]]\n\nI was going to make a unanimous consent request on the immigration \nbill. I am not going to do that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The assistant majority leader is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, when Senator Grassley comes to the floor \nand speaks of the Midwestern need, he speaks of an issue of which I \nhave intimate personal knowledge. In 1993, it was my district, my \ncongressional district, inundated by these floods.\n  I spent countless hours and days working with the brave volunteers \nand the National Guard and others to try to save buildings and homes \nand farms, filling sandbags and doing everything we could to fight off \nthe flooding of the Illinois River and the Mississippi River.\n  This flood, which was not supposed to occur 15 years later, matched \nthe intensity of the 1993 flood, in some places it overwhelmed the \nintensity in others, particularly in the State of Iowa. The scenes \nSenator Grassley has depicted on the floor and have been described to \nme by Senator Harkin are absolutely heartbreaking.\n  Cedar Rapids and so many other communities were devastated. I wish to \nmake a point for the Record. It is this: In the 26 years I have served \nin the House and the Senate, I have never--repeat never--voted against \nemergency disaster relief for any part of our country.\n  I have felt that when that occurs, we need to come together as an \nAmerican family and help others, even if it did not affect my State of \nIllinois. Time and again, I have voted for that disaster relief, \nbelieving the day might come when I would need it for the people I \nrepresented. I sincerely believe that. I believe that what Senator \nGrassley has offered, in terms of additional assistance for Iowa, and \nperhaps even for my State, in the style that was offered to Katrina \nvictims may be a good idea. I have not had a chance to study it. But I \nam inclined to support it.\n  I believe it could be a valuable addition to the assistance which we \nprovided.\n  I wish to make it clear from the outset that what I am about to say \ndoes not reflect the fact that I could end up cosponsoring the bill \noffered by Senator Grassley and work and vote for it and probably will \nbefore it is all over.\n  But I cannot understand what happened here last night. The Senate \nadjourned. We passed the adjournment resolution. Virtually everyone had \ngone. The floor was empty but for Senator Grassley, myself and maybe \none other Member and the Presiding Officer.\n  Then, at 10 o'clock at night, Senator Grassley came on the floor and \nmade a unanimous consent request for this assistance for Iowa. Now, he \nis the ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee. I do not serve \non that committee. What he is asking for would be a measure that would \nbe considered by his committee. I looked around for Senator Baucus, the \nchairman of the committee who works with Senator Grassley. He had left \nfor the evening, as most other Members had.\n  To think that at that moment in time, with virtually no one in the \nSenate, after the adjournment resolution had been passed, when the \nchairman of the Senate Finance Committee was not on the floor, the \nSenator came and made his request.\n  Now, any Senator can make any request at any time. But it was not \nmade at a moment in time where one might expect success. This is a \nmatter that should have been brought up weeks ago, weeks ago by the \nSenator from Iowa, and so many others, in the Senate Finance Committee, \nresolved and brought to the floor.\n  But it was not until the Chamber was empty late at night that it was \nbrought up. I spoke on behalf of Senator Baucus and I objected. I did \nbecause it concerned me that the day before, we had a measure on the \nfloor to not only help Iowa, which truly needs help, but to help \nIllinois, to help all the States that have encountered disasters during \nthe course of this last year.\n\n  Senator Grassley's request relates primarily to the Midwestern area, \nwhich I am part of, and to disasters which occurred after May 20. There \nare many States that have faced many disasters which would not be \nhelped by Senator Grassley's bill. He made that conscious choice. He \nwanted to help his own State and, of course, he would. I would want to \nhelp my State first too.\n  But in the scheme of things, do we not owe an obligation to other \nStates that have faced disasters to try to treat them fairly as well? \nHow can some Senators on the Republican side come and vote against \ndisaster relief on Wednesday or Thursday, and then come the next day \nand say: I want my own version of the bill--late at night--let's make \nsure we get it passed.\n  The Senate does not work that way and it should not. We should be \nconscious of the disasters across the United States and be evenhanded. \nNow, the Senator raised my name in the debate this morning, referring \nto me as the majority whip. I had not planned on being on the Senate \nfloor. But my staff said: The Senator from Iowa is making reference to \nyou. I came to the floor. I wanted to make sure the Record is complete \nand at least reflects my own views of what happened last night and what \nshould happen moving forward.\n  The Senator from Iowa said this morning, and I wish to quote what he \nsaid because I think it is very important. The Senator from Iowa, in \ndescribing why he voted against S. 3335, which includes the energy tax \nextenders, $8 billion for the highway trust fund so 400,000 jobs across \nAmerica would not be lost; money to protect families from the \nalternative minimum tax penalties; the Wellstone Mental Health Parity \nBill; and, disaster assistance for the State of Iowa, the Senator voted \nagainst that.\n  This morning here is how he explained it:\n\n       We, the minority, want to stay on the No. 1 problem \n     affecting this country and, that is, the high cost of \n     gasoline and the energy crisis that is facing the Nation.\n\n  That is how he explained his vote against the measure. Yet he comes \nto the floor and asks the Senate to move off that energy matter so his \nbill can pass. The Senator cannot have it both ways. You cannot have it \nboth ways, when we bring a bill to the floor to help the State of Iowa \nand other disaster-stricken States and you vote against it saying, ``I \ndo not want to move off the Energy bill,'' and then, while we are still \non the Energy bill, make a unanimous consent to move off it to help \nyour State.\n  If we are going to be fair to all the States that have faced \ndisasters, then we should pass this bill. I am going to give you a \nchance to help Iowa now.\n\n\n                  Unanimous Consent Request--H.R. 6049\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate \nconsideration of Calendar No. 767, H.R. 6049, the Renewable Energy Job \nCreation Act of 2008, that the amendment at the desk, the text of which \nis S. 3335, be considered and agreed to; the bill, as amended, be read \na third time, passed, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable; that any statements be printed in the Record.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Illinois has the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I yield to Senator Grassley for the purpose of his \nexplaining his objection so the Senator's objection is in the Record. \nBut do I not want to surrender the floor. Is that possible?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, yes, I will take that opportunity. I \nhope I get to have an opportunity to offer a unanimous consent request \nas well for our side of the aisle, if you want to be completely fair. \nIn the last few weeks in this body, we have not necessarily been fair.\n  So let me take advantage of the majority whip's invitation to \nrespond. First of all, he knows, because he is in the leadership, that \nI gave the majority party information, at least 48 hours ago, and maybe \n72 hours ago, that this week I was going to seek a unanimous consent \nrequest, and all day yesterday we were denied that opportunity, even at \nthe point before adjournment and my speaking to Leader Reid about when \ncan I do my unanimous consent request.\n  You know what I was told? After the adjournment resolution. So do not \nsay\n\n[[Page S7992]]\n\nI did not make an attempt to do it and do not say you did not know \nabout it. If you wanted to cooperate with us, we could have had that \ncooperation. But there does not seem to be that sort of comity in the \nSenate anymore.\n  Another point you made was that I had a chance to work for a tax \nrelief package for flood victims. The bill you voted for and you asked \nunanimous consent on did less for your constituents than the \nlegislation we had been working on for 2 weeks.\n  Then, he brings up the point about not working through committee. \nWell, most of the work on this bill has been so we can get a consensus \npackage, working with even Chairman Rangel's staff, so it is not only \nbipartisan but bicameral, so we can put together something and get it \ndone very quickly in the same consensus manner that we were able to \nhelp the victims of New Orleans.\n  Then, the other reason: Why would the Senator from Illinois cosponsor \nour bill if it was not the right bill for his State and for the Midwest \nand for this disaster?\n  We have always tried to do things as quickly as can be done when \npeople hurt. That is why when we got back after Katrina--on Tuesday or \nWednesday--we had $10 billion that we were going to give to New \nOrleans. Before the end of the week was up, it was $60 billion, in \n2005.\n  Now, do you think the committee had an opportunity to work its will \non that? No. They were responding to need. Don't you think your \nconstituents hurt across from Burlington? They may be still underwater. \nI do not know. A couple weeks ago, they were when I was talking on the \nradio station. In Burlington you had constituents who still had just \nthe roofs of houses showing. Don't you think they need help right now?\n  So I think, first of all, procedural-wise, either the majority whip \ndoes not know what is going on when I notify his cloakroom that I am \ngoing to offer it or else he does not care or he wants to mislead.\n  The second thing is, he is not voting for the bills and pushing the \nbills that will help his constituents the most, and we still do not \nhave the relief.\n  So that is my response to the Senator from Illinois.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority whip.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I would just say to the Senator from Iowa, \nI was not part of his conversation with the majority leader as to when \nhe was going to offer his unanimous consent request. He offered it \nafter the chairman of the Finance Committee had left and virtually all \nthe members had left.\n  Whether he had an opportunity to do that before, I do not know. He \ndid not make a request of me. I was not aware of it. But he certainly \nmet with Senator Baucus during the course of this week and had ample \nopportunity to raise this issue. It is something that should have been \nresolved between the two of them before Senator Baucus left. I think he \nwould understand, as I do, that is a problem for Senator Baucus to be \ngone and to make a unanimous consent request.\n  One thing the Senator from Iowa did not say was why he objected to \nthis bill. Again, he voted against it. Now he objected again--this bill \nthat does contain assistance for my State and his State because of the \nrecent flood disaster. The simple reason is, he disagrees with many of \nthe other provisions of this bill and decided he would vote against it. \nThat is his right as a Senator.\n  I will tell him again, I may find his bill that he is offering today \nto be the right bill for my State and for his State as well and support \nhim. Even if his unanimous consent request prevailed today, the House \nis gone. We will be gone in just a matter of hours. Nothing is going to \nhappen to his request until we return in September.\n  Maybe after the August break, and a little bit of time and \nreflection, we can come back and find what we need; that is, a \nbipartisan approach to helping a lot of innocent victims of this \nflooding in the Midwest and victims of other disasters across the \nUnited States.\n  As much as I feel for my own home State and his State of Iowa, there \nare many other disaster victims who need a helping hand as well. I \nthink we ought to consider all of them when we return.\n  So at this point, Mr. President, I am going to yield the floor and \nsay to the Senator from Iowa, we have worked closely on things before. \nBut when he raised my name on the Senate floor this morning, when I was \nnot present, I felt I had to come down and explain what happened last \nnight and the situation we find ourselves in today.\n\n\n                   Unanimous Consent Request--S. 2291\n\n  Mr. President, I have one unanimous consent request to ask, which I \ndo not think has an objection.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nconsideration of Calendar No. 869, S. 2291, the Plain Language in \nGovernment Communications Act; that an Akaka substitute amendment, \nwhich is at the desk, be agreed to, the bill, as amended, be read a \nthird time and passed, and the motions to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, with no intervening action or debate.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Bennett, I object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  The senior Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n\n\n                   Unanimous Consent Request--S. 3322\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, before the Senator from Illinois leaves \nthe floor, I want to ask unanimous consent to bring up a bill to which \nhe is probably going to object. But I want him to know that people on \nthis side of the aisle want to move things along.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on Finance \nbe discharged from further consideration of S. 3322, and the Senate \nproceed to its immediate consideration. I ask unanimous consent that \nthe Grassley amendment at the desk be agreed to, the bill, as amended, \nbe read a third time and passed, the motions to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table, and the bill be held at the desk pending further House \naction.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, this is the \nsame request that was made last night.\n  On behalf of Senator Baucus, the chairman of the Senate Finance \nCommittee, I object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, thank you very much.\n\n\n                                 Energy\n\n  Mr. President, I rise this morning to talk about an issue we have \ntalked a lot about in the Senate for weeks and now months, literally, \nand we have not reached a resolution on it. It is the question of \nenergy and gasoline and what has been happening to our economy, what \nhas been happening to our families.\n  There is plenty of blame to go around. I am not here to do that \ntoday. But I do think that anything we talk about--and certainly \nanything we legislate on--has to pass two tests. One test is, will it \nprovide short-term relief to families or short-term help to the \neconomy? And, will it help long term? If it does not pass the short-\nterm and/or the long-term test, we should not be doing it. That is kind \nof the frame of what I want to use to talk about some of the issues I \nam going to raise this morning.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a unanimous \nconsent request?\n  Mr. CASEY. Sure.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I apologize for interrupting the Senator.\n  I ask unanimous consent that I be recognized following the Senator's \nremarks for 20 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from North Dakota for \nreminding me what I promised I would do.\n  Mr. President, I want to talk about this issue in terms of short term \nand long term because one thing that has been missing from this debate, \nfrankly, on both sides, is sometimes not nearly enough honesty--a lot \nof charges and countercharges, a lot of finger pointing, and not enough \nprogress. I think for one party or the other in the Senate to blame the \nother is not productive, nor is it accurate.\n  So let's talk about short term and long term. There are some things \nwe\n\n[[Page S7993]]\n\ncan do short term to help this problem. No one here has a magic wand to \nsay if we take this action, gas prices are going to go down in the next \ncouple of weeks. Anyone who says that is probably not telling the \ntruth--maybe not even over the course of a couple of months. But there \nare some things we should try to help in the short term before we \nabandon that and say all we can do is look to the long term, which we \nall know is renewable energy and all of these strategies. But let's \ntalk about the short term.\n  I think yesterday a number of Senators--I think the total is 36; I \nwill stand corrected if I am wrong about that--at least 35 or 36 \nSenators wrote to the President of the United States. Mr. President, I \nask unanimous consent that the July 31 letter to the President \nregarding the Strategic Petroleum Reserve be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 31, 2008.\n     The President,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: We are writing today to urge you to use \n     your emergency authority to immediately release oil from the \n     Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Virtually no other action you \n     could take would have as positive or as immediate an impact \n     at the pump, lowering fuel prices for American consumers and \n     businesses. Unlike other proposals put forward in recent days \n     that would take 8 to 10 years to affect the price of \n     gasoline, an announcement of plans to release oil from the \n     Reserve could cause a decline in oil prices within hours. A \n     similar announcement made by your father, President George H. \n     W. Bush, in 1991 led oil prices to decline within a day of \n     the announcement, even though the actual release of oil did \n     not occur for two weeks.\n       For the past two months, U.S. gasoline prices have topped \n     $4.00 per gallon--at least $1 more than just a year ago. \n     Diesel fuel has been even more expensive, now averaging $4.60 \n     a gallon. This has had a devastating effect on American \n     families and businesses. Although gasoline prices have risen \n     165 percent since you have taken office, average gross income \n     has increased only approximately 24 percent. High \n     transportation costs are adding to higher prices in our \n     stores and supermarkets, too.\n       Fuel prices have risen in direct response to rising crude \n     oil prices. The 40-percent increase in oil prices since the \n     beginning of the year is unprecedented, given that there have \n     been no unusual world supply disruptions. Instead, growing \n     worldwide demand, flat production, and uncontrolled market \n     speculation have put upward pressure on oil prices. This \n     crisis constitutes a severe energy supply interruption. It \n     requires an immediate response, and you hold it in your power \n     to authorize a release from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve \n     that will immediately supplement our crude oil supply and \n     break the cycle of spiraling speculation.\n       The Government Accountability Office recommended in a \n     hearing before the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural \n     Resources on February 26, 2008, that the Department of Energy \n     hold 10 percent of its Strategic Petroleum Reserve inventory \n     in heavy crude oil. The lack of heavy, sour crude oil in the \n     Reserve inventory poses a problem for refiners that use this \n     kind of oil, refiners upon whom we would rely in the case of \n     an emergency supply disruption. The Department has \n     acknowledged the benefit of holding heavier crude oil in its \n     inventory and stated its intent to acquire heavy crude oil as \n     it expands its inventory capacity.\n       We ask that you take immediate action to begin to implement \n     this modernization of the Reserve by releasing 70 million \n     barrels of light, sweet crude oil, about 10 percent of the \n     current Reserve inventory.\n       This would have an immediate effect on oil and gasoline \n     prices, unlike proposals that would open new federal land and \n     offshore areas for drilling, which would not add oil to the \n     market for many years.\n       At an appropriate time in the future, the Reserve should be \n     replenished with lower-grade, heavy crude oil, in accordance \n     with the GAO's recommendation. Market conditions are \n     favorable for this exchange of light for heavy crude, as the \n     current high price differential between these two crude types \n     would allow the Department to generate considerable revenue.\n       Given the benefits this step offers for the mission of the \n     Strategic Petroleum Reserve and the relief it would provide \n     to Americans suffering from record high fuel costs, we urge \n     you to direct the Department of Energy to release light, \n     sweet crude oil from the reserve to help Americans at the \n     pump now.\n       Thank you for your consideration of this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n         Dick Durbin, Harry Reid, Bill Nelson, John Kerry, Amy \n           Klobuchar, Kent Conrad, Debbie Stabenow, Dianne \n           Feinstein, Herb Kohl, Barbara Boxer, Sherrod Brown, --\n           ---- ------.\n\n  Mr. CASEY. I won't read the whole letter, and I won't read all the \nsignatures. But here is how the letter starts. The first line of the \nletter reads:\n\n       Dear Mr. President:\n       We are writing today--\n\n  Meaning yesterday--\n\n     to urge you to use your emergency authority to immediately \n     release oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.\n\n  It goes on later in that paragraph to say:\n\n       A similar announcement made by your father, President \n     George H.W. Bush, in 1991 led oil prices to decline within a \n     day of the announcement, even though the actual release of \n     oil did not occur for two weeks.\n\n  So when that happened in 1991, oil prices went down very rapidly. The \nsame happened with this President Bush in the aftermath of Hurricane \nKatrina. So what we ask is that the President--he does not need \nCongress; he does not need to get a consensus in Washington--the \nPresident has the authority today to release oil from the Strategic \nPetroleum Reserve.\n  So the letter, toward the end, says:\n\n       We ask that you take immediate action to begin to implement \n     this modernization of the Reserve by releasing 70 million \n     barrels of light, sweet crude oil, about 10 percent of the \n     current Reserve inventory.\n\n  So I am quoting in part from the letter, but the point is, the \nPresident of the United States today--today--has all the power and the \nauthority to take that action. Will it be a magic wand? No. Will it \nimmediately lower prices? Probably not. But it has the potential \nbecause of the precedents of what happened before--the recent history \non this--to bring down prices. So that is something that is short term \nthat the President could do right now. I hope he would do that.\n  But let's talk about long term. One thing we all agree upon, both \nsides of the aisle, we can fight and we can point fingers and we can \nhave arguments and debates--and it is OK to debate--but one thing we \nall agree on, no matter what party we are in--and this is something the \nAmerican people understand in their gut; they get this and they \nunderstand this--we have to take steps now that we should have taken 10 \nyears ago or maybe 20 or 25 years ago that we did not take to reduce \nour dependence on foreign oil and to get to this question of \nrenewables.\n  We had that chance a couple of times in the last 18 months. We had \nthat chance just a few days ago, but it was blocked. A lot of people in \nthis body voted for it. We did not get enough votes, but here is what \nwas blocked.\n  Let me run through a quick list because sometimes when these votes \noccur and the vote is announced we forget what was voted on. Here is \nwhat was blocked a couple days ago: a new consumer tax credit for the \npurchase of plug-in electric vehicles, to move that tax credit from \n$3,000 to $5,000, plug in electric vehicles, that was blocked; a 1-year \nextension of a wind power tax credit, that was blocked; a 3-year \nextension of biomass, geothermal, and other renewable energy tax \ncredits, that was blocked; an extension of the 30-percent investment \ntax credit for solar energy, that was blocked; an extension of the 10-\npercent investment tax credit for fuel cells, that was blocked; a 5-\nyear extension of the tax deduction for energy-efficient commercial \nbuildings--we know we have to do that--that was blocked; a 3-year \nextension of the tax credit for energy-efficient appliances, that was \nblocked.\n  So on issue after issue that gets to this question of reducing our \ndependence on foreign oil, getting off of oil generally--not just \nforeign oil but getting off of the dependence on oil--working on all of \nthose renewable energy strategies that everybody in the country knows \nwe have to do, they were blocked a couple days ago, and we should \nremind people who are paying attention to this issue that actually \nhappened.\n  We have a debate currently about speculation. I am not going to spend \na lot of time on that. It is not a magic wand. I have said that before. \nBut it is one of the ways--probably more long term than short term, but \nit is one of the ways we have to provide some relief long term.\n  So these are strategies that, whether it is speculation, cracking \ndown, and providing more sunlight--that is all we are asking for, is to \nsay: If you want to make a lot of money in the market, and we have a \ncommodity futures entity that regulates your conduct, we\n\n[[Page S7994]]\n\nwant to give them the authority to provide sunlight to that \ntransaction. That is all we are asking. That is all we are asking on \nspeculation.\n  So speculation passes maybe both but at least one of the short-term/\nlong-term tests--one of that two-part test. This letter to the \nPresident on the Strategic Petroleum Reserve--that certainly passes the \nshort-term test that we can get some short-term help. It is not all the \nrelief we want, not a magic wand, but it can provide some help.\n  So what else do we need to talk about?\n  We have been talking and talking a lot about drilling. Let's put some \nfacts on the table. Some of these facts have not been on the table. It \nis important to do that. I know there are a lot of people out there \nsaying: If we could just drill, we could have some relief provided. I \nwould argue--and I think there is a lot of evidence to show this--that \nthe drilling argument put forth by the other side does not pass the \nshort-term test and does not pass the long-term test. It does not pass \neither test, and we know that.\n  Here is what should be on the table in terms of facts. All these \nyears since the President has been in office, the price of gasoline has \ngone up, and in my home State of Pennsylvania people are paying more in \na year--almost $2,800 more--for gasoline than they were when the \nadministration started. OK. That is just a fact. We know the price of \ngasoline has gone up. Everyone understands that.\n  But while the price of gasoline was going up over the last couple \nyears, guess what else was going up. This has not been talked about \nmuch. There has been a 361-percent increase in oil drilling. So we have \nincreased oil drilling a lot. Some might argue we have never drilled \nmore. There has been a 361-percent increase in oil drilling since the \nPresident came into office, and yet the price of gasoline has gone up \nat the same time. So this idea that oil drilling has been restricted or \nlimited is contrary to the facts.\n  So how can that be? If the other side keeps talking about ``drilling \nleading to relief,'' how can it be that we have had that increase, and \nwhether you measure it by the increase in drilling or the leases, we \nhave had a dramatic increase in the number of leases. So that is fact \nNo. 1, a 361-percent increase in oil drilling since the administration \nstarted.\n\n  Here is another fact: Seventy-nine percent of America's recoverable \noil reserves are already open for drilling. Seventy-nine percent are \nopen--open for business right now. So there is plenty of drilling going \non; in fact, it has accelerated. Yet the price of gasoline has gone up.\n  Regarding the 24-percent versus 3-percent argument that I and others \nhave made, the Washington Post had a chart on Sunday, July 27, page A-\n8, and I have the chart right here, a chart in red. It reads very \nsimply: The percent of the world's oil consumed by the United States in \n2007: 24.4 percent. So we are consuming more of the world's oil. It is \nup to 24 percent. So if you want to drill your way to that 24 percent \nof the world's oil--because that is what the other side is saying--then \nwe must be, I guess, hoping to produce enough to get there. Well, we \nknow America has only 3 percent of the world's oil reserves, so no \nmatter what we do on drilling, even if we add to the massive increase \nwe have had in drilling, it is not going to get us to the 24.4 percent \nconsumption. That is why we have to get renewables.\n  So when people across America say we can't drill our way out of it, \nthat is not just a nice little phrase, it is the truth. You can't get \nto 24.4 percent if you only have 3 percent of the reserves, no matter \nwhat you do on drilling.\n  Finally--and I won't spend a lot of time on this, but it is relevant \nto the discussion--one party involved but that hasn't checked in on the \ndebate to give us a little help is the oil companies. Members of the \nHouse and Senate are debating and sometimes fighting, the American \npeople are arguing about this, and all the while this debate is going \non, guess who is getting our tax money--tens of billions--and guess who \nis also doing pretty well on their quarterly profits. Big oil. I have \nsaid it before and I will say it again. President Kennedy was right. \nOnce in a while, we have to ask ourselves, what can we do for our \ncountry? I have to ask Mr. Big Oil: What are you doing for your \ncountry? While we are having this debate and while everyone is \nfrustrated by gas prices--and rightfully so--what is big oil doing?\n  Well, here is what they are doing. ExxonMobil released their \nquarterly profits: in one quarter, almost $12 billion in profits, and \nwe are giving them tax breaks. So they get all the drilling they need, \nthey are getting our tax money, their quarterly profit is $11 billion, \nand they are not checking in. They are not saying, you know what--or we \nare not saying to them with legislation--we want to do it, I want to do \nit, but we don't have enough votes on the other side to do it. We are \nnot saying: You know what, Mr. Big, with big oil profits, you have \nenough. You have enough tax breaks, you have enough places to drill. \nYou have enough profits. You have enough. It is time for Mr. Big Oil to \ngive a little, to help us a little as we debate this, because until \nthey check in and until they help the American people, or until we \nforce them to help the American people, we are going to be missing a \nlot of opportunities.\n  I will conclude with this. I think we should continue this important \ndebate. I am happy the majority leader, who I think has shown great \nleadership on this issue, has continued to work in a bipartisan way and \nwants to have a summit, a meeting with both parties. That is important \nto get something done. I think we can. If we don't start dealing with \nfacts and start dealing with that test, what will help us short term \nbut, more importantly, what is going to help us long term--and that is \nrenewables--until we get to the question of renewables and until more \npeople on the other side start voting to incentivize the creation of \nrenewable sources of energy, we are not going to make much progress. So \nI think we need to focus on that test and we need to make sure we are \nworking in a bipartisan way to try to bring some relief to American \nfamilies.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota is \nrecognized for 20 minutes.\n\n\n                                 China\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I come today as a United States Senator, \nbut also as the co-chairman of the Congressional-Executive Commission \non China. I wish to tell my colleagues that the Congress created the \nCongressional-Executive Commission on China in the year 2000 to monitor \nChina's compliance with international human rights standards and to \nencourage the development of the rule of law there. I am proud to be a \nco-chairman of the Congressional Executive Commission on China. I think \nthe role it performs is an extremely important one.\n  I come to the Senate floor today in that role. I also come as well to \nsay that at a time when there is so much criticism of almost everybody \nin the political system--and I have done my share of differing with \nvarious people in politics--I come today to say to President Bush that \nI very much appreciate the actions he took this week when he met with \nseveral dissidents from China, all of whom have been imprisoned in \nChina for exercising the fundamental human right of free speech.\n  The President met with the dissidents for the same reason I come to \nthe floor of the Senate this morning. One week from today, the 2008 \nSummer Olympics begin. It is a great pageantry and a great celebration, \nin many ways. It is a celebration of athletic achievement from all \naround the globe. We will have many Americans representing our country \nand demonstrating their individual achievements on the field of sport. \nWe will have basketball players and tennis players and gymnasts and \ntrack and field participants. They will participate in these wonderful \nOlympic games that occur every 4 years.\n  The Olympic games at this time, a week from now, will be held in the \ncountry of China. There was dispute about that and concern about China \nhosting the Olympics, but China convinced the International Olympic \nCommittee that it would make significant progress in areas that reflect \nthe ideals of the Olympics--especially human rights and human dignity. \nBecause of the commitments it made, China was awarded the Olympic Games \nfor 2008.\n\n[[Page S7995]]\n\nThis is, it seems to me, not only an opportunity for athletes from our \ncountry and around the world to compete in sport, but it is also an \nopportunity, given that the Games will be held this year in China, for \nour country and for other countries to appeal to the Chinese government \nto open its system to greater human rights. It is also an opportunity \nto strongly urge the Chinese government at this point to address the \nissue of so many of its citizens--many of whom are its best and \nbrightest citizens--sitting in dark prison cells, having been sent to \nprison for exercising the right of free speech.\n  China is an extraordinary country. You cannot understand the wonder \nof China without visiting it. You can't help but stand on the Great \nWall of China and think about the history of this incredibly \ninteresting country. Visiting China is an extraordinary experience. \nBut, it is also the case that China is not an open society.\n  Our Congressional-Executive Commission on China has the largest \ndatabase of prisoners, the most complete database of Chinese political \nprisoners that is accessible and searchable by the public. Why do we \nkeep that database? So we can shine a bright light into the darkest \ncells of China, for those who have been imprisoned by the Chinese for \nexercising the right of free assembly and free speech, and to say to \nthem: The world knows you are there. You are not forgotten.\n  The international community has the opportunity at this moments \nduring these Olympics to speak up and speak out. I complimented \nPresident Bush for meeting with the dissidents this week. I think it \nwas exactly the right thing to do. I compliment him and support him for \nwhat he said to the dissidents. He said to the dissidents that he \nintended to not only care about freedom and liberty, but when he \ntraveled to China, and to talk to the Chinese about freedom and \nliberty.\n\n  All of the people President Bush met with this week have spent years \nin Chinese jails for advocating on behalf of religious freedom, human \nrights, freedom of speech in China. So when the President travels to \nChina for the opening of the Olympics, it is vital, it seems to me--and \nI think I speak for the entire Congress--to say it is vital that the \nPresident express in the strongest terms possible to the Chinese that \nthey need to address the human rights problems in their country that \nhave been so deeply disturbing to the rest of the world.\n  As I indicated, we have the names of 807 political prisoners known or \nbelieved to be currently detained, imprisoned or under house arrest. \nThese 807 records of Chinese people in jail are a subset of the nearly \n4,500 records in the Political Prisoner Database. The rest of the \nrecords reflect release, death, or escape.\n  Our commission works very hard to get information out about those who \nare being held in some of the darkest cells in China. We want the world \nto pay attention. The President of the United States committing to go \nto China and to talk to the Chinese leaders about these people is very \nimportant. We have sent President Bush the list of 807 prisoners now in \nChinese prisons. Let me go through a few of them, because I think it is \nimportant to attach faces and names to this list of 807 people.\n  This man is named Hu Jia. Hu Jia is a courageous activist who was \njailed last December by Chinese authorities because he was invited to \nspeak at a European Parliament hearing. At the hearing, he made \ncomments in his testimony that were critical of China hosting the \nOlympics. The result was that he was put in a Chinese prison. His wife \nand infant daughter--and you see his wife and daughter in this \nphotograph--were placed under house arrest for several months. In \nApril, Hu Jia was sentenced to 3\\1/2\\ years in prison for inciting \nsubversion of state power. Let me describe the charge again: ``Inciting \nsubversion of state power.''\n  I recently talked to a man who testified at that same European \nParliament hearing and along with Mr. Hu Jia. This man, however, is not \nin prison because he is not a Chinese citizen. He also just expressed \nhimself like Hu Jia. At the request of a hearing of the European \nParliament, he testified and expressed himself. He expressed criticism \nof China for being chosen to host the Olympics. For that, Mr. Hu Jia \nwill spend 3\\1/2\\ years in a Chinese prison.\n  The next photograph is a photograph of Yang Chunlin. He has been \nrepeatedly detained for helping farmers seek compensation for lost land \nin China. Last summer he organized a petition entitled ``We Want Human \nRights, Not The Olympics.'' He was subsequently arrested and he was \ncharged for inciting subversion of state power. We are told that he has \nsuffered severe beatings, causing damage to his eyesight, all for the \npurpose of speaking out, exercising the right of free speech. He is a \nvery courageous Chinese citizen who simply wants the opportunity to \nspeak freely.\n  Finally, Mr. Ye Guozhu. He is pictured in this photograph alone. \nThree generations of his family were evicted from their Beijing home in \n2003 to make way for the Olympic-related construction that occurred in \nBeijing. In 2004, because three generations of his family were evicted \nfrom their homes, he applied for permission to organize a protest \nagainst other alleged forced evictions in connection with preparations \nfor the Olympics. He was arrested. He has been sentenced to 4 years in \nprison.\n  Let me describe the charge. The charge for which he is serving 4 \nyears in a Chinese prison is ``provoking and making trouble.'' Because \nthree generations of his family had been evicted from their homes to \nmake room for the Olympics, he decided to circulate a petition to \norganize a protest against other alleged forced evictions, and he is \nnow serving 4 years in prison. We are told he has repeatedly been \ntortured. He finished his sentence, by the way, and was supposed to be \nreleased from prison this week. But his release has been further \ndelayed, presumably, because the Olympics are near.\n  The President of the United States--and only the President--has the \npower to shine the brightest light in the world into the dark cells in \nChina and say to these courageous Chinese citizens that you are not \nalone. This country knows about you, about your struggle, and about \nyour efforts to secure freedom of speech and other fundamental human \nrights.\n  We have said to the Chinese Government we want progress. They made \nrepresentations to the Olympic Committee, in exchange for being able to \nhost the Olympics, that they would make progress on human rights. I \nhave shown photographs of some very courageous Chinese citizens who now \nsit in Chinese prisons precisely because their human rights have been \nviolated.\n  Again, I thank President Bush for meeting with the dissidents this \npast week. I am someone who, from time to time, doesn't agree with \nPresident Bush. I am often critical of his work. But today I commend \nhim for meeting with the dissidents who had previously served time in \nprison in China. He met with them at the White House this week. It was \nthe right thing to do. He made commitments to those dissidents that he \nis going to do all he can. I hope he will--when he goes to China--take \nthat torch of liberty and freedom to President Hu in China and say that \nour country will not ignore these prisoners, we will not pretend they \ndon't exist. China has a responsibility to move toward greater human \nrights.\n  So this is the moment. I hope very much that President Bush will do \nwhat he told the Chinese dissidents he will. I commend him for that, \nand I hope that not just in the next 7 days, when the Olympics are \nprepared to start, but also during the Olympics and during the \nPresident's visit, he will offer some hope and encouragement to those \nwho now spend their time in a dark prison cell for having the temerity \nto try to speak the truth in China.\n  I strongly feel that if we miss this moment, we will have missed \nsomething very important. I support the Olympics. They are a wonderful \nopportunity for the world. But I strongly believe that when the \nOlympics are held in a country such as China, and the Government there \nmakes certain representations about human rights not only to the \nOlympic Committee but also to those who will attend the Olympics, and \nespecially the President of the United States, who will meet with \nPresident Hu, that he will bring that message of freedom, liberty, and \nhuman rights to the Chinese Government and describe our expectation and \nthe expectation of the international community that their citizens be \nallowed full and genuine freedom.\n\n[[Page S7996]]\n\n  Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota has 6 \nminutes 20 seconds.\n\n\n                                 Energy\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I wish to make a couple comments about \nenergy. There has been a lot of discussion all week--in fact, the last \nseveral weeks--on energy, and the reason is obvious. When you see the \nrunup and doubling of price of gas and oil in a year, the American \npeople are pretty apoplectic about that. They wonder what can they do \nto respond to it. How do I afford to fill my gas tank to go to work? \nThe airlines wonder: How do we afford to put jet fuel in the airplanes \nwe fly? The truckers wonder: How do I fill the saddle tanks and be able \nto afford it? The farmers wonder: How do I fill the fuel tanks for the \nharvest? This is a big hit to the American economy.\n  The first step is to do the obvious thing. I have a letter, for \nexample, from the chief executive officer of an oil refining company \ncalled Tesoro. They don't produce oil; they have to buy oil like \neverybody else to refine it. He believes there is a dramatic amount of \nexcess speculation in the oil market. We need to wring out the excess \nspeculation from the commodity markets. Seventy-one percent of what is \nhappening in the oil futures market has nothing to do with people who \nwant oil. They don't want a can of oil, a 5-gallon can or even a quart. \nThey want to trade paper and make money. That market is broken and has \nbeen taken over by speculators. We should set that market right and \nwring out the excess speculation in that market. We have testimony \nbefore the committee that doing that can reduce the price of oil and \ngas by 20 to 40 percent. That is step 1. We ought to do the easy \nthings, and then a lot of other things.\n  My colleagues say drill. I say absolutely. Conservation is the \ncheapest form of energy. Saving a barrel is the same as producing a \nbarrel. We waste a lot. Producing and drilling and conservation and \nefficiency. Every light switch we turn on, every thermostat, everything \nwe do can be much more efficient and lose much less energy, no question \nabout that. Conservation, efficiency, production--and especially a \ngame-changing approach away from every 15 years shuffling in here like \nbags of wind in blue suits, talking about the plan we had 15 years ago \nand 15 years before that and 15 years before that.\n  How about finding new energy and moving toward hydrogen fuel cell \nvehicles? Hydrogen is everywhere. Water vapor would come out of the \ntailpipe. Wouldn't that be wonderful? Battery storage technology, with \nsubstantial research, and moving to electric cars. How about doing all \nthese things? Solar, wind, biomass, geothermal--we have so many \nopportunities. We can round up all the money we spend on all of it and \nresearch a different energy future, which equals what we spend in the \nwar in Iraq in 40 hours. We ought to do everything and do it well; but \nwe ought to decide that if we are addicted--and President Bush says we \nare--what do you do with an addict? Do you say I will quit tomorrow and \npass the bottle tonight? That is not what you do. You decide you are \ngoing to have something that is game changing. You are going to go to a \ndifferent kind of energy future.\n  I wish to make a final point that is very important. I support \nincreased production, all those things. But my colleagues in the Senate \nhave blocked--some of them in the minority--through eight votes, our \ndetermination to provide tax incentives for renewable energy. Renewable \nenergy is so important, and we put into place permanent, robust tax \nincentives in 1916 to say that if you look for oil and gas, God bless \nyou, we need it. If you find it, you will get tax incentives. We have \ndone that for almost a century. Do you know what we did for people who \ntried to go find and produce wind, solar, and other renewable forms? We \nput into place tax incentives in 1992--short term, kind of shallow--and \nwe extended them five times, and we let them expire three times. Start, \nstop, stutter step. The fact is, we shut off all the investment every \ntime they stop. They are set to expire at the end of the year. The \nminority has blocked, eight times, the extension of the tax incentives \nso we can move toward a different energy future.\n  If we don't understand that when 65 percent of your oil comes from \nSaudi Arabia, Iraq, Kuwait, and Venezuela and outside our country and \nthat makes America vulnerable--if we don't understand that, we ought to \ngo back to bed; you don't need to wake up. It has been pretty \ndisconcerting to see people thumb their suspenders and stick out their \nstomachs and say we need to drill another hole someplace. We suck 85 \nmillion barrels of oil a day out of this planet, and 21 million barrels \nof that are destined for this country. We use one-fourth of every drop \nof oil pulled out of this planet every day, and almost 65 percent of it \ncomes from outside our country. If you don't understand the \nvulnerability of that, then you don't have the capability to understand \nvery much, in my judgment.\n  We need a robust, aggressive, new energy future. It must include \nvirtually everything, but at its root and at its foundation, it must \nhave a game-changing device that says that 10 years from now we are \ngoing to have a different energy mix, a different construct.\n  Yesterday, I said John F. Kennedy didn't hang around in the early \nsixties and say: I am thinking of sending a person to the Moon or I am \ngoing to try to send a person to the Moon or I hope we can send a \nperson to the Moon. That is not what he said. He said that by the end \nof the decade, we are going to have a person walking on the Moon. How \nabout saying that in this country now on energy?\n  By the end of the next 10 years, we will have substantially changed \nthis country's energy mix, and we are going to make the investments \nnecessary to do it, so we are not shuffling around here 10 years from \nnow with the same tired arguments I call ``yesterday forever.'' How \nabout something that does advance this country's long-term interest in \nenergy? Let's do everything we can at this point. In the meantime, \nlet's set a goal and meet the goal as a country that makes us less \ndependent on foreign oil and move to a different kind of energy future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The senior Senator from Oregon is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to \n20 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I am heading home for town meetings this \nweekend. There is no question that the dominant subject is going to be \nall the economic hurt we are certainly seeing in Oregon and across the \ncountry. People are concerned about their gas bills and their food \nbills and medical bills.\n  Yesterday, Senator Grassley and I, in an effort to look at a fresh \napproach to holding down gas bills, released what we call a discussion \ndraft, in an effort to solicit ideas and input from people who have \nexpertise on this subject, about how we might change the tax laws so as \nto not encourage speculation in the oil business.\n  The current Tax Code gives speculators tax incentives to bid up the \nprice of oil. Essentially, the current tax law distorts our markets. It \nfavors one set of buyers and sellers over another. Senator Grassley and \nI are going to be seeking ideas and suggestions over the month-long \nAugust recess in the hope that in the fall, when the Senate reconvenes, \nDemocrats and Republicans can come together on a bipartisan basis and \ncome up with more sensible tax policies, so we don't have a tax system \nthat, in effect, creates incentives to drive up the price of gasoline.\n  We have put out this proposal, and it is on my Web site. Again, we \ncall it a discussion draft. It is, in fact, just that--a way to gather \nideas and input and make sure people have a chance to be heard.\n  On another economic hot button issue that is burning a hole in the \npockets of our people, I wish to spend a few minutes talking about \nhealth care. One of the reasons health care is so expensive is that we \npay for so much inefficiency in our health care system. This year, we \nare going to spend about $2.3 trillion on American health care. Dr. \nPeter Orszag, the head of the CBO, estimates that about $700 billion of \nthat $2.3 trillion is essentially spent on health care of little or no \nvalue. So we\n\n[[Page S7997]]\n\nhave to find ways to root out some of this inefficient health care \nspending if we are going to hold the costs down.\n  Yesterday, a very remarkable hearing was held in the Senate Finance \nCommittee on which I serve. Senator Baucus, chairman of the committee, \nto his credit, made it clear that he is going to dig into these big \nissues. It is clear, once again, that the Tax Code, as it relates to \nhealth care, is clearly driving up the cost for American families and \nfor our people. In effect, the Tax Code encourages inefficient \nexpenditures in American health. We have writeoffs for employers. We \nhave breaks for individuals but they are not shared by all. The $250 \nbillion that is spent through these tax rules disproportionally goes to \nthe most affluent in our society, rather than the people who need it \nthe most.\n  If you live, for example, in a small town in Ohio or a small town in \nOregon, here is the way it works with the Tax Code: If you are well-off \nand you have a fancy health care plan, you can tuck a whole lot of your \ncompensation into that health plan tax-free. So in a town in Ohio or \nOregon, if you are going to buy a pair of designer eyeglasses or get a \ndesigner smile, you can write off the cost of those Cadillac benefits. \nBut if you are somebody in a small Oregon town or in Ohio who has no \nhealth care, you don't get those writeoffs.\n  It is unfair. It encourages inefficiency because the typical worker \nis in the dark about their health care. Even if they have a plan, most \nof the time they don't have the choice. Most individuals don't have a \nchance to hold down their health care costs the way we do as Members of \nCongress. As Members of Congress, we get to choose between a host of \nprivate plans. If you are lucky enough to have some employer coverage \nin our country, you hardly ever have a choice, No. 1, and, No. 2, if \nyour money is being spent inefficiently, there isn't anything you can \ndo about it as an individual. In fact, most people don't even realize \nthe reason their take-home pay doesn't go up is because all of their \npotential increase in take-home pay when they are more productive seems \nto go to health care. In fact, Dr. Orszag of the Congressional Budget \nOffice has said there is so much inefficiency in the health care system \nthat nothing much is going to change until people realize they are \nlosing out on take-home pay because their take-home pay goes to pay for \ntheir health care.\n  What we have said as a group in the Senate--eight Democratic Senators \nand eight Republican Senators--is we want to change this system that is \nso profoundly unfair to working people and also rewards inefficiency. \nWhat we have proposed in our legislation--the Healthy Americans Act--is \nto take away the Federal tax subsidies for the Cadillac health care \nplans and use that money instead so every family in America can get a \nprogressive deduction of $15,000 annually to buy their health care.\n  It is our view that this amounts to a trifecta. Health care would be \nfairer because we would have taken away those Cadillac tax breaks and \ngiven them to the middle-class folks who are having difficulty \naffording their health care. It would be more efficient because people \nwould have choices of their private health coverage and have new \nincentives to make purchases carefully. And there would be a \nprogressive way to finance extending coverage for more of our people.\n  I have watched with great interest the effort in Pennsylvania where \nwonderful people, such as Governor Rendell and committed State \nlegislators, have been trying to expand coverage. One of the reasons it \nis hard to do at the State level is there is no progressive way to \nfinance some of the extra coverage for people who are uninsured or \nunderinsured.\n  We have found that progressive financing in the Healthy Americans Act \nbecause we take away the tax breaks for those Cadillac plans used for \ndesigner eyeglasses or new smiles, or whatever, and we move that money \nto hard working families in Oregon and Pennsylvania and Ohio for \nexpanded coverage.\n  Our approach, as was noted by the head of the Joint Committee on \nTaxation, would give 80 percent of the American people a tax cut. A \ntypical family spends about $12,000 buying their private health \ninsurance, if they can afford it. We would give a tax cut to 80 percent \nof the American people with our approach.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania and I sat in on a very good meeting \nyesterday describing some of the questions that accompany making change \non big economic issues. People want to know how do you make sure it is \nnot so confusing and your family doesn't get lost in red tape. For \nexample, in health care, people want to know: If I like what I have, \ncan I keep it? I like the idea of looking at alternatives, but if I \nhave a plan and I like it and my employer wants to continue to offer \nit, can I do it?\n  What we said in the Healthy Americans Act, sponsored by 16 of us in \nthe Senate, was absolutely. If you want to keep what you have and your \nemployer wants to keep offering it, so be it. But if your employer \nwants more choices and if you as a worker want more choices, we also \nprovide that kind of opportunity. That is why I have said our proposal \noperates very much like what all of us--the Senator from Pennsylvania, \nthe Senator from Ohio, and myself--have in the Congress. There is a \nperiod of time when we get to choose between the various private \ninsurance policies. The insurers cannot cream skim. They cannot cherry \npick and take only healthy people and send everybody who has a health \nproblem somewhere else. We do that in the Healthy Americans Act. With \nour approach, we can get a lot more for our health care dollar. A lot \nof people in this country, say if they work for a small employer where \nthey do not have much bargaining power or they are out on their own, \ncannot get that today.\n  We set this up so it looks, in terms of its operations, pretty much \nlike the way it works for us as Members of Congress in terms of making \nour private choices. There are places you can call for help in choosing \na plan. And giving everyone these kinds of private choices injects \ncompetition and new opportunities to hold down costs into the system.\n  The issue we talked about yesterday in the Senate Finance Committee, \nthe Federal tax rules, I would guess there is probably not 1 out of 100 \npeople in the United States who knows much about this. But this is one \nof the biggest programs run by the Federal Government. It comes to \nabout $250 billion a year. And to have the money go out the door in a \nway that so wildly favors the most fortunate and encourages \ninefficiency at the same time strikes me as bizarre.\n  Yesterday, under the leadership of Chairman Baucus and Senator \nGrassley, conversation was started about a topic that I think is \nessential to this issue of fixing American health care. If we do it \nright, there is the opportunity for expanding coverage in a progressive \nway so that the next time, for example, the Pennsylvania legislature \nwrestles with this issue--this issue that Governor Rendell and \nPennsylvania legislators tackled this last year and could not pass \nlegislation on--they would be able to say some changes were made in \nFederal policy so as to fund in a progressive way some of the changes \nthat need to be made.\n  There is no question this needs to be done in a careful and \ndeliberate way. We are talking about changing something that started in \nthe 1940s. In the 1940s, it probably made a lot of sense. We were not \ndealing with a global economy, and people would go to work in Oregon or \nPennsylvania at a young age and stay put until you gave them a gold \nwatch and a retirement dinner. The typical worker today changes their \njob 11 times by the time they are in their early forties. So they need \na portable health plan they can take from place to place. We have done \nthat in the Healthy Americans Act as well.\n  Chairman Baucus made a very important point in terms of making sure \nthis is explained to people in a more simple and straightforward way \nthan it has been in the past, certainly than as it was explained in \n1993. Then fundamentally it has to be a commitment the Congress makes \nto our people to say: If you like what you have and employers want to \nkeep offering it, they can do it. I hope they will. But nearly 7 \npercent of the employers have gotten out of the health business \naltogether in the last few years and thousands more have heaped on the \ncopayments and the deductibles in the last few years.\n\n[[Page S7998]]\n\n  We need to have more choices, and 16 Members of the Senate are \nworking toward this goal. This is the first time in the history of this \ndebate, in 60 years of the Senate debating this issue, there has ever \nbeen a piece of legislation where a large number of Democrats and \nRepublicans have come together. Senator Bennett in particular, the \nSenator from Utah, a member of the Republican leadership, deserves \nenormous credit for his efforts to help find common ground.\n  Now we have a chance for the debate as we go into September, with \nChairman Baucus holding additional hearings in September, and all our \ncolleagues being home and folks asking: What is going to be done about \nhealth care? We have a chance now to start that discussion about what \nit is going to take to fix American health care.\n  I submit that when people talk about their bills, they are talking \nabout their gas bill, they are talking about their food bill, they are \ntalking about their medical bill, and that medical bill is pumped up--\nthat is the only way you can characterize it--by $700 billion worth of \nspending that is inefficient and is of little or no value. The Federal \nTax Code, as we heard from three of the experts yesterday, props up all \nthat inefficiency. So reforming those Federal tax rules, as we seek to \ndo in the Healthy Americans Act, is a key part of the solution.\n  I thank Chairman Baucus for his leadership for being willing to \ntackle an issue that lots of people, frankly, have ducked in past \nyears. And I submit that finding a bipartisan solution to these \noutdated, unfair tax rules--rules that show how broken the health care \nsystem is--is a key to holding down the costs that people are so upset \nabout and assure that we attain our goal, which is all Americans have \nhigh-quality affordable health care.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I have been in the House of Representatives \nand the Senate now for about a little over 15 years. One thing you can \ncount on that I have seen over and over is you can always count on \nRepublicans to stand up for Big Oil. We can look in recent memory. We \ncan look at the Energy bill 3 years ago--earlier than that. We can look \nat the plan Vice President Cheney wrote in the White House bringing in \nall the energy executives, not bringing in consumer groups, not \nbringing in environmentalists, not bringing in small businesses that \nare hit so hard by high energy costs, not bringing in truckers, not \nbringing in people who are paying the bills, but bringing in the \nproducers, writing an energy plan, that legislation then written by Big \nOil and other big energy producers, pushed through a Republican House \nof Representatives 3 years ago and a Republican Senate, having given \nthe President everything he wanted on an energy policy.\n  That is obviously the best example of how always in my 15 years here \nI have seen Republicans protecting Big Oil. Most recently in the last \nyear and a half, as the Senator from Pennsylvania said so well earlier, \nwe have seen eight filibusters blocking any proposals we have had on \nenergy--short-term proposals, medium-term proposals, long-term \nproposals.\n  As the Presiding Officer, Senator Casey from Pennsylvania, talked \nabout, there is no silver bullet, but there are things we can do \nimmediately. We can open the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, sell 10 \npercent of the oil from that Reserve, bringing down prices pretty \nquickly. We can go after the speculators. I am not sure Senator Casey \nsaid this, but the President's Justice Department could go after the \noil industry for some of the price gouging that many of us in this \nbody, and probably most of the American public--certainly people in \nSteubenville and Lima and Zanesville, OH--think the oil companies are \nengaged in. We can do those things.\n  A few minutes ago, when I was the Presiding Officer, I heard the \nminority leader say that the Democrats are offering legislation \nclaiming it is only speculation that is driving up prices. We have \nnever done that. We have said: Yes, speculation is a big part of it. \nSenator Dorgan said speculation is like a washcloth: you wring it out \nand you will get an immediate 20, 30, or 40 percent price decrease \noverall just by wringing out the speculation.\n  But what the other side never talks about is that it is not just that \nwe want to deal with speculation and open the Strategic Petroleum \nReserve and have the Justice Department go after the increasingly, \nimmensely profitable oil industry on price gouging, but we also have a \nvery specific long-term energy plan.\n  As Senator Dorgan said, President Kennedy didn't say: Let's think \nabout going to the Moon. He said: We are going to put a man on the \nMoon. It was the early 1960s, and he said we could do it by the end of \nthe decade. And he did it. It happened by July 1969. I was 16 then. We \nhad just gotten our first color television, I remember. My brother had \nconvinced my parents that because of the Moon landing, we should get a \ncolor television. My parents didn't really know this wasn't going to be \nin color, but it was a good move by my brother, I must admit. But I \nremember looking up in the sky and not seeing anything other than the \nbig white Moon, but how exciting it was that we could do this.\n  The same thing could be true with the President on alternative \nenergy. That is what the Democratic majority has been trying repeatedly \nto do, to take the money President Bush, Vice President Cheney, and the \nRepublican majorities in each U.S. House gave to big oil in 2005 in the \nEnergy bill and put it into alternative energy development.\n  Senator Whitehouse, speaking earlier this morning, mentioned that for \nevery $10,000 in profits Exxon has made, only $1 of the $10,000 has \ngone to research and development for alternative energy and $3 has gone \ninto advertising how green they are and how much they are doing on \nalternative energy. Senator Casey talked about the incredible increase \nin oil drilling in the last few years; that the oil companies are \ndrilling plenty, but they understand how to keep prices up.\n  So I am for more drilling, but I am not for drilling in the Outer \nContinental Shelf. I am for the oil companies drilling on the 68 \nmillion acres of Federal lands on which they already have leases. Let's \ndo that first, and let's see where we are on that discussion of \ndrilling. We can't drill ourselves out of this, it is clear.\n  Last point, Mr. President, and then I wish to speak for a moment \nabout something related to energy; that is, throughout my time in the \nHouse of Representatives and the Senate in the last 15 or so years, I \nhave always noticed that oil prices go up when one of four things \nhappens: Either there is a refinery fire or there is a pipeline outage \nor there is a major catastrophe, such as Katrina, or there is an \ninternational incident that disrupts the flow of oil to our country. It \nis either a major refinery fire, a major pipeline outage, a major \ndisaster such as Hurricane Katrina, or a major international incident \nthat disrupts the flow of oil to our country.\n  None of those things has happened in the last couple of years. Sure, \nChina and India are using more oil, and that is a long-term, huge issue \nin terms of the oil crisis, but to see the kinds of oil spikes we have \nseen in the last year and to look at what we have seen, frankly, in the \n8 years of two oilmen in the White House--we know that story--nothing \nhas happened that should have caused oil prices to go up that \ndramatically. If anything, that absolutely shows it is all, in large \npart, about speculation, and it is about the price gaming of the system \nthat the oil industry and Wall Street have done.\n  As we talk about energy, we often talk about what that means to our \nNation's infrastructure. Today marks the 1-year anniversary of the I-35 \nbridge collapse in Minneapolis. Our freshman colleague, Senator \nKlobuchar, has spoken eloquently about that and what we need to do \nabout that. It took the lives, as we remember, of 13 people and injured \nnearly 100.\n  The Minnesota bridge collapse was a rude awakening to Americans about \nthe current state of our critical infrastructure and the importance of \nimproving all aspects of bridge safety.\n\n[[Page S7999]]\n\nCorrosion, for example, which causes metal in bridges to rust and \nultimately weaken, is a significant problem for our Nation's bridges \nbut one that is resolvable if addressed by Congress.\n  In 1998, there was an amendment to ISTEA, the highway bill. Congress \ncommissioned a report about the cost of corrosion--a report from the \nFederal Highway Administration--and that report to Congress, conducted \nby CC Technologies of Dublin, OH, a community near Columbus, has \nestimated that corrosion costs the Nation an unbelievable 3-plus \npercent of gross domestic product annually, or $442 billion last year. \nIn my State alone, corrosion ultimately cost Ohio taxpayers, in damage \nto bridges and highways and other infrastructure, $15.1 billion. For \nbridges alone, this country spent $13 billion and $500 million in Ohio \nin 2007. In that same report, the FHA estimated a third of that cost \ncould be prevented through existing corrosion-control technologies.\n  There are many bills pending before this Congress that would lessen \nor prevent future corrosion of our Nation's infrastructure.\n  S. 3319 requires that any proposal to the Department of \nTransportation for bridge construction or modification or renovation \ninclude a corrosion mitigation and prevention plan. When a State \nhighway department submits a proposal to the Department of \nTransportation about this, under this legislation--there is no demand \nor other mandate--it must include a corrosion mitigation and prevention \nplan that looks at how much money it will cost to do the corrosion \nprevention and mitigation and see how much money over the next 10, 20, \nor 30 years the taxpayers will save because these bridges will last \nlonger and will be safer in the ensuing years. This plan would \nincorporate existing technologies to enhance the safety of bridges and \nsave Ohio and the Nation billions of dollars a year at a time when \nhighway funding is suffering severely from a dramatic rise in \nconstruction cost.\n\n  The reason I talked earlier about energy and connected it to these \nhighway issues and bridge issues and water and sewer issues is that the \ngas tax--which certainly funds much of our highway and bridge \ninfrastructure, the construction and maintenance--the tax dollars are \nnot increasing, and it is because it is not a percentage of the cost of \noil, of the cost of gas, it is the cost per gallon of gas purchased. So \nas people are using less, revenues are down, and obviously construction \ncosts are up as asphalt and other oil-based materials are included in \nthe construction.\n  S. 3316, a separate piece of legislation I have introduced, would \nprovide a 50-percent tax credit to companies for the design, materials, \nand installation of corrosion-mitigation technology. The tax credits \nwould encourage further work in corrosion mitigation, expanding beyond \nbridges to include all kinds of infrastructure affected by corrosion, \nincluding drinking water and sewer systems, motor vehicles, pipelines, \nand defense infrastructure.\n  I know that the Senator from Pennsylvania, when he is in Erie or \nSharon, close to my State, or when he is in eastern or central \nPennsylvania, hears over and over from mayors, as I do, about the \nproblems with infrastructure and what that means to the cost of \npeople's water and sewer bills. Mayor Coleman of Columbus told me \nmonths ago what he was facing--more importantly, what consumers, what \nhomeowners and renters in Columbus are facing--with the increased cost \nof water and sewer bills because of demands from the Federal Government \non what we need to do to guarantee safe drinking water, demands local \ngovernments want to meet but at costs which they simply can't bear. So \nhomeowners see double-digit increases in the cost of their water and \nsewer.\n  I met recently with the mayor of Defiance, Mayor Armstrong, in \nnorthwest Ohio at a roundtable--one of the hundred or so roundtables I \nhave conducted in most of Ohio's 88 counties--and I talked to him about \nwhat these costs are meaning to him in terms of sewer and water bills \nfor residents of Defiance and Defiance County.\n  A few months before that, I had a roundtable with the mayors of \nFremont, Paulding, and Perrysburg, again in northwestern Ohio. Mayor \nOvermyer of Fremont, Mayor White of Paulding, and Mayor Evans of \nPerrysburg, where the meeting was conducted--Perrysburg City Hall in \nWood County--were all telling me about the immense costs they were \nfacing and, again, more importantly, their constituents were facing \nwith the high cost of water and sewer.\n  Corrosion protection plans of this type can make a big difference in \nrelieving the cost of all kinds of infrastructure. The new I-35 bridge \nproject is under heightened scrutiny from everybody--public officials, \nthe media, and obviously Minnesotans who travel that bridge regularly \nto and from work. Their new bridge will be equipped with the best \ntechnology available, including built-in sensors to measure corrosion.\n  With all these bridge projects in other places, we should have this \nlevel of attention and they should be outfitted with robust safety \ntechnology and anticorrosion technology. The technology is pretty far \ndown the road. We are able to do an awful lot of things to arrest and \nalmost stop corrosion and the aging of these bridges. Our legislation \nwill not just utilize the technology that is available now, but it will \nspur on new technologies to arrest bridge corrosion.\n  Anticorrosion and corrosion-detection measures save money and lives. \nIt is nothing but shortsighted to bypass such measures. For too long, \nwe have governed in a way that has sort of gotten us through the day, \nthinking that we have to figure out how to get through today and not \nlooking ahead. Business doesn't look often enough beyond the next \nquarter, and government doesn't look often enough beyond the next \nelection cycle. This is an opportunity for the Nation to use its \nresearch and development talent to address the unnecessary and \nenormously costly burden we bear as our infrastructure rusts away and \nneeds to be replaced.\n  We remember the Minnesota bridge collapse of 1 year ago. This body \ncan honor the memory of those who died there and learn our lesson from \nlooking ahead and helping local and State governments adopt these \nanticorrosion measures. It will ultimately save lives and billions of \ntaxpayer dollars. It is something we can do, and it is something we \nshould begin today.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n               Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I wish to take a few minutes, if I may, \nbefore we conclude business here today, and then basically I guess we \nwill be in either adjournment or recess until the first week in \nSeptember. I wish to take a moment or so and review the events of the \npast number of weeks, culminating in the vote a week or so ago on the \nhousing legislation. Of course, the Presiding Officer played a very \nimportant and supportive role, and I appreciate immensely his \nparticipation on the Banking Committee and the effort we made together \nto achieve what I think is a fairly historic piece of legislation.\n  The news from the housing and financial markets continues to be grim. \nUnfortunately, the new Case-Schiller Index--which most people are \nfamiliar with and which is used to determine the level of home values--\nCase-Schiller data earlier this week shows that home prices were down \n15.8 Percent from May of last year, including a .9-percent, 1-month \ndrop in the month of May alone. The 10-city price index, which dates to \n1988, dropped 16.9 percent, its sharpest decline on record since those \nnumbers have been kept over the last 20 years. All 20 cities measured \nby the index showed annual declines in home values, and 10 cities have \nsuffered double-digit percentage declines over the last year.\n  Job data is not any better, I am sad to point out. It shows a loss of \n50,000 jobs. The unemployment rate now is at 5.7 percent.\n  Earlier this week, the President signed the Housing and Economic \nRecovery Act. I am grateful to him for that signature. He earlier \nindicated he was going to veto the bill but changed his mind. I, for \none, appreciate that\n\n[[Page S8000]]\n\nchange of mind, because I think it is an important message to send to \nmarkets about the importance of this bill. I wish to quickly point out \nthat the President didn't like every provision in this bill, nor did I \nnecessarily, for that matter, but he signed it into law and for that we \nare grateful.\n  This legislation is a crucial response to the ongoing housing and \neconomic crisis. Most of the legislation took effect immediately upon \nit being signed into law by the President. Already, the new regulator \nfor the housing GSEs is on the job. We are not even a week into the \nbill and he is already there, preparing to write the numerous new \nregulations required by this law.\n  On Tuesday, before the President even signed the bill, I met with \nmembers of the oversight board of the new HOPE for Homeowners program: \nthe Chairman of the Federal Reserve, Chairman Bernanke; the Chairman of \nthe Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Sheila Bair; the Secretary \nof the Treasury, Secretary Paulson; and the Secretary of Housing and \nUrban Development, Secretary Preston. We all met in my office as the \noversight board. I urged them to get to work immediately. They assured \nme they were doing that. In fact, the very next day they were having \nthe very first meeting of the oversight board. I commend them for that. \nAnywhere from 400,000 to 600,000 families can keep their homes if, in \nfact, that program works as we all hope it will.\n  Next week, my staff is meeting with HUD staff to push them to \ncomplete the regulations to get out the $3.9 billion in Community \nDevelopment Block Grant funds. For Connecticut, as well as Pennsylvania \nand other States, these dollars could be very valuable in restoring \nneighborhoods and homes that have been foreclosed, getting them back on \nthe market and producing those tax revenues every community needs in \norder to provide services to its people. The law requires HUD to have a \nformula for the distribution of this money ready in 60 days, and I \nintend to make sure this deadline is met, hence the reason for the \nmeeting with the HUD staff.\n  The Housing and Economic Recovery Act has a number of provisions that \nwill make a real difference in people's lives, and I want my colleagues \nto be able to explain them to their constituents as they travel around \ntheir States over the next several weeks. First and foremost, the bill \nestablishes the HOPE for Homeowners Act to help 400,000 families keep \ntheir homes. It does so after asking both lenders and borrowers to make \nfinancial sacrifices, and it does so at absolutely no cost to \ntaxpayers. This program will become effective on October 1.\n  In addition to providing a much stronger regulator, the bill \nincreases the loan limits for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to $625,000. \nThese GSEs--government-sponsored enterprises--along with the Federal \nHousing Administration, have been about the only sources of mortgage \ncredit available to most Americans. This will make this credit more \nwidely available to more families seeking to buy or to refinance their \nhomes.\n  The bill modernizes and expands the Federal Housing Administration \nprograms, raising the loan limits from $362,000 to $625,000, so that 98 \npercent of the counties in our country and 85 percent of the population \nof our Nation will have access to this very critical program. FHA has \nproved its value over and over again, particularly in the current \ncrisis, as it has continued to be a stable source of mortgage credit, \neven while many of the lenders have failed. By raising these loan \nlimits, that credit line now becomes available, as I said, to more than \n85 percent of the population of our country.\n  The bill also includes a permanent, affordable housing fund financed \nby Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. This is the first time ever in the \nhistory of our Nation we have established a permanent affordable \nhousing program. Ninety percent of these dollars will go for the \nconstruction of rental housing. This will take a little time to get in \nplace and will not immediately come on line as other provisions of the \nbill will, but for the long-term needs of our country, including the \nability to build affordable housing every single year as a result of \nGSE money, is going to provide great relief for those who can't afford \na home, those who are starting out and need to have affordable rental \nhousing.\n  The bill includes new protections for elderly homeowners taking out \nthe FHA-insured reverse mortgages so they are not deceived into using \nthe proceeds from these loans to buy expensive and needless insurance \nproducts. It will require mortgage brokers to be licensed. Again, that \nis a major reform in this legislation.\n  The bill expands the ability of the VA housing programs. It includes \na number of provisions to help our returning veterans coming back from \nIraq and Afghanistan and elsewhere to save their homes from \nforeclosure. Tragically, you would be amazed at how many of our service \nmen and women serving in harm's way are at risk of losing their \nproperties while they are serving overseas. This bill changes that by \nproviding new housing benefits to our veterans.\n  The legislation includes $3.9 billion, as I mentioned, in Community \nDevelopment Block Grant funds. These are dollars that go directly back \nto our communities to allow them to rehabilitate homes and revitalize \nneighborhoods that have been devastated by the foreclosure problem. \nRemember, 8,000 to 9,000 people every day end up in foreclosure--8,000 \nto 9,000 homes every day. Certain neighborhoods in our States and in \nour cities have been literally devastated by foreclosures. These \ndollars will help to get those neighborhoods back on their feet.\n  Finally, the bill includes $150 million in counseling money to \norganizations out there trying to bring lenders and borrowers together.\n  Let me take advantage of this moment to urge my colleagues to do what \nI am going to be doing in my own State, and that is doing public \nservice announcements, asking my media outlets on a daily basis to \ninform people as to what they can do. If they are delinquent in their \nmortgages, they may very well qualify for this program we have passed \nin the Congress, where they can save that house. It is not going to be \nfree of charge; they are going to have some obligations to meet. It is \nnot for everyone. You have to be an owner-occupier. It is not for \nspeculative investments people have made. I urge people to call their \nbanks, call one of these nonprofits, call the office of your \nCongressman or Senator, and they will tell you how to get in touch with \nthem, but don't allow another month or two to go by on a delinquent \nbasis. You may end up losing a home that you need to have, and it is \npossible to save that property if you will step up.\n  So I urge my colleagues, if they are interested in doing what they \ncan for their constituents in the month of August, to find the time to \ntalk about this program, let your constituents know it exists, urge \nthem to step forward, urge your lenders to be in touch with borrowers \nto see if we can't avoid the kind of continuing foreclosure issues that \nare going to make our economic recovery difficult.\n  I will end on this note: The heart of our economic problems, whether \nit is the unemployment problems, the staggering lack of commercial \ndevelopment that is going on, the problem with student loans--all of it \nrelates back to the foreclosure issue. The sooner we can stop this \nhemorrhaging of foreclosures in the country, the quicker we are going \nto get back on our feet economically. So this is not just about saving \nhomes or keeping people in their homes; it is also dealing with the \ncontagion effect that has spread over to other aspects of our economy.\n  I wanted to take advantage of these closing moments to talk about the \nbill, to talk about what is in it, and urge our colleagues--Democrats, \nRepublicans--whether you are for the bill or against the bill, there is \nan opportunity now to make a difference for the people you represent.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor and note the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Missed Energy Opportunities\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise today to put some facts on the\n\n[[Page S8001]]\n\ntable about the high cost of energy. I know many of my colleagues have \nleft town, but some are still here. And even though today is August 1, \nI doubt that it is the last we are going to hear on this debate. I \nexpect that we will hear about it all during August.\n  I come to the floor this afternoon to just put a few last remarks \ninto the Record about what I think this debate has been about and what \nI think it will be about when we return. I know some of my colleagues \nhave put out statements today about what they think we should do in \nmoving forward. I think it is very important to address the issue of \nthe high cost of energy and to put forth a realistic plan for our \ncountry to move forward.\n  Many times this week we heard the slogan: Find more and use less. It \nreminds me of the slogans we hear on oil company commercials who spend \nhundreds of millions of dollars saying things such as ``beyond \npetroleum,'' and ``look at the future we are planning.'' They are \nspending all of that money trying to convince us they have a plan, when \nin reality they are keeping us addicted to oil.\n  Mr. President, now is not the time to worry about big oil. They just \nposted astronomical second quarter profits. ExxonMobil alone made about \n$130 million a day--not bad for a hard day's work impacting consumers. \nIn fact, since the Bush Administration came into office, oil industry \nprofits have totaled $641 billion. And as this chart shows every year's \nprofit was greater than the last.\n  The complexity of this issue is that many colleagues really think \nthat drilling more is going to solve our nation's energy crisis. But \nthe clear facts is it is not going to; drilling more will just continue \nto add to the profits of these companies at a time when we should be \ninvesting in clean energy solutions.\n  So now is not the time to give the American people the false hope \nthat drilling is going to have any effect on oil prices or provide any \ndrop of relief at the pump. Now is not the time to play politics and to \ntry to continue to play the blame game.\n  Instead now is the time to realize that our economy can't take much \nmore of this. We simply have to get off of oil. It is time, after 8 \nyears of an administration with a dead-end oil policy, that we \nunderstand the long-term cost of our addiction to oil and how it is \nstrangling our economy and our vitality. Because unless we change \ncourse, and change course soon, we soon will be sending $1 trillion \nabroad to cover our foreign oil addiction. No amount of drilling--no \namount--in the United States will change that fact.\n  Just a few years ago I would come to the floor and talk about how we \nwere 50-percent dependent, heading toward 60-percent dependent on \nforeign oil. Now we are talking about being 70-percent dependent and \neven more unless we change course.\n  I think it is safe to say that the last 8 years of this \nadministration has done great damage to the continuation of our \naddiction to foreign oil. We have tried their approach. It doesn't \nwork. So what we need to do today is move ahead.\n  We need to admit the United States consumes one-quarter of the \nworld's oil but only has less than 2 percent of the world's oil \nreserves. We will never, ever be able to affect the world oil price. \nEven if we drilled in every corner of God's creation in the United \nStates, we would not be able to affect the world price of oil.\n  Americans can do the math. They know we need to be aggressively \nputting new policies into place that will make us a 21st century leader \nin new energy solutions. That is what we should be doing in the Senate \nas well.\n  Unfortunately, it seems as though many of my colleagues aren't doing \nthis simple math. Instead, they are trying to exploit the current \ncrisis and convince us that we should continue this oil addiction. That \nthe answer is to give big oil one of their top legislative priorities--\none they have wished for for several decades breaking the quarter-\ncentury-old moratorium on drilling off of America's pristine coast.\n  Pro-drilling advocates and certainly the President of the United \nStates seem perfectly comfortable perpetrating what I think is a cruel \nhoax on the American people. They are willing to imply, to insinuate, \nand to outright pretend that drilling off our coastlines will help \nprovide some relief at the pump. They are willing to pretend that \ndrilling will somehow lessen our dangerous dependence on foreign oil.\n  Though my colleagues on the other side of the aisle do not like to \nadmit this, the American people can listen to experts at the Department \nof Energy who say:\n\n       Access to the Pacific, Atlantic, and eastern Gulf Coast \n     regions would not have a significant impact on domestic crude \n     oil and natural gas production or prices before 2030.\n\n  We heard that 2030 is the magic year by which drilling in the Outer \nContinental Shelf would produce supply. But our own Energy Information \nAdministration said that access to the Pacific, Atlantic, and eastern \ngulf coast regions would not have a significant impact on the price \nbefore 2030.\n  I know we had a lot of discussion about the psychological impact, but \noil industry experts have testified before Congress that the notion of \nmore drilling would have no psychological effect on world oil prices. \nThat is from oil analysts who have written books about oil and covered \nit for many years.\n  But even in 22 years the offshore drilling scheme will not provide \nconsumers relief. This is what the Energy Information Administration \nsaid:\n\n       Because oil prices are determined on the international \n     market, any impact on average wellhead prices is expected to \n     be insignificant.\n\n  So the notion that somehow our drilling is going to help us relieve \nthe price when we are such a small player on the world market is really \na hoax. We are not going to be able to have any significant impact on \nthe price.\n  Even if we drilled in every last corner of our great Nation it would \nnot have any impact. We will never be able to drill our way out of the \nfact that our addiction to oil leaves critical aspects of our economy \nin the hands of OPEC.\n  We do not have 22 years to wait. We need to be aggressive in getting \noff oil and move ahead. I know many of my colleagues really think the \ndrilling that has been talked about here will provide relief, and they \nassume that oil companies would invest the tens of billions of dollars \nit would take to drill up and down our coastlines. I guess we should \nignore for the moment that these same oil companies are not even \nutilizing 83 percent of the leases they already have.\n  But the truth is that all the drilling will do, even post-2030, is \nlead to 1 percent of what the United States needs. That is right, if we \ngo ahead and lift the moratorium on Outer Continental Shelf drilling \nand that process starts and we get to 2030, the United States will \nstill need over 22 million barrels of oil a day. That is what our \ngrowth rate is expected to be under the status quo. Drilling in the \n600-million-acre moratorium areas would only meet 1 percent of U.S. \nneeds in 2030. All that money, all that risk of catastrophic spills, \nall the years of waiting, and that is the payoff--1 percent.\n  It is not good enough, and the American people need and deserve \nbetter solutions. That is what, when we return, we have to focus on.\n  There is a way out of this hole. It is definitely not drilling \ndeeper, and it is time to say enough is enough and that we have to \nchange course. My colleagues who use a chart that says ``Find More, Use \nLess'' on the other side of the aisle have the same empty slogan as \nthose oil company ads that pretend they are the solution.\n  In fact, I think the solution my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle ought to consider is: Find more and hold up less. They ought to \nhold up less legislation that allows us to move forward on a renewable \nenergy strategy. Find more renewable energy and sources of power and \nproduction for the United States that can impact the price consumers \nare paying now, can impact what they are going to have to pay in 2009, \nand what they can do to get us moving off our oil addiction.\n  I say hold up less, because if we look at what has happened in the \nlast year or two, we have had many proposals to move ahead off oil and \non to clean energy sources that would have impacted the price at the \npump. In fact, what this chart shows is the dozen times the other side \nof the aisle held up critical clean energy bills.\n  Starting in June of 2007, when we had a $28 billion clean energy \npackage that we tried to pass. This bill would have eliminated some of \nthe subsidies that\n\n[[Page S8002]]\n\noil companies got embedded in the Tax Code, because if we are at $126 \nor $140 a barrel of oil, it is pretty hard to argue that oil companies \nstill need tax incentives.\n  One of the best parts of this legislative package created a consumer \ntax credit of up to $7,500 toward the purchase of plug-in electric \nvehicle. That was a provision I authored with Senator Hatch and Senator \nObama. I know many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have \ntalked a lot recently about the great promise of plug-in hybrids and \nelectric vehicles as a way to get us off our addiction to oil.\n  I talked about that 1 percent that was going to be supplied by \ndrilling by 2030. If we invested in plug-in electric vehicles over \nroughly the same period of time, using electricity from our grid for \nfuel, we could have a 50-percent reduction in the amount of foreign oil \nwe would need to import.\n  So the Republican plan by 2030 is to drill everywhere to reduce \nforeign oil needs by 200,000 barrels of oil per day. Our plan, which is \ninvestment in clean and alternative energy solutions, like the plug-in \nelectric vehicles would reduce foreign oil imports by 6.5 million \nbarrels of oil a day over the same time period.\n  The difference is unbelievable what we could have achieved if the \nRepublicans would have stopped holding up these policies.\n  And my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are saying: We are \nnot supporting plug-in electric vehicles unless you give us offshore \ndrilling. They are saying we are holding hostage the great ideas and \npromise of the future of reducing our oil dependence unless you agree \nto continue the old, insane practices of giving incentives to oil \ncompanies with record profits to continue to provide the non-solutions \nto one of our nation's greatest problems.\n  It is time to get the solutions out of the hands of the oil companies \nand into the hands of the American public who want tools to reduce \ntheir oil consumption.\n  Literally, my colleagues voted no for cars that could get over 100 \nmiles per gallon on the equivalent of $1 of gasoline. That is right, \nthat is what a plug-in hybrid will get you. That analysis and study is \nthere, that our nation's electricity grid today has enough spare \ncapacity to power 70 percent of cars on the road today if they were \nelectric hybrids. So instead of paying $3.99 for a gallon of gas, you \nwould only pay about one dollar for the same amount of electricity.\n  This was just one realistic proposal the majority offered to move our \nnation to where we need to go. But every time they vote no on one of \nthese proposals, we slow up the process. Voting no in June of 2007 was \nholding us up to going to that transition.\n  So I am glad other people on the other side of the aisle realize the \npromise of plug-in electrics, but they are not voting to help us break \nthrough and implement these solutions that could help us today and \nbreak the shackles of big oil.\n  As I mentioned, this was a bipartisan bill that Senators Hatch, \nObama, and I introduced over a year ago. Our bill provides scalable \ncredits that increase up to $15,000 for large vehicles. We had this big \ndiscussion about what cars Americans drive, how big, how small, safety \nissues, farm vehicles, big transportation vehicles. The great thing \nabout plug-in hybrids and battery technology moving us forward is we \ncan put those in any size vehicle. We are not going to be limited to a \nsmall car. The legislation would also provide assistance for automakers \nand parts manufacturers to retool their facilities to speed up the \ntransition time.\n\n  So the Hatch-Cantwell-Obama bill would have been very progressive in \ngetting solutions out into the marketplace that could have gotten us \ntoward that goal we need to get to quickly.\n  Unfortunately, in December of 2007, there was another blocked attempt \nfor us to change this policy. In December of last year, the majority of \nSenate Republicans blocked what would have created a renewable \nelectricity standard. That is something even President Bush, when he \nwas Governor of Texas, supported and today Texas is the nation's \nlargest wind energy producer for our country. But Republican \nobstructionism cost us over 90,000 megawatts of new renewable energy \ncapacity by 2020. That is the equivalent of 135 new coal-fired \npowerplants.\n  If they had not blocked this legislation in December of last year, we \ncould have been on our way in 2020 to reducing the amount of coal-fired \npowerplants that we would have had in our country and getting on to \nrenewable wind energy. The billions of dollars in clean energy \ninvestment, tens of thousands of jobs could be making an incredible \npositive impact, more so than any drilling offshore could ever be.\n  Then, just a few days later, there was another blocked attempt to \nmove toward a clean energy transition when Republicans blocked a \nsmaller clean energy tax incentive package that also would have ended \nsubsidies to the big oil companies that have made these record profits. \nEven this scaled-back approach was too much for big oil, and they \nbasically made their voice heard on Capitol Hill. Big oil refused to \ngive up what was $13 billion in unwarranted tax breaks over 10 years, \ndespite hundreds of billions in profits over the last 8 years.\n  Mr. President, the American people should know that Senators that \nvoted against that bill voted against solar power, against wind power, \nagainst making homes and our commercial buildings more efficient. \nAgainst incentives for homeowners to lower their home heating and \ncooling bills and against making the electricity grid smarter, less \nprone to blackouts, and against plug-in vehicles.\n  Last February, there was another successful effort to block $6 \nbillion of clean energy tax incentives on the stimulus bill. This time \nwe gave up and said: You know what, forget the oil company subsidies, \nwe would like to get rid of them, but you don't want to get rid of \nthem, so let's put this as part of the stimulus package and let's \nstimulate our economy by moving forward. The stimulus bill reported by \nthe Finance Committee had $6 billion in clean energy incentives that \nwould have provided a short-term extension of expiring tax credits and \nhelp us stimulate the clean energy economy instead of having it bleed a \nslow death.\n  But we failed to pass that legislation. It would have helped us with \nthe creation of 100,000 green-collar jobs and $20 billion in energy \ninvestment over the next year. If $20 billion was not stimulus and \n100,000 green energy jobs, I don't know what was. Yet that was another \nbig hold on our ability to move forward.\n  The bottom line is, we cannot keep up this slogan of saying: Find \nmore, use less. We need to find more clean energy and hold up less \nlegislation that will let us get there. Quit holding hostage clean \nenergy legislation that is the truer predictor of domestic energy \nproduction, of if we are going to continue to be hostage to foreign \noil, of if we are going to make progress of moving the United States \nforward. But again our colleagues held us up on moving to that \nlegislation.\n  In fact, it was interesting that during the time of this vote, some \nof my colleagues were actually out campaigning at a solar plant. The \nCEO at the solar plant during that debate said:\n\n       The only question before us today is if the Senate, which \n     is debating an economic stimulus bill at this very moment, \n     understands green and can be green. Federal tax credits for \n     solar energy are about to expire which will send the growing \n     solar energy into a tailspin, especially here in California. \n     But the Senate can ensure we keep the economic engine moving \n     forward and extend the solar tax credits as part of the \n     economic stimulus bill.\n\n  We know what the result was. We didn't pass that legislation. And the \nblockage continued.\n  In June of this year, blocking continued on a tri-partisan bill on \nthe Senate floor. That is right, a climate change bill authored by an \nIndependent, Republican, and a Democrat that would have had a low \ncarbon fuel standard in it that would have saved an estimated 5 million \nbarrels of oil per day by 2020. That is equal to nearly 85 percent of \nour daily oil imports from OPEC. Another missed opportunity, because \nthat legislation didn't pass.\n  On June 10, we had another opportunity to try to pass clean energy \nlegislation that would have helped us in reducing our critical energy \nneeds. There were hundreds of businesses that were up here on the Hill \nasking for us to pass this legislation, telling us that new job \ncreation and reduction of fuel costs depended on it, and yet, again, we \nhad a blockage of this legislation. And it seemed, in fact, that many \npeople\n\n[[Page S8003]]\n\ncared more about the hedge fund managers' ability to use offshore \naccounts to avoid paying taxes than they did whether we were going to \nsolve this energy problem by making an investment in new energy. So \nagain we had a blocked vote that prohibited us from taking action and \ntaking our country in a new direction.\n  That same day we tried a second vote and again were blocked in a \ncomprehensive effort to get oil companies to either reinvest a portion \nof their astronomical profits into these needed areas of infrastructure \nor pay the tax so we could help clean energy solutions. And you guessed \nit, it was also blocked and held up.\n  About 6 weeks ago, on June 17, there was another blocked attempt when \nwe tried to come up with a resolution to the long overdue extensions of \nclean energy tax incentives. Again, a strict party-line discipline \nmaintained a filibuster, and companies across America started to lose \nhope that we were going to keep this investment cycle.\n  The problem is, without the tax incentives every year, where we have \nfailed to produce a coherent policy on clean energy, we have seen \nastronomical drops in investment. As this chart of wind energy \ninvestment shows there was a 73-percent drop in 2001 to 2002, and a 77-\npercent drop from 2003 to 2004, the two times Congress allowed the \nProduction Tax Credit to expire. And this is where we have gotten in \n2007--this level of investment in wind energy resources. Yet now it is \ncollapsing right in front of us because certain Senators would not pass \nlegislation to make continued investments and continued predictable \npolicy that the clean energy industry can use to put up new power \nplants.\n  In fact, around this time I got a letter from a company that I think \nillustrates the mistake we made. It came from a solar company named \nAbengoa and the Arizona Public Service, a local utility company. They \ntold me that the Senate's failure to pass clean energy tax incentives \nwas going to lead to the cancellation of a 280-megawatt concentrating \nsolar plant near Phoenix. That is a $1 billion investment down the \ndrain, and 2,000 construction jobs that will not happen, as well as 80 \nfull-time jobs lost that would have run the plant.\n  So we tried many times, but they continued blocking these critical \nbills. The filibustering just this week just further illustrates this \nissue.\n  It is frustrating because we have even heard from those who have been \nin the oil industry such as T. Boone Pickens and others who say that \nunless we aggressively act to reduce our dependence on oil and get off \nof foreign petroleum, we could see, as Mr. Pickens told us at one of \nour Senate hearings last week, $300-a-barrel oil.\n  I don't think any of my colleagues want to see that. So I hope my \ncolleagues go home and understand that our future lies in providing \nopportunities to find more renewable production, not drilling hoaxes. I \nhope they will quit holding clean energy hostage for the oil company \nexecutives; quit holding up the good legislation that could move our \ncountry forward.\n  I hope my colleagues will come back to the Senate in September with \nthe notion in mind that reducing by 50 percent our dependence on \nforeign oil by accelerating the transition to plug-in electric vehicles \nshould be our goal. That they will realize that holding up good \nlegislation hostage for the 1 percent--the 1 percent--we might get from \nour Outer Continental Shelf drilling is risking our country's future.\n  This is the time to make the transition, and I hope my colleagues \nwill hear that and understand it is not time to keep perpetrating \nhoaxes backed by and focused on by the oil companies. Rather its time \nto stop the politics and get serious about implementing a plan that \ngets our country off our dependence on oil. So I hope when we get back \nin September the other side of the aisle will quit holding up these \ncritical clean energy bills and work with us to move forward on a \ndesperately needed new energy strategy for the United States that will \nprovide real price relief for Americans.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/08/01/senate-section/article/S8003-1", "month": "08", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8003]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    RAILROAD SAFETY ENHANCEMENT ACT\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL.

Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report the bill by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 2608) to amend section 402 of the Personal \n     Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of \n     1996 to provide, in fiscal years 2008 through 2010, \n     extensions of supplemental security income for refugees, \n     asylees, and certain other humanitarian immigrants, and to \n     amend the Internal Revenue Code to collect unemployment \n     compensation debts resulting from fraud.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise to extend my appreciation that the \nSenate will pass the ``SSI Extension for Elderly and Disabled Refugees \nAct.'' I thank Chairman Baucus and Senator Grassley for their help in \nmoving this important legislation to the President. This is a bill that \nI introduced in the Senate with Senator Kohl and it will make a \nsignificant impact in helping our most vulnerable asylees and refugees. \nI also want to thank Senator Specter for his tremendous support of this \nbill and help in negotiating a final package. The passage of this bill \nsends a message that we have not and will not turn our back on those \nwhom we have welcomed to our country.\n  As many of you may know, Congress modified the Supplemental Security\n\n[[Page S8004]]\n\nIncome--SSI--program to include a 7-year time limit on the receipt of \nbenefits for refugees and asylees. To allow adequate time for asylees \nand refugees to become naturalized citizens, Congress provided the 7-\nyear time limit before the expiration of SSI benefits. Unfortunately, \nthe naturalization process often takes longer than 7 years. Applicants \nare required to live in the United States for a minimum of 5 years \nprior to applying for citizenship. In addition to that time period, \ntheir application process often can take 3 or more years before there \nis resolution.\n  Because of this time delay, many individuals are trapped in the \nsystem and faced with the loss of their SSI benefits. In fact, by the \nend of 2008 more than 30,000 elderly and disabled refugees will have \nlost their benefits and more than 19,000 are projected to lose their \nbenefits in the coming years.\n  Many of these individuals are elderly refugees who fled persecution \nor torture in their home countries. They include Jewish refugees \nfleeing religious persecution in the former Soviet Union, Iraqi Kurds \nfleeing the Saddam Hussein regime, Cubans and Hmong people from the \nhighlands of Laos who served on the side of the United States military \nduring the Vietnam War. They are elderly and unable to work, and have \nbecome reliant on their SSI benefits as their primary income. To \npenalize them because of delays encountered through the bureaucratic \nprocess seems unjust and inappropriate.\n  The administration, in its fiscal year 2009 budget, acknowledged the \nnecessity of correcting this problem by dedicating funding to extend \nrefugee eligibility for SSI beyond the 7-year limit. This legislation \nbuilds upon those efforts by allowing an additional 2 years of benefits \nfor elderly and disabled refugees, asylees, and other qualified \nhumanitarian immigrants, including those whose benefits have expired in \nthe recent past.\n  The Senate version requires that eligible individuals demonstrate \nthat they are moving toward citizenship in order to gain the additional \n2-year extension of benefits. While the Act provides flexibility to the \nSocial Security Administration--SSA--and the Department of Homeland \nSecurity--DHS--in developing a procedure whereby they can verify an \napplicant's eligibility for the extension of benefits, it is our intent \nthat whatever procedure SSA and DHS establish, it does not impose any \nundue burdens or barriers on the benefactors of this Act.\n  Additionally, the bill allows benefits to be extended for a third \nyear for those refugees who are awaiting a decision on a pending \nnaturalization application. These policies are limited to 2011 and are \ncompletely offset in cost by a provision that will allow the Department \nof Labor to recapture federal funds that are the result of unemployment \ninsurance fraud.\n  I again thank my colleagues for their support of this bill and for \nits passage.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Smith \nsubstitute at the desk be agreed to, the bill as amended be read a \nthird time and passed, the title amendment be agreed to, the motion to \nreconsider be laid on the table, and any statements be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 6580) to ensure the fair treatment of a member \n     of the Armed Forces who is discharged from the Armed Forces, \n     at the request of the member, pursuant to the Department of \n     Defense policy permitting the early discharge of a member who \n     is the only surviving child in a family in which the father \n     or mother, or one or more siblings, served in the Armed \n     Forces and, because of hazards incident to such service, was \n     killed, died as a result of wounds, accident, or disease, is \n     in a captured or missing in action status, or is permanently \n     disabled, to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \n     repeal the dollar limitation on contributions to funeral \n     trusts, and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Hubbard Act.\n  This important legislation helps our service men and women in uniform \nwho are the ``sole survivor''--only surviving child in a family in \nwhich one of their family members has died or been killed due to their \nmilitary service. Under the current ``sole survivor'' policy of the \nArmed Forces, there are no standard benefits available to those who \nseparate from the Armed Forces under this policy.\n  The legislation corrects a flaw, allowing sole survivors to qualify \nfor a standard set of Federal benefits that are generally available to \nother veterans.\n  I would like to comment on the bill's other provision. Section 9 \nwould repeal the dollar limitations on contributions to funeral trusts. \nIn the Senate, this provision was authored by the Senator from Utah, \nMr. Hatch. It has been included to offset the additional spending \nassociated with the bill's sole survivor provisions.\n  As I have consistently said in the past, the Senate Finance Committee \nis not a piggy bank for the other committees to dip into to pay for \ntheir new\n\n[[Page S8005]]\n\nspending proposals. My preference would have been to have the sole \nsurvivor provisions in this legislation funded by spending reductions \nby the committees of jurisdiction.\n  I have been told that option was not available for this bill.\n  The funeral trust provision under Section 9, is a taxpayer favorable \nprovision. It is a purely voluntary provision. It helps people who want \nto put more money aside in trust to provide for their funeral.\n  Unlike prior revenue raisers proposed by the majority that would \nimpose tax increases on unsuspecting Americans, this revenue offset is \nstrongly supported by those who would pay the additional tax.\n  As I said previously, my strong preference would be to not use the \ntax code to pay for higher spending. However, there is strong support \nfor the funeral trust provision and it is favorable to taxpayers.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nread a third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, and any statements be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I ask unanimous consent the Judiciary Committee be \ndischarged from further consideration of S.J. Res. 45 and the Senate \nproceed to its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the joint resolution by title.\n  The assistant clerk read as follows:\n\n       A joint resolution (S.J. Res. 45) expressing the consent \n     and approval of Congress to an interstate compact regarding \n     water resources in the Great Lakes St. Lawrence River Basin.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the joint \nresolution.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I wanted to talk to today about the Great \nLakes-St. Lawrence River Basin Water Resources Compact. The compact \nenjoys broad bipartisan support, including all 8 Great Lakes States, \nCanadian provinces Ontario and Quebec, and 150 business and \nenvironmental groups.\n  The Great Lakes are one of America's national treasures and one of \nthe natural wonders of the world. Holding 20 percent of the worlds \nfreshwater, the Great Lakes play a vital role in the daily lives of the \npeople of Wisconsin providing drinking water, jobs, energy, shipping, \nand recreation. Something that important to our prosperity needs to be \nconserved so that future generations can benefit.\n  The compact before us does just that. It is a binding agreement among \nthe Great Lakes States to implement a conservation standard for \nregulating water withdrawals from the Great Lakes Basin. Specifically, \nthe compact protects the Great Lakes by banning new or increased \ndiversions outside of the Great Lakes basin. The compact also requires \neach State to implement water conservation measures, which will promote \nefficient water use and minimize waste.\n  Not too long ago we faced the specter of foreign companies exporting \nwater out of the lakes--threatening our environment. This compact is a \nresponse to those threats, making it clear that the Lakes are not to be \nexploited. As a cosponsor of this resolution, I am pleased the Senate \npassed this important compact.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise to today in support of S.J. Res. \n45, the Great Lakes--St. Lawrence River Basin Water Resources Compact. \nDuring the course of adoption of the Compact by the respective State \nlegislatures, an issue arose concerning the intent and interpretation \nof section 4.11.2 of the Compact's Decision-Making Standard relating to \nthe scale and scope of impacts that would be deemed sufficiently \nsignificant such to preclude approval of a withdrawal proposal. It is \nmy understanding that the intent of the drafters of the Compact is \nexpressed in a memorandum prepared by Dr. Sam Speck, Chair of the \nCouncil of Great Lakes Governors Annex 2001 Working Group, dated \nDecember 5, 2005, and I ask unanimous consent it be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                 December 5, 2005.\n     To: George Kuper, President and CEO, Council of Great Lakes \n     Industries.\n     From: Sam Speck, Director, Ohio Department of Natural \n     Resources, Chair, Great Lakes Governors' and Premiers' Water \n     Management Working Group.\n\n       You and other stakeholder representatives have raised \n     concerns regarding three specific sections of the November 10 \n     drafts of the Great Lakes--St. Lawrence River Basin Water \n     Resources Compact (Compact). On behalf of the Working Group, \n     I would like to provide you with a description of our intent \n     with respect to these sections. Please share this memo with \n     other interested parties.\n\n\n                         CONCERNS AND RESPONSES\n\n       Please note that all Section references below are to the \n     November 10 drafts of the compact and ``your submission'' \n     mean the joint submission from the Council of Great Lakes \n     Industries and the National Wildlife Federation dated October \n     9, 2005. Each ``concern'' below is the text that you \n     submitted to us and the ``response'' is on behalf of the \n     Working Group.\n       1. CONCERN: The ``grandfathering'' of existing users.\n       The ``grandfathering'' issue has been known--and industry \n     widely believes agreed to--since the beginning of the \n     deliberations. But, there are major problems with current \n     language:\n       (a.) The current baseline from which ``new'' or \n     ``increased'' will be determined is unnecessarily unclear/\n     imprecise and potentially constraining (Section 4.12.2 ii). \n     An industrial capital investment made in any part of a \n     facility's water withdrawal system must be permitted to \n     operate at the capacity for which it was designed and built, \n     no matter if other parts of the water treatment or \n     distribution system may require enlargement. Above all, this \n     section will generate wide dissatisfaction and a decided lack \n     of support if it is not clarified.\n       (b.) There is no provision for challenging/correcting the \n     list of existing withdrawers--and the grandfathered \n     withdrawal quantities--that will be created by each Party \n     which may omit users or cite incorrect quantities. Some will \n     believe that if they are inadvertently left off such a list \n     they will not be considered for an existing use at some point \n     in the future.\n       Response\n       (a.) In your submission to the Working Group, you proposed \n     that existing Withdrawals would be determined as follows:\n       ``The existing Withdrawal will be determined by the \n     [larger] of either the applicable Withdrawal limitation in \n     any permit authorizing the Withdrawal; or, the physical \n     capacity of the withdrawal system facility (which includes \n     Withdrawal capacity, treatment capacity, and other capacity \n     limiting factors) as of the effective date of the Compact.''\n       The Working Group's intent and effect of Section 4.12.2 of \n     the Compact is consistent with your submission. Each State \n     will have the flexibility of choosing either to use the \n     permitted amount or capacity limiting factors for determining \n     existing withdrawals.\n       We encourage interested stakeholders to work with the \n     individual States to help them determine which approach to \n     use when identifying existing water withdrawals.\n       (b.) The individual States will have the authority to \n     create the process for developing and maintaining lists of \n     existing water withdrawals. It is our understanding that \n     States intend to use processes similar to those that have \n     been used for other management and regulatory initiatives \n     with opportunities for public participation, appeals and due \n     process. All interested stakeholders are encouraged to work \n     with the individual States as they develop these processes to \n     ensure that the lists are accurate.\n       2. CONCERN: Change to a mandatory requirement not \n     understood.\n       A very recent change to a decision-making standard (Section \n     4.11.2)--a substitution of ``and'' instead of ``of'' as the \n     conjunctive in the last phrase--changes the entire meaning of \n     the provision and sets up a situation where a significant \n     impact on a few feet of a stream could be viewed as a bar to \n     permitting. Hopefully this is just a ``typo.'' If not, this \n     constitutes a considerable and unsupportable change in intent \n     of the section.\n       Response\n       The Working Group's intent is consistent with your \n     submission regarding the scope of evaluating ``no significant \n     adverse impacts.'' To clarify, a ``Source Watershed'' is the \n     watershed of a Great Lake or the St. Lawrence River. \n     Therefore, requiring that there be no significant adverse \n     impacts to a Source Watershed means that, for example, there \n     be no significant adverse impacts to the Lake Michigan \n     watershed.\n       In your submission to the Working Group, your proposed \n     criterion included in your Section 4.9.2 read as follows:\n       ``The Consumptive Use [or] Withdrawal . . . will be \n     implemented so as to ensure that the Proposal. . . .will \n     result in no significant individual or cumulative adverse \n     impacts to the quantity or quality of the Waters and Water \n     Dependent Natural Resources of the applicable Source \n     Watershed.'' [Emphasis added.]\n       With this language and the corresponding definitions, your \n     submission would require that there be no significant \n     individual or cumulative adverse impacts at both the Basin-\n     wide and Source Watershed (e.g. Lake Michigan watershed) \n     scale.\n       In the Compact, the definition of ``Water and Water \n     Dependent Natural Resources'' (Section 1.2) reads as follows:\n       ``Water Dependent Natural Resources means the interacting \n     components of land, Water and living organisms affected by \n     the Waters of the Basin.'' [Emphasis added.]\n       And the definition ``Waters of the Basin'' reads in the \n     Compact as follows (Section 1.2):\n\n[[Page S8007]]\n\n       ``Waters of the Basin or Basin Water means the Great Lakes \n     and all streams, rivers, lakes, connecting channels and other \n     bodies of water, including tributary groundwater, within the \n     Basin.'' [Emphasis added.]\n       Accordingly, when a reference is made to the ``Water \n     Dependent Natural Resources,'' a reference is effectively \n     made to all of the water of the Great Lakes Basin. Therefore, \n     in Section 4.11.2 of the Compact, the use of the word ``and'' \n     in place of ``of'' simply clarifies that, in addition to your \n     explicit requirement that there be no significant adverse \n     impacts to the Water Dependent Natural Resources of the \n     Source Watershed, there be no significant adverse impacts to \n     the Great Lakes--St. Lawrence River Basin as a whole.\n       In conclusion, the intent and effect of the language \n     included by the Working Group is consistent with the intent \n     and effect of the language provided in your submission.\n       3. CONCERN: Inappropriate unilateral Council authority.\n       As currently drafted, it appears that the Council can \n     revise all the carefully crafted provisions of this Compact \n     (Section 3.1, 2nd Para.) without any public or State \n     legislative review. This threatens the stability of secure \n     access which is so critical to industry. The odds are \n     legislators would not appreciate this delegation of \n     legislative authority either. At best there are significant \n     differences of opinion as to how this section reads. At \n     worse, the Council has reserved the right to change, by \n     unanimous vote and without affirmative legislative action of \n     the Parties, the Standard. We suspect it is a lack of clarity \n     and can easily be remedied.\n       Response\n       This is an incorrect interpretation of the referenced \n     paragraph. The second paragraph of Section 3.1 of the Compact \n     does not allow the Compact Council to ``unilaterally'' revise \n     the Standard of Review and Decision without any public or \n     State legislative review. The second paragraph of Section 3.1 \n     states that:\n       The Council may revise the Standard of Review and Decision, \n     after consultation with the Provinces and upon (1) unanimous \n     vote of all Council members, (2) by regulation duly adopted \n     in accordance with Section 3.3 of this Compact and (3) in \n     accordance with each Party's respective statutory authorities \n     and applicable procedures. [Italicized numbers added]\n       Therefore, before any revision can be made to the Standard \n     of Review and Decision, ALL of the following steps must take \n     place:\n       (1) Unanimous vote of all Council members. The Council \n     consists of all eight Great Lakes Governors (see Section \n     2.2). Therefore, all eight Governors must approve any \n     proposed revision to the Standard of Review and Decision. Any \n     single Governor may veto a proposed revision to the Standard \n     of Review and Decision.\n       (2) Regulation duly adopted in accordance with Section 3.3 \n     of this Compact. Section 3.3.1 states in part that: Any rule \n     or regulation of the Council . . . shall be adopted only \n     after public notice and hearing. [Emphasis added] A \n     contention that changes can be made without public notice and \n     hearing is incorrect.\n       (3) In accordance with each Party's respective statutory \n     authorities and applicable procedures. Any proposed revision \n     must be done in accordance with the appropriate statutes, \n     rules and regulations in each and every State. Each State \n     will have the opportunity to determine what the appropriate \n     rules may be.\n       It is difficult to envision a case where there would be no \n     public hearings or input in any of the States on a proposed \n     revision to the Standard of Review and Decision. All of the \n     States currently have in place procedures that must be \n     followed before regulations can come into force. In some \n     instances, these procedures include legislative review of the \n     proposed regulations.\n       Therefore, an interpretation that there could be a \n     ``unilateral'' revision to the Standard or Review and \n     Decision is erroneous. Each State legislature has significant \n     ability to decide under what circumstances the Standard of \n     Review and Decision may be revised because of the requirement \n     that the revision be adopted in accordance with each Party's \n     respective statutory authorities and applicable procedures.\n\n\n                               CONCLUSION\n\n       We appreciate your concerns and we hope that this \n     clarification regarding the Working Group's intent is \n     helpful. As always, if there are questions please do not \n     hesitate to contact me or other Working Group members. We \n     appreciate your continued partnership in our shared efforts \n     to protect the Great Lakes--St. Lawrence River Basin.\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL.

Withdrawal Systems. The total volume of surface water \n     and groundwater resources that supply a common distribution \n     system shall determine the volume of a Withdrawal, \n     Consumptive Use or Diversion.\n       ``7. Connecting Channels. The watershed of each Great Lake \n     shall include its upstream and downstream connecting \n     channels.\n       ``8. Transmission in Water Lines.

Res. 625\n\n       Whereas the airborne forces of the Armed Forces have a long \n     and honorable history as units of adventuresome, hardy, and \n     fierce warriors who, for the national security of the United \n     States and the defense of freedom and peace, project the \n     effective ground combat power of the United States by Air \n     Force air transport to the far reaches of the battle area \n     and, indeed, to the far corners of the world;\n       Whereas August 16 marks the anniversary of the first \n     official Army parachute jump on August 16, 1940, an event \n     that validated the innovative concept of inserting United \n     States ground combat forces behind the battle line by means \n     of a parachute;\n       Whereas the United States experiment of airborne infantry \n     attack began on June 25, 1940, when the Army Parachute Test \n     Platoon was first authorized by the Department of War, and \n     was launched when 48 volunteers began training in July 1940;\n       Whereas the success of the Parachute Test Platoon in the \n     days immediately preceding the entry of the United States \n     into World War II led to the formation of a formidable force \n     of airborne units that have served with distinction and have \n     had repeated success in armed hostilities;\n       Whereas among those airborne units are the former 11th, \n     13th, and 17th Airborne Divisions, the venerable 82nd \n     Airborne Division, the versatile 101st Airborne Division (Air \n     Assault), and the airborne regiments and battalions (some as \n     components of those divisions, some as separate units) that \n     achieved distinction as the elite 75th Ranger Regiment, the \n     173rd Airborne Brigade, the 187th Infantry (Airborne) \n     Regiment, the 503rd, 507th, 508th, 517th, 541st, and 542nd \n     Parachute Infantry Regiments, the 88th Glider Infantry \n     Regiment, the 509th, 551st, and 555th Parachute Infantry \n     Battalions, the 325th and 327th Glider Infantry, and the \n     550th Airborne Infantry Battalion;\n       Whereas the achievements of the airborne forces during \n     World War II prompted the evolution of those forces into a \n     diversified force of parachute and air assault units that, \n     over the years, have fought in Korea, Vietnam, Grenada, \n     Panama, the Persian Gulf region, and Somalia, and have \n     engaged in peacekeeping operations in Lebanon, the Sinai \n     Peninsula, the Dominican Republic, Haiti, Bosnia, and Kosovo;\n       Whereas the modern-day airborne force that has evolved from \n     those World War II beginnings is an agile, powerful force \n     that, in large part, is composed of the 82nd Airborne \n     Division, the 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault), and the \n     75th Ranger Regiment;\n       Whereas the modern-day airborne force also includes other \n     elite forces composed entirely of airborne trained and \n     qualified special operations warriors, including Army Special \n     Forces, Marine Corps Reconnaissance units, Navy SEALs, and \n     Air Force combat control teams, all or most of which comprise \n     the forces of the United States Special Operations Command;\n       Whereas in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks on the \n     United States on September 11, 2001, the 75th Ranger \n     Regiment, special forces units, and units of the 82nd \n     Airborne Division and the 101st Airborne Division (Air \n     Assault), together with other units of the Armed Forces, have \n     been prosecuting the war against terrorism by carrying out \n     combat operations in Afghanistan, training operations in the \n     Philippines, and other operations elsewhere;\n       Whereas in the aftermath of the President's announcement of \n     Operation Iraqi Freedom in March 2003, the 75th Ranger \n     Regiment, special forces units, and units of the 82nd \n     Airborne Division, the 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault), \n     the 173rd Airborne Brigade, and the 4th Brigade Combat Team \n     (Airborne) of the 25th Infantry Division, together with other \n     units of the Armed Forces, have been prosecuting the war \n     against terrorism, carrying out combat operations, conducting \n     civil affairs missions, and assisting in establishing \n     democracy in Iraq;\n       Whereas the airborne forces are and will continue to be at \n     the ready and the forefront until the Global War on Terrorism \n     is concluded;\n       Whereas of the members and former members of the United \n     States airborne forces, all have achieved distinction by \n     earning the right to wear the airborne's ``Silver Wings of \n     Courage'', thousands have achieved the distinction of making \n     combat jumps, 69 have earned the Medal of Honor, and hundreds \n     have earned the Distinguished-Service Cross, Silver Star, or \n     other decorations and awards for displays of such traits as \n     heroism, gallantry, intrepidity, and valor;\n       Whereas the members and former members of the United States \n     airborne forces are members of a proud and honorable \n     fraternity of the profession of arms that is made exclusive \n     by those distinctions which, together with their special \n     skills and achievements, distinguish them as intrepid combat \n     parachutists, special operation forces, and (in former days) \n     glider troops;\n       Whereas the history and achievements of the members and \n     former members of the airborne forces of the United States \n     Armed Forces warrant special expressions of the gratitude of \n     the American people; and\n       Whereas, since the airborne community celebrates August 16 \n     as the anniversary of the first official jump by the Army \n     Parachute Test Platoon, August 16 would be an appropriate day \n     to recognize as National Airborne Day: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates August 16, 2008, as ``National Airborne \n     Day''; and\n       (2) calls on the people of the United States to observe \n     ``National Airborne Day'' with appropriate programs, \n     ceremonies, and activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url":

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in \nthe Record an article from the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, which \nprofiles Mr. Alvin Sykes. Mr. Sykes and I have worked closely together \nto reach a compromise on this bill, and I would like the story of his \nlife and his work on this legislation to be part of the record.\n  I would also ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a \nmessage from Mr. Sykes to me, expressing support for the compromise.\n  Finally, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record three \nletters. The first is to the bill's sponsor, Senator Chris Dodd, \nexplaining my objection to the legislation. The letter is dated June \n25, 2007. The second is a subsequent letter to Senator Dodd, seeking a \nUC agreement for floor time on the bill, dated June 19, 2008. The third \nis a similar letter to Senator Reid, sent the same day.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         [From the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Jun. 3, 2007]\n\nCivil Rights-Era Murder Cases: ``Another Day for Justice''--Self-Taught \n Legal Expert Alvin Sykes Is on a Quest To Get Long-Unpursued Suspects \n                    Into Court Before It's Too Late\n\n                            (By Drew Jubera)\n\n       Jackson, Miss.--A fourth-floor courtroom filled here last \n     week much the way Southern courtrooms now fill every few \n     years for a civil rights-era murder case.\n       The 71-year-old defendant, James Seale, requested \n     headphones as he sat with his lawyers during jury selection \n     so he could hear the proceedings.\n       The former crop duster and reputed Klansman is charged with \n     kidnapping and conspiracy in connection with the May 2, 1964, \n     abduction and killings of two black teenagers. The bodies of \n     Henry Dee and Charles Moore were found in the Mississippi \n     River, tied to a Jeep engine block.\n       Seale has pleaded not guilty to the federal charges.\n       Also inside the downtown courthouse: aging relatives of the \n     murdered boys, including Thomas Moore, 63, a Vietnam veteran \n     who worked almost a decade to get his brother's moldering \n     case reopened.\n       Before entering this historic scene and sitting in a rear \n     pew, Alvin Sykes tugged at his blue-jean jacket, stroked his \n     scraggly goatee and exhaled.\n       ``Another day for justice,'' said Sykes, an improbable \n     presence at yet another improbable decades-old case.\n       Sykes, a high school dropout and practicing Buddhist who \n     once lived in a homeless shelter and learned the law reading \n     books in public libraries, has become both a catalyst and an \n     inspiration during the 11th-hour rush to reopen these old \n     murder cases before the killers die off.\n       Since 1989, authorities in Mississippi and six other states \n     have re-examined 29 civil rights-era murders, with 28 \n     resulting arrests and 22 convictions.\n       The FBI has uncovered 51 more killings, and the Southern \n     Poverty Law Center has a list of 127 race-related killings \n     between 1954 and 1968.\n       It's in this atmosphere that Sykes has brokered meetings \n     with people as various as U.S. senators, district attorneys \n     and victims' relatives to seek long-delayed justice.\n       His behind-the-scenes maneuvering was key to the FBI's \n     reinvestigation of the infamous 1955 murder of Emmett Till, a \n     black Chicago teen brutally killed after he allegedly \n     whistled at a white woman in Money, Miss. (Earlier this year, \n     a Mississippi grand jury did not return an indictment in the \n     case.)\n       Sykes also generated the idea for legislation now before \n     Congress that grew out of the reopening of that now-52-year-\n     old slaying. Commonly known as the Till Bill, and sponsored \n     in the House of Representatives by Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.), \n     it would fund a separate unit in the Justice Department \n     devoted to investigating civil rights-era crimes.\n       ``He's a warrior,'' said Moore of the mild-mannered Sykes, \n     whom he credits with inspiring him while he sought justice \n     for his brother. ``Every now and then a person comes along \n     who you say, `Where'd this guy come from?' Alvin's one of \n     those guys. He might not have this degree or that background, \n     but he has a lot of dedication and inner strength.''\n       Added Margaret Burnham, a Northeastern University law \n     professor who recently invited Sykes to speak at a conference \n     in Boston about civil rights-era cases, co-sponsored by \n     Harvard University, ``He's a completely self-taught man who's \n     incredibly skilled at knowing what buttons to push, when to \n     push them and what cases the government might respond to. \n     He's better at it than hundreds of people I've met in my long \n     life as a civil rights lawyer.\n       ``He brings a passion and insight to the work that would be \n     extraordinary for anybody--a university-trained academic or \n     lawyer--but it's particularly extraordinary given his \n     personal history.''\n       Sykes was born to a 14-year-old at a home for unwed \n     mothers, then taken in by a single 48-year-old friend of the \n     family in Kansas City, Mo. He was sickly, in and out of \n     hospitals with epilepsy, and says around age 11 he was \n     sexually abused by a couple that lived across the street.\n       His formal education was spotty--he spent three years at \n     Boys Town, the facility for at-risk kids in Omaha--then left \n     school for good at 16.\n       He lived briefly with his biological mother--he thought for \n     years she was a cousin--but says she was an alcoholic and \n     rarely employed. He ran into her years later when he was \n     homeless. She lived at the same shelter.\n       But Sykes calls leaving school the start of his education. \n     Working nights managing a band, he spent his days holed up in \n     a library. ``Education was important to me--that's the reason \n     I left school,'' he said. ``The administration was more \n     concerned with students getting a piece of paper than an \n     education. So I started teaching myself.''\n       He also sat in on trials, watching legal strategies, \n     researching what he didn't understand. He became involved in \n     a federal desegregation case with the Kansas City public \n     schools and befriended a Justice Department official. ``I \n     learned about cases and the system and started applying it to \n     real matters,'' he said.\n       Sykes' work as a victims' advocate became locally renowned \n     after a string of Kansas City musicians were murdered in the \n     late '70s and early '80s. When a white defendant was \n     acquitted of beating a prominent black musician to death, \n     Sykes went back to the library with the victim's wife. ``It \n     was like in the movies,'' he recalled. ``We just kept opening \n     books. Then 10 minutes before closing time, I found it.''\n       Sykes unearthed an obscure federal statute that allowed the \n     defendant to be prosecuted on a civil rights violation. He \n     sent everything he found to Justice Department lawyer Richard \n     Roberts, now a federal judge in Washington, who got an \n     indictment. The defendant was convicted and received a life \n     sentence.\n       ``His seriousness of purpose was impressive,'' Roberts \n     said. ``It made answering his phone calls much more \n     attractive.''\n       Sykes had worked for or founded a variety of local victims' \n     rights groups, rarely living on more than $10,000 a year, \n     when in 2003 he read a story about Till's mother wanting her \n     son's case reopened. Two documentarians also suggested there \n     were living suspects beyond the two men, now dead, who were \n     acquitted of the 14-year-old's murder but later bragged about \n     it in an article.\n       Sykes and Donald Burger, a retired Justice Department \n     official who befriended Sykes during the school desegregation \n     case, met with Mamie Till-Mobley in Chicago and talked about \n     pursuing the case. Till-Mobley died days later, after co-\n     founding, with Sykes and others, the Emmett Till Justice \n     Campaign.\n       ``Alvin was the aggressor,'' said Wheeler Parker, 68, who \n     traveled with Till, his cousin, from Chicago to Mississippi \n     in 1955. ``Don had more contacts and knowledge, but Alvin had \n     the aggressiveness and nerve to pursue it. The fire's in his \n     belly.''\n       Sykes arranged a meeting in Oxford, Miss., with a U.S. \n     attorney, the district attorney who would prosecute the case, \n     a Till relative and documentarian Keith Beauchamp. The FBI \n     soon agreed to investigate the case for local authorities.\n       ``He was a very adept facilitator,'' recalled Jim Greenlee, \n     the U.S. attorney. ``Without his efforts, the chances for the \n     investigation being reopened would have been much less. I \n     call him a catalyst.''\n       During the Till investigation, Sykes became aware of dozens \n     of other cold cases from that era. He couldn't create a \n     justice campaign for each one, so he envisioned a unit within \n     the Justice Department with the money, resources and \n     expertise to investigate them all. He sold the idea to \n     Missouri's conservative Republican Sen. Jim Talent, who \n     introduced the so-called Till Bill in 2005.\n       Talent, who credits Sykes with the initial idea, lost re-\n     election last year, and the original bill stalled. But the \n     Emmett Till Unsolved Civil Rights Crime Act has been \n     reintroduced by Reps. Lewis and Kenny Hulshof (R-Mo.) in the \n     House and Sens. Chris Dodd (D-Conn.) and Patrick Leahy (D-\n     Vt.). It provides $11.5 million annually to look into the \n     era's unsolved murders, and political observers say its \n     chances now look good. Many give Sykes credit.\n\n[[Page S8018]]\n\n       ``He has played the role of public advocate on Capitol Hill \n     to remind legislators who may not have experienced the \n     tragedy of segregation and racial discrimination that \n     unsolved crimes against African-Americans have left an \n     intolerable stain on our democracy,'' said Brenda Jones, \n     spokeswoman for Lewis. ``He has helped remind many members of \n     Congress that we must take steps to right these wrongs.''\n       Leaving the Jackson courthouse during a break in the Seale \n     trial, which continues with jury selection this week, Sykes \n     shook his head.\n       ``I was sitting there thinking, `When I was 16, it was just \n     like this.' I was sitting in a courtroom, getting an \n     education.''\n       Sykes sometimes wishes he could return to the music \n     business, make a better living, have a better life. Living \n     off donations, some speaking fees and a book Till's mother \n     wrote that he sometimes sells out of a bag, he doesn't even \n     own a car. Friends drove him to Jackson.\n       But he says he can't leave the cause yet. There are still \n     too many low-profile cases he worries will stay lost. Even \n     the Till case languished five decades without a \n     reinvestigation.\n       ``The thing that gets me [maddest] in terms of the Till \n     case,'' he said, ``is the realization that [the two killers \n     who were acquitted on murder charges] could have been tried \n     for kidnapping before they died.\n       ``I have a chip on my shoulder about all the people more \n     knowledgeable than me who could have pursued that case. On my \n     more benevolent days, I say they just didn't know the law \n     enough. On my most cynical days, I say it was just too much \n     work.''\n\n\n                            SYKES' SUCCESSES\n\n       Sykes' behind-the-scenes maneuvering was key to the FBI's \n     reinvestigation of the 1955 murder of Emmett Till.\n       Sykes generated the idea for legislation that would create \n     a separate unit in the Justice Department devoted to civil \n     rights-era crimes.\n\n\n                           DECADES-OLD CRIMES\n\n       Since 1989, officials in Mississippi and other states have \n     taken another look:\n       29: Number of murders re-examined\n       28: Number of arrests made\n       22: Number of guilty verdicts\n                                  ____\n\n                                                    July 31, 2008.\n       Dear Senator Coburn: First allow me to extend our \n     appreciation and admiration for you and your staff for \n     assistance and communication with us concerning S. 535, the \n     Emmett Till Unsolved Civil Rights Crime Act. While we still \n     believe that the hold that you placed on our bill was not the \n     good way to effect the institutional change in the manner \n     that the United States Senate does business, we do appreciate \n     the open lines of communication and respect that your staff, \n     in particular Brooke Bacak and Tim Tardibono, have shown in \n     negotiating with us on proposed language and conditions that \n     would address your concern and minimize the loss we have \n     suffered from going this route. Therefore our Board of \n     Directors has voted to endorse a unanimous consent agreement \n     that would include the latest draft language that rectifies \n     the concerns with the controversy over the Attorney having \n     authority to reprogram funds from one congressionally \n     directed fund to another by eliminating all reference to \n     reprogramming and replacing with prioritizing spending \n     request if Congress does not fully fund the Till Bill. \n     Furthermore we support you having the right to submit this \n     language as an amendment in the cloture vote process as long \n     as the floor debate time is limited and that you would not \n     replace your hold on our bill if your amendment fails. \n     Nothing in this request is meant to criticize the Senate \n     Leadership on the enormous work that they have done to craft \n     and advocate for the passage of this bill, especially the \n     good work of Patrick Grant in Senator Dodd's office and \n     Darrell Thompson in Senate Majority leader Harry Reid's \n     office who has kept hope alive on this historic bill. However \n     we firmly believe that truth and justice can be best achieved \n     by opening and maintaining effective lines of communication \n     and searching for a win-win justice seeking solution. We \n     further believe that since you started this by placing your \n     hold on our bill, you should be the one to finish it. \n     Therefore the Emmett Till Justice Campaign, Inc. requests \n     that you make an overture to the Democratic Leadership and \n     the sponsors of the Till Bill by introducing the Emmett Till \n     Unsolved Civil Rights Crime Act, as proposed amended, under \n     the Unanimous Concent Agreement outlined above tonight in the \n     interest of time, truth and justice.\n           Sincerely, in the pursuit of justice, I am,\n\n                                                  Alvin Sykes,\n\n                                                        President,\n     Emmett Till Justice Campaign, Inc.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 25, 2007.\n     Senator Christopher J. Dodd,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chris: As you know, I have not agreed to a unanimous \n     consent request for the Senate to approve S. 535/H.R. 923, \n     not because I disagree with the well intended motives of the \n     legislation, but because it violates the principles I use to \n     evaluate every piece of legislation. I sent you and the other \n     members of the Senate a copy of these principles in February.\n       Among these principles are: If a bill creates or authorizes \n     a new federal program or activity, it must not duplicate an \n     existing program or activity; and if a bill authorizes new \n     spending, it must be offset by reductions in real spending \n     elsewhere.\n       Your bill both creates a new government program that \n     duplicates an existing program and authorizes new government \n     spending without offsetting the costs.\n       The bill authorizes $115 million over 10 years to \n     investigate murders committed before 1970 that have gone \n     unpunished. Perhaps you are unaware, but the Department of \n     Justice initiated an effort over a year ago to do just this.\n       In February 2006, a full year before you introduced your \n     bill, the U.S. Attorney General and the FBI director \n     announced a partnership with the NAACP, the Southern Poverty \n     Law Center and the National Urban League to investigate \n     unsolved crimes from the civil rights era. Attorney General \n     Alberto Gonzales has pledged that ``The Justice Department is \n     committed to investigating and prosecuting civil-rights era \n     homicides for as long as it takes and as far as the law \n     allows--because there is no statute of limitations on human \n     dignity and justice.''\n       According to the FBI, ``in February 2006, the FBI enacted \n     an initiative to identify hate crimes that occurred prior to \n     December 1969, and resulted in death.'' The Bureau's 56 field \n     offices have been directed to re-examine their unsolved civil \n     rights cases and determine which ones could still be viable \n     for prosecution. The FBI has partnered with a number of state \n     and local authorities, civic organizations, and community \n     leaders to reexamine old files. Since the initiative began, \n     the FBI has received nearly 100 such referrals. The FBI is \n     continuing to assess each referral for its investigative and \n     legal viability and, given the updated investigative and \n     forensic tools, move forward in investigating these cases.\n       The Department of Justice is not lacking resources either. \n     At the end of Fiscal Year 2006, the Department had $2.5 \n     billion in unobligated balances, which is unspent money. The \n     Department is expected to have $1.6 billion in unobligated \n     balances at the end of Fiscal Years 2007 and 2008.\n       Because the FBI is already working on this issue and the \n     Justice Department has billions of unspent dollars, I am \n     unsure why creating new government programs and authorizing \n     more than $100 million in new spending is necessary.\n       If authorizing more spending for this ongoing effort, \n     however, is necessary, we could pay for it with unspent \n     Department funds or with offsets from existing lower priority \n     spending, as I have proposed doing.\n       I realize that many members of the Senate do not care about \n     our national debt which is why it is nearly $9 trillion. Most \n     Senators, including you, voted to kill a Sense of Senate \n     resolution stating that Congress has a moral obligation to \n     offset the cost of new Government programs and initiatives. \n     You even voted to fund the infamous ``Bridges to Nowhere'' in \n     Alaska which cost half a billion dollars!\n       So while you may not concern yourself with our national \n     debt or the impact of adding to it, I do. That it why I was \n     very disappointed that you issued a press statement last week \n     claiming that I am ``delaying this bill's passage under false \n     pretense.''\n       If you really care about this issue and the economic future \n     of our nation, I would hope that you would actually discuss \n     the matter directly with me instead of holding press \n     conferences and issuing press releases. In fact, my office \n     did make an offer to your staff to find a way to pay for this \n     bill, which was rejected.\n       If you have any interest in passing this bill in a fiscally \n     responsible manner, please contact me. In the meantime, you \n     can rest assured that the Attorney General and the FBI are \n     already conducting the investigations that your bill seeks to \n     address.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Tom A. Coburn, M.D.,\n     U.S. Senator.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 19, 2008.\n     Senator Christopher J. Dodd,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Dodd: As you are aware, I am ready to enter \n     into a unanimous consent agreement on S. 535, the Emmett Till \n     Unsolved Civil Rights Crime Act. This weekend marks the \n     anniversary of the murders of three civil rights workers in \n     Mississippi, and I believe it is an opportune time for the \n     Senate to give this bill the vote it deserves. To that end, I \n     have offered four amendments for your consideration. \n     Unfortunately, until you agree to allow me to offer these \n     amendments on the floor, the Senate is prevented from moving \n     to the bill. My hope is that we can resolve this issue soon, \n     so that the Senate may consider S. 535 immediately.\n       I have always supported the admirable goal of this \n     legislation: namely, to ensure that perpetrators of heinous \n     civil rights cold case crimes are finally brought to justice. \n     I was pleased to learn of the Government's efforts to \n     identify and prosecute these crimes, initiated a full year \n     before your bill was introduced. It remains my desire to see \n     these efforts continue, but I insist that they be done in a \n     fiscally responsible manner.\n       My concerns with this bill have always involved its cost, \n     and I have worked consistently to identify possible offsets. \n     I made\n\n[[Page S8019]]\n\n     known these concerns as early as August 2006, when the \n     measure was first considered by the Senate Judiciary \n     Committee. At that time, the bill's sponsor worked with me to \n     find an agreeable offset; however, our proposals were \n     ultimately rejected by an unnamed Senator. In June 2007, I \n     had another opportunity to explain my concerns when the bill \n     again came before the Committee. Additionally, more than \n     three months before I publicly objected to your request for \n     unanimous consent to consider the bill on the floor, I sent \n     you a letter explaining in detail my position on the bill. \n     Finally, in October 2007, I offered an amendment to provide \n     $1.68 million to investigate and prosecute unsolved civil \n     rights crimes by transferring funds from other wasteful \n     programs. That amendment was defeated after a majority of the \n     Senate, including 11 of the bill's sponsors, voted to table \n     it.\n       Even if I had not been so vocal about this bill in the \n     109th Congress, the letter I sent to you and all of my Senate \n     colleagues in February 2007 should have left no doubt about \n     my position this year. That letter outlined the principles I \n     use to evaluate legislation, which include: If a bill creates \n     or authorizes a new federal program or activity, it must not \n     duplicate an existing program or activity; and if a bill \n     authorizes new spending it must be offset by reductions in \n     real spending elsewhere.\n       Because S. 535 both creates a new, duplicative government \n     program and authorizes new government spending without \n     offsetting the costs, you had ample notice--long before you \n     hotlined the bill--that I would object.\n       Because of the knowledge you had about negotiations that \n     occurred in the previous Congress, my staff's earlier failed \n     efforts to negotiate an offset with your staff, and my own \n     public statements, there has been a consistent understanding \n     of my willingness to allow the full Senate to consider S. \n     535. My only desire is to be permitted to offer amendments to \n     the bill. I regret that my position has been unfairly--and \n     incorrectly--characterized as an insurmountable obstacle to \n     final passage.\n       Although my office has not been contacted by yours (or any \n     other bill sponsors) since before the press conference you \n     held to question my intentions on this bill, I have been in \n     frequent contact with the Emmett Till Justice Campaign. That \n     Campaign is undoubtedly the bill's greatest supporter, and \n     the persistent efforts of President Alvin Sykes have outdone \n     any member of the Senate, both in character and enthusiasm. \n     It has been my privilege to work directly with Mr. Sykes, and \n     it is to his credit that so much progress has been made these \n     past few months. We could all stand to learn from his \n     example.\n       In short, the purpose of this letter is to secure your \n     commitment to a UC agreement allowing me to offer four \n     amendments to S. 535 during floor debate. If you will do so, \n     I am prepared to take up the bill immediately. Especially \n     given the timeliness of this weekend's memorials \n     commemorating the 44th anniversary of the deaths of three \n     civil rights martyrs, I see no reason for further delay.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Tom A. Coburn, M.D.,\n     U.S. Senator.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 19, 2008.\n     Senator Harry Reid,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Reid: The purpose of this letter is to \n     reiterate my willingness to enter into a unanimous consent \n     agreement allowing floor consideration of S. 535, the Emmett \n     Till Unsolved Civil Rights Crime Act. I understand that your \n     staff, along with that of the bill's sponsor, is still \n     considering the four amendments I have proposed as a \n     condition of my consent. My hope is that we can resolve this \n     issue soon, so that the Senate may consider S. 535 \n     immediately.\n       I have been disappointed in the progress of this bill. \n     Although I made known my specific concerns over the bill's \n     cost as early as August 2006, my intentions have repeatedly \n     been questioned both by members of the media and the Senate. \n     The attacks have been disingenuous, as I have always \n     supported the admirable goal of this legislation: namely, to \n     ensure that perpetrators of heinous civil rights cold case \n     crimes are finally brought to justice. Consistent with the \n     position I have taken toward all legislation authorizing new \n     spending in the 110th Congress, I exercised my right to \n     withhold consent on S. 535.\n       I have, however, always made known my willingness to work \n     with bill sponsors on identifying needed offsets. Because \n     they have been unwilling to accept my offers and have shown \n     no willingness to otherwise negotiate, the Senate must now \n     consider the bill on the floor. In order for this to happen, \n     we must reach an agreement as to time and amendments. I have \n     put forth my request for consent to offer four amendments and \n     continue to await a response.\n       Although my office has not been contacted since last year \n     by any Senator seeking to move this bill, I have been in \n     frequent contact with the Emmett Till Justice Campaign. That \n     Campaign is undoubtedly the bill's greatest supporter, and \n     the persistent efforts of President Alvin Sykes have outdone \n     any member of the Senate, both in character and enthusiasm. \n     It has been my privilege to work directly with Mr. Sykes, and \n     it is to his credit that so much progress has been made these \n     past few months. We could all stand to learn from his \n     example.\n       This weekend marks the 44th anniversary of the murders of \n     three civil rights workers in Mississippi. The occasion makes \n     consideration of this bill especially timely, and I want to \n     make clear that I support prompt consideration. Please give \n     me a response on my request to offer four amendments so that \n     the Senate is able to take up S. 535 as soon as possible.\n           Thanks,\n                                              Tom A. Coburn, M.D.,\n                                                     U.S. Senator.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Senate Accomplishments\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, in 2004, when I was selected by my peers as \nthe Democratic leader, the first public appearance I made following the \nvote we had, I walked out to the press and said I would rather dance \nthan fight. I still feel that way. I was elected to the Senate because \nthe people of Nevada knew I was a good Democrat but that I always would \neagerly reach across the table and find common ground wherever \npossible. I guess I learned that in the courtroom in working cases. You \nhave to be willing to compromise in the law, as you do in politics. I \nhave a strong conviction, that is true.\n  There is no better example of that than my relationship with John \nEnsign. John Ensign, the junior Senator from Nevada, and I had a bitter \nrace in 1998. He was a Member of Congress. I was a sitting Senator. He \nran against me. That was a close race. No one ever thought we would \nwind up in the Senate together, but as fortune spins, Senator Bryant \nunexpectedly decided not to run for reelection, and John Ensign was \nable to come to the Senate.\n  For 8 years, we have worked to develop a relationship that has turned \ninto a strong friendship. John Ensign and I, though we disagree on some \npolitical issues, never, ever publicly or privately discuss our \ndifferences politically.\n  I mention that because we need in the Senate to work together. Even \nthough we may have different political views on different aspects of \nGovernment, we need to work together. It may not be apparent to those \nwho watch the daily skirmishes of the Senate from afar, but I try to \napproach every issue in this Congress with the same eagerness to find \ncommon ground that I do working with Senator Ensign.\n  There have been occasions--not often enough--where Republican \ncolleagues have joined Democrats in the pursuit of progress. When they \nhave chosen that path, we have, together, accomplished some very good \nthings for the American people, even in this work period, which has \nseen some bitter partisanship. While it will be remembered probably for \nthe Republican obstructionism that has occurred, we can still look and \nfind examples of significant bipartisan compromise.\n  At a time when we see such interesting things around the country that \nneed so much help, we have been able to pass legislation in one area of \ngreat concern: housing. We passed a comprehensive housing bill. The \nhousing crisis has been uprooting families and wreaking havoc in \nneighborhoods across the country for far too long. It was a struggle to \nget this bill passed. Never in the history of the country, I am told, \nhas there been a bill that has passed the Congress where we have had \nseven filibusters on one bill--the same bill--at the same time. We had \none filibuster right after the other, seven of them, but we finally got \nto the finish line on housing. It is a good piece of legislation. Some \n8,500 families who receive foreclosure notices every day will not be \nconfronted with that in many instances because of the legislation we \npassed.\n  During this work period, we also passed the Medicare doctors fix--the \nsalvation of Medicare is what it was--and we did that by overriding the \nsenseless veto by the President of the United States. We were only able \nto do that because right down here stood Senator Ted Kennedy, a man who \nshould not have been here. He was not supposed to be flying. He wasn't \nsupposed to be around crowds, and of course there were lots of crowds \nthat\n\n[[Page S8020]]\n\nwere here--everyone wanted to be around him--and he stood here and cast \nthe deciding vote that broke the impasse. We had 60 votes. After we got \n60 votes, the Republicans in good will joined and allowed us to save \nMedicare. It took the courage of Ted Kennedy, rising from his sick bed \nagainst doctors' orders, to cast the deciding vote. Because he did, and \nenough Republicans joined with us, we renewed the long-held American \npromise that the elderly, the disabled and the orphans and widows will \nreceive the health care they need.\n  We also passed, during this work period, a bill that is a test to \nAmerica's charity and moral authority in the world, the so-called \nPEPFAR bill. This legislation provides an unprecedented level of \nsupport for the fight against AIDS in Africa. It is not often I have \noccasion to praise the President, but he did a good job on this, and I \ncommend him for helping us. I am glad that even after we had struggles \nfor months at a time, Senate Republicans joined with the President and \nSenate Democrats to choose to end their obstruction and allow us to \npass that legislation.\n  Late yesterday, we wrapped up work on an important piece of \nlegislation. We did it at the end of this work period. In fact, we did \nit on two important pieces of legislation: consumer product safety and \nthe higher education bill, both very important pieces of legislation. \nAt a time when parents are rightly more concerned than ever about the \nsafety of the toys they buy for their children, the consumer product \nsafety legislation gives parents and all consumers new assurance that \nthe goods we buy are fully tested and approved for safe use. That \napplies to the stereotype, which is the toys the children use in \nAmerica, but it is far broader than that. With rare exception, it is \neverything we consume in America today now will be safe.\n  The Higher Education Act had not been reauthorized in some 10 years \nuntil last night. Of course, it was long overdue, but since we passed \nit, millions of bright young American minds will have the opportunity \nto unlock the doors of opportunity a college education provides.\n  Our country will be stronger for every one of the bills we passed \nthis work period--every one of them. I wish we had passed a lot more. \nThose we did are important. I am glad we did it. As with any \nlegislation, when you pass a bill, there are lots of accolades to be \npassed around. When you don't pass a bill, there is a lot of blame to \ngo around.\n  I feel a lot of disappointment, though, when I think back upon this \nwork period and wonder what might have been, what might we have \naccomplished if our Republican colleagues had decided to dance with us \nmore often than fight. We could have gone a long way toward solving \nAmerica's energy crisis. Yesterday was a microcosm for why the Senate \nfailed to do so. Democrats came to the floor to offer seven different \nenergy initiatives. Our plan would tackle every piece of the energy \npuzzle: Increasing supply with more domestic production, meaning \nincreasing supply with more American production; reducing demand by \ninvesting in clean and renewable alternatives; going after those who \nkeep oil prices artificially high for their own financial gain; and \nhelping those in need pay their skyrocketing heating bills.\n  Earlier today, a group of 10 Senators--5 Republicans, 5 Democrats--\nindicated they had done some work to come up with a proposal that they \nthink would help the energy crisis. I have been kept informed of how \nthis has been progressing, and I am glad they have worked on what they \ndid. They have worked very hard. There are many good ideas. Do I agree \nwith everything they did? No, I don't agree with everything, but even \nthe 10 don't agree with everything in the package.\n  I look forward to working with them. We are going to work with this \ngroup in a number of different ways. First of all, the information we \ngot from them is important. I am going to hold a summit in Las Vegas on \nAugust 19--an energy summit, a clean energy summit. President Clinton \nwill be there, Mayor Bloomberg, T. Boone Pickens, the Governors of \nUtah, Arizona, Colorado. We have people from the private sector, the \npublic sector coming to talk about what we can do to wean ourselves \nfrom fossil fuel.\n  Also, the week we get back in September, we are going to have an \nenergy summit of Democrats, a bipartisan energy summit, to see if there \nis any way we can work together to move forward--move forward on things \nthat are so important to this country, such as having multiple year \nenergy tax credits so we can wean ourselves from the fossil fuels and \nlook to the Sun, the wind, and geothermal for our energy. I certainly \nhope we can do that.\n  Republicans have said no to every proposal we have made. Because they \ndid, the American people will have to wait for short- and long-term \nsolutions to the energy crisis. That truly is unfortunate.\n  With more Republican cooperation, we could have passed mental health \nparity. That is so important. It is a bipartisan bill to ensure equal \naccess to health care for people with mental illness. We were prevented \nfrom doing that.\n  With more Republican cooperation, we could have passed a package of \n13 bipartisan bills that Republicans blocked. That package includes the \nEmmett Till unsolved crimes bill which would help heal old wounds and \nprovide the Department of Justice and the FBI tools needed to \neffectively investigate and possibly solve civil rights-era murders.\n  The Runaway and Homeless Youth Act would provide grants for health \ncare, education and workforce programs and housing programs for runaway \nand homeless youth.\n  The combating child exploitation bill would provide grants to train \nlaw enforcement to use technology to track individuals who trade in \nchild pornography and establish an Internet crimes against children \ntask force.\n  The Christopher and Dana Reeve Paralysis Act would enhance \ncooperation in research, rehabilitation, and quality of life with \npeople who suffer from paralysis.\n  LIHEAP, a bill that was called Cool In Summer, Warm In Winter Act to \nprovide relief to the aged, the disabled, and the poor so they can have \nenergy assistance to cool their homes in summertime, heat their homes \nin the wintertime--the Republicans turned it down.\n  We were amazed that Republicans said no to these bills and many \nothers, but they did, and that is unfortunate.\n  The list of critical priorities we could have done something about \nwith even a small degree of Republican cooperation is no longer \navailable to us now. It would have been nice if we could have done the \nlist. The list of things we copuld have done is far longer than I can \nrecite today, but I say that because Republicans chose the path of \nobstruction. The good we did is far outweighed by the good that could \nhave been. Of course, that is disappointing to all of us.\n  When you strip away the differences between the McCain Republican \napproach to energy and the Democratic approach to high gas prices, you \nfind the Republican policy is the Exxon policy, and our policy is an \nenergy policy. The Republicans have a one-word policy: drill. That is \nthe Exxon policy. Our approach, the Democratic approach is No. 1, drill \nwhere appropriate, but also develop competition for oil by encouraging \nsolar, wind, geothermal. The Republicans say no because it will lower \noil prices, and that is not what Exxon wants. Our policy is to increase \nthe supply now by releasing oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. \nThe Republicans say no because it will lower oil prices and that is not \nwhat Exxon wants.\n  No. 3, we say go after financial speculators. The Republicans say no \nbecause that would lower the price of oil, and that is not what Exxon \nwants.\n  No. 4, we say invest in new car battery technology. The Republicans \nsay no because that will lower oil prices, and that is not what Exxon \nwants.\n  The Republicans' affection for Exxon explains why they say no to even \nallowing us to debate issues that are so important. No, no, no is what \nExxon wants--to keep oil prices high.\n  That is too bad.\n  When we return in September, we need to get right back to work. We \nhave just a few weeks to get a lot done. Perhaps by then, though, the \npolitical winds will blow in a different direction, and the Republicans \nwill return with a new willingness to work together. If they do, we can \nwork out a bipartisan plan on energy that meets our country's near- and \nlong-term needs.\n\n[[Page S8021]]\n\n  We can send the American people a new economic stimulus bill to help \nfamilies make ends meet and strengthen an economy that has now lost \njobs every month this year.\n  We can pass the Defense authorization bill that provides our military \nwith the funds they need to keep our country safe. It takes care of \nthose who serve us bravely with an across-the-board 3.9-percent \nmilitary pay raise and major investments in the physical safety and \nmental health of our troops, not the least of which is attempting to \nrebuild the military which is in a state of distress because of the \nIraq war.\n  We can pass a Military Construction/Veterans Affairs appropriations \nbill to maintain and upgrade military facilities, build better military \nfamily housing, and ensure the care our veterans deserve.\n  We can pass a Defense appropriations bill to keep our Armed Forces \nprepared for combat and peacetime missions, relieve the strain of \nconstant 12- and now 15-month deployments, and support highly \nclassified initiatives in the fight against terrorism.\n  With the Presidential election drawing near, our time will be short. \nBut with new cooperation from our Republican colleagues, we can do all \nthis--and pass several other important bipartisan bills already passed \nby the House of Representatives.\n  So I wish all my colleagues well in their August travels. I know we \nare all weary from the long, difficult work period.\n  I also know the fights that await our return won't be easy. I hope a \nmonth back home will give our Republican colleagues a new appreciation \nfor how America needs badly the changes they have blocked.\n  Our hands remain outstretched. Our eagerness to seek common ground \nremains as strong as ever. We will fight if we must, but we would much \nrather dance.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today, joined by my colleagues \nSenators Lieberman, Reed, and Whitehouse, to mark the 50th anniversary \nof a momentous occasion in our Nation's maritime history, an occasion \nthat truly launched the American Navy into the Nuclear Age. On August \n3, 1958, the USS Nautilus, the world's first nuclear powered submarine, \nbecame the first vessel to travel under the North Pole. The intrepid \ncrewmen of the Nautilus received a Presidential Unit Citation for their \nservice, and Operation Sunshine, as it was called, provided a powerful \nboost to American morale following the Soviet launch of Sputnik. Today, \nwe mark this important milestone with a resolution honoring the \nNautilus's historic feat.\n  The USS Nautilus's Arctic voyage was a remarkable feat of American \nnaval engineering, demonstrating the evolution of submarines from slow \nunderwater ships to warships that could submerge for many weeks and \ntravel through varied depths and conditions, maintaining travel speeds \nof 20-25 knots. Submarines, as was proven that day, would pursue \nunconventional courses to achieve incredible results, in this case, \ntraveling a much shorter distance than was thought possible, to reach \nstrategically important destinations on the other side of the globe.\n  But most important, it marked a major milestone for our nuclear Navy, \nwhich would lead to other developments, such as submarines powered by \nsingle pressurized water reactors, and an aircraft carrier, USS \nEnterprise, powered by eight reactor units in 1960.\n  While the Nautilus's successful voyage was an inspiration to all \nAmerica, it serves a particularly important point of pride to our \nsubmariners, as well as the engineers and shipbuilders of the Electric \nBoat Division of General Dynamics, who have built our Nation's nuclear \nsubmarines in Connecticut for more than four decades. As a young boy, I \nattended the launch of the USS Nautilus in Groton, CT; and had the \nhonor to witness my late mother christening the USS Stimson. My first \ncousin, Bill McAree, was one of the chosen few to serve in the nuclear \nsubmarine force under Admiral Rickover, and for 34 years, I have had \nthe distinct pleasure of representing the home State of our Nation's \npremier undersea warfare facilities, including Naval Submarine Base New \nLondon.\n  As we commemorate the 50th anniversary of this important voyage, we \nmust also look forward to the future of American naval power. As \nnations around the world continue to enlarge their own submarine \nfleets, the U.S. ability to travel freely and swiftly beneath the waves \nrepresents a critically important component of U.S. seapower. Today, \nour submarine fleet is contributing invaluable surveillance and \nreconnaissance to our warfighters, and providing an important platform \nfor operations in what the Navy calls ``the littorals,'' or coastal \nareas. Our military has no more stealthy means for delivering power \nthan the submarine, carrying Navy SEAL teams to enemy territory \nundetected, or traveling to specific locations to launch cruise \nmissiles. Submarines are not merely weapons of war, they are tools of \nstatecraft, providing critical intelligence to policymakers and serving \nas a critical deterrent to promote stability throughout the globe. And \nit is submarines' demonstrated ability to traverse the world \nundetected, at any point in the ocean, even the North Pole, that makes \nthe work of our silent service, our submariners, so critically \nimportant to our national security.\n  As we look back on the first 50 years of America's nuclear submarine \nprogram, the United States must be ready to continue the great legacy \nof the USS Nautilus, its crewmen, shipwrights, and designers, and \nremain in the forefront of submarine development.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/08/01/senate-section/article/S8021-4", "month": "08", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8021]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         COSPONSORSHIP--S. 3406\n\n  Mr. HATCH.

CODY\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. I rise to commend GEN Richard A. Cody, the Vice Chief of \nStaff of the Army, on his retirement. General Cody is one of the \nNation's finest military officers, and, with a career that spans over \n36 years in the Army, he leaves behind a stronger, more experienced, \nand more professional fighting force. Vermont is proud to call General \nCody a native, and there is little doubt that his time growing up in \nour State capital, Montpelier, instilled in him a deep sense of loyalty \nand public service.\n\n[[Page S8022]]\n\n  From the day of his commissioning to his last formal day in the \nservice, General Cody made an indelible mark as an aviator, not just as \nan officer who could wield an Apache or Blackhawk with impressive \nprecision and skill, but as a leader who inspired other aviators and \nmaintainers to do their best. He competently led such prestigious and \ncapable aviation units as the 160th Special Operations Regiment and the \n101st Airborne Division. In the early stages of the first gulf war, he \nheaded up one of the earliest and strategically critical aerial \nattacks, paving the way for subsequent air and ground forces. He \namassed an impressive 5,000 hours of flight time.\n  It was that quality to inspire and to lead through example that \nelevated General Cody to the higher ranks of the U.S. Army. His service \nas the Vice Chief of Staff has coincided with ongoing wars in Iraq and \nAfghanistan, and he has helped the Army restructure and reequip itself \nfor that challenging undertaking. He has always been open about the \nArmy's needs, clearly informing the service's civilian leaders, the \nmedia, and Congress about the tools necessary to carry out its \nmissions. He has been involved in some vigorous debates in the \nPentagon, out of which emerged sensible approaches to activation and \nequipping of the Reserves, including the National Guard. He always has \nin mind his view--built through that experience and knowledge--of what \nis best for the Army and the country. He is an articulate spokesperson \nand fierce advocate.\n  General Cody has always kept one foot in Vermont where his family has \nsuch strong roots, particularly around Montpelier where he was born and \nraised. Few in the State have not purchased a car at Cody Chevrolet, \nwhich is owned and operated by the General's family. He and his lovely \nwife Vicki have two proud sons, Capt. Clint Cody and Capt. Tyler Cody, \nboth Apache pilots in the Army. His immediate family has had the chance \nto spend considerable time in the State, experiencing the deep \npatriotism that runs through the Green Mountains and the Champlain \nValley. It was only fitting that Norwich University, the Nation's \noldest military academy, recently honored General Cody.\n  General Cody has been open about the challenges that the Army faces. \nHis forthright manner is matched only by the quiet energy he brings to \ntackling problems aggressively.

Mr. President, I am proud to join Senator Kennedy and \nother Senators in the introduction of this legislation. The bill that \nwe introduced yesterday will correct a decision of the Supreme Court \nthat misconstrued the intent of Congress and cut off access to our \nNation's courts for citizens injured or killed by defective medical \ndevices.\n  The Senate Judiciary Committee held a hearing on June 11 to examine \nthe way in which the Supreme Court's decisions in the areas of \nretirement benefits and consumer product safety have consistently \ntrended against the rights of consumers and in favor of big business. \nIn many cases that have profound effects on the lives of ordinary \nAmericans, the Court has either ignored the intent of Congress, or \nsided with a Federal agency's flawed interpretation of a congressional \nstatute's preemptive froce to disadvantage consumers.\n  It is regrettable that an anonymous Republican Senator objected on \nprocedural grounds to the committee completing that hearing. And it is \ndisappointing that the same party that engages in so much partisan \nrhetoric complaining about activist judges refuses to hear about the \njudicial activism when it comes from the judges whose activism they \nembrace as sound judicial philosophy. The impact of the decisions that \nwere the focus of that hearing are being felt by Americans today, \nwhether they are prohibited from seeking redress in the courts for an \ninjury caused by a defective product, or left without remedies to \nenforce rights granted by Congress relating to nondiscrimination, or \nretirement and health care benefits.\n  The bill we introduce today is an important step to correcting the \nSupreme Court's erroneous reading of Congress' intent in enacting the \nmedical device amendments of 1976. Where the Court reaches to the \nextent it did in the Riegel decision to find Federal preemption \ncontrary to what Congress intended, Congress is compelled to act. This \nlegislation will make explicit that the preemption clause in the \nmedical device amendments that the Court relied upon does not, and \nnever was intended to preempt the common law claims of consumers \ninjured by a federally approved medical device.\n  As I noted in the Judiciary Committee's recent hearing, many of the \nCourt's decisions that have the most far reaching impact on Americans' \nwallets, retirement and health benefits, or access to justice, are the \nleast publicized. But Americans should be deeply concerned when \ndecisions of the Supreme Court override the policy judgments made by \ntheir elected representatives in Congress and negatively affect their \nday-to-day lives in significant ways. The extraordinary power to \npreempt State law and regulation lies with Congress alone. And as the \nSupreme Court has said on many occasions, the fundamental inquiry into \nwhether a Federal statute preempts State law is the intent of Congress. \nI hope the introduction of this legislation sends the strong signal \nthat some Senators intend to hold the Court to its own often-repeated \npronouncements about this important principle.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/08/01/senate-section/article/S8022-2", "month": "08", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8022-S8023]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       THE FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION EMPLOYEE RETENTION ACT\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I was pleased to join Senator Lautenberg \nyesterday in introducing S. 3416, The Federal Aviation Administration \nEmployee Retention Act. I am supporting Senator Lautenberg in his \nefforts to correct what I believe is a very unfair process imposed upon \nemployees of the Federal Aviation Administration, FAA, by Congress.\n  Essentially, S. 3416 will correct the collective bargaining process \nCongress established for FAA employees in the FAA Reauthorization Act \nof 1996--Public Law 104-264--in which we inserted ourselves as \narbitrators in labor disputes. Under the 1996 act, if the FAA and the \nunion with whom they are in negotiation can not reach an agreement, \nthen Congress has 60 days to intervene and if we do not, the FAA is \nable to impose its terms on the employees. Mr. President, this is not \nfair, it has not worked and it is time that we correct it.\n  In addition to the widely published dispute between the FAA and the \nNational Air Traffic Controllers Association, NATCA, the Professional \nAviation Safety Specialists, PASS, also have been unable to negotiate a \nnew contract with the FAA. Furthermore, in my State of Oklahoma, there \nhas been an 8-year disagreement between the FAA and the FAA Academy \nInstructors represented by the Professional Association of Aeronautical \nCenter Employees, PAACE. It is my understanding from PAACE that FAA has \nbasically refused to come to the bargaining table, which has resulted \nin year to year extensions of an 8-year-old contract. This is not \nright.\n  The very reasonable procedure established by S. 3416 will provide \nboth sides in a labor dispute with a means to resolve disagreements by \nallowing FAA employees the same collective bargaining protections that \nemployees covered under the National Labor Relations Board currently \nhave. The bill provides the option of resolving disputes through the \nFederal Mediation and Conciliation Service or through mutual agreement \non an alternative procedure. If no agreement is reached, then matters \nof disagreements will be presented to the Federal Services Impasses \nPanel for binding arbitration.\n  Finally, the bill would require both sides go back to the negotiating \ntable for any ``personnel management system implemented'' by the FAA \nAdministrator on or after July 10, 2005. In\n\n[[Page S8023]]\n\nother words, contract negotiations between FAA, NATCA and PASS are \nrestarted with a 45-day deadline. If no agreement is reached, then \nthere is an additional 90 days for binding arbitration.\n  As a pilot I am well acquainted with the exceptional work done by the \nemployees of the FAA and I know firsthand that our aviation system is \nonly as good as these employees. They deserve the right to bargain in \ngood faith on their employment contracts. This bill will give them that \nopportunity.\n  Thank you, Senator Lautenberg, for introducing this bill, and I hope \nwe get an opportunity to debate it very soon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/08/01/senate-section/article/S8023-1", "month": "08", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8023-S8024]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    REMEMBERING SENATOR JESSE HELMS\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I join with my colleagues in the Senate and \nthe House, and with the people whose lives he touched all across the \nNation, in saying how sorry I was to learn of the passing of Jesse \nHelms on July 4. He was a remarkable man, and he has left his mark on \nthe United States that he loved so very much and the State of North \nCarolina that he served with great pride. He will not be forgotten.\n  Jesse Helms was an American in every sense of the word--one who was \nfirmly and staunchly dedicated to the principles upon which our country \nwas founded. Those principles guided him through his life and helped \nhim to make every difficult decision that confronted him in his 86 \nyears of life.\n  Jesse Helms was an established force in the Senate by the time I \narrived. As a freshman Senator I knew I had a lot to learn and I was \nable to learn a lot from him as we served together and worked on \nseveral issues that meant a great deal to us both. We didn't always \nagree, but I always found him to be a man of his word who said what he \nmeant and meant what he said. You always knew where you stood with him \nand when he said ``Yes'' you knew that you could count on him to do \nwhat he said he would.\n  Many of us come to Washington hoping to change Washington. Then, with \nthe passage of time, we find that instead of changing Washington, \nWashington has changed us. How we are changed says a lot about us and \nour commitment to the principles and values that motivated us to run \nfor the Senate in the first place.\n  That kind of change is only natural and, for many of us, the changes \nthat occur help us to see other viewpoints and perspectives and make it \npossible for us to work with Members on both sides of the aisle so we \ncan achieve common goals and work for the best interests of the United \nStates and the American people.\n  Like so many of us, Jesse Helms was changed by his experience in the \nSenate. One of the most notable examples was the President's foreign \nAIDS relief package we worked on together.\n  For years Jesse was opposed to providing any assistance to countries \nfighting the AIDS epidemic. Some thought he would always oppose any \nkind of relief. Then, Bono, who is a powerful advocate for the cause, \nmade an appointment to see Jesse Helms so he could share the human side \nof the problem with him.\n  I guess no one had been able to put a human face on the AIDS epidemic \nfor him before. However Bono was able to do it, he was able to touch \nJesse's heart and convince him that the need was real--and the right \nthing to do. In response, Jesse was big enough to admit that he had \nbeen wrong. After Bono's presentation, Jesse decided to work on a \nproposal that would provide the needed funds to fight AIDS in Africa. \nThe proposal was passed and signed into law, and thanks in part to his \nsupport, countless lives were saved. It is no coincidence that the \nreauthorization of this legislation that he worked so hard to pass was \nrecently enacted into law by President Bush. It is a part of his legacy \nthat will continue on after him and make a difference all over the \nworld for many years to come.\n  That is but one facet of his character, and one we are all familiar \nwith. And, now that he has been taken from us, we will all take with us \nmany more memories that come from our service with Jesse Helms in the \nSenate.\n  A lot of what we remember about Jesse Helms and his service in the \nSenate would surprise those who only knew him by reputation because \npeople thought he was a tough guy. But when you met him, you quickly \ncame to see that he was a friendly person. He enjoyed greeting the \ntourists he met in the Halls and he made them all feel welcome because \nhe always had a kind word for everyone he met. Those who worked here in \nthe Capitol liked him because he treated them all with kindness and \nrespect.\n  At the top of Jesse's list were those who work with us to help the \nHouse and Senate function as it should--especially the pages. I don't \nthink Jesse Helms ever missed a chance to say ``Thank you!'' to the \npages for their service to the Congress. That was just one of the ways \nthat Jesse honored the Senate's traditions and respected the office he \nwas elected to hold.\n  I remember a story he told me about his first Senate race. The \ncampaign was in full swing, but Jesse's numbers didn't look too good. \nThen one day he ran into a fellow Mason who handed him a Masonic lapel \npin. ``Here,'' he said. ``Wear this during your campaign and I \nguarantee you that you will win.''\n  He took his friend's advice and wore the pin every day. Then, when \nthe votes were counted, Jesse was the newly elected Senator from North \nCarolina.\n  He told me that story while we were in the cloakroom and I was \nwatching him put a new back on the pin that now showed a lot of use. I \ntold him that I was a Mason, too. As he put the pin back on his lapel, \nhe told me that he had worn that pin every day since his friend gave it \nto him during that first Senate campaign.\n  As I came to know him, I saw that Jesse and I shared a great fondness \nand appreciation for the youth organizations that are recognized by the \nCongress. He knew that they were teaching our kids things they weren't \ngoing to be getting any other way. He knew that these groups were \nhelping our kids learn how to be good citizens and good students and to \nstand up for the things they believed in. He knew that they were \nhelping to prepare our young people for the challenges they would face \nin school and later, in life.\n  One organization we both worked to support was the Boy Scouts. He was \na strong supporter of Scouting and he stood up for them whenever they \nwere unfairly criticized or attacked. His response to each attack was \nto craft a bill that protected the promotion of volunteerism, values \nand faith to ensure those valuable lessons would continue to be taught \nto the Scouts.\n  That is just one example of Jesse's commitment to the values that \nmeant so very much to him. That is why he was able to get a lot of \nthings done over the years. His success was based on his strong \nfoundation of values and beliefs that he would stand fast on and that \nwas enough for him to win on most occasions. Watching him in action on \nthe floor or in committee taught me that conviction counts, especially \nwhen you are firm and comfortable in what you believe.\n  Jesse was a kind, soft spoken, effective, persistent and successful \nindividual. He paid attention to people and they responded to him--in \nNorth Carolina and across the country. Another of his great political \nsecrets was his understanding that a problem always appears bigger if \nit is your own. That's why the people of his State sent him back to the \nSenate for five terms. He listened to the people of North Carolina, he \nunderstood them, and he made their problems his own.\n  Now that the last chapter of his life has been written, Jesse Helms' \nrecord speaks for itself. It reflects the fact that he was never \nconcerned with being popular or taking positions because they mirrored \nthe results of the latest poll. His focus was always on doing what was \nright--because it was the right thing to do. I think he owes his \nperspective on life to some advice his father gave him that helped to \nshape his character and point him toward his destiny. Jesse would often \nshare his father's words with others, ``The Lord does not require you \nto win, but he does require you to try.''\n  Jesse never forgot what his father told him. In fact, he lived those \nwords by putting them into practice every day. No matter the odds or \nhow impossible the situation was, Jesse stayed true to the life lesson \nhis father taught him many years ago.\n  Now that he has been taken from us, it will be for others to judge \nhis place\n\n[[Page S8024]]\n\nin history and the impact his life had on the Nation. Whatever is \ndecided, for me and for so many others, the record will show that Jesse \nHelms didn't always win, but he never let the fear of losing keep him \nfrom fighting for a cause he believed in. For Jesse Helms, the glory \ncame not from victory, but from giving all he had in a noble effort in \nsupport of a worthy cause.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/08/01/senate-section/article/S8024-1", "month": "08", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8024-S8025]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                IDAHOANS SPEAK OUT ON HIGH ENERGY PRICES\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, in mid-June, I asked Idahoans to share with \nme how high energy prices are affecting their lives, and they responded \nby the hundreds. The stories, numbering over 1,000, are heartbreaking \nand touching. To respect their efforts, I am submitting every e-mail \nsent to me through energy_prices@crapo.senate.gov to the Congressional \nRecord. This is not an issue that will be easily resolved, but it is \none that deserves immediate and serious attention, and Idahoans deserve \nto be heard. Their stories not only detail their struggles to meet \neveryday expenses, but also have suggestions and recommendations as to \nwhat Congress can do now to tackle this problem and find solutions that \nlast beyond today. I ask unanimous consent to have today's letters \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n       I am a firm believer that Americans need to find \n     alternatives to foreign oil and reliance on fossil fuels. \n     But, instead of more domestic production, I believe Americans \n     need to diversify in their approach, and not simply rely on \n     alternative places to find oil and fossil fuels. Instead, the \n     focus should be upon ingenuity, for example instead of water \n     producing electricity, why not windmills, or wind energy? I \n     grew up seeing fields of windmills on drives from Los Angeles \n     to Palm Springs. Also, Boise is one of the most bicycle \n     friendly cities, although you'd never know it by commuting on \n     our poor streets that have completely ineffective bicycle \n     commuting lanes. Instead of oil and gasoline, encourage \n     people to bike to work by offering an expanded commuter tax \n     credit. And, we have absolutely NO public transportation \n     system. Why not focus on a systematic expansion of public \n     transportation? As for home electricity and the like, why not \n     an expanded tax credit on ``going green?'' I learned about \n     the energy certification for your home when my family was \n     building our new house, but it costs almost $3,000 to get \n     your home tested to qualify for the tax credit, which is not \n     worth it. Plus, energy efficient appliances and technology \n     generally costs more. Why isn't such technology more cost \n     effective? Why are we not encouraged to do more? If green \n     technology costs more, in order to encourage its use and \n     mainstream applications, there has to be financial \n     encouragement to install it in order to offset the high up-\n     front costs.\n       As for transportation, this summer, I cannot afford to buy \n     a new car, even though I am a solid middle class citizen. \n     Food prices have skyrocketed for my family, I have to pay for \n     daycare for the summer, and I own a 10-year-old gas guzzling \n     SUV, which is probably not worth much on a trade in anymore \n     what with the high gas prices. But I live only 2 miles from \n     work. The lack of public transportation has forced me to \n     consider a different alternative, and that is biking to work. \n     I am lucky because my employer (the federal government, by \n     the way) is required to provide lockers and shower facilities \n     on site, so I can bike in, shower, and go to work. I have \n     encouraged my children to join me, and they are biking with \n     me to summer camp as well. Unfortunately, this is the first \n     summer I have been able to do this, because transporting my \n     children to daycare was just about impossible without a car \n     before this. Yet, most other nations have alternative \n     transportation, and a totally different day care system, and \n     because cycling is the norm it is much safer. I think the \n     problem is deeper than just gas or oil prices. It is our own \n     selfishness that has gotten us here, because we have never \n     been forced to consider the alternatives.\n       I hope that a comprehensive approach to this problem will \n     be focused on, instead of just a quick financial fix for \n     segments of the population. It is hurting us all. And until \n     Congress and our nation focuses on the more widespread \n     issues, our approach to everyday life won't change. Because \n     it is not just energy costs . . . it is more than that, and \n     God forbid Congress forgets about the other problems, such as \n     health care, child care, education, affordable housing, and \n     the lack of appropriate services for those that are now \n     falling behind because wages cannot keep up.\n     Kirsten.\n                                  ____\n\n       As a kid, Congress said they were solving an `energy-\n     crisis,' and by the time I could drive, cars would get 100 \n     mpg, jet-packs would be available by 1975, there would be a \n     resort at ``LunaCity'' on the Moon by 1980, Mars by 1990, and \n     Alpha Centauri by 2000.\n       Today, Congress says they are `solving' an `energy-crisis,' \n     and if I just `believe' in them, I will be `delivered' from \n     the valleys of shadows and death.\n       Please note, Mr. Karzai's diversion of cross-border \n     Pakistani Talibani `marauding-hoards,' and the House of \n     Saud's past-due promises to pump more oil, while Congress \n     spins their wheels-in-wheels-in-wheels of deceptions, is not \n     `solving' anything. Use of strategic reserves at this \n     critical juncture is probably not a wise move, although I \n     wish for the Clinton days of $0.89 cent/gal diesel. Your \n     entire branch of government is completely out of control. \n     THAT is the solution.\n     Clayton, Priest River.\n                                  ____\n\n       I have 4 teenage boys that are big and are growing fast. \n     The increased energy costs have significantly increased the \n     cost of almost all goods. Most noticeably, our food bill has \n     nearly doubled since the first of the year. We are \n     desperately looking for any means to economize.\n       Although I am able to ride my bike to work and have taken \n     several steps to minimize our fuel bills, we are feeling the \n     crunch of increased petroleum costs. We have aging parents \n     that are in need of more of our attention. Unfortunately, our \n     parents are over 400 miles away, so it costs us over $180 \n     dollars to make the trip to see them and to try to help them \n     take care of their homes and properties.\n       It makes sense to me that the rising cost of fuel would \n     affect our economy. My salary is not increasing, and with the \n     cost of goods and fuel increasing, we are only able to make \n     ends meet by not buying other things. This trend would seem \n     to hurt other businesses that are depending on people like me \n     to be buying their goods.\n       I am an Electrical Engineer and I am very disturbed over \n     the push to skip nuclear power and move solely to renewable \n     energy. The wind and solar power options available today will \n     not meet our energy needs. Unfortunately, our country was \n     behind in providing the needed supply of energy when the \n     recent acceleration in energy costs began. I do believe that \n     renewable technologies like wind and solar can play an \n     important role in meeting future energy needs, but I think we \n     need to provide a plan that sees these technologies mature \n     and become less expensive through manufacturing advances. I \n     believe we need to develop nuclear and clean-burning coal as \n     stop-gap measures to allow the renewable technologies to \n     advance to the point where they are more cost effective. If \n     we try to move strictly to renewable energy sources, I am \n     concerned that we will face energy shortages, or will further \n     reduce consumer spending power by having to put our money in \n     the more expensive renewable energy sources.\n     Gene.\n                                  ____\n\n       This is one subject I completely agree with you on. The \n     U.S. Congress has to act to allow drilling where we know we \n     have oil reserves. The stupidest statement I have ever heard \n     from Congress, which I have recently heard repeatedly, is \n     that we cannot solve our energy crisis by drilling. That is \n     about like saying we cannot solve a food shortage by planting \n     more crops!\n       Last month I spent over $760 on gasoline and my wife spent \n     several hundred [dollars] also. We do not have the option of \n     using public transportation and we need larger vehicles on \n     our farms. As a farmer, while currently enjoying good prices, \n     we are seeing a big chunk of the increased income eaten up in \n     fuel costs. If crop prices were to return to ``normal'' \n     levels, it would devastate Idaho farms. Thanks for your help \n     on this important issue.\n     Keith, Blackfoot.\n                                  ____\n\n       Honestly, I do not want to tell a story about how I am \n     affected by high energy prices--it is obvious. I think the \n     last thing we need is to talk about it more. The ways to \n     lower prices are out there and the Congress knows it. Just \n     get it done. Just as communism caused us to fight with all \n     our American might at home and around the world to \n     preserve our nation, so also must we view our nation's \n     energy as a cause worth pursuing with all our sweat and \n     synapses. If not, our nation will lose the strength, the \n     hope, the dream that has raised so many generations of \n     Americans before.\n       Please, please do not talk anymore. Do something. You \n     should receive many reply emails. Several will have great \n     ideas (wind, solar, hydrogen, nuclear, oil). Pick the ideas \n     with the most promise and encourage their production and then \n     stay out of those geniuses' way and watch what the American \n     people can do.\n     Josh, Idaho Falls.\n                                  ____\n\n       Too many people have this backwards. Most agree there is a \n     limited amount of oil we can get. We need to save our \n     reserves and use up the foreign oil first. Then when the \n     foreign oil is nearly used up we will still have some to aid \n     in the transition to other sources or energy. Save our oil \n     and use up foreign oil first.\n       The last one standing with some oil wins.\n     Carl.\n                                  ____\n\n       I am an Idaho Farmer. I have been deeply concerned about \n     the prices of fuel in Idaho. The price of fuel has affected \n     the cost of almost every aspect of farming from fertilizer to \n     chemicals, tires, etc. The list goes on and on. The price of \n     labor has all gone up because people cannot afford to work \n     for less. My generation might be the last generation of \n     farmers in Idaho. I personally have two sons\n\n[[Page S8025]]\n\n     and have encouraged them to find another way to make a living \n     because the cost of starting up and the cost of farming are \n     too prohibitive. There is no way that they can make it with \n     the price of fuels. I guess my story is that the family farm \n     is on its way out of Idaho. The families of America hold this \n     nation together. If you break up the family, the United \n     States will break as well. I guess the only way to get \n     Congress to do anything is to wait for their stomachs to \n     growl. Otherwise, if you eat you are involved in farming. No \n     farms--no food!\n     Lorn.\n                                  ____\n\n       First, thank you for some leadership on this issue. I will \n     be brief. My family and I just completed an auto trip to \n     Montana and back. Fuel costs were averaging $4.05/gallon of \n     regular. The costs of travel will have a significant effect \n     on my family's recreation this year. We also have a small \n     airplane and AV gas is now $6.30 in our area meaning it now \n     costs $63.00 per hour just in fuel costs to fly the airplane \n     my family and I have enjoyed for years. Unfortunately at \n     these prices our boating costs have risen considerably. \n     Grocery costs have risen. Freight costs are going up along \n     with the airfares for the airlines. The selling price for my \n     airplane and boat if I were to sell them are going down. Many \n     families are selling their RVs because they just cannot \n     afford to recreate like they used to.\n       Finally I have just retired after 31 years in my company. I \n     have a small pension and have had to cut drastically on my \n     anticipated lifestyle already. I had planned to teach flying \n     lessons as a part-time job but the marketability of flight \n     instruction may very well be priced out of the range of many \n     prospective students.\n       I feel that the government and Congress have had since 1972 \n     to get a grip on this problem and have done nothing except \n     band-aid and pass the buck. We need to get real, drill \n     whenever and wherever we need to immediately and reverse our \n     current bad policy on nuclear energy. We cannot remain \n     forever relying on petroleum but we need cogent policies to \n     help us get to the next best thing for our energy needs.\n       We also need to put a cap on the speculating by the \n     commodity traders that are driving up the prices daily. And, \n     although I hate to say it, maybe we need to regulate a few \n     more of those items that affect us working people so much on \n     a daily basis, like utilities, phone service, cable costs and \n     fuel.\n     Mike, Pocatello.\n                                  ____\n\n       Thank you for providing this forum to express my views \n     about energy prices in our fine state, their impact, and \n     solutions. I unequivocally believe that our present asset-\n     depleting condition is a direct result of 30-plus years of \n     disastrous, foolhardy legislation from Congress that has made \n     it impossible for America's brilliant innovators to make us \n     energy independent. Yes, the price of gas is leading my \n     family to really think about every trip in the car, but I do \n     not want a band-aid government solution to replace the free \n     market. The following is what I believe is critical to our \n     national security, as well as comfort at the pump:\n       (1) Deregulate and allow drilling in all its forms \n     everywhere, right now! Admit to decades of failed, self-\n     destructive policy and move on.\n       (2) Encourage, through generous incentives, the building of \n     refineries everywhere, right now!\n       (3) Remove all legislative obstacles to the building of \n     nuclear plants and encourage, through generous incentives, \n     their construction everywhere, right now!\n       Senator, what is frightening and of tremendous concern for \n     myself and many citizens, perhaps yourself as well, is our \n     global competitors, friend and foe alike, are rapidly growing \n     and tapping into their own energy sources, nuclear and \n     petroleum, and America has become weak and dependent. It is \n     sickening and dangerous. This must be reversed, immediately! \n     Congress needs to remember that American interests, both \n     short and long-term, must at all times be placed above those \n     of other countries or the so-called ``international \n     community.'' There is no one else on the globe looking out \n     for us. Senator, you need to do it. Thank you for your \n     excellent work on behalf of your constituents.\n     Michael, Post Falls.\n                                  ____\n\n       My husband and I live in the country outside of Rexburg and \n     have to drive almost ten miles to get to town. My husband is \n     a full-time college student and works part-time. I also have \n     a part-time job and it is a struggle to fill up our gas tanks \n     every few weeks. Gas prices are shooting up but our incomes \n     are as small as ever.\n       My father is a farmer and has tractors, trucks, and other \n     machinery to fuel. He has no choice. He needs those machines \n     to do his work, but it is just so expensive.\n       Something needs to be done about the cost of fuel and \n     energy and it needs to be done now! We need to stop relying \n     on other countries to fuel our cars. We need to start using \n     more alternative fuel and energy sources. We have the means \n     but do we have the motivation? I hope so.\n     Regency, Rexburg.\n                                  ____\n\n       You are correct regarding the adverse affect that the \n     rising cost of fuel has on the lives of all Americans \n     including the citizens of Idaho.\n       We must drill for oil on American soil and pump from the \n     wells we have capped, mine clean coal in Utah and elsewhere, \n     use wind for energy where it pays, create more fuel efficient \n     engines, engineer better batteries for electric cars, make \n     affordable solar power options available where possible . . . \n     and thank God for the clean source of power we get from our \n     hydro-electric dams.\n       We are a nation that was blessed by God with an abundance \n     of natural resources. However, if we don't develop them and \n     use what we have been provided with, and yet continue to \n     complain, we are fools.\n       The cost of fuel is showing its effect on our small \n     business in that orders are down and costs are up. It now \n     costs double what it did two years ago to get to and from \n     work, purchase some of our materials, and pick up those \n     materials from our suppliers. We have tried not to pass the \n     rising cost of shipping on to our customers as it is already \n     high and keeps some people from purchasing our product. \n     Therefore, we take a cut in our normal profit and that means \n     less money in our pockets to spend on other products and \n     services that we would like to have and use locally.\n       I work in town and there is absolutely no public \n     transportation available in this area. It is a small town in \n     the mountains of Idaho and I drive seven miles each way to \n     work every day. Many workers must drive ten to twenty miles \n     each way and it is eating into their family budgets. Now the \n     price of fuel is taking its toll on food costs. Prices are \n     getting ridiculously high and I cannot imagine trying to feed \n     a family these days. I believe in less government. But there \n     is something wrong with these high fuel costs; they are \n     unjustified and the government does need to get to the bottom \n     of it and put a stop to it now.\n       The last thing that should be done is to put a higher tax \n     on our fuel and energy costs. The people who suffer the most \n     from this problem are our elderly population (and disabled) \n     who are on fixed incomes. Now they must choose whether to \n     fill the oil tank (pay the electric bill) or to eat . . . we \n     have gone sadly astray from the United States of America in \n     which I grew up, and we had better get back to our roots of \n     belief and our Constitution.\n       I believe in helping others and it is a fact that Americans \n     are the most generous citizens on earth, giving to others \n     even in other nations freely on a regular basis; no nation on \n     earth gives more. However, as a country we must stop sending \n     money to other countries in the world that have problems or \n     disasters and start taking care of our own problems, \n     infrastructure, and disasters. I do not believe in socialism, \n     but we should provide for our elderly who provided for us. I \n     am sick of seeing our government pledge billions of dollars \n     of taxpayer money to countries that hate us. It is wrong and \n     foolish. . . .\n       We have got a mess on our hands. Our Congress and Senate \n     need to stand up for what is right . . . and protect and \n     defend the U.S. Constitution as they swore to do. Quit being \n     swayed by interest groups, and money. Stand for what is good \n     for our Country not what is good for their pocketbook. We \n     need some men and women with character and honor . . . I hope \n     you will be a man of character and honor and serve this \n     nation as is needed. May God bless and help you in this \n     fight.\n     Mrs. Kenneth.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/08/01/senate-section/article/S8025-1", "month": "08", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8025-S8026]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                    90TH BIRTHDAY OF MAURY ALBERTSON\n\n Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, today I honor Colorado State \nUniversity professor Maury Albertson in recognition of his 90th \nbirthday on August 30, 2008.\n  Dr. Albertson has distinguished himself in countless ways throughout \nhis extensive and renowned career. He has been a devout champion of \ncivic responsibility, a selfless servant to others, and a man who has \nchanged lives worldwide through his compassion and understanding of \nother peoples and cultures.\n  As a young professor in 1960, Dr. Albertson and his team of scholars \nand students won a contract to study the option and assess the \nlikelihood of creating an International Youth Corps, which laid the \ngroundwork for the creation of the Peace Corps. He later went on to \ncoauthor ``New Frontiers for American Youth'' that put forth the basic \ndesign for the Peace Corps.\n  Throughout his many years as a consultant for the World Bank, the \nUnited Nations Development Program, the Agency for International \nDevelopment, and others, Dr. Albertson organized and advanced \ninnovative projects involving sanitation, water resource development, \nvillage development, small industry development, and research and \neducation.\n  A true believer in the philosophy of local empowerment, Dr. Albertson \nfounded and currently serves as president of Village Earth, an \ninternational organization that has trained villages and NGOs in 15 \ncountries in the methods of sustainable village development. \nRemarkably, in 1993, Dr. Albertson\n\n[[Page S8026]]\n\nconvened an international conference on sustainable village \ndevelopment, attended by over 350 people from 34 countries. It was an \nextraordinary success.\n  In May, 2006, Colorado State University awarded Dr. Albertson an \nhonorary Doctor of Humane Letters in recognition of his exceptional \ncontributions to industry and developing nations. This was a well-\ndeserved honorary degree for Dr. Albertson.\n  Mr. President, I am proud the Senate has recognized the many \naccomplishments of Dr. Maury Albertson, a distinguished professor and \ntrue humanitarian.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/08/01/senate-section/article/S8026-1", "month": "08", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8026]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 HONORING MOUNTAIN HOME AIR FORCE BASE\n\n Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I am pleased to recognize the \noutstanding accomplishments of the 366th Fighter Wing at Mountain Home \nAir Force Base in my home State of Idaho. The Gunfighters at Mountain \nHome earned the Air Force Meritorious Unit Award for the 17-month \nperiod from January 1, 2007, to May 31, 2008. The award is presented to \nactive duty, Reserve and Guard units for exceptionally meritorious \nconduct in several areas, including outstanding services for at least \nthree months during military operations against an armed enemy, \noutstanding devotion to duty and superior performance of exceptionally \ndifficult tasks setting them apart from other units with similar \nmissions. This award was established following September 11.\n  According to the 366th Fighter Wing Commander, COL James S. Browne, \nthe Gunfighters earned this prestigious honor for exceptional conduct \nin direct support of combat operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, which \ninclude the historical deployment of Mountain Home AFB's F-15E Strike \nEagles to Bagram Airfield, Afghanistan, as well as its direct support \nof 600 close air support missions over the Iraq. I offer my \ncongratulations to all members of the 366th, and commend them on a job \nthat continues to be extremely well done. Idaho is very proud of her \nAir Force personnel, and remains honored to be the host of these men \nand women who make Idaho home during their military service. The \nGunfighters' outstanding accomplishments in earning this reward reflect \nwell on them, their units, their families and their adopted state. This \naward demonstrates, yet again, the outstanding commitment that our \nMountain Home Air Force Base airmen have to their mission, their \nexcellence in support and execution of the strategic goals of our \nmilitary mission overseas and their unwavering defense of our \nNation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/08/01/senate-section/article/S8026-2", "month": "08", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8026]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         TRIBUTE TO RETIRED BRIGADIER GENERAL KENNETH M. TAYLOR\n\n Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, all of us know what happened at \nPearl Harbor on December 7, 1941. We have seen and read about the brave \nmen and women who fought that day. Today, I rise to pay special tribute \nto one of those men, Kenneth M. Taylor a retired U.S. Air Force \nbrigadier general, a fighter pilot, war hero, and, of course, a Sooner.\n  Seventy years ago, Ken Taylor graduated from high school in Hominy, \nOK, and entered the University of Oklahoma, as a pre-law student. Like \nmany college students in 1938, he was enjoying life with his fraternity \nbrothers but could not avoid thinking about what was happening in \nEurope, the South Pacific and Asia. He believed America would be going \nto war in the next year or two and wanted his first choice should his \ncountry go to war. He joined the Army Air Corps in 1940 and graduated \nfrom the U.S. Army Air Corps Training Center at Brooks Field near San \nAntonio, TX, on April 25, 1941. Second Lieutenant Taylor requested to \nfly fighters and, in June 1941, he was assigned to the 47th Pursuit \nSquadron at Wheeler Army Airfield in Honolulu, HI.\n  After arriving at Wheeler Field, Lieutenant Taylor met another pilot, \nGeorge Welch, from Wilmington, DE, and they became close friends. \nTaylor and Welch were both assigned to fly the Curtiss P-40B Warhawk, a \nsingle-engine, single-seat, fighter and ground attack aircraft. On the \nground, they were seen as goof-offs and a nuisance to West Pointers. \nHowever, the commander of the 47th Pursuit Squadron, Captain Gordon \nAustin, said he immediately recognized their extraordinary skills as \npilots and made them flight leads.\n  About 3 a.m. on December 7, Taylor and Welch were just returning from \ntheir Saturday evening on the town. Just before 8 a.m., Taylor was \nawakened by low-flying planes and explosions. He jumped out of bed, \nquickly put on his tuxedo pants from the night before, and ran into the \nstreet to see Japanese planes firing and dropping bombs on the base. He \ncalled Haleiwa Auxiliary air field where 18 P-40B fighters were located \nand, without orders, he told the ground crews to get two P-40 fighters \narmed and ready for takeoff. Enroute to Haleiwa, Taylor and Welsh were \nstrafed by Japanese aircraft as they made their 10 mile trek to Haleiwa \nin Taylor's new Buick. At the airstrip, they climbed into their Curtiss \nP-40B Warhawk fighters and headed towards Barber's Point at the \nsouthwest tip of Oahu. Unfortunately, the aircraft only had .30-caliber \ngunnery practice ammo.\n  Initially, Taylor and Welsh saw an unarmed group of American B-17 \nFlying Fortress bombers who were arriving from the mainland but then \nspotted twelve Japanese torpedo dive bombers near Ewa Mooring Mast \nField, a Marine base near Pearl Harbor. Lieutenant Taylor shot down two \ndive bombers and was able to damage another before running out of \nammunition and returned with Welsh to Wheeler Field to rearm with .50-\ncaliber bullets. On the ground at Wheeler, several senior officers \nclimbed up on the wings of their aircraft and told them to disperse \ntheir aircraft and do not go up again. Luckily, as Lieutenant Taylor \nexplained later, a second wave of Japanese aircraft flew over and ``the \nbrass'' ran for safety. With fuel and ammo, Taylor and Welsh took to \nthe air again straight into the wave of Japanese aircraft attacking \nWheeler Field.\n  As Taylor headed for a group of Japanese aircraft, he found himself \nin the middle of a line of Japanese planes. A bullet from a plane \nbehind him came through his canopy about an inch from his head, hit the \ntrim tab, went though his left arm and exploded. One piece of shrapnel \nwent through his left arm and another piece went into his leg, ruining \nhis tux pants. Taylor reflected on the injuries in a 2001 interview, \nsaying ``It was of no consequence; it just scared the hell out of me \nfor a minute.'' A few years after the interview, he received two slugs \nfrom his crew chief that had been found behind his seat. Welch saw \nTaylor's predicament and shot down the plane on his friend's tail, \nlikely saving his life. Both pilots continued their aerial combat until \nthey had chased the Japanese planes off the north shore and again were \nout of ammunition.\n  Fourteen different American pilots were able to take off during the \nsurprise attack on Pearl Harbor and recorded 10 Japanese aircraft \nkills. Lieutenant Taylor was credited with two kills and two probables. \nOn December 13, 1941, the U.S. War Department named Lieutenants Taylor \nand Welsh as the official first two heroes of World War II and both \nwere awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross on January 8. When asked \nabout his actions that day, Taylor reflected, ``I wasn't in the least \nbit terrified, and let me tell you why: I was too young and too stupid \nto realize that I was in a lot of danger.'' Lieutenant Taylor went on \nto a record total of six career kills, designating him as a flying ace.\n  Ken Taylor served for 27 years of active duty before joining the \nAlaska Air National Guard in 1967. He has commanded at all levels, \nretiring as a brigadier general in 1971. His Pearl Harbor experience \nwas portrayed in the 1970 film ``Tora! Tora! Tora!'' and the 2001 film \n``Pearl Harbor.'' Ken passed away on 25 November 2006 just a few days \nshy of his 65th birthday. He is buried at Arlington National Cemetery.\n  I am honored to be able to present this small tribute to an American \nhero whose leadership and bravery ensured our Nation and its people \nremain free and strong. We must never forget the sacrifices of those \nwho have gone before us as well as those who are sacrificing today. I \noffer my sincere thanks and appreciation to Ken Taylor and his family \nfor his service to our great Nation.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/08/01/senate-section/article/S8027-1", "month": "08", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8027]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S8027]]\n             CONGRATULATING THE CITY OF PLYMOUTH, MINNESOTA\n\n Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I wish to congratulate the city \nof Plymouth, MN, for being named the ``Best City in America'' by the \nstaff and writers of Money Magazine.\n  Because of this recognition, the country now knows what the residents \nof Plymouth, MN, have already known: that Plymouth is an exceptional \nplace to live and grow, rich in culture and character.\n  The median household costs of single family homes in Plymouth allow \nfamilies to responsibly purchase homes that are appropriate to their \nneeds. When looking for educational or entertainment opportunities \nthough, residents of Plymouth have access to a wide array of events at \nthe Hilde Performance Center and other entertainment venues, as well as \n40 public parks, 100 miles of trails, and half a dozen large lakes to \nswim, fish, and run around. With over 104 libraries within 15 miles, it \nis no surprise that the Plymouth public school system is ranked among \nthe top three districts in a State renowned for education leadership. \nThere are also 27 colleges, universities, and professional schools \nwithin a few miles of the city, exemplifying why 83 percent of \nPlymouth's citizens attended college.\n  Plymouth is not only the best city in America because of its \nproximity to arts, education, and the outdoors, it is also home to a \nhealthy and thriving economy and active local government. The 50,000 \njobs created in the city of Plymouth aids in independent business \ndevelopment, low crime rates, and allows for greater access to heath \ncare options, so critical to Plymouth's low rates of diabetes and \nhypertension. Plymouth's local government recently led an effort to \nhave a ``green roof'' and rain gardens installed when City Hall was \nexpanded, thereby reducing greenhouse gases and mitigating the impact \nof pollution through water runoff.\n  Acknowledging this city's many successes, today I encourage other \ncommunities to follow the lead of Plymouth, MN, and encourage business \nleadership, civic investment, and community cohesiveness through its \ncommerce, government, schools, entertainment, and health care \ninitiatives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/08/01/senate-section/article/S8027-2", "month": "08", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8027]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO TOM J. MORRIS\n\n Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I would like to take a few \nminutes to reflect upon the memory of Tom J. Morris, a true hero to the \nmen and women of Louisiana. Tom died while traveling on vacation with \nhis wife Denise in Boston last Friday morning. As an individual who \nshares his commitment to civil service and the State of Louisiana, I \nwanted to honor his truly inspiring career. For the last 19 years, Tom \nwas the CEO for the United Way of Southwest Louisiana, Inc., in Lake \nCharles. In sum, he had a combined 30 years of service with the United \nWay and was considered a leader in the community of Lake Charles, \nparticularly in the wake of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. As you know, \nUnited Way is a nonprofit organization dedicated to nurturing the \nfuture generations and youth of the United States. Tom Morris was a man \nwho represented the convictions of this Nation's youth, by bringing \ntogether communities and organizations in order to solve today's \ndilemmas. Louisiana is still in the wake of the hurricanes, and his \ndedicated assistance to victims, as well as the general community, will \nbe sorely missed. His efforts to inspire young volunteers and assist in \nhurricane recovery are still considered vital to the reconstruction of \nlocal communities in Louisiana. To his family and his wife Denise, I \nextend my condolences and my prayers. Tom Morris's efforts are truly \ninspirational and will always be remembered, not only by the men and \nwomen of southwest Louisiana but by also by the Nation as a \nwhole.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/08/01/senate-section/article/S8027-3", "month": "08", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8027-S8031]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ANIVERSARY OF THE DITCHLEY FOUNDATION\n\n Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I am pleased to have the opportunity \nto pay tribute to the work of the Ditchley Foundation on the occasion \nof the 50th anniversary of its founding.\n  Since the foundation's inception in 1958, several of my colleagues, \non both sides of the aisle and in both Chambers of the Congress, have \ntaken part in the conferences held at Ditchley Park. This beautiful \n18th century country house a few miles outside of Oxford, England, was \nused as a weekend retreat by Prime Minister Winston Churchill and \nAverill Harriman, then U.S. Ambassador to Great Britain, during the \nfrequent bombings of London during World War II. Today, Ditchley Park \nis home to around a dozen conferences each year on topics of relevance \nto transatlantic relations and international policy concerns in \ngeneral. This series includes a keynote annual address given by a \ndistinguished lecturer every summer.\n  This year's lecture gathering was especially noteworthy during this \nanniversary year. Individuals from a number of fields and countries \nattended, including our former colleague in the House of \nRepresentatives, now president emeritus of New York University, Dr. \nJohn Brademas. Dr. Brademas is himself a trustee of the Ditchley \nFoundation and was for several years chairman of the American Ditchley \nFoundation.\n  The current chairman is Rita E. Hauser, president of the Hauser \nFoundation and a former member of the President's Foreign Intelligence \nAdvisory Board. Further, the executive director of American Ditchley is \nJohn J. O'Conner, vice chancellor and secretary of the State University \nof New York.\n  At the annual lecture on July 11, 2008, chairman of the Ditchley \nFoundation and former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom John Major \nmade the following introductory remarks, which I would like to share \nwith my colleagues. I ask to have the remarks printed in the Record.\n  The material follows.\n\n       ``Ditchley is one of the hidden gems of the Transatlantic \n     relationship.\n       It doesn't feature in Presidential speeches or Prime \n     Ministerial briefing. Mercifully, it is not a plaything of \n     the media: but its role as a clearing house for ideas; a \n     forum for debate and discussion; and a magnet for policy-\n     makers gives it a unique status. It is the intellectual \n     expression of `soft power' and a tribute to the pre-eminence \n     of reason and rational debate.\n       Of course--you all know that: it is why you are here. All \n     of you know Ditchley, are committed to Ditchley, care about \n     its future and have contributed generously to ensure it. For \n     that--I thank you most warmly; it is a delight to see you all \n     here this evening. My only regret is that many others--who \n     also care for Ditchley and have been enormously generous to \n     it--could not be here to join us. In their absence, I thank \n     them, too, for all their support.\n       On Ditchley's 50th Anniversary, I think it worthwhile to \n     look at its role.\n       My father was half-American. Brought up in the United \n     States he drilled into me as a boy the importance of the \n     Transatlantic relationship. His affection for it was \n     emotional--but the economic, political and military case is \n     even stronger. And yet we cannot take this for granted; it is \n     not necessarily a fixed star in the firmament. Geography hugs \n     Britain to her neighbors in Europe, and so does trade.\n       Trade and real politik turn American eyes to the East: \n     there is no room for complacency. The most successful \n     alliance in history is not immutable. It needs cherishing to \n     keep it in good order.\n       Ditchley plays a role in this. And why is that? It is, of \n     course, because thoughtful minds--lifting debate from the \n     ephemeral to the eternal--see the importance (and the self-\n     interest if you like) of nurturing Transatlantic ties.\n       But there is a further reason why Ditchley plays a role--a \n     more prosaic reason. It is because one man saw the importance \n     of the subject and had the vision to establish Ditchley in \n     order to do something about it. That man was David Wills. \n     Today, we remember and honour his vision, his commitment and \n     his generosity. He saw the need--forgive the unintended pun--\n     and he willed the means. David Wills is the Father of \n     Ditchley and the effect of his invisible hand is evident in \n     the continuing and instinctive relationship of trust that we \n     take for granted across the Atlantic.\n       He chose wisely, too, in entrusting his legacy to Lady \n     Wills and Catherine Wills. No one could have cared for \n     Ditchley more, and their generosity has always been \n     outstanding. I don't simply mean generosity in material \n     terms--though certainly that, for the Wills family were by \n     far the largest contributors to our recent fundraising \n     campaign--but also their personal commitment in time and \n     involvement. They are the living embodiment of Ditchley. I \n     believe they can be satisfied that their actions have helped \n     bind the ties that keep us safe and prosperous.\n\n  Following Sir John's remarks, the annual lecture was delivered by an \neminent British scholar and scientist, Professor Martin Rees, a member \nof the House of Lords. President of the Royal Society, Lord Rees of \nLudlow is\n\n[[Page S8028]]\n\nalso Master of Trinity College, Cambridge University, and Astronomer \nRoyal. The address by Lord Rees, in full, was as follows:\n\n       Last year, Brent Scowcroft stood at this podium as Ditchley \n     Lecturer. It's daunting to follow him. I'll take as my text \n     his concluding words:\n       ``If we behave wisely, prudently and in close strategic \n     cooperation with each other, the 21st century could be the \n     best yet in the rather dismal history of mankind.''\n       This is the 50th anniversary of the Ditchley Foundation, \n     and I've been asked to offer a scientist's perspective on the \n     next fifty years. As an astronomer, I often get \n     mistakenly described as an astrologer--but I cast no \n     horoscopes and have no crystal ball. My message will be \n     that the Promethean power of science offers greater \n     opportunities than ever before--for the developing and the \n     developed world. We can indeed be optimistic: we can \n     surely expect huge economic and social advances, \n     especially in Asia. But there will be new challenges and \n     vulnerabilities to contend with.\n\n\n                           THE LAST 50 YEARS\n\n       Fifty years ago no-one here could confidently have \n     predicted the geopolitical landscape of today. And scientific \n     forecasting is just as hazardous. Three of today's most \n     remarkable technologies had their gestation in the 1950s. But \n     nobody could then have guessed how pervasively they would \n     shape our lives today.\n       It was in 1958 that Jack Kilby of Texas Instruments and \n     Robert Noyce of Fairchild Semiconductors built the first \n     integrated circuit--the precursor of today's ubiquitous \n     silicon chips, each containing literally billions of \n     microscopic circuit elements. This was perhaps the most \n     transformative single invention of the past century.\n       A second technology with huge potential began in Cambridge \n     in the 1950s, when Watson and Crick discovered the bedrock \n     mechanism of heredity--the famous double helix. This \n     discovery launched the science of molecular biology, opening \n     exciting prospects in genomics and synthetic biology.\n       And it's just over 50 years since the launch of Sputnik. \n     This event started the `space race', and led President \n     Kennedy to inaugurate the programme to land men on the Moon. \n     Kennedy's prime motive was of course superpower rivalry--\n     cynics could deride it as a stunt. But it was an \n     extraordinary technical triumph--especially as NASA's total \n     computing power was far less than in a single mobile phone \n     today. And it had an inspirational aspect too: it offered a \n     new perspective on our planet. Distant images of Earth--its \n     delicate biosphere of clouds, land and oceans contrasting \n     with the sterile moonscape where the astronauts left their \n     footprints--have, ever since the 1960s, been iconic for \n     environmentalists.\n       Most of us here are old enough to recall the Apollo \n     programme. But it's nearly 40 years since Neil Armstrong's \n     `first small step'. To young people today, however, this is \n     ancient history: they know that the Americans went to the \n     Moon, just as they know the Egyptians built pyramids, but the \n     motives for these two enterprises may seem equally baffling.\n       There was no real follow-on after Apollo: there is no \n     practical or scientific motive adequate to justify the huge \n     expense of NASA-style manned spaceflight, and it has lost its \n     glamour. But unmanned space technology has flourished, giving \n     us GPS, global communications, environmental monitoring and \n     other everyday benefits, as well as an immense scientific \n     yield. But of course there is a dark side. Its initial \n     motivation was to provide missiles to carry nuclear weapons. \n     And those weapons were themselves the outcome of a huge \n     enterprise, the Manhattan project, that was even more intense \n     and focused than the Apollo programme.\n       Soon after World War II, some physicists who had been \n     involved in the Manhattan project founded a journal called \n     the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists, aimed at promoting arms \n     control. The `logo' on the Bulletin's cover is a clock, the \n     closeness of whose hands to midnight indicates the Editorial \n     Board's judgement on how precarious the world situation is. \n     Every year or two, the minute hand is shifted, either \n     forwards or backwards.\n       It was closest to midnight at the time of the Cuban Missile \n     Crisis. Robert MacNamara spoke frankly about that episode in \n     his confessional movie `Fog of War'. He said that ``We came \n     within a hairbreadth of nuclear war without realising it. \n     It's no credit to us that we escaped--Khrushchev and Kennedy \n     were lucky as well as wise''. Indeed on several occasions \n     during the Cold War the superpowers could have stumbled \n     towards armageddon.\n       When the Cold War ended, the Bulletin's clock was put back \n     to 17 minutes to midnight. There is now far less risk of tens \n     of thousands of H-bombs devastating our civilisation. Indeed \n     one clear reason for sharing Brent Scowcroft's optimism is \n     that the greatest peril to confront the world from the 1950s \n     to the 1980s--massive nuclear annihilation--has diminished.\n       But the clock has been creeping forward again. There is \n     increasing concern about nuclear proliferation, and about \n     nuclear weapons being deployed in a localised conflict. And \n     Al Qaida-style terrorists might some day acquire a nuclear \n     weapon. If they did, they would willingly detonate it in a \n     city, killing tens of thousands along with themselves, and \n     millions would acclaim them as heroes.\n       And the threat of a global nuclear catastrophe could be \n     merely in temporary abeyance. I'm diffident about even \n     mentioning such matters to an audience where there's so much \n     experience and expertise. But during this century, \n     geopolitical realignments could be as drastic as those during \n     the last century, and could lead to a nuclear standoff \n     between new superpowers that might be handled less well--or \n     less luckily--than the Cuba crisis was.\n       The nuclear age inaugurated an era when humans could \n     threaten the entire Earth's future--what some have called the \n     `anthropocene' era. We'll never be completely rid of the \n     nuclear threat. But the 21st century confronts us with new \n     perils as grave as the bomb. They may not threaten a sudden \n     world-wide catastrophe--the doomsday clock is not such a good \n     metaphor--but they are, in aggregate, worrying and \n     challenging.\n       I want briefly to address some of these themes, and then, \n     near the end of my lecture, to comment on the role of science \n     and scientists in the policy arena.\n\n\n                           ENERGY AND CLIMATE\n\n       High on the global agenda are energy supply and energy \n     security. These are crucial for economic and political \n     stability, and linked of course to the grave issue of long-\n     term climate change.\n       Human actions--mainly the burning of fossil fuels--have \n     already raised the carbon dioxide concentration higher than \n     it's ever been in the last half million years. Moreover, \n     according to `business as usual' scenarios, it will reach \n     twice the pre-industrial level by 2050, and three times that \n     level later in the century. This much is entirely \n     uncontroversial. Nor is there significant doubt that \n     CO2 is a greenhouse gas, and that the higher its \n     concentration rises, the greater the warming--and, more \n     important still, the greater the chance of triggering \n     something grave and irreversible: rising sea levels due to \n     the melting of Greenland's icecap; runaway greenhouse warming \n     due to release of methane in the tundra, and so forth.\n       There is a substantial uncertainty in just how sensitive \n     the temperature is to the CO2 level. The climate \n     models can, however, assess the likelihood of a range of \n     temperature rises. It is the `high-end tail' of the \n     probability distribution that should worry us most--the small \n     probability of a really drastic climatic shift. Climate \n     scientists now aim to refine their calculations, and to \n     address questions like: Where will the flood risks be \n     concentrated? What parts of Africa will suffer severest \n     drought? Where will the worst hurricanes strike?\n       The `headline figures' that the climate modellers quote--2, \n     3 or 5 degrees rise in the mean global temperature--might \n     seem too small to fuss about. But two comments should put \n     them into perspective.\n       First, even in the depth of the last ice age the mean \n     temperature was lower by just 5 degrees. Second, the \n     prediction isn't a uniform warming: the land warms more than \n     the sea, and high latitudes more than low. Quoting a single \n     figure glosses over shifts in global weather patterns that \n     will be more drastic in some regions than in others, and \n     could involve relatively sudden `flips' rather than steady \n     changes.\n       Nations can adapt to some of the adverse effects of \n     warming. But the most vulnerable people--in, for instance, \n     Africa or in Bangladesh--are the least able to adapt.\n       The science of climate change is intricate. But it's a \n     doddle compared to the economics and politics. Global warming \n     poses a unique political challenge for two reasons. First, \n     the effect is non-localised: the CO2 emissions \n     from this country have no more effect here than they do in \n     Australia, and vice versa. That means that any credible \n     regime whereby the `polluter pays' has to be broadly \n     international.\n       Second, there are long time-lags--it takes decades for the \n     oceans to adjust to a new equilibrium, and centuries for ice-\n     sheets to melt completely. So the main downsides of global \n     warming lie a century or more in the future. Concepts of \n     intergenerational justice then come into play: How should we \n     rate the rights and interests of future generations compared \n     to our own? What discount rate should we apply?\n       In his influential 2006 report for the UK government, \n     Nicholas Stern argued that equity to future generations \n     renders a `commercial' discount rate quite inappropriate. \n     Largely on that basis he argues that we should commit \n     substantial resources now, to pre-empt much greater costs in \n     future decades.\n       There are of course precedents for long-term altruism. \n     Indeed, in discussing the safe disposal of nuclear waste, \n     experts talk with a straight face about what might happen \n     more than 10,000 years from now, thereby implicitly applying \n     a zero discount rate. To concern ourselves with such a remote \n     `post-human' era might seem bizarre. But all of us can surely \n     empathise at least a century ahead. Especially in Europe, \n     we're mindful of the heritage we owe to centuries past; \n     history will judge us harshly if we discount too heavily what \n     might happen when our grandchildren grow old.\n       To ensure a better-than-evens chance of avoiding a \n     potentially dangerous `tipping point'; global CO2 \n     emissions must, by 2050, be brought down to half the 1990 \n     level. This is the target espoused by the G8. It corresponds \n     to two tons of CO2 per year from\n\n[[Page S8029]]\n\n     each person on the planet. For comparison, the current \n     European figure is about 10, and the Chinese level is already \n     4. To achieve this target without stifling economic growth--\n     to turn around the curve of CO2 emissions well \n     before 2050--is a huge challenge. The debates last week in \n     Japan indicated the problems--especially how to bring India \n     and China into the frame. The great emerging economies have \n     not caused the present problem, but if they develop in as \n     carbon-intensive a way as ours did, they could swamp and \n     negate any measures taken by the G8 alone.\n       Realistically, however, there is no chance of reaching this \n     target, nor of achieving real energy security, without \n     drastically new technologies. Though I'm confident that these \n     will have emerged by the second half of the century, the \n     worry is that this may not be soon enough.\n       Efforts to develop a whole raft of techniques for \n     economising on energy, storing it and generating it by \n     `clean' or low-carbon methods, deserve a priority and \n     commitment from governments akin to that accorded to the \n     Manhattan project or the Apollo moon landing. Current R and D \n     is far less than the scale and urgency demands. To speed \n     things up, we need a `shotgun approach'--trying all the \n     options. And we can afford it: the stakes are colossal. The \n     world spends around 7 trillion dollars per year on energy and \n     its infrastructure. The U.S. imports 500 billion dollars \n     worth of oil each year.\n       I can't think of anything that could do more to attract the \n     brightest and best into science than a strongly proclaimed \n     commitment--led by the U.S. and Europe--to provide clean and \n     sustainable energy for the developing and the developed \n     world.\n       Even optimists about prospects in solar energy, advanced \n     biofuels, fusion and other renewables have to acknowledge \n     that it will be at least 40 years before they can fully `take \n     over'. Coal, oil and gas seem set to dominate the world's \n     every-growing energy needs for at least that long. Last year \n     the Chinese built 100 coal-fired power stations. Coal \n     deposits representing a million years' accumulation of \n     primeval forest are now being burnt in a single year.\n       Coal is the most `inefficient' fossil fuel in terms of \n     energy generated per unit of carbon released. Annual \n     CO2 emissions are rising year by year. Unless this \n     rising curve can be turned around sooner, the atmospheric \n     concentration will irrevocably reach a threatening level.\n       So an immediate priority has to be a coordinated \n     international effort to develop carbon capture and storage--\n     CCS. Carbon from power stations must be captured before it \n     escapes in the atmosphere; and then piped to some geological \n     formation where it can be stored without leaking out. It's \n     crucial to agree a timetable, and a coordinated plan for the \n     construction of CCS demonstration plants to explore all \n     variants of the technology. To jump-start such a programme \n     would need up to 10 billion dollars a year of public funding \n     worldwide (preferably as part of public-private \n     partnerships). But this is a small price to pay for bringing \n     forward, by five years or more, the time when CCS can be \n     widely adopted and the graph of CO2 emissions \n     turned around.\n       What is the role of nuclear power in all this? The concerns \n     are well known--it is an issue where expert and lay opinions \n     are equally divided. I'm myself in favour of the UK and the \n     U.S. having at least a replacement generation of power \n     stations--and of R and D into new kinds of reactors. But the \n     non-proliferation regime is fragile, and before being relaxed \n     about a world-wide programme of nuclear power, one would \n     surely require the kind of fuel bank and leasing arrangement \n     that has been proposed by Mohamed el Baradei at the IAEA .\n\n\n                    NATURAL RESOURCES AND POPULATION\n\n       Energy security and climate change are the prime `threats \n     without enemies' that confront us. But there are others. High \n     among these is the threat to biological diversity caused by \n     rapid changes in land use and deforestation. There have been \n     5 great extinctions in the geological past; human actions are \n     causing a 6th. The extinction rate is 1000 times higher than \n     normal, and increasing. We are destroying the book of life \n     before we have read it.\n       Biodiversity--manifested in forests, coral reefs, marine \n     blue waters and all Earth's other ecosystems--is often \n     proclaimed as a crucial component of human wellbeing and \n     economic growth. It manifestly is: we're clearly harmed if \n     fish stocks dwindle to extinction; there are plants whose \n     gene pool might be useful to us. And massive destruction of \n     the rain forests would accelerate global warming. But for \n     environmentalists these `instrumental'--and anthropocentric--\n     arguments aren't the only compelling ones. For them, \n     preserving the richness of our biosphere has value in its own \n     right, over and above what it means to us humans.\n       Population growth, of course, aggravates all pressures on \n     energy and environment. Fifty years ago the world population \n     was below 3 billion. It has more than doubled since then, to \n     6.6 billion. The percentage growth-rate has slowed, but the \n     global figure is projected to reach 8 or even 9 billion by \n     2050. The excess will almost all be in the developing world.\n       There is, incidentally, a global trend from rural towards \n     urban living. More than half the world's population is now \n     urban--and megacities are growing explosively.\n       There is an extensive literature on the `carrying capacity' \n     of our planet--on how many people it can sustain without \n     irreversible degradation. The answer of course depends on \n     lifestyle. The world could not sustain its present population \n     if everyone lived like present-day Americans or Europeans. On \n     the other hand, the pressures would plainly be eased if \n     people travelled little and interacted via super-internet and \n     virtual reality. And, incidentally, if they were all \n     vegetarians: it takes 13 pounds of corn to make one pound of \n     beef.\n       If population growth continues even beyond 2050, one can't \n     be other than exceedingly gloomy about the prospects. \n     However, there could be a turnaround. There are now more than \n     60 countries in which fertility is below replacement level--\n     it's far below in, for instance, Italy and Singapore. In Iran \n     the fertility rate has fallen from 6.5 in 1980 to 2.1 today. \n     We all know the social trends that lead to this demographic \n     transition--declining infant mortality, availability of \n     contraceptive advice, women's education, and so forth.\n       If the transition quickly extended to all countries, then \n     the global population could start a gradual decline after \n     2050--a development that would surely be benign.\n       There is, incidentally, one `wild card' in all these long-\n     term forecasts. This is the possibility that the average \n     lifespan in advanced countries may be extended drastically by \n     some biomedical breakthrough.\n       The prognosis is especially bleak in Africa, where there \n     could be a billion more people in 2050 than there are today. \n     It's worth quoting some numbers here. A hundred years ago, \n     the population of Ethiopia was 5 million. It is now 75 \n     million (of whom 8 million need permanent food aid) and will \n     almost double by 2050. Quite apart from the problem of \n     providing services, there is consequent pressure on the water \n     resources of the Nile basin.\n       Over 200 years ago, Thomas Malthus famously argued that \n     populations would rise until limited by food shortages. His \n     gloomy prognosis has been forestalled by advancing \n     technology, the green revolution and so forth, but he could \n     be tragically vindicated in Africa. Continuing population \n     growth makes it harder to break out of the poverty trap--\n     Africa not only needs more food, but a million more teachers \n     annually, just to keep standards level. And just as today's \n     population couldn't be fed by yesterday's agriculture, a \n     second green revolution may be needed to feed tomorrow's \n     population.\n       But the rich world has the resources, if the will is there, \n     to enhance the life-chances of the world's billion poorest \n     people--relieving the most extreme poverty, providing clean \n     water, primary education and other basics. This is a \n     precondition of achieving in Africa the demographic tradition \n     that has occurred elsewhere. The overseas aid from most \n     countries, including the U.S., is far below the UN's \n     target of 0.7 percent of GNP. It would surely be shameful, \n     as well as against even our narrow self-interests, if the \n     Millennium Goals set for 2015 were not met.\n       (To inject a pessimistic note in parenthesis, the meagre \n     underfunding of overseas aid, even in a context where the \n     humanitarian imperative seems so clear, augurs badly for the \n     actual implementation of the measures needed to meet the 2050 \n     carbon emission targets--generally quoted as around 1 percent \n     of GNP--where the payoff is less immediately apparent.)\n\n\n                        some new vulnerabilities\n\n       Infectious diseases are mainly associated with developing \n     countries--but in our interconnected world we are now all \n     more vulnerable. The spread of epidemics is aggravated by \n     rapid air travel, plus the huge concentrations in megacities \n     with fragile infrastructures.\n       Whether or not a pandemic gets global grip may hinge on the \n     efficiency of worldwide monitoring--how quickly a Vietnamese \n     or Sudanese poultry farmer can diagnose or report any strange \n     sickness.\n       In our everyday lives, we have a confused attitude to risk. \n     We fret about tiny risks: carcinogens in food, a one-in-a-\n     million chance of being killed in train crashes, and so \n     forth. But we're in denial about others that should loom much \n     larger. If we apply to pandemics the same prudent analysis \n     that leads us to buy insurance--multiplying probability by \n     consequences--we'd surely conclude that measures to alleviate \n     this kind of extreme event need higher priority. A global \n     pandemic could kill tens of millions and cost many trillions \n     of dollars.\n       This thought leads me to new vulnerabilities of a different \n     kind: vulnerabilities stemming from the misuse of powerful \n     technologies--either through error or by design. \n     Biotechnology, for instance, holds huge promise for health \n     care, for enhanced food production, even for energy. But \n     there is a downside.\n       Here's a quote from the American National Academy of \n     Sciences: ``Just a few individuals with specialized skills . \n     . . could inexpensively and easily produce a panoply of \n     lethal biological weapons. . . . The deciphering of the human \n     genome sequence and the complete elucidation of numerous \n     pathogen genomes . . . allow science to be misused to create \n     new agents of mass destruction'.''\n       Not even an organized network would be required: just a \n     fanatic, or a weirdo with the mindset of those who now design \n     computer viruses--the mindset of an arsonist. The techniques \n     and expertise for bio or cyber attacks will be accessible to \n     millions.\n       We're kidding ourselves if we think that technical \n     expertise is always allied with balanced rationality: it can \n     be combined with\n\n[[Page S8030]]\n\n     fanaticism--not just the traditional fundamentalism that \n     we're so mindful of today, but new age irrationalities. I'm \n     thinking of cults such as the Raelians: and of extreme eco-\n     freaks, animal rights campaigners and the like. The global \n     village will have its village idiots.\n       In a future era of vast individual empowerment, where even \n     one malign act would be too many, how can our open society be \n     safeguarded? Will there be pressures to constrain diversity \n     and individualism? Or to shift the balance between privacy \n     and intrusion? These are stark questions, but I think they \n     are deeply serious ones. (Though--to inject a slightly \n     frivolous comment--the careless abandon with which younger \n     people put their intimate details on Facebook, and the broad \n     acquiescence in ubiquitous CCTV, suggests that in our society \n     there will be surprisingly little resistance to loss of \n     privacy.)\n       Developments in cyber, bio or nano-technology will open up \n     new risks of error or terror. Our global society is \n     precariously dependent on elaborate networks--electricity \n     grids, air traffic control, the internet, just-in-time \n     delivery and so forth--whose collapse could stress it to \n     breaking point. It's crucial to ensure maximal resilience of \n     all such systems.\n       At the start of this lecture, I cited three technologies \n     that now pervade our lives in ways quite unenvisioned 50 \n     years ago. Likewise, by extrapolating from the present, I \n     have surely missed the qualitatively greatest changes that \n     may occur in the next 50.\n       The great science-fiction writer Arthur C. Clark opined \n     that any ultra-advanced technology was indistinguishable from \n     magic. Everyday consumer items like Sony game stations, sat-\n     nav and Google would have seemed magic 50 years ago.\n       In the coming decades, there could be qualitatively new \n     kinds of change. One thing that's been unaltered for \n     millennia is human nature and human character. But in this \n     century, novel mind-enhancing drugs, genetics, and `cyberg' \n     techniques may start to alter human beings themselves. That's \n     something qualitatively new in recorded history.\n       And we should keep our minds open, or at least ajar, to \n     concepts on the fringe of science fiction--robots with many \n     human attributes, computers that make discoveries worthy of \n     Nobel prizes, bioengineered organisms, and so forth. Flaky \n     Californian futurologists aren't always wrong.\n       Opinion polls in England show that people are generally \n     positive about science's role, but are concerned that it may \n     `run away' faster than we can properly cope with it. Some \n     commentators on biotech, robotics and nanotech worry that \n     when the genie is out of the bottle, the outcome may be \n     impossible to control. They urge caution in `pushing the \n     envelope' in some areas of science.\n       The uses of academic research generally can't be foreseen: \n     Rutherford famously said, in the mid-thirties, that nuclear \n     energy was `moonshine'; the inventors of lasers didn't \n     foresee that an early application of their work would be to \n     eye surgery; the discoverer of x-rays was not searching for \n     ways to see through flesh. A major scientific discovery is \n     likely to have many applications--some benign, others less \n     so--none of which was foreseen by the original investigator.\n       We can't reap the benefits of science without accepting \n     some risks--the best we can do is minimize them. Most \n     surgical procedures, even if now routine, were risky and \n     often fatal when they were being pioneered. In the early days \n     of steam, people died when poorly designed boilers exploded.\n       But something has changed. Most of the `old' risks were \n     localized. If a boiler explodes, it's horrible but there's an \n     `upper bound' to just how horrible. In our ever more \n     interconnected world, there are new risks whose consequences \n     could be so widespread that even a tiny probability is \n     unacceptable.\n       There will surely be a widening gulf between what science \n     enables us to do, and what applications it's prudent or \n     ethical actually to pursue--more doors that science could \n     open but which are best kept closed.\n       There are already scientific procedures--human reproductive \n     cloning, synthetic biology and the rest--where regulation is \n     called for, on ethical as well as prudential grounds. And \n     there will be more. Regulations will need to be \n     international, and to contend with commercial pressures--and \n     they may prove as hard to enforce as the drug laws. If one \n     country alone imposed regulations, the most dynamic \n     researchers and enterprising companies would migrate to \n     another that was more permissive. This is happening already, \n     in a small way, in primate and stem cell research.\n\n\n                 the international scientific community\n\n       Some comments, now, on the role of the scientific \n     community. Science is the only truly global culture: protons, \n     proteins, and Pythagoras's theorem are the same from China to \n     Peru. Research is international, highly networked, and \n     collaborative. And most science-linked policy issues are \n     international, even global--that's certainly true of those \n     I've addressed in this lecture.\n       This is primarily an Anglo-American gathering, so I hope \n     it's not out of place to emphasis that our two countries have \n     been the most successful in creating and sustaining world-\n     class research universities. These institutions are magnets \n     for talent--both faculty and students--from all over the \n     world, and are in most cases embedded in a `cluster' of high-\n     tech companies, to symbiotic benefit.\n       By 2050, China and India should at least gain parity with \n     Europe and the US--they will surely become the `centre of \n     gravity' of the world's intellectual power. We will need to \n     aim high if we are to sustain our competitive advantage in \n     offering cutting-edge `value added'.\n       It's a duty of scientific academies and similar bodies to \n     ensure that policy decisions are based on the best science, \n     even when that science is still uncertain and provisional; \n     this is the Royal Society's role in the UK and that of the \n     National Academy of Sciences in the US. The academies of the \n     G8 + 5 countries are playing an increasing role in \n     highlighting global issues. And one thinks of consortia like \n     the IPCC, and bodies like the WHO.\n       In this country, an ongoing dialogue with parliamentarians \n     on embryos and stem cells has led to a generally-admired \n     legal framework. On the other hand, the GM crops debate went \n     wrong here because we came in too late, when opinion was \n     already polarized between eco-campaigners on the one side and \n     commercial interests on the other. I think we have recently \n     done better on nanotechnology, by raising the key issues \n     early. It's necessary to engage with the public `upstream' of \n     any legislation or commercial developments.\n       We need to point out that the resources and expertise \n     devoted to applications of science are not deployed \n     optimally. Some subjects have had the `inside track' and \n     gained disproportionate resources; huge sums, for instance, \n     are still devoted to new weaponry. On the other hand, \n     environmental projects, renewable energy, and so forth, \n     deserve more effort. In medicine, the focus is \n     disproportionately on cancer and cardiovascular studies, the \n     ailments that loom largest in prosperous countries, rather \n     than on the infections endemic in the tropics.\n       Policy decisions--whether about energy, GM technology, \n     mind-enhancing drugs or whatever--are never solely \n     `scientific': strategic, economic, social, and ethical \n     ramifications enter as well. And here scientists have no \n     special credentials. Choices on how science is applied \n     shouldn't be made just by scientists. That's why everyone \n     needs a `feel' for science and a realistic attitude to risk--\n     otherwise public debate won't rise above the level of tabloid \n     slogans.\n       Scientists nonetheless have a special responsibility. We \n     feel there is something lacking in parents who don't care \n     what happens to their children in adulthood, even though this \n     is largely beyond their control. Likewise, scientists \n     shouldn't be indifferent to the fruits of their ideas--their \n     intellectual creations. They should try to foster benign \n     spin-offs--and of course help to bring their work to market \n     when appropriate. But they should campaign to resist, so far \n     as they can, ethically dubious or threatening applications. \n     And they should be prepared to engage in public debate and \n     discussion.\n       I mentioned earlier the atomic scientists in World War II. \n     Many of them--and I've been privileged to know some, such as \n     Hans Bethe and Joseph Rotblat--set a fine example. Fate had \n     assigned them a pivotal role in history. They returned with \n     relief to peacetime academic pursuits. But they didn't say \n     that they were `just scientists' and that the use made of \n     their work was up to politicians. They continued as engaged \n     citizens--promoting efforts to control the power they had \n     helped unleash. We now need such individuals--not just in \n     physics, but across the whole range of applicable science.\n\n\n                          a cosmic perspective\n\n       My special subject is astronomy--the study of our \n     environment in the widest conceivable sense. And I'd like to \n     end with a cosmic perspective.\n       It is surely a cultural deprivation to be unaware of the \n     marvelous vision of nature offered by Darwinism and by modern \n     cosmology--the chain of emergent complexity leading from a \n     still-mysterious beginning to atoms, stars, planets, \n     biospheres and human brains able to ponder the wonder and the \n     mystery. And there's no reason to regard humans as the \n     culmination of this emergent process. Our Sun is less than \n     half way through its life. Any creatures witnessing the Sun's \n     demise, here on earth or far beyond, won't be human--they'll \n     be as different from us as we are from bacteria.\n       But, even in this cosmic time-perspective--extending \n     billions of years into the future, as well as into the past--\n     this century may be a defining moment. It's the first in our \n     planet's history where one species--ours--has Earth's future \n     in its hands.\n       I recalled earlier the image of our Earth viewed from \n     space. Suppose some aliens had been watching our planet--a \n     `pale blue dot' in a vast cosmos, for its entire history, \n     what would they have seen?\n       Over nearly all that immense time, 4.5 billion years, \n     Earth's appearance would have altered very gradually. The \n     continents drifted; the ice cover waxed and waned; successive \n     species emerged, evolved and became extinct.\n       But in just a tiny sliver of the Earth's history--the last \n     one millionth part, a few thousand years--the patterns of \n     vegetation altered much faster than before. This signaled the \n     start of agriculture. The changes accelerated as human \n     populations rose.\n       But then there were other changes, even more abrupt. Within \n     fifty years--little more than one hundredth of a millionth of \n     the Earth's age, the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere began \n     to rise anomalously fast. The planet became an intense \n     emitter of radio waves (the total output from all TV, \n     cellphone and radar transmissions).\n\n[[Page S8031]]\n\n       And something else unprecedented happened: small \n     projectiles lifted from the planet's surface and escaped the \n     biosphere completely. Some were propelled into orbits around \n     the Earth; some journeyed to the Moon and planets.\n       If they understood astrophysics, the aliens could \n     confidently predict that the biosphere would face doom in a \n     few billion years when the Sun flares up and dies. But could \n     they have predicted this unprecedented spike less than half \n     way through the Earth's life--these human-induced alterations \n     occupying, overall, less than a millionth of the elapsed \n     lifetime and seemingly occurring with runaway speed?\n       If they continued to keep watch, what might these \n     hypothetical aliens witness in the next hundred years? Will a \n     final spasm be followed by silence? Or will the planet itself \n     stabilize? And will some of the objects launched from the \n     Earth spawn new oases of life elsewhere?\n       The answers will depend on us, collectively--on whether we \n     can, to quote Brent Scowcroft again, `behave wisely, \n     prudently.'

Mr. President, today I pay tribute to SGT Peyton \nWilliams, a constituent of mine from Wetumpka, AL. Sergeant Williams \nwas selected as the Marine of the Year for the Second Marine Division. \nOut of the over 20,000 marines who comprise the Second Division, \nSergeant Williams was selected for his outstanding performance in \nOperation Iraqi Freedom, OIF. This prestigious award signifies that \nSergeant Williams represents the best of what a U.S. Marine should be.\n  Later this month, Governor Bob Riley will proclaim August 21, 2008, \nas Sergeant Peyton Williams Day in the State of Alabama. I would like \nto express my pride in his accomplishment, and appreciation for his \nservice to our Nation in Iraq. Sergeant Williams contributed to the \nsuccess of the counterinsurgency in the Al Anbar province. His work \nthere was critical to our success in our current operations and he \nserves as an example to his fellow marines and an inspiration to all \nyoung Alabamians who will follow him in service as members of the \nmilitary.\n  According to his company commander, CPT Brian Cillessen, ``Peyton has \nmore talent by accident than most Marines learn in a career. He is a \ngreat American who has served his country well, and I am proud to have \nthe honor to serve with him and would welcome the opportunity in the \nfuture.''\n  I would like to echo Captain Cillessen's praise of Sergeant Williams, \nit is Marines like him who have ensured the success of the surge \nstrategy. I believe that with dedicated marines like Sergeant Williams \nin the force, victory is not only possible in our current operations in \nIraq, it is certain.\n  And so, I applaud Sergeant Williams' hard work, and I look forward to \nhearing more great things about this fine son of Alabama.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/08/01/senate-section/article/S8031-2", "month": "08", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8031]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           TRIBUTE TO THE UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM\n\n Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, today I recognize the University \nof Alabama at Birmingham, UAB, a place known for its outstanding, \nworld-renowned HIV/AIDS research and treatment. Dr. Michael Saag \ndirects the Center for AIDS Research at UAB, which was established in \n1988 by the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases to \nstimulate research and scientific advancement concerning AIDS and HIV. \nThis program was initiated in 1998 and currently includes 20 centers \nfunded through a consortium of six National Institutes of Health. Under \nDr. Saag's exceptional leadership, the UAB Center for AIDS Research has \ngrown dramatically as shown by its increase in total research funding, \nfrom $2.9 million dollars in 1988 to over $90 million currently.\n  UAB has a remarkable program in Zambia, the Center for Infectious \nDisease Research, headed up by Dr. Jeff Stringer. The UAB Zambia \nprogram, which receives funding through the President's Emergency \nProgram for AIDS Relief, PEPFAR, is treating over 170,000 patients, \nwith up to 100,000 patients on ARV treatment.\n  Dr. Stringer and his remarkable team have also worked vigorously with \nthe Zambian Government to deliver ``prevention of mother-to-child HIV \ntransmission'' services to over 500,000 women in Zambia, preventing \ntens of thousands of infants from being born with HIV. The UAB HIV \nprevention and treatment service units support 175 public health \nfacilities in four of the nine provinces of Zambia. Prevention of \nmother-to-child transmission services are offered in 154 clinics and \nhospitals.\n  HIV care and treatment services are offered in 46 sites, and include \na comprehensive cervical cancer screening program that has screened \nover 5,000 women in its first year. Research has shown a direct \nconnection between HIV and cervical cancer among women, and \ngroundbreaking work in the field has demonstrated the importance of \nscreening HIV-infected women for cervical cancer, especially in \nresource-poor countries of the world. Dr. Groesbeck Parham and his \ngroup from UAB/ CIDRZ, using PEPFAR resources, have led the way in \ncreating mechanisms to screen large numbers of women in Zambia, saving \nthousands of lives.\n  The UAB Zambia program also provides HIV testing to TB patients, and \nTB screening for all HIV patients in a comprehensive, integrated TB/HIV \ninitiative.\n  I applaud the fine work UAB is doing, and I know that their service \nhas saved thousands of lives. This is a prime example of the clear, \npositive results we have seen come about through PEPFAR, and one major \nreason I worked to ensure that new PEPFAR legislation preserves the \nfocus on treatment that has undoubtedly contributed to its success.\n  I am proud of the role UAB has played on an international level in \nstriving to provide top-notch treatment, as well as research to \ncontinuously improve on that treatment for Alabama, the nation, and the \nworld, over the past 20 years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/08/01/senate-section/article/S8031-3", "month": "08", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8031]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      HONORING DR. EPHRAIM ZUROFF\n\n Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to commend Dr. Ephraim \nZuroff and the Simon Wiesenthal Center for their efforts to track down \nthe last Nazi war criminals from World War II. Their work is enormously \nimportant, both in bringing the guilty to justice and preventing future \nacts of genocide. The statute of limitations does not, must not, expire \non crimes against humanity. Earlier this year, I introduced the World \nWar II War Crimes Accountability Act with Senator Nelson, which I hope \nwill help Dr. Zuroff and the Simon Wiesenthal Center in their noble \neffort.\n  One of the main targets of this effort is Sandor Kepiro, who is \ncharged with the 1942 killing of about 1,000 Jews, Gypsies, and Serbs \nin Novi Sad, Serbia. Kepiro allegedly committed these crimes while \nserving as a Hungarian police captain during World War II. He was \nconvicted in 1944, but the verdict was annulled when the Nazis invaded \nHungary. He was convicted again in 1946, in absentia, but escaped \nbefore serving his sentence. In 2007, a Hungarian court ruled that \nKepiro could not be charged again for his alleged crimes. He is now \nliving in Hungary, and the government continues to investigate the \ncircumstances of his WWII activities. The Hungarian government must \nsummon the political will to bring Kepiro to justice. Inaction is not \nan option.\n  The Simon Wiesenthal Center launched Operation: Last Chance in 2002, \nto identify and assist in the prosecution of the remaining Nazi war \ncriminals still at large. Dr. Zuroff, who has been leading this effort, \nshould be highly commended for his outstanding efforts in bringing the \nmost guilty Nazis to justice. Of these, Kepiro is near the top of his \nlist.\n  Even today, the crimes of people like Kepiro in the service of pro-\nNazi regimes strain our understanding of hate. National Socialist \nGermany today is an icon remembered only for its brutality, its mantra \nof genocide, and its culture of racism. And those last Nazis, who are \nwaiting out their last days under the coming twilight, must not be \nallowed to go quietly into the night, as did too many of their victims. \nFor the souls that were lost, and even more for those that remain, \nthere must be justice. I commend Dr. Zuroff and the Simon Wiesenthal \nCenter in the highest possible terms, and urge the United States \nGovernment to do all it can to help them in their cause.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/08/01/senate-section/article/S8032-1", "month": "08", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8032]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S8032]]\n                        RECOGNIZING JORDAN FINK\n\n Mr. THUNE.

A bill to make effective the proposed rule of the Food and \nDrug Administration relating to sunscreen drug products, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today along with Senators Jack Reed, \nJohn Kerry, Tom Carper, Hillary Rodham Clinton, and Joe Biden to \nintroduce the Sunscreen Labeling Protection Act of 2008, or the SUN \nAct. I thank them for their support of this legislation and have \nenjoyed working with them on the issue of sunscreen labeling. This is \nan issue I have been working on for more than a decade. I also want to \nthank the many outside organizations who support this legislation \nincluding the American Cancer Society, the Melanoma Research \nFoundation, and many others as well as the leading U.S. manufacturers \nof sunscreen, Banana Boat and Hawaiian Tropic.\n  As we head into yet another steamy, sweltering summer locally in \nWashington, DC, and as Americans throughout the country hit the \noutdoors to enjoy a relaxing time at beaches, backyard barbeques and \nparks, we cannot forget how important it is to protect our skin from \nthe sun's damaging rays.\n  However, I am profoundly disappointed to report that yet another \nsummer is passing us by without adequate sunscreen labeling to protect \nconsumers from harmful ultraviolet radiation, including UVA and UVB. \nAmericans are being left in the lurch by the inaction of the Food and \nDrug Administration, which has failed to issue comprehensive and \nconsistent standards for measuring and labeling sunscreen products for \ntheir protective value and for guarding against false claims on \nsunscreen products.\n  Americans may be surprised to learn that the Sun Protection Factor, \nSPF, number on the sunscreen they buy at their local convenience store \nor supermarket measures only the level of UVB protection provided by \nthe sunscreen. It does not include a measure of the level of UVA \nprotection. UVB has long been associated with sunburn while UVA has \nbeen recognized as a deeper penetrating radiation that contributes to \nskin cancer. While many products claim to offer UVA protection, that \nclaim is not backed by enforceable, FDA-recommended standards by which \nthose claims can be substantiated.\n  The FDA's standards for sunscreen testing and labeling lag 30 years \nbehind our knowledge of the dangers of sun exposure. Research tells us \nthat individual risk of melanoma, the most serious form of skin cancer, \nis associated with the intensity of sunlight that a person receives \nover a lifetime. In 2008, it is estimated there will be more than 1 \nmillion new cases of skin cancers and 62,480 new cases of melanoma, the \ndeadliest form of skin cancer. Tragically, there will be as many as \n8,420 deaths from melanoma this year.\n\n  Many sunscreen products carry claims that they protect against \ncancer-causing UVA rays, but without FDA action to set standards for \ntesting and labeling, these claims can't be validated. Indeed, an \nanalysis released earlier this summer found that many sunscreen \nproducts have misleading labels that make unsubstantiated claims.\n  Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island and I, along with many of my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle, have repeatedly urged the FDA--\nfor over a decade now--to follow through with its\n\n[[Page S8038]]\n\ndevelopment of standards. We have written letters to the FDA dating \nback more than ten years, we have made phone calls, we have asked \nquestions at hearings, and we even directed the FDA to issue final \nlabeling for UVA and UVB in the fiscal year 2006 Agriculture \nAppropriations bill.\n  The American Cancer Society, the American Academy of Dermatology, and \nnumerous other organizations speak of the value of using sunscreen to \nprotect our skin from damaging UVA and UVB rays as an important step in \npreventing skin cancer. For years, we have heard their repeated cries \nfor industry-wide standards that will help Americans protect themselves \nfrom a preventable cause of cancer. And still there is no final action \nby the FDA.\n  The public deserves better. If you take one look at the startling \nnumbers of Americans who will be diagnosed with skin cancer this year \nand who will likely die from this disease, it is clear that the public \nmust know that what they read on the label of a sunscreen product \nrepresents a scientifically valid claim of protection from both UVA and \nUVB radiation.\n  Almost a year ago, the FDA issued a proposed rule that would set \nstandards for testing and labeling sunscreen that includes UVA and UVB. \nI applaud this progress. It was a long time in coming. But I must \nreiterate that until the proposed rule is finalized, consumers and \nmanufacturers lack an enforceable, consistent and comprehensive \nstandard for testing and labeling of sunscreen products.\n  That is why I am introducing the SUNscreen Labeling Protection Act of \n2008, or the SUN Act. This simple, straightforward bill gives the FDA \n180 days from the date of enactment to finalize the proposed rule for \ncomprehensive labeling, including formulation, testing and labeling \nrequirements for both UVA and UVB, after which point the proposed rule \nwould become effective.\n  I cannot emphasize enough the importance of this issue. The public \ncontinues to be misled by false claims that cannot be effectively \nchallenged because there are no enforceable FDA standards for measuring \nand labeling UVA protection.\n  If the FDA would finalize its proposed rule including UVA and UVB \nprotection, this legislation would not be necessary. But, a year and an \nentire summer season has nearly passed since the rule was proposed, as \nhave decades of inaction prior to the proposed rule even being issued. \nAll the while, consumers have gone without the information and \nprotection they need which is what makes this legislation so critical.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this critically important bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that letters of support be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be placed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                        Cancer Action Network,\n\n                                                    July 30, 2008.\n     Hon. Christopher J. Dodd,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Dodd: On behalf of the volunteers and \n     supporters of the American Cancer Society Cancer Action \n     NetworksSM (ACS CAN), the partner advocacy organization of \n     the American Cancer Society, we want to express our thanks \n     for your leadership in introducing the Sunscreen Labeling \n     Protection Act of 2008 (SUN Act). The SUN Act will direct the \n     Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to issue final regulations \n     related to labeling for sunscreen products.\n       Skin cancer is the most common of all cancer types with \n     more than one million skin cancer diagnoses each year in the \n     United States. Because exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation \n     from the sun is the most important known risk fact for skin \n     cancers, we believe this long-awaited proposal from the FDA \n     will better inform consumers on the value and limits of \n     sunscreen use.\n       We have provided extensive comments on the FDA proposed \n     rules to ensure that the new regulations will require the \n     most accurate and user-friendly presentation of sun \n     protection possible on sunscreen products. The majority of \n     skin cancers are caused primarily by UVB rays, and we know \n     that UV exposure from the sun increases the risk of skin \n     cancer, premature skin aging and other skin damage. \n     Therefore, it is important to decrease UV exposure by wearing \n     protective clothing, seeking shade whenever possible, and \n     using a sunscreen with a high enough SPF Value to protect \n     against some level of both UVB and UVA rays. ACS CAN believes \n     that by raising the highest labeled sun protection factor \n     (SPF) Value from 30 to 50 and including a UVA protection \n     measure, consumers will be able to better select their \n     protection level.\n       ACS CAN views cancer prevention as the most important \n     attribute of sunscreens, and there is now convincing evidence \n     that consistent use of appropriate sunscreens will result in \n     the prevention of squamous cell carcinoma of the skin and may \n     lower melanoma risk. Hence it is our strong conviction that \n     all sunscreen packages must note the importance of applying \n     sunscreen before going into the sun and reapplying as needed. \n     We hope the new FDA regulations will help to achieve this by \n     requiring a principle display panel on packages that is \n     simple and easy for consumers to read, so they have clear \n     directions on sun safety to make the most appropriate choice \n     about protection levels.\n       Again, ACS CAN is encouraged that the SUN Act may finally \n     lead to implementation of new regulations related to \n     sunscreen labeling, and we look forward to working with \n     Congress and the FDA to provide consumers with the most \n     accurate and forthright information regarding sun protection \n     and sunscreen use. If we can ever be of assistance or provide \n     information, please contact Kelly Green Kahn, Associate \n     Director, Federal Relations.\n           Sincerely,\n     Daniel E. Smith,\n       President,\n     Dick Woodruff,\n       Senior Director, Federal Relations.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                  Citizens for Sun Protection,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 30, 2008.\n     Hon. Christopher Dodd,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Dodd, On behalf of the Citizens for Sun \n     Protection, an organization of parents, cancer survivors, \n     healthcare professionals, business advocates and community \n     leaders, joined together to advocate for stronger standards \n     for sunscreen protection, I am writing you to express our \n     strong support for the Sunscreen Labeling Protection Act of \n     2008 (SUN Act). This legislation would provide for the \n     enactment within 180 days of the sunscreen standards rule \n     that was first proposed by the Food and Drug Administration \n     (FDA) in August 2007, and has yet been acted upon. We applaud \n     your leadership in advancing federal sunscreen standards to \n     protect Americans against cancer-causing UVB and UVA rays.\n       The delay in upgrading U.S. sunscreen standards, which has \n     dragged on for now close to 20 years, can no longer be \n     tolerated. Several other countries, including the European \n     Union, already have strong sunscreen standards that provide \n     protection from both UVA and UVB rays for their citizens. \n     Your legislation will assure that the FDA issues final \n     standards for UVA and UVB protection within 180 days of \n     enactment and thus provide Americans with vitally important \n     protection against skin cancer, premature aging, and skin \n     damage.\n       A comprehensive FDA rule would require that sunscreen \n     manufacturers properly label products so consumers will know \n     the level of protection provided in the sunscreen they use \n     for themselves and their families. Today, the average \n     American using sunscreens that are commercially available in \n     this country mistakenly believes that the product is \n     providing equal protection for both UVB and UVA exposure. In \n     reality Sun Protection Factor designations only apply only to \n     UVB rays, those that primarily cause sunburn, and do not \n     protect against UVA rays which cause skin cancer and other \n     skin damage.\n       Compelling facts drive the need for change: According to \n     the American Cancer Society one million new cases of skin \n     cancer will be diagnosed in the United States this year and \n     over 10,000 Americans will die from the disease. Every year \n     the FDA proposal is delayed leaves our citizens at increased \n     risk. It is critical to the health and welfare of the U.S. \n     public to have access to strong, protective sunscreens they \n     can trust. On behalf of the Citizens for Sun Protection, I \n     wish to once again affirm our strong support for the SUN Act. \n     We applaud your efforts to establish strong standards and an \n     accurate labeling system for UVA and UVB protection in the \n     United States.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Robert F. Hurley,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                  Environmental Working Group,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 30, 2008.\n     Hon. Christopher J. Dodd,\n     Chair, Subcommittee on Children and Families, Committee on \n         Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: As the summer sun is upon us, we are \n     again reminded of the need to ensure that sunscreens protect \n     consumers from the damaging rays of both ultraviolet A (UVA) \n     and ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation. The Food and Drug \n     Administration first proposed to set safety standards in \n     1978, yet failed to act. That is why EWG supports the \n     Sunscreen Labeling Protection Act of 2008, The SUN Act, which \n     would require FDA to finalize sunscreen safety standards \n     within 6 months, ending 30 years of delay.\n       The need for these standards is clear. A recent EWG study \n     found that 85 percent of sunscreens that we tested do not \n     offer enough protection from UV rays, are made with \n     potentially harmful ingredients, or have not been tested for \n     safety. Many products on the market present obvious safety \n     and effectiveness concerns, including one of every seven that \n     does not protect from UVA radiation. Overall we identified \n     143 products that offer\n\n[[Page S8039]]\n\n     very good sun protection with ingredients that present \n     minimal health risks to users. Many sunscreens: lack UVA \n     protection; break down in the sun; make questionable product \n     claims, i.e. ``waterproof''; contain nano-scale materials \n     that raise questions; and absorb into the blood.\n       These problems are aggravated by the fact that FDA has not \n     finalized comprehensive sunscreen safety standards, called \n     the ``Sunscreen Monograph,'' they began drafting 30 years \n     ago. It took FDA 29 years to propose a Sunscreen Monograph. \n     It has been nearly a year and it has yet to finalize the \n     Monograph. EWG hopes it will do so quickly, but after 30 \n     years of delay, we must ensure consumers get the protections \n     they believe they are getting.\n       We commend you for your continued leadership in this area \n     and the introduction of The SUN Act. We look forward to \n     working with you to ensure its quick passage.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Richard Wiles\n                                               Executive Director.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID (for Mr. Kennedy (for himself, Mr. Bingaman, and Mr. \n        Sanders)):\n  S. 3431. A bill to establish expanded learning time initiatives, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today, along with Senators \nKennedy and Sanders, to introduce the Time for Innovation Matters in \nEducation, or TIME Act, of 2008. This bill would improve and expand \nstudents' instructional time, while ensuring rigorous standards, as a \nmeans to help close the academic achievement gap that exists for so \nmany of our disadvantaged students.\n  The fundamental principle underlying this bill is that the amount of \ninstructional time provided by the vast majority of school calendars is \nsimply inadequate for today's students and teachers. Teachers need more \ntime to plan and deliver instruction, and students need more time for \n21st century learning.\n  The demands on 21st century learners reflect the rapid increase in \ntechnological advances that we have all experienced in the last 30 or \n40 years. Twenty first century learning demands an increase in the \nrigor of mathematics and science education, and the acquisition of \nsubject area knowledge in areas that simply did not exist years ago, \nsuch as computer literacy. These increased demands should not be met at \nthe expense of ignoring other subjects such as social studies, art, and \nphysical education. Yet, these other areas are often ignored to allow \nfor time for some of the major academic subjects. That is the \nconsequence of failing to match the gradual increase in educational \ndemands with a corresponding increase in instructional time.\n  Instead, here we are in the 21st century, continuing to adhere to a \nschool calendar that was established over 100 years ago, and which was \ndesigned to accommodate a predominantly agricultural society. In nearly \nevery State, the school calendar is based on approximately 180 or fewer \ninstructional days, or on approximately 1000 instructional hours, per \nschool year. This means that American students are spending fewer than \n20 percent of their waking hours in school.\n  In the recent National Research Council report entitled, How People \nLearn, the authors comment on the importance of being realistic about \nthe amount of time it takes to learn complex subject matter. Simply \nput, they note that ``significant learning takes major investments of \ntime.'' The TIME Act is an initial investment that will provide \nteachers and students with the expanded opportunities they need to \nachieve high quality instruction and learning. We know that time needs \nare significant if our students are to achieve a 21st century \neducation.\n  Although all students are likely to benefit from expanded learning \ntime, we must prioritize these opportunities for students who are most \nat risk for poor academic achievement. International reports like the \nPISA study demonstrate that although American students, as a group, \nhave poor academic achievement relative to students in other \nindustrialized nations, this disparity is most pronounced for students \nthat are overrepresented among our Nation's poor. In fact, the 2006 \nPISA report shows that achievement scores for White, non-Hispanic \nstudents meet or exceed average scores reported across participating \nnations, whereas the average scores for Black or Hispanic students are \nwell below that average.\n  Likewise, although research has demonstrated that all students are at \nrisk for losing educational gains during the extended summer breaks \nthat are currently the norm for most schools, children from low income \nhouseholds experience significantly greater achievement losses during \nsummer breaks because they lack opportunities to attend the quality \nsummer programs available to their less disadvantaged peers. Each year, \nthis disparity contributes to the growing achievement gap. Researchers \nhave shown us that these out-of-school experiences account for most of \nthe achievement difference observed by 9th grade, which in turn \ninfluences when and whether students will graduate from high school and \nattend postsecondary school. Investing in more time during the school \nyear can help to diminish these achievement gaps, improve graduation \nrates, and make a lasting difference in these students' lives.\n  But effective expanded learning opportunities require more than just \nmore time. The time must be well spent. Students must be appropriately \nengaged in their learning, and teachers must have the training and \nsupport to use the longer school time effectively. Researchers have \nidentified that expanded learning time benefits teachers, by providing \nmore opportunities for cooperative planning and more time to \nindividualize instruction. Involved students and teachers are critical \nto successful expanded learning time programs, and both benefit from \neffective programming.\n  States have begun to explore expanded learning programs, and have \ndemonstrated their effectiveness. In Massachusetts, 10 schools \nconverted their calendars to expand the mandatory number of school days \nand the number of hours within a school day. Outcomes include not only \nincreased student achievement, but greater school satisfaction among \nparents, teachers, and students. In my own State of New Mexico, \nexpanded learning initiatives have been pursued, in the form of longer \nschool days or additional school days throughout the year. Early \nreports demonstrate increased achievement in math and reading, beyond \ngrade-level expectations. Unfortunately, the funds available for these \ninitiatives are limited to voluntary participation. We must make these \nprograms become a regular part of the school day for all students and \nteachers, particularly those who are greatest risk for academic \nfailure.\n  Most districts and State educational agencies do not have the \ncapacity or infrastructure to guide, support, and fund expanded \nlearning day programs, but good models for turning around low-\nperforming schools do exist. Federal support can be used to build \nStates' and schools' capacity based on evidence from such models.\n  Towards this goal, the TIME Act will: provide incentives for States \nand local educational agencies to develop plans for research-based, \nsustainable, and replicable expanded learning programs, for high-\npriority schools, with a focus on increasing rigorous and varied \ninstructional opportunities for students and teachers; allow local \neducational agencies to determine appropriate objectives of their \nextended learning programs, such as increasing math and science scores \nfor all students, enhance art or physical education, or increase \nacademic English proficiency for English language learners; encourage \nStates to take a leadership role and deliver technical assistance to \nschools that implement such programs; encourage schools to form \npartnerships with organizations that have successful track records in \nsupporting or delivering effective expanded learning programs; and \npromote research on expanded learning program implementation, through \nlocal, State, and national data collection efforts. The results of \nthese evaluations can inform best practices for future delivery of \nexpanded learning models to additional schools.\n\n  I would like to thank Chairman Kennedy for his leadership on this \nlegislation, and for his ongoing commitment to enhancing educational \nopportunities for all Americans; particularly our most disadvantaged \nyouths. Moreover, Senator Kennedy's State of Massachusetts is a leader \nin school-wide expanded learning initiatives. Massachusetts has \ndemonstrated that expanded\n\n[[Page S8040]]\n\nlearning enhances students' success, and it has done so in formerly \nstruggling schools in some of the State's poorest school districts.\n  The TIME Act expands upon these models of success by promoting \nsimilar initiatives across the country. I hope that this legislation \nwill be incorporated into reauthorization of the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act, and I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Like my colleagues Senator Kennedy and Sanders, I believe that all \nstudents deserve the time needed for a quality education. I also \nbelieve that all schools should expand well beyond their current \nlimited calendar, especially if America is to maintain and increase its \ncompetitive edge in the global economy. We must invest in a systematic \napproach to improving schools so that every child graduates prepared \nfor success. The TIME Act is an initial investment toward this goal.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BIDEN (for himself, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Casey, Mr. Voinovich, \n        and Mr. Webb):\n  S. 3433. A bill to ensure that any agreement with Iraq containing a \nsecurity commitment or arrangement is concluded as a treaty or is \napproved by Congress; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Today I join a bipartisan group of Senators in introducing \nthe Iraq Security Agreement Act of 2008. This bill, consistent with the \nConstitution of the United States, prohibits the Bush administration \nfrom entering into a binding security agreement with Iraq without the \napproval of Congress. It would also prohibit the obligation of any \nfunds to implement such an agreement.\n  I regret that I am compelled to introduce this legislation. If the \nPresident had embarked on these negotiations in a more responsible \nmanner--by being clear about the objective, by ensuring that the \nagreements would not tie the hands of the next administration, by \nactively consulting with Congress as a partner in the process--this \nbill would be unnecessary. But the Administration has done none of \nthese things, and so my colleagues and I want to ensure that Congress, \nand thus the American people, is brought into the process.\n  Let me take a step back and summarize how we got to this point. From \nOctober 2003 until the present day, the American military presence in \nIraq has been authorized under international law through a series of UN \nSecurity Council Resolutions. Last November, President Bush and Prime \nMinister Maliki signed a ``Declaration of Principles,'' which set out a \nframework for our countries to negotiate, by yesterday--July 31, 2008--\nagreements governing cooperation in the political, economic and \nsecurity spheres. The Declaration indicated that the two countries \nwould not seek to renew the United Nations mandate for American troops \nin Iraq past December 31, 2008. Among other things, the Declaration \ncontemplates ``providing security assurances and commitments to the \nRepublic of Iraq to deter foreign aggression against Iraq'' and \nsupporting Iraq ``in its efforts to combat all terrorist groups,'' \nincluding Al-Qaeda, Saddamists, and ``all other outlaw groups \nregardless of affiliation.'' In other words, all the folks fighting in \nIraq and killing each other.\n  The Declaration may result in two pacts. One would be a ``Strategic \nFramework Agreement'' that will ``set the broad parameters of the \noverall bilateral relationship in every field,'' according to the U.S. \nAmbassador to Iraq, Ryan Crocker. This might be better titled ``What \nthe United States will do for Iraq,'' because it consists mostly of a \nseries of promises that flow in one direction--promises by the United \nStates to a sectarian government that has thus far failed to reach the \npolitical compromises necessary to build a stable country.\n  The second agreement is a ``Status of Forces Agreement'' or SOFA, \ngoverning the presence of U.S. forces in Iraq, including their entry \ninto the country and the immunities to be granted to them under Iraqi \nlaw. The administration claims that this agreement is mostly \n``routine'' because we have SOFAs with over 90 countries around the \nglobe. But conditions our soldiers face in Iraq are far from \n``routine,'' despite recent improvements in security. Moreover, this \nSOFA would be much broader than the typical SOFA, from what we know. It \nwould provide us with access to bases from which our military would \noperate, provisions that are usually in a separate facilities or \n``basing'' agreement. This SOFA would also deal with contractor \nimmunity, would permit U.S. forces to engage in combat operations in \nIraq, and would provide authority for detaining insurgents. This is not \na typical SOFA.\n  One of these agreements will reportedly contain a ``security \narrangement''--a pledge by the United States to consult on next steps \nif Iraq is threatened. The Administration suggests that such an \nagreement is unremarkable, and that it does not bind the United States. \nBut at a time when we have over 100,000 troops on the ground, an \nexpansive program to train and equip Iraqi forces, and multiple U.S. \nmilitary facilities, the pledge is, in reality, little different from a \nbinding security commitment. Certainly, the government of Iraq and its \npeople will perceive that we are signing up to defend Iraq against \nexternal threats.\n  Yesterday's deadline has apparently not been met. The New York Times \nreports, however, that the Bush administration and Iraqi government are \nclose to an agreement. But Congress still remains largely in the dark.\n  We have not seen draft language. We do not definitively know which \nportions of the agreement will be binding, and which will not be. We \nare not in a position to evaluate whether the agreement will create \nobligations--either legal or political--that will constrain the next \nadministration, whether Democratic or Republican. The President cannot \nmake such a sweeping commitment on his own authority. Congress must \ngrant approval. The legislation we introduce today requires that \nCongress be made part of the process.\n  I have often stated that no foreign policy can be sustained without \nthe informed consent of the American people. More than 5 years ago, \nPresident Bush went to war in Iraq without gaining that consent--by \noverstating the intelligence and understating the difficulty, cost and \nduration of the mission.\n  In the final months of his term, President Bush is once again acting \nwithout the informed consent of the American people, putting us on a \ncourse to commit the Nation to a new phase of a long war in Iraq, and \nthereby bind his successors to his vision of U.S. policy in Iraq. By \nthese agreements, the President will make it harder for his successor \nto change course.\n  Let me be clear. I support the concept of a Status of Forces \nAgreement with Iraq. But not at the cost of limiting our operational \nlatitude or making security commitments--legal or political--that are \nnot approved by Congress.\n  Administration officials have indicated that the Iraqi government is \nresisting the inclusion of key provisions that U.S. forces need in \norder to operate in Iraq. Given the difficulty of securing Iraq's \nconsent to the broad authorities that the United States now has by \nvirtue of the U.N. Security Council Resolutions, I believe the best \noption for the United States at this juncture is to seek an extension \nof the current United Nations Security Counsel resolution for Iraq.\n   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3433\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Iraq Security Agreement Act \n     of 2008''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) On November 26, 2007, President George W. Bush and \n     Prime Minister of Iraq Nouri al-Maliki signed the Declaration \n     of Principles for a Long-Term Relationship of Cooperation and \n     Friendship Between the Republic of Iraq and the United States \n     of America (in this Act referred to as the ``Declaration of \n     Principles''), with the goal of concluding a final agreement \n     or agreements between the United States and Iraq by July 31, \n     2008, ``with respect to the political, cultural, economic, \n     and security spheres.''\n       (2) The Declaration of Principles contemplates the United \n     States ``providing security assurances and commitments to the \n     Republic of Iraq to deter foreign aggression.''\n\n[[Page S8041]]\n\n       (3) In 1992, pursuant to section 1457 of the National \n     Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1991 (50 U.S.C. \n     404c), the executive branch submitted a report to Congress on \n     then-existing security commitments and arrangements.\n       (4) The report described in paragraph (3) defined a \n     ``security commitment'' as an ``obligation, binding under \n     international law, of the United States to act in the common \n     defense in the event of an armed attack on that country.'' \n     The report noted that all current security commitments of the \n     United States are ``embodied in treaties which receive the \n     advice and consent of the Senate.''\n       (5) The report defined a ``security arrangement'' as a \n     ``pledge by the United States to take some action in the \n     event of a threat to that country's security. Security \n     arrangements typically oblige the United States to consult \n     with a country in the event of a threat to its security. They \n     may appear in legally-binding agreements, such as treaties or \n     executive agreements, or in political documents, such as \n     policy declarations by the President, Secretary of State or \n     Secretary of Defense.''\n       (6) The United States Ambassador to Iraq, Ryan Crocker, has \n     stated that the agreements to be concluded as anticipated by \n     the Declaration of Principles will ``deal with the status of \n     U.S. and coalition forces in Iraq past 2008'' and ``set the \n     broad parameters of the overall bilateral relationship in \n     every field''.\n       (7) On November 26, 2007, Assistant to the President and \n     Deputy National Security Advisor for Iraq and Afghanistan, \n     Lieutenant General Douglas Lute, stated, ``We don't \n     anticipate now that these negotiations [under the Declaration \n     of Principles] will lead to . . . formal inputs from \n     Congress.''\n\n     SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) any agreement that sets forth the ``broad parameters of \n     the overall bilateral relationship [as between the United \n     States and the Republic of Iraq] in every field,'' \n     particularly one that includes a security commitment or \n     arrangement provided to the Republic of Iraq by the United \n     States, would result in serious military, political, and \n     economic obligations for the United States, and thus, \n     consistent with past practice, should involve a joint \n     decision by the executive and legislative branches; and\n       (2) a short-term extension of the mandate of the Multi-\n     National Force in Iraq (currently provided by United Nations \n     Security Council Resolution 1790 (2007)), would, in concert \n     with Iraqi law, provide United States forces with the \n     authorities, privileges, and immunities necessary for those \n     forces to carry out their mission in Iraq.\n\n     SEC. 4. ANNUAL REPORT ON SECURITY AGREEMENTS.\n\n       (a) Reports Required.--Not later than 180 days after date \n     of the enactment of this Act, and every February 1 \n     thereafter, the President shall submit to the appropriate \n     congressional committees a report (in both classified and \n     unclassified form) on United States security commitments to, \n     and arrangements with, other countries.\n       (b) Content.--Each report submitted under subsection (a) \n     shall include the following:\n       (1) The text, and a description, of each security \n     commitment to, or arrangement with, one or more other \n     countries, whether based upon--\n       (A) a formal document (including a mutual defense treaty, a \n     status of forces agreement, a pre-positioning arrangement or \n     agreement, an access agreement, or a non-binding declaration \n     or letter); or\n       (B) an expressed policy, whether expressed orally or in \n     writing.\n       (2) An assessment of the need to continue, modify, or \n     discontinue each of those commitments and arrangements in \n     view of the changing international security situation.\n\n     SEC. 5. CONSULTATION WITH CONGRESS.\n\n       Not later than 30 days after the date of the enactment of \n     this Act, the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Defense \n     shall consult with the appropriate congressional committees \n     about the negotiations pursuant to the Declaration of \n     Principles. After the initial consultation, the Secretary of \n     State and the Secretary of Defense shall keep such committees \n     fully and currently informed regarding the status of the \n     negotiations. Prior to finalizing any agreement that includes \n     a security commitment or security arrangement with Iraq, the \n     Secretary of State should provide the text of the agreement \n     to the appropriate congressional committees.\n\n     SEC. 6. PROHIBITIONS.\n\n       (a) Prohibition on Entry Into Force of Certain \n     Agreements.--No agreement containing a security commitment \n     to, or security arrangement with, the Republic of Iraq, may \n     enter into force except pursuant to Article II, section 2, \n     clause 2 of the Constitution of the United States (relating \n     to the making of treaties) or unless authorized by a law \n     enacted on or after the date of the enactment of this Act \n     pursuant to Article I, section 7, clause 2 of the \n     Constitution (relating to the enactment of laws).\n       (b) Prohibition on Use of Funds.--No funds may be obligated \n     or expended to implement an agreement containing a security \n     commitment to, or security arrangement with, the Republic of \n     Iraq, unless it enters into force pursuant to Article II, \n     section 2, clause 2 of the Constitution of the United States \n     or is authorized by a law enacted on or after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act pursuant to Article I, section 7, \n     clause 2 of the Constitution.\n       (c) Point of Order.--It shall not be in order for either \n     House of Congress to consider any bill, resolution, \n     amendment, or conference report that provides budget \n     authority for the implementation of an agreement entered into \n     in contravention of subsection (a).\n\n     SEC. 7. APPROPRIATE CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEES DEFINED.\n\n       In this Act, the term ``appropriate congressional \n     committees'' means--\n       (1) the Committee on Armed Services of the Senate;\n       (2) the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate;\n       (3) the Committee on Armed Services of the House of \n     Representatives; and\n       (4) the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of \n     Representatives.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN:\n  S. 3434. A bill to combat organized crime involving the illegal \nacquisition of retail goods for the purpose of selling those illegally \nobtained goods through physical and online retail marketplaces; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise to discuss legislation that I am \nintroducing today, the it Combating Organized Retail Crime Act of 2008.\n  This bill addresses a persistent and growing problem that costs \nretailers billions of dollars and poses serious health and safety risks \nfor consumers. Organized retail crime involves the coordinated theft of \nlarge numbers of items from retail stores with the intent to resell \nthose items. Typically, crime organizations hire teams of professional \nshoplifters to steal over-the-counter drugs, health and beauty aids, \ndesigner clothing, razor blades, baby formula, electronic devices and \nother items from retail stores. Using sophisticated means for evading \nanti-theft measures, and often the assistance of employees at stores, \nthe thieves target 10-15 stores per day. They steal thousands of \ndollars worth of items from each store and deliver the items to a \nprocessing and storage location. There, teams of workers sort the \nitems, remove anti-theft tracking devices, and remove labels that \nidentify the items with a particular store. In some instances, they \nchange the expiration date, replace the label with that of a more \nexpensive product, or dilute the product and repackage the modified \ncontents in seemingly-authentic packaging. The items are then stored in \na warehouse, often under poor conditions that result in the \ndeterioration of the contents.\n  Organized retail crime rings typically sell their stolen merchandise \nin different markets, including flea markets, swap-meets, and online \nauction sites. Online sales are of particular concern, since the \ninternet reaches a worldwide market and allows sellers to operate \nanonymously and maximize return. A growing number of multi-million \ndollar organized retail crime cases involve internet sales. For \nexample, in Florida recently law enforcement agents arrested 20 people \nin a $100 million case involving the sale of stolen health and beauty \naids on an online auction site and at flea markets.\n  Organized retail crime has a variety of harmful effects. Retailers \nand the FBI estimate that it costs retailers billions of dollars in \nrevenues and costs states hundreds of millions of dollars in sales tax \nrevenues. With respect to certain products, such as baby formula and \ndiabetic test strips, improper storage and handling by thieves creates \na serious public safety risk when the products are resold. The proceeds \nof organized retail crime are often used to finance other forms of \ncriminal behavior, including gang activity and drug trafficking.\n  The Combating Organized Retail Crime Act would address this problem \nin several ways. First, it would toughen the criminal code's treatment \nof organized retail crime by refining certain offenses to capture \nconduct that is currently being committed by individuals engaged in \norganized retail crime, and by requiring the U.S. Sentencing Commission \nto consider relevant sentencing guideline enhancements.\n  Second, the bill would require physical retail marketplaces, such as \nflea markets, and online retail marketplaces, such as auction websites, \nto review the account of a seller and file a suspicious activity report \nwith the Justice Department when presented with documentary evidence \nshowing that the seller is selling items that were illegally obtained. \nIf the physical or online retail marketplace is presented\n\n[[Page S8042]]\n\nwith clear and convincing evidence that the seller is engaged in such \nillegal activity, it must terminate the activities of the seller. This \nrequirement will lead to greater cooperation between retail \nmarketplaces, retailers and law enforcement, and will result in an \nincreased number of organized retail crime prosecutions.\n  Third, the bill would require high-volume sellers on online auction \nsites (meaning sellers that have obtained at least $10,000 in annual \ngross revenues on the site) to display a physical address, post office \nbox, or private mail box registered with a commercial mail receiving \nagency. This requirement will help online buyers get in touch with \nsellers, and assist law enforcement agents who wish to identify people \nwho may be selling stolen goods online. It is analogous to a provision \nin the federal CAN-SPAM Act, which also requires persons who send mass \nemails to disclose their physical addresses.\n  This legislation has broad support in the retail industry in my home \nstate of Illinois and nationwide. It is supported by the Illinois \nRetail Merchants Association, the National Retail Federation, the \nRetail Industry Leaders Association, the Food Marketing Institute, the \nNational Association of Chain Drug Stores, and the Coalition to Stop \nOrganized Retail Crime, whose members include such retail giants as \nHome Depot, Target, Wal-Mart, Safeway, Walgreens, and Macy's.\n  In summary, the Combating Organized Retail Crime Act addresses a \nserious problem that hurts businesses that are struggling to survive in \na weak economy, and that harms consumers who unknowingly purchase \nstolen items that have been subjected to tampering. It heightens the \npenalties for organized retail crime, shuts down criminals who are \nselling stolen goods, and places valuable information about illegal \nactivity into the hands of law enforcement. This bill is a big step \nforward in the fight against a nationwide problem, and I urge my \ncolleagues to support it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3434\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Combating Organized Retail \n     Crime Act of 2008''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Organized retail crime involves the coordinated \n     acquisition of large volumes of retail merchandise by theft, \n     embezzlement, fraud, false pretenses, or other illegal means \n     from commercial entities engaged in interstate commerce, for \n     the purpose of selling or distributing such illegally \n     obtained items in the stream of commerce. Organized retail \n     crime is a growing problem nationwide that costs American \n     companies and consumers billions of dollars annually and that \n     has a substantial and direct effect upon interstate commerce.\n       (2) The illegal acquisition and black-market sale of \n     merchandise by persons engaged in organized retail crime \n     result in an estimated annual loss of hundreds of millions of \n     dollars in sales and income tax revenues to State and local \n     governments.\n       (3) The illegal acquisition, unsafe tampering and storage, \n     and unregulated redistribution of consumer products such as \n     baby formula, over-the-counter drugs, and other items by \n     persons engaged in organized retail crime pose a health and \n     safety hazard to consumers nationwide.\n       (4) Investigations into organized retail crime have \n     revealed that the illegal income resulting from such crime \n     often benefits persons and organizations engaged in other \n     forms of criminal activity, such as drug trafficking and gang \n     activity.\n       (5) Items obtained through organized retail crime are \n     resold in a variety of different marketplaces, including flea \n     markets, swap meets, open-air markets, and Internet auction \n     websites. Increasingly, persons engaged in organized retail \n     crime use Internet auction websites to resell illegally \n     obtained items. The Internet offers such sellers a worldwide \n     market and a degree of anonymity that physical marketplace \n     settings do not offer.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to limit the use of certain interrogation techniques, \nto require notification of the International Committee of the Red Cross \nof detainees, to prohibit interrogation by contractors, and for other \npurposes; to the Select Committee on Intelligence.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today, Senators Rockefeller, \nWhitehouse, Hagel, Feingold and I introduce legislation to end coercive \ninterrogations and secret detentions by the Central Intelligence \nAgency.\n  These practices have brought shame to our Nation, have harmed our \nability to fight the war on terror, and, I believe, violate U.S. law \nand international treaty obligations.\n  It is time to repudiate torture and secret disappearances. It is time \nto end the outsourcing of coercive interrogations to the lowest bidder. \nIt is time to return to the norms and values that have driven the \nUnited States to greatness for decades, but have been tarnished in the \npast 7 years.\n  It is now public knowledge that the Bush administration, in the Vice \nPresident's words, turned to ``the dark side.'' The ``gloves came \noff.'' In the name of counterterrorism, the CIA resorted to \nwaterboarding--an interrogation technique invented in the Spanish \nInquisition to force false confessions and punish enemies.\n  In a mistaken effort to gain better intelligence, the CIA used this \nsame technique that the Justice Department has prosecuted and the State \nDepartment has decried overseas. The administration used warped logic \nand faulty reasoning to say waterboarding technique was not torture. It \nis.\n  Waterboarding is the only technique to be publicly confirmed by this \nadministration. There are others that have not been acknowledged but \nare still authorized for use. This has to end.\n  But we will never turn this sad page in our Nation's history until \nall coercive techniques are banned, and are replaced with a single, \nclear, uniform standard across the United States Government.\n  That standard is the one set out in the Army Field Manual. Its \ntechniques work for the military and for the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation. If the CIA would abide by its terms, it would work for \nthe CIA as well.\n  The first provision in this legislation requires the Intelligence \nCommunity to follow the Army Field Manual. That is already the law for \nthe Department of Defense.\n  It is supported by 43 retired generals and admirals and by a \nbipartisan group of former Secretaries of State and Defense, \nAmbassadors, and national security advisors.\n\n[[Page S8045]]\n\n  Majorities in both houses of Congress passed this provision earlier \nthis year, sending a clear message that we do not support coercive \ninterrogations. Regrettably, the President's veto stopped it from \nbecoming law.\n  The second provision in this legislation requires that access to any \ndetainee being held by the intelligence community be provided to \nmembers of the International Committee of the Red Cross.\n  Access by the ICRC is a hallmark of international law and is required \nby the Geneva Conventions. We believe that granting access to the ICRC \nis the best way to ensure that the same right will be afforded to U.S. \nforces if they are ever captured overseas.\n  But ICRC access has been denied at CIA black sites in the war on \nterror. This has, in part, opened the door to the abuses in detainee \ntreatment. Independent access prevents abuses like we witnessed at Abu \nGhraib and Guantanamo Bay. It is time that the same protection is in \nplace for the CIA as well, in the well-established rules that the \nmilitary has used for years.\n  Finally, this legislation contains a ban on contractor interrogators \nat the CIA. As General Hayden has testified, the CIA uses outside \ncontractors to conduct these interrogations.\n  We should not be using coercive interrogation techniques at all. But \nI firmly believe that outsourcing these interrogations to private \ncompanies is a way to diminish accountability and to avoid getting the \nAgency's hands dirty. I also believe that the use of contractors leads \nto more brutal interrogations than if they were done by Government \nemployees.\n  We remain a nation at war, and credible, actionable intelligence \nremains a cornerstone of our war effort. But that is not what the CIA \ndetention and interrogation program has provided.\n  Every single experienced interrogator tells us that coercive \ntechniques will get someone to say what the interrogator wants to hear. \nBut that doesn't make it true.\n  In fact, coercive interrogations and the threat of torture produced \nthe information that Saddam Hussein was providing al Qaeda with WMD \ntraining. That wasn't true, but it helped lead us to war in Iraq.\n  Military and FBI interrogators also tell us that when they build a \nrapport with a detainee, they get more information, and more valuable \ninformation, than when it is coerced.\n  Beyond that, our Nation has paid an enormous price because of these \ninterrogations. They cast shadow and doubt over our ideals and our \nsystem of justice. Our enemies have used our practices to recruit more \nextremists. Our key global partnerships, crucial to winning the war on \nterror, have been strained.\n  Look at two of our closest allies in the world. The British \nParliament no longer trusts U.S. assurances that we will not torture \ndetainees. The Canadian Government recently added the United States to \nits list of nations that conduct torture.\n  This is not the country that we want to be. Torture and \ndisappearances do not befit the nation that I know.\n  It is time to restore America's integrity.\n  It will take time to resume our place as the world's beacon of \nliberty and justice. This bill will put us on that path and start the \nprocess. I urge its passage.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3437\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to prohibit the use of funds for the establishment of \nNational Marine Monuments unless certain requirements are met; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I introduce this bill today to prevent \nmisuse of the Antiquities. Act of 1906 to create very large marine \nmonuments. The Antiquities Act was intended to protect landmarks, not \ncreate the largest protected areas in the United States unilaterally \nwithout congressional assent.\n  The Bush administration acted covertly to convey protected status to \n139,000 square miles of the northwestern Hawaiian Islands. In so doing, \nthe administration short-circuited the extensive Marine Sanctuaries \nprocess that was already underway and notified the delegation only \nafter the press conference. Now they have turned their attention to the \nGulf of Mexico.\n  We learned that the President, with mixed support from his top \nadvisors, is considering using his authorities under the Antiquities \nAct to unilaterally and permanently declare ``marine monuments'' in \nvarious locations of the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone. Some of these \nareas are in my backyard--in the Gulf of Mexico--but other areas of the \nAtlantic and Pacific are also under consideration.\n  I certainly understand the need to conserve and appropriately manage \nour most sensitive and vulnerable marine areas, which can serve as \nnurseries for fish stocks and provide critical habitat for other \nimportant species. That is why I support the processes Congress \nestablished in the National Marine Sanctuaries Act. But any \ndeclarations of new or additional protected status to marine areas \nshould continue to follow the scientific and public processes outlined \nin the Sanctuaries Act. This is a good process that allows all affected \nparties--from the environmental community to recreational fishermen to \nthe oil and gas industries--to have a say.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. LANDRIEU:\n  S. 3447. A bill to reprogram $15,000,000 in savings in the Jackson \nBarracks military construction to the Department of the Interior for \nthe Historic Preservation Fund of the National Park Service for the \npurpose of restoring Jackson Barracks to its pre-Hurricane Katrina \nstatus as a national historic treasure; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I introduce this bill today to restore \nhistoric Jackson Barracks in New Orleans to its pre-Hurricane Katrina \nstatus as a national historic treasure. Jackson Barracks represents the \nrich military history of New Orleans, and indeed our great State. \nHowever, the rebuilding of the structures on this significant garrison \nhas been hindered by bureaucratic roadblocks and gaps in funding. This \nbill directly addresses those challenges.\n  As you know, Hurricane Katrina brought torrential floods and driving\n\n[[Page S8046]]\n\nwinds to New Orleans and the surrounding region. The devastation from \nthe storm touched every structure at Jackson Barracks. The original \nJackson Barracks consists of 14 Antebellum Garrison Structures built \nbetween 1834 and 1835. These historic buildings were not spared and \nsuffered tremendous damage.\n  There is a pressing need to complete the restoration and renovation \nof the barracks. Jackson Barracks requires additional renovations and \nrestorations that are not within the scope of the Federal Emergency \nManagement Agency hurricane restoration funding. With the agreement of \nthe Chief, National Guard Bureau and the Secretary of the Interior, \nthis bill would reprogram the savings from several military \nconstruction projects elsewhere on Jackson Barracks to assist in the \ncompletion of historic preservation at the post.\n  I ask the support of my colleagues in enabling the National Park \nService to aid in the restoration of Jackson Barracks through the \nHistoric Preservation Fund. I am not asking for additional dollars, but \nrather that the money that was saved on previous projects be \nrecommitted and used for this vital need.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. LANDRIEU:\n  S. 3448. A bill to reauthorize the Cane River National Heritage Area \nCommission and expand the boundaries of the Cane River National \nHeritage Area in the State of Louisiana; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \nreauthorize the Cane River National Heritage Area Commission and modify \nthe boundaries of the heritage area. In 1994, Congress recognized this \narea as one of the nation's cultural and historic treasures. In the \n1700s, Creole culture flowered across the stunning landscapes of the \nCane River, and the Creole culture continues to enliven the region to \nthis day. In terms of beauty, it is not only the landscape but the \nCreole architecture from that time period that charms visitors. Today, \nthe 35 mile region includes the Cane River Creole National Historical \nPark, seven national historic landmarks, three state historic sites, \nand 24 properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\n  Anchored by the city of Natchitoches, which traces its history to a \nFrench colonial settlement established in 1714 near the Natchitoches \nIndian village on the Red River, the region's colonial forts, Creole \nplantations, churches, cemeteries, archeological sites, historic \ntransportation routes, and commercial centers provide a unique view \ninto Louisiana's past.\n  I am proud to represent the people of Louisiana by asking the 110th \nCongress to reauthorize this National Heritage Area and reaffirm the \nimportance of the Cane River Creole culture as a nationally significant \nelement of American heritage.\n  This should not be a difficult task. Congress has once before agreed \nto establish a Cane River Creole National Historical Park to serve as \nthe focus of interpretive and educational programs on the history of \nthe Cane River area and to assist in the preservation of certain \nhistoric sites along the river. Now, I ask this Congress to do it again \nby reauthorizing the Cane River National Heritage Area.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3448\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to direct the Secretary of the Interior to study the \nsuitability and feasibility of designating sites in the Lower \nMississippi River Area in the State of Louisiana as a unit of the \nNational Park System, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nentitled the Lower Mississippi River National Historic Site Study Act. \nThis bill will direct the Secretary of the Interior to study the \nsuitability and feasibility of designating sites in Plaquemines Parish \nalong the Lower Mississippi River Area as a unit of the National Park \nSystem. To be eligible for favorable consideration as a unit of the \nNational Park System, an area must possess nationally significant \nnatural, cultural or recreational resources. The Lower Mississippi \nRiver area in Plaquemines Parish meets and exceeds these criteria.\n\n[[Page S8047]]\n\n  I am proud to come to the floor today to introduce this bill. Anyone \nwho has visited Plaquemines Parish knows that it is one of the Nation's \nunique treasures. The natural beauty there at the mouth of the \nMississippi is impossible to describe, but impossible not to love. The \narea is rich in history, and it is a preserve for one of the nation's \nmost unique cultural melanges.\n  That mix began after the Native Americans in the region began to \nintermingle with the Spanish explorers who traveled along the banks of \nthe river in the 1500s. In 1682, Rene-Robert Cavelier de LaSalle \nclaimed all the land drained by the Mississippi for France area. In \n1699, the area became the site of the first fortification on the Lower \nMississippi River, known as Fort Mississippi. Since then, it has been \nthe home to 10 different fortifications, including Fort St. Philip and \nFort Jackson.\n  Fort St. Philip, originally built in 1749, proved to be instrumental \nduring the Battle of New Orleans by blocking the British Navy from \ngoing up river. Fort Jackson was built at the request of General Andrew \nJackson and partially constructed by famous local Civil War General \nP.G.T. Beauregard. This fort was the site of the famous Civil War \nbattle know as the ``Battle of Forts'' which is also referred to as the \n``night the war was lost.''\n  As this glimpse of the region's military history shows, the Lower \nPlaquemines region is of national cultural and historical significance.\n  There are also many other important and unique attributes to this \narea. This area is home to the longest continuous river road and levee \nsystem in the U.S. It is also home to the ancient Head of Passes site, \nPlaquemines Bend, geological features and two national wildlife \nrefuges.\n  Finally, the area has a rich cultural heritage. Over the years, many \ndifferent cultures have made this area home including Creoles, \nEuropeans, Indians, Yugoslavs, African-Americans and Vietnamese. These \ncultures have worked together to create the infrastructure for \ntransportation of our Nation's energy which is being produced by these \nsame people out in the Gulf of Mexico off our shores. They have also \ncreated a fishing industry that contributes to Louisiana's economy.\n  I think it is easy to see why this area would make an excellent \naddition to the National Park Service. I hope that my colleagues will \njoin me in supporting this bill which simply allows the National Park \nService to study the suitability and feasibility of bringing this area \ninto the system. I look forward to working with my colleagues to \nquickly enact this bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3449\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Lower Mississippi River \n     National Historic Site Study Act of 2008''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Lower Mississippi area located south of New \n     Orleans, Louisiana, which is known as ``Plaquemines Parish'', \n     has great historical significance;\n       (2) from the earliest Spanish explorers traveling along the \n     banks of the Lower Mississippi River in the 1500's, to Robert \n     de LaSalle claiming all of the land drained by the Lower \n     Mississippi River in 1682, to the petroleum, fisheries, and \n     transportation industries of today, the area is one of the \n     most unique areas in the continental United States;\n       (3) while, in 1699, the area became the site of the first \n     fortification on the Lower Mississippi River, known as ``Fort \n     Mississippi'', it has since been home to 10 different \n     fortifications, more than a dozen light houses, and several \n     wildlife refuges, quarantine stations, and pilot stations;\n       (4) of particular interest to the area are--\n       (A) Fort St. Philip, originally built in 1749, at which, \n     during the Battle of New Orleans, the British navy was \n     blocked from going up river and a victory for the Colonial \n     Army was ensured; and\n       (B) Fort Jackson, built across from Fort St. Philip at the \n     request of General Andrew Jackson and partially constructed \n     by famous local Civil War General P.G.T. Beauregard, which \n     was the site of the famous Civil War battle known as the \n     ``Battle of the Forts'', which is also referred to as the \n     ``night the war was lost'';\n       (5) the area is--\n       (A) at the end of the longest continuous river road and \n     levee system in the United States; and\n       (B) a part of the River Road highway system;\n       (6) lower Plaquemines Parish is split down the middle by \n     the Mississippi River, surrounded on 3 sides by the Gulf of \n     Mexico, and crossed by numerous bayous, canals, and ditches;\n       (7) Fort Jackson and Fort St. Philip are located on--\n       (A) an ancient Head of Passes site; and\n       (B) 1 of the most historic areas on the Lower Mississippi \n     River known as ``Plaquemines Bend'';\n       (8) the modern Head of Passes is only 21 miles south of \n     Fort Jackson and Fort St. Philip where the Mississippi River \n     splits into a bird foot delta to travel the last 20 miles to \n     the Gulf of Mexico;\n       (9) there are numerous geological features that are unique \n     to a large river mouth or delta that could make a national \n     park in the area a particularly intriguing attraction;\n       (10) the coastal erosion, subsidence, river hydraulics, \n     delta features, fresh, salt, and brackish water marshes, and \n     other unique features of the area could be an effective \n     classroom for the public on the challenges of protecting our \n     river and coastal zones;\n       (11) the area includes the beginning of the Mississippi \n     River flyway, which is--\n       (A) 1 of the most pristine eco-sites in the United States; \n     and\n       (B) the site of 2 national wildlife refuges and 1 state \n     wildlife refuge;\n       (12) the area is culturally diverse in history, population, \n     industry, and politics;\n       (13) many well-known characters lived or performed deeds of \n     great notoriety in the area;\n       (14) in the area, Creoles, Europeans, Indians, Yugoslav, \n     African-Americans, and Vietnamese all worked together to \n     weave an interesting history of survival and success in a \n     very treacherous environment;\n       (15) the area has tremendous tourism potential, \n     particularly for historical tourism and eco-tourism, because \n     of the location, pristine ecosystems, and past indifference \n     of the local government to promote tourism in the area; and\n       (16) since Hurricane Katrina, the local government in the \n     area has--\n       (A) passed a resolution strongly supporting a national park \n     study; and\n       (B) shown an interest in developing tourism in the area.\n\n     SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act:\n       (1) Study area.--\n       (A) In general.--The term ``Study Area'' means the Lower \n     Mississippi River area in the State of Louisiana.\n       (B) Inclusions.--The term ``Study Area'' includes Fort St. \n     Philip and Fort Jackson, the Head of Passes, and any related \n     and supporting historical, natural, cultural, and \n     recreational resources located in Plaquemines Parish, \n     Louisiana.\n       (2) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' mean the Secretary \n     of the Interior, acting through the Director of the National \n     Park Service.\n\n     SEC. 4.

Res. 643\n\n       Whereas, on April 25, 2008, China's official news agency \n     Xinhua expressed the willingness of the Government of China \n     to meet with envoys of the Dalai Lama;\n       Whereas, on May 4, 2008, Special Envoy of His Holiness the \n     Dalai Lama Lodi Gyari and Envoy Kelsang Gyaltsen met with \n     Chinese Executive Vice Minister Zhu Weiqun and Executive Vice \n     Minister Sithar for one day of talks, in which the Government \n     of China alleged that the Dalai Lama instigated the March \n     2008 unrest in autonomous Tibetan areas of China, and was \n     sabotaging the Olympic Games;\n       Whereas Hu Jintao, General Secretary of the Communist Party \n     of China, released a statement after this meeting saying that \n     his Government of China was committed to a ``serious'' \n     dialogue with the Dalai Lama;\n       Whereas, at the United States-European Union (EU) Summit on \n     June 10, 2008, the United States and the European Union \n     issued a joint statement welcoming the decision by the \n     Government of China to hold talks with representatives of the \n     Dalai Lama, and urged ``both parties to move forward with a \n     substantive, constructive and results-oriented dialogue at an \n     early date'';\n       Whereas the Envoys of His Holiness the Dalai Lama's Kelsang \n     Gyaltsen and Lodi Gyari visited Beijing from June 30 to July \n     3, 2008, to conduct the seventh round of the Tibetan-Chinese \n     dialogue;\n       Whereas, during these talks, the Government of China issued \n     a new set of demands, including that the Dalai Lama prove \n     that he does not support Tibetan independence or disruption \n     of the Olympic Games in Beijing;\n       Whereas the Dalai Lama has stated multiple times he does \n     not favor the independence of Tibet and is instead seeking \n     negotiations to address the legitimate grievances of, and \n     provide genuine autonomy for, the Tibetan people within the \n     People's Republic of China, and is committed to non-violence;\n       Whereas the Dalai Lama has repeatedly and publicly declared \n     his support for the Olympic Games in China, as well as his \n     intention to attend the opening ceremony, if invited;\n       Whereas, at the conclusion of the July round of talks, \n     officials of the Government of China did not accept a \n     proposal by the representatives of the Dalai Lama to agree to \n     a joint statement supporting a continuation of the dialogue \n     process;\n       Whereas Special Envoy Lodi Gyari said on July 5, 2008, that \n     the talks with the Government of China, called for by the \n     international community, were ``disappointing and \n     difficult'';\n       Whereas, in contrast to the opinion of Special Envoy Lodi \n     Gyari, President George W. Bush said on July 6, 2008, that \n     ``it looks like there's some progress, at least in the talks \n     with the Dalai Lama'';\n       Whereas officials of the Government of China subsequently \n     stated that the talks with the Dalai Lama's envoys are only \n     about the Dalai Lama's personal future, rather than about the \n     future of Tibet;\n       Whereas the Office of the Dalai Lama on July 17, 2008, \n     restated its position that the talks are about ``the future \n     of 6,000,000 Tibetans in Tibet and not His Holiness the Dalai \n     Lama'';\n       Whereas, on July 11, 2008, the European Parliament adopted \n     a resolution that ``welcomes the resumption of contacts, \n     after the events of March 2008 in Lhasa, between the \n     representatives of the Dalai Lama and the Chinese \n     authorities'' and ``encourages the two parties to intensify \n     these contacts so as to establish the bases for mutual trust, \n     without which it will be impossible to arrive at a mutually \n     acceptable political solution'';\n       Whereas, on the official stage during the Olympic torch's \n     relay through Lhasa on June 21, 2008, China's Communist Party \n     chief in the Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR), Zhang Qingli, \n     said, ``Tibet's sky will never change and the red flag with \n     five stars will forever flutter high above it. . . . [W]e \n     will certainly be able to totally smash the splittist schemes \n     of the Dalai Lama clique.'';\n       Whereas, in reference to Zhang Qingli, the International \n     Olympics Committee said in a rare rebuke that it ``regrets \n     that political statements were made during the closing \n     ceremony of the torch relay in Tibet''; and\n       Whereas China's People's Armed Police troops have been sent \n     to monasteries in Tibetan areas to give monks ``relevant \n     information'' about the Olympics, and Chinese authorities \n     have stepped up ``patriotic education'' campaigns designed to \n     conform the religious practices of Tibetan Buddhists to \n     Communist Party rules, including forcing monks and nuns to \n     denounce the Dalai Lama: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) urges the Dalai Lama or his representatives and the \n     Government of the People's Republic of China to begin earnest \n     negotiations, without preconditions, to provide for a \n     mutually agreeable solution that addresses the legitimate \n     grievances of, and provides genuine autonomy for, the Tibetan \n     people;\n       (2) urges that the talks in October 2008 between the \n     Government of China and the Dalai Lama should focus on the \n     welfare, cultural, political, and religious autonomy of the \n     Tibetan people, and not on the person of the Dalai Lama;\n       (3) affirms that the human rights of Tibetans and their \n     right to practice religion free of government regulation is \n     not an internal matter of any one country;\n       (4) urges the President to take a more personal and engaged \n     interest in the successful conclusion of these negotiations, \n     both unilaterally and in coordination with United States \n     allies; and\n       (5) calls on the United States Government to press the \n     Government of China--\n       (A) to respect freedom of speech and freedom of \n     association, as required by international law and as \n     enshrined in the Constitution of China and to release those \n     who have committed no crime other than peaceful protest; and\n       (B) to end the ``patriotic education'' campaign against lay \n     and clerical Tibetans and allow Tibetans to practice their \n     religion freely.\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a resolution with \nmy colleague, Senator Feingold, supporting the human rights and \nreligious freedom of Tibetans.\n  Last March, I was one of many people worldwide who watched as Tibetan \ndemonstrations in China exploded into violence. These protests \nreflected long-standing frustration with the harsh measures imposed on \nTibetans by the Government of China. Among other harassment, Tibetans \ncan be required to undergo propaganda-based ``political education,'' \ndetained without judicial due process, and are forbidden from \npossessing pictures of the Dalai Lama. After the March 2008 unrest, \nmuch of the international community urged China and the Dalai Lama to \nenter a positive, results-based dialogue on the human rights of \nTibetans living. Unfortunately, these pleas have apparently fallen on \ndeaf ears in Beijing. After the latest round of Tibetan-Chinese \ndialogue from June 30 to July 3, the Tibetan representatives expressed \ndisappointment that the two sides could not even agree on a joint \nresolution calling for more talks. Progress, it seems, has been almost \nnon-existent.\n  As a result, Senator Feingold and I are introducing a resolution \nurging that the talks--real, results-oriented talks--continue. We also \ncall for the United States to press the Government of China to make a \nserious commitment to the human rights and religious freedom of \nTibetans living on its soil, and an end to forced ``political \neducation'' of Tibetans. The aim of the dialogue between the Government \nof China and the Dalai Lama must include an end to harassment of lay \nand religious Tibetans, and genuine autonomy for ethnically Tibetan \nregions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/08/01/senate-section/article/S8048-2", "month": "08", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8048-S8049]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 644--DESIGNATING SEPTEMBER 2008 AS ``NATIONAL CHILD \n    AWARENESS MONTH'' TO PROMOTE AWARENESS OF CHARITIES BENEFITTING \n CHILDREN AND YOUTH-SERVING ORGANIZATIONS THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES \n AND RECOGNIZING EFFORTS MADE BY THESE CHARITIES AND ORGANIZATIONS ON \nBEHALF OF CHILDREN AND YOUTH AS A POSITIVE INVESTMENT IN THE FUTURE OF \n                           THE UNITED STATES\n\n  Mr. BURR (for himself and Mrs. Feinstein) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                               S.Res. 644\n\n       Whereas millions of children and youth in the United States \n     represent the hopes and future of the United States;\n       Whereas numerous individuals, charities benefitting \n     children, and youth-serving organizations that work with \n     children and youth collaborate to provide invaluable services \n     to enrich and better the lives of children and youth \n     throughout the United States;\n       Whereas raising awareness of and increasing support for \n     organizations that provide access to healthcare, social \n     services, education, the arts, sports, and other services \n     will result in the development of character and the future \n     success of children and youth;\n       Whereas the President issued a proclamation on May 30, \n     2008, proclaiming June 1, 2008 as ``National Child's Day'' to \n     demonstrate a commitment to the youth of the United States;\n       Whereas September, as the school year begins, is a time \n     when parents, families, teachers, school administrators, and \n     communities increase their focus on children and youth \n     throughout the United States;\n\n[[Page S8049]]\n\n       Whereas September is a time for the people of the United \n     States to highlight and be mindful of the needs of children \n     and youth;\n       Whereas private corporations and businesses have joined \n     with hundreds of national and local charitable organizations \n     throughout the United States in support of a month-long focus \n     on children and youth;\n       Whereas designating September 2008 as ``National Child \n     Awareness Month'' would recognize that a long-term commitment \n     to children and youth is in the public interest, and will \n     encourage widespread support for charities and organizations \n     that seek to provide a better future for the children and \n     youth of the United States: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate designates September 2008 as \n     ``National Child Awareness Month''--\n       (1) to promote awareness of charities benefitting children \n     and youth-serving organizations throughout the United States; \n     and\n       (2) to recognize efforts made by such charities and \n     organizations on behalf of children and youth as a positive \n     investment in the future of the United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/08/01/senate-section/article/S8049-1", "month": "08", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8049]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 645--HONORING THE LIFE OF ANNE LEGENDRE ARMSTRONG\n\n  Mr. CORNYN (for himself and Mrs. Hutchison) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S.

Res. 647\n\n       Whereas the term ``fetal alcohol spectrum disorders'' \n     includes a broader range of conditions and therefore has \n     replaced the term ``fetal alcohol syndrome'' as the umbrella \n     term describing the range of effects that can occur in an \n     individual whose mother drank alcohol during pregnancy;\n       Whereas fetal alcohol spectrum disorders are the leading \n     cause of cognitive disability in western civilization, \n     including the United States, and are 100 percent preventable;\n       Whereas fetal alcohol spectrum disorders are a major cause \n     of numerous social disorders, including learning \n     disabilities, school failure, juvenile delinquency, \n     homelessness, unemployment, mental illness, and crime;\n       Whereas the incidence rate of fetal alcohol syndrome is \n     estimated at 1 out of 500 live births and the incidence rate \n     of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders is estimated at 1 out of \n     every 100 live births;\n       Whereas, although the economic costs of fetal alcohol \n     spectrum disorders are difficult to estimate, the cost of \n     fetal alcohol syndrome alone in the United States was \n     $5,400,000,000 in 2003 and it is estimated that each \n     individual with fetal alcohol syndrome will cost taxpayers of \n     the United States between $1,500,000 and $3,000,000 in his or \n     her lifetime;\n       Whereas, in February 1999, a small group of parents of \n     children who suffer from fetal alcohol spectrum disorders \n     came together with the hope that in 1 magic moment the world \n     could be made aware of the devastating consequences of \n     alcohol consumption during pregnancy;\n       Whereas the first International Fetal Alcohol Syndrome \n     Awareness Day was observed on September 9, 1999;\n       Whereas Bonnie Buxton of Toronto, Canada, the co-founder of \n     the first International Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Awareness Day, \n     asked ``What if . . . a world full of FAS/E [Fetal Alcohol \n     Syndrome/Effect] parents all got together on the ninth hour \n     of the ninth day of the ninth month of the year and asked the \n     world to remember that during the 9 months of pregnancy a \n     woman should not consume alcohol . . . would the rest of the \n     world listen?''; and\n       Whereas on the ninth day of the ninth month of each year \n     since 1999, communities around the world have observed \n     International Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Awareness Day: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates September 9, 2008, as ``National Fetal \n     Alcohol Spectrum Disorders Awareness Day''; and\n       (2) calls upon the people of the United States--\n       (A) to observe National Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders \n     Awareness Day with appropriate ceremonies--\n       (i) to promote awareness of the effects of prenatal \n     exposure to alcohol;\n       (ii) to increase compassion for individuals affected by \n     prenatal exposure to alcohol;\n       (iii) to minimize further effects of prenatal exposure to \n     alcohol; and\n       (iv) to ensure healthier communities across the United \n     States; and\n\n[[Page S8050]]\n\n       (B) to observe a moment of reflection on the ninth hour of \n     September 9, 2008, to remember that during the 9 months of \n     pregnancy a woman should not consume alcohol.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/08/01/senate-section/article/S8050-1", "month": "08", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8050]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 648--RECOGNIZING THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE CROSSING \nOF THE NORTH POLE BY THE USS NAUTILUS (SSN 571) AND ITS SIGNIFICANCE IN \n              THE HISTORY OF BOTH OUR NATION AND THE WORLD\n\n  Mr. DODD (for himself, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Reed, and Mr. Whitehouse) \nsubmitted the following resolution; which was referred to the committee \non Armed Services:\n\n                              S.

Res. 649\n\n       Whereas Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (also \n     known as ADHD or ADD), is a chronic neurobiological disorder \n     that affects both children and adults, and can significantly \n     interfere with the ability of an individual to regulate \n     activity level, inhibit behavior, and attend to tasks in \n     developmentally-appropriate ways;\n       Whereas ADHD can cause devastating consequences, including \n     failure in school and the workplace, antisocial behavior, \n     encounters with the criminal justice system, interpersonal \n     difficulties, and substance abuse;\n       Whereas ADHD, the most extensively studied mental disorder \n     in children, affects an estimated 3 to 7 percent (4,000,000) \n     of young school-age children and an estimated 4 percent \n     (8,000,000) of adults across racial, ethnic, and socio-\n     economic lines;\n       Whereas scientific studies indicate that between 10 and 35 \n     percent of children with ADHD have a first-degree relative \n     with past or present ADHD, and that approximately \\1/2\\ of \n     parents who had ADHD have a child with the disorder, \n     suggesting that ADHD runs in families and inheritance is an \n     important risk factor;\n       Whereas despite the serious consequences that can manifest \n     in the family and life experiences of an individual with \n     ADHD, studies indicate that less than 85 percent of adults \n     with the disorder are diagnosed and less than \\1/2\\ of \n     children and adults with the disorder receive treatment and, \n     furthermore, poor and minority communities are particularly \n     underserved by ADHD resources;\n       Whereas the Surgeon General, the American Medical \n     Association, the American Psychiatric Association, the \n     American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, the \n     American Psychological Association, the American Academy of \n     Pediatrics, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, \n     and the National Institutes of Mental Health, among others, \n     recognize the need for proper diagnosis, education, and \n     treatment of ADHD;\n       Whereas the lack of public knowledge and understanding of \n     the disorder play a significant role in the overwhelming \n     numbers of undiagnosed and untreated cases of ADHD, and the \n     dissemination of inaccurate, misleading information \n     contributes as an obstacle for diagnosis and treatment;\n       Whereas lack of knowledge combined with issues of stigma \n     have a particularly detrimental effect on the diagnosis and \n     treatment of the disorder;\n       Whereas there is a need for education of health care \n     professionals, employers, and educators about the disorder \n     and a need for well-trained mental health professionals \n     capable of conducting proper diagnosis and treatment \n     activities; and\n       Whereas studies by the National Institute of Mental Health \n     and others consistently reveal that through proper \n     comprehensive diagnosis and treatment, the symptoms of ADHD \n     can be substantially decreased and quality of life can be \n     improved: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates September 18, 2008, as ``National Attention \n     Deficit Disorder Awareness Day'';\n       (2) recognizes Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder \n     (ADHD) as a major public health concern;\n       (3) encourages all Americans to find out more about ADHD, \n     support ADHD mental health services, and seek the appropriate \n     treatment and support, if necessary;\n       (4) expresses the sense of the Senate that the Federal \n     Government has a responsibility to--\n       (A) endeavor to raise awareness about ADHD; and\n       (B) continue to consider ways to improve access and quality \n     of mental health services dedicated to improving the quality \n     of life of children and adults with ADHD; and\n       (5) calls on Federal, State, and local administrators and \n     the people of the United States to observe the day with \n     appropriate programs and activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/08/01/senate-section/article/S8050-3", "month": "08", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8050]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 650--RECOGNIZING THE IMPORTANCE OF NATIONAL NEIGHBOR \n     DAY, NATIONAL GOOD NEIGHBOR DAY, AND NATIONAL NEIGHBORHOOD DAY\n\n  Mr. REED (for himself, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Whitehouse, and Mr. Tester) \nsubmitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee \non the Judiciary:\n\n                              S.
