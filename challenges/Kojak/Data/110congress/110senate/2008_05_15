Mr. President, following leader time, the Senate will \nresume consideration of the conference report to accompany the Food, \nConservation, and Energy Act, H.R. 2419. There will be 90 minutes for \ndebate on the conference report.\n  I might add in passing that Senators worked until about 11 o'clock \nlast night on this important piece of legislation.\n  The Senate will vote on any motions relating to the conference report \nprior to a vote on its adoption. Senators should expect the first vote \nof the day to begin about 11:05, 11:10, depending on how long Senator \nMcConnell and I take. Upon disposition of the conference report, we \nexpect to begin the process of appointing conferees to the budget \nresolution conference. Senators should expect rollcall votes to occur \nthroughout the day.\n  I would note that there is a 1 p.m. filing deadline for first-degree \namendments to the collective bargaining legislation, H.R. 980.\n  As I mentioned last night, when we finish adoption of the conference \nreport, it will be up to Senators Judd Gregg and Kent Conrad to \ndetermine how many motions will be filed to instruct conferees. Other \nSenators can do that, of course, but it would have to be through the \ntwo managers. There is a total of 10 hours on that. We would hope that \ntime could be shortened significantly. We are going to finish that \ntonight, the appointing of conferees.\n  I have spoken to Senator Dorgan. We have the media cross-ownership \nmatter that he has proceeded forward with under a statute Senator \nNickles and I passed in the early 1990s. The statutory time limit on \nthat is 10 hours. Senator Dorgan told me last night that he would take \n1 hour. I would hope others wouldn't take much more time than that. \nThat being the case, there is an opportunity to finish that tonight. I \nhope that is the case. Otherwise, we would finish that tomorrow.\n  Tomorrow, we have scheduled now a cloture vote on the collective \nbargaining matter we worked on this week. As I indicated last night, we \nare going to see if Senators Kennedy and Gregg can work something out \non that, along with the comanager of the bill, Senator Enzi. If they \ncan give us some way to proceed to complete that, maybe we can work out \na unanimous consent that we wouldn't have to do the cloture vote. I \nthink the ability to do that is somewhat slim, but I never give up \nhope. It might be possible.\n  The point being, we have a lot to do. We are going to work late \ntonight unless there is some agreement that shortens the time \nsignificantly on the appointing of conferees and the cross-ownership \nissue dealing with the Dorgan proposal. I think that is what we have \nahead of us.\n  The reason I am making sure we complete everything this week, the \nHouse is going to pass, sometime today, the supplemental. We have no \nvotes on Monday. I would hope we could start maybe on that issue on \nMonday because we would like to do some other things next week. But \nthat is a big issue to deal with. The House can jam things through, as \nwe all know, because they have different rules than we do. But over \nhere we have to follow our rules, which are not the\n\n[[Page S4212]]\n\nHouse rules. So one of the first things we will do when we see what the \nHouse finally does, because we don't know yet, is I will sit down and \ntalk to the Republican leader and find out if there is a way we can \nproceed to allow people to do what they think is necessary on the bill \nbut at least make it so it is more understandable and we are not here \nthis coming Friday, a week from tomorrow, 8, 9 o'clock at night, still \ntrying to figure out what we are going to do on that. As contentious as \nthis matter is, I would like to have an orderly process on which to \nmove forward.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/15/senate-section/article/S4212-1", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4212]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the \nundaunted courage and fighting spirit of one soldier from the \nCommonwealth of Kentucky. CPL Joseph H. Cantrell IV was lost on April \n4, 2007, in Taji, Iraq, when an improvised explosive device detonated \nnear his vehicle during combat operations. The Westwood, KY, native was \n23 years old.\n  For his valor in uniform, Corporal Cantrell received several awards, \nmedals and decorations, including the National Defense Service Medal, \nthe Army Commendation Medal, the Bronze Star Medal, and the Purple \nHeart.\n  After Corporal Cantrell was gone, his mother, Sondra Adkins, met a \nwoman at a hospital who said that her nephew was also a soldier. He had \nbeen wounded and then saved by an Army medic, and now was going to name \nhis son after the medic who had treated him. That medic's name was \nJoey.\n  ``My son saved her nephew's life,'' Sondra reveals.\n  Those who knew Joey growing up in Boyd County, in northeastern \nKentucky, were not surprised at the impact the young man could have on \nothers. Sondra remembers when an excited Joey called her to say ``there \nis nothing more beautiful than bringing a baby into the world.''\n  ``By chance, he got to deliver a baby during his Army training,'' \nSondra says. ``He was high on life that day. That wasn't a planned \nevent. He called and said, `You're not going to believe this . . . I \ngot to deliver a baby.' ''\n  Joey was an Army medic who saved lives in Iraq. He brought the same \nenthusiasm to his job that he once had as a child who would dress up in \ncamouflage and green paint on Halloween and go out as ``G.I. Joey.''\n  At Westwood's Fairview High School, Joey was a member of Who's Who \nand the National Honors Society, and played football and ran track.\n  ``I didn't want him to run track because he was so short,'' Sondra \nrecalls. ``The hurdles came up to his hipbone. But he could clear those \nhurdles and come out . . . as the best hurdle jumper. . . . Track was \nhis calling. He could flat-out fly.''\n  Joey's dad, Joe Cantrell, remembers eating lunch with his son just \nbefore a big hurdle race. ``We went to eat and Joey told me, `Dad, I'm \ngoing to win this because they don't think I can,' '' Joe says. ``When \nthe gun went off, all they saw was his back end. When he'd get his \nconfidence built up, he was fun to watch in sports.''\n  ``Joey had the perfect life in high school,'' Sondra adds. ``Dating \nthe head cheerleader, excelling on the football team. He was very \noutgoing.''\n  Joey graduated from Fairview in 2002, and attended Ashland Community \nCollege. One day he came to his mother and said, ``Mom, I have \nsomething to prove.''\n  ``I said, `You don't have anything to prove to anybody,' '' Sondra \nsays. ``He replied, `You're right. I have to prove this to myself.' I \nwas prepared for my son to move out, but I wasn't prepared for my son \nto live halfway around the world.''\n  Joey enlisted in the U.S. Army on March 31, 2005. ``He joined the \nArmy to see how high he could fly without someone to catch him,'' his \nfather, Joe, says. ``There was no quit in him.''\n  Joey was assigned to the 2nd Battalion, 8th Cavalry Regiment, 1st \nBrigade Combat Team, 1st Cavalry Division, based out of Fort Hood, TX, \nand in October 2006, he was deployed to Iraq in support of Operation \nIraqi Freedom.\n  One day he called his mom from Iraq after saving a fellow soldier's \nlife. ``Mama, the only thing the soldier was worried about was if he \nwould be able to walk again and continue serving his country,'' he told \nher.\n  ``He loved his job,'' Sondra adds. ``They're out there to do a job \njust like all of us--but theirs is the most dangerous of all.''\n  Joe says that Joey eventually wanted to study sports medicine. Sondra \nrecalls Joey wanting to be a doctor, perhaps an obstetrician.\n  On the day of Joey's funeral, students from the local schools lined \nup alongside the road holding flags to watch the procession drive by. \n``I couldn't believe the turnout from the community,'' Sondra says. The \ncity of Westwood dedicated Main Street in Joey's memory.\n  Mr. President, our prayers are with the Cantrell family after their \ntragic loss. We are thinking of Joey's mother, Sondra Adkins; his \nfather, Joe Cantrell; his brother, Chase Adkins; his stepfather, Bryan \nAdkins; his grandmother, Pehylien Mullins; his aunts Anita Hollo, \nJeannie Mullins, Elisa Lambert, and Janie Hill; and other beloved \nfamily members and friends. Joey was predeceased by his grandfather, \nClaude Mullins.\n  At Boyd County High School in Ashland, a teacher named Mary Beth \nLeadingham Patton started ``Project Joey.'' Mary Beth is an old friend \nof Joey's mother, Sondra.\n  ``She was one of the first visitors to come to my house to see my \nJoey when he was born,'' Sondra recalls.\n  Project Joey is simple: When Mary Beth's kids pass someone in \nuniform, they stop and say thank you.\n  ``Those young men and those young women--we truly do not know what \nthey've had to see in their lives,'' Sondra says. ``We should always be \nthankful that we have someone who's gone that extra mile for all of \nus.''\n  Sondra, of course, does know some of what our men and women in \nuniform have seen, as she watched her little Joey grow into a man, a \npatriot and a dedicated soldier.\n  And although he is gone, it is not too late to thank CPL Joseph H. \nCantrell IV. This United States Senate is honored to pay tribute to his \nlife of service, and we pause with reverence for the sacrifice he made \non his Nation's behalf.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/15/senate-section/article/S4212-4", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4212]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Ninety minutes, evenly divided.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I am sorry, an hour and a half--45 minutes on each side--\nand then we will proceed to start voting on the farm bill.\n  We had a great debate last night. I appreciate all the Senators who \ncame over and spoke so forcefully and favorably for this bill. There \nare a few more speakers who want to speak this morning, and then we \nwill have a little bit of a wrap-up again.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor for others who want to start \nspeaking on the farm bill.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I again thank Senator Harkin for his \nleadership on this issue. We did have a good, long debate last night, \nand a number of folks had an opportunity to come over and voice their \nopinion about the bill. We look forward to wrapping this up this \nmorning and having a vote, hopefully, around 11:15, 11:30.\n  I urge those folks who want to speak--we have had a number who have \nindicated they wish some time. Obviously, we are pretty squeezed with a \ncompacted morning this morning, so folks need to make their wishes \nknown and be here to be ready to speak.\n  I wish to start off by recognizing the Senator from Idaho, who has \nbeen a critical asset to us with respect particularly to the specialty \ncrop section in this farm bill. I ask the Chair to recognize Senator \nCraig for 5 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure to come to the \nfloor in the final hours of the debate over agricultural policy in this \ncountry and to, first and foremost, thank the two principals, who are \nhere on the floor, the chairman and ranking member of the Senate Ag \nCommittee. They have done yeoman work in a very difficult process--15 \ntitles and 673 pages of policy--in what is, without question, one of \nthe most complicated efforts at putting public policy and interest \ngroups within the agricultural community together in some degree of \nharmony. I thank my colleagues for the work they have done.\n  Mr. President, I will be brief, as I have already come to the floor \nseveral times to discuss the valuable programs included in this bill. \nBut I would be remiss not to take the opportunity to thank my \ncolleagues--and this Congress--for producing a good product for the \nAmerican people.\n  We have been ``tangled in inaction'' on so many issues. The American \npeople want a functional Congress.\n  The 2008 farm bill conference report represents a monumental feat for \nthe U.S. Congress. Every 5 years, we undertake the task of \nreauthorizing our farm policy. This version includes 15 titles; 673 \npages.\n  Though some who have not yet served on an agriculture committee \nduring the reauthorization of a farm bill may disagree, let me assure \nyou this is one of the most complicated pieces of legislation \nconsidered by Congress, and it is also one of the most important.\n  In an age of skyrocketing energy prices, economic uncertainty, and \nnow a global food crisis, there is at least one thing we should be able \nto be certain of: our Nation's food security. We cannot take for \ngranted our ability to feed ourselves, lest we become dependent on \nother countries for our food in addition to our oil.\n  How do we achieve food security? Here are a few key principles.\n  First and foremost, we enact policy designed to keep our food \nproducers productive and profitable, and ensure access to those foods \nfor all Americans. This includes things such as a safety net to protect \nfarmers from volatile price swings; and nutrition programs that give \naccess to fresh fruits and vegetables in schools.\n  We enact policy that incentivizes state-of-the-art conservation \npractices to encourage the best possible stewardship of our \nagricultural lands. This will ensure these lands stay productive and \nprofitable for future generations. And we enact policy that helps \nAmerican agriculture continue to diversify--including becoming a larger \nplayer not only in our food security, but also in our energy security.\n  This bill does just that. This bipartisan work product--aptly named \nthe Food, Conservation and Energy Act of 2008--sets a strong and secure \ndirection for our food, conservation and energy future.\n  The bill has broad support from virtually every corner of my State of \nIdaho, and every corner of the Nation.\n  Congress has heard from rural farmers to urban food banks calling for \npassage of this vital piece of legislation.\n  Mr. President, 500 farm, conservation, nutrition, consumer, and \nreligious groups sent a letter supporting passage of the farm bill \nconference report.\n  These groups--with one voice--recognized that the bill ``makes \nsignificant farm policy reforms, protects the safety net for all of \nAmerica's food producers, addresses important infrastructure needs for \nspecialty crops, increases funding to feed our nation's poor, and \nenhances support for important conservation initiatives.''\n  It is not a perfect bill--we all will admit this--but it is a great \nbill. I commend my colleagues for their work.\n  The President has stated his intention to veto this bill. It is not \noften that I so strongly disagree with our Commander in Chief, but on \nthis I must. There are too many great things in this bill to deny its \npassage over a few areas of disagreement, too many important things for \nmy State of Idaho, and for the Nation.\n  We began several years ago to ensure that specialty crops were \nadequately recognized in this new farm bill. We now have a new title \ndevoted to horticulture and organic agriculture. It dedicates \napproximately $3 billion for specialty crop, pest and disease, \nnutrition, research, trade and conservation priorities important to \nthis vital industry that represents nearly half of all crop cash \nreceipts in our country, including: $466 million for Specialty Crop \nBlock Grants to support local efforts to enhance competitiveness of \nlocal products; $1 billion to expand the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable \nSnack Program to all 50 States--which will help our school children \ndevelop healthy eating habits; $377 million for a pest and disease \nprogram to combat costly damage to crops such as our famous potatoes; \n$230 million for the Specialty Crop Research Initiative to address food \nsafety, mechanization, plant breeding, and other priorities; $59 \nmillion for trade assistance and market promotion to maintain and grow \nour international markets; and many other programs.\n  Idaho's famous potatoes, our burgeoning table grape and wine grape \nindustry, our apples and onions and carrots and nursery and ornamental \ncrops--and this just touches the surface of both our current production \nand our potential to continue to diversify.\n  Now, it should be noted that this is only one part of the effort to \nensure the competitiveness of our specialty crop industry. The next \nstep is to ensure that we have an adequate workforce to conduct the \nlabor in which the average American refuses to participate. The \nharvesting of those healthy fruits and vegetables--this, I contend, is \nas important, or more important, than these ``competitiveness'' \npriorities that we have finally set forward in the farm bill. So our \nwork is not done.\n  And I could go on for a great deal of time, talking about: the \ncommodity programs that create a vital safety net for our wheat, \nbarley, peas, lentils, chickpeas, oilseeds, sugar, wool producers, and \nso on; the conservation programs that will help Idaho's booming dairy \nindustry address environmental challenges associated with their growth, \nand our crop producers to incorporate better stewardship practices; the \nnutrition programs that are vital to improving the health of our youth; \nthe rural development programs that will ensure funding for things such \nas water and wastewater programs, broadband, and rural housing; the \nenergy programs that will help us reach the 36 billion gallon RFS by \ncreating new incentives for cellulosic ethanol and beginning to pare \ndown the subsidy for corn-based ethanol; the wildlife programs, such as \nthe provision authored by my colleague from Idaho, that creates \nincentives for endangered species recovery; the forestry, trade, \ncredit, disaster programs.\n  Those programs that will benefit the Nation--and my State of Idaho in \nparticular--are simply too vast to cover.\n\n[[Page S4214]]\n\n  I thank my colleagues once again, and urge support for this vital \npiece of legislation.\n  I will now speak, again, specifically to Idaho and to the specialty \ncrops provision that Senator Saxby Chambliss spoke to that is now a \nvery important part of agricultural policy.\n  We know specialty crops are about 51 percent of the gross revenue of \nAmerican agriculture, and yet they were never mentioned in agricultural \npolicy from a Federal level. Oh, yes, we had research and experimental \nprograms, and we targeted money into the specialty crop area, but the \nprogram crops--those kinds of base crops we think about, be it cotton, \nsoybeans, corn, wheat--all of those were the staples, if you will, of \nAmerican agriculture, while today they do not represent the majority of \nthe portfolio.\n  That is why several years ago I thought it was critically important \nwe begin to work to include a specialty crop title. So we began that \neffort. Today, we have completed that effort with the help of these two \nSenators and a broad-based coalition to now have a title devoted to \nhorticulture and organic agriculture.\n  In my State of Idaho, specialty crops are a big deal. Many people \nhave heard about potatoes and Idaho. It is almost synonymous in the \nminds of the average American. Yet, by definition, that is a specialty \ncrop. Is this a loan guarantee? No, it is not a loan guarantee. It is \nan effort to advance specialty crops in a variety of ways: specialty \ncrop grants to enhance competitive local markets; expanding the Fresh \nFruit and Vegetable Snack Program in our high schools and grade schools \nin all 50 States; pest and disease management control; research \nprograms in these areas; initiatives for food safety, mechanization, \nplant breeding and priorities to keep our edge, if you will, our world-\nclass edge in the area of specialty crops; along with trade assistance \nand market promotion.\n  That is a full title. Not only did these two Senators--our chairman \nand ranking member--who led the effort for us, get this in the bill, \nthey also got money behind it. Frankly, I thought maybe we would have \nto go the first 5 years simply authorizing the program and then \nbeginning to fund it. But there is now substantial money behind it. It \nwill go a long way toward helping the specialty crop areas and organic \nagriculture in the kind of farming many of our agricultural areas are \nmoving into.\n  When you get at the edge of urbanization and agriculture and \nagricultural farmland, boutique farming, small specialty crop farming \noftentimes becomes the transitional form of agriculture. To keep it \nprofitable on the land, so we can keep the land in agricultural \nproduction, is very important, and I think that is offered in all of \nthis.\n  I also thank my Idaho colleague, Mike Crapo, who has worked a long \nwhile on making the Endangered Species Act and those private properties \nthat care for endangered habitat--to have a relationship, to have an \nadvantage, to incentivize landowners to appreciate the reality of \nhaving an endangered species on their property. He has done that. Our \ncolleagues have recognized it. It is very important we do that.\n  I could go on a great deal more about the programs that are there: \nthe commodity programs that create a vital safety net for our wheat, \nbarley, peas, lentils, chickpeas, oil seeds, sugar, wool products, and \nso on; conservation programs that are adjusted and important.\n  A great deal of effort has been focused on energy over the last \nseveral years and agriculture's role in that. It is not by accident \nthat this bill has a title that recognizes energy, and that being a \npart of--a very valuable part of--American agriculture. To transition \ndollars out of a mature market in corn-based ethanol into cellulosics \nis a major step and a correct step in the right direction.\n  My time is up, but I want to thank my colleagues for the effort at \nhand. We had a solid vote out of the House last night. I think we are \ngoing to have a strong vote in the Senate today on this conference \nreport.\n  Let me say in closing, to the White House and to our President: Mr. \nPresident, you and your people have been at the table working on this \nprogram with us for well over a year. It is time you recognize the \nvalue of this program, what has been put into new agricultural policy, \nand support us in that effort.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes--and maybe more if he \nneeds it--to the Senator from North Dakota, who has been so \ninstrumental in getting us to this point.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank the Acting President pro tempore, \nand I especially thank the chairman of this committee, Senator Harkin. \nI said last night that without his vision, we would not have a vehicle \nof this quality that is this forward looking. I think now of the \nchairman of the committee as the father of a new conservation movement \nin this country because it was the steady pressure from the chairman of \nthe committee that has pushed us in a new direction for farm policy, \none far more oriented toward conservation. I believe in future years \nChairman Harkin will be looked upon as somebody who led a fundamental \nreorientation of agriculture policy, and he will be recognized as \nsomeone who broke the path for this new direction, and he deserves \nenormous credit for it.\n  I also again thank the ranking member, Senator Chambliss, who is a \npro's pro. If ever you were to want a partner in a very complicated \nendeavor, one in which trust among colleagues was absolutely essential \nto an outcome, you would want Senator Chambliss involved because his \nword is like gold. All of us who have dealt in difficult negotiations \nknow how critically important that is.\n  I also salute his superb staff: Martha Scott Poindexter, and Vernie \nHubert, who played such a critical role in advancing this legislation. \nAt the same time, I want to recognize the staff of the chairman: Mark \nHalverson, who I said last night has actually gone gray in this \nexercise--that is how much he has put into it--and Susan Keith, who has \nplayed a central role in the developing of the policy, deserves our \ncredit as well.\n  I also recognize Senator Baucus, the chairman of the Senate Finance \nCommittee, for the extraordinary contribution he has made throughout. \nHe has provided the kind of leadership you would hope for in an \nendeavor of this complexity, and I will be forever in his debt for what \nhe has done for not only production agriculture but what he did to \nconstruct the financing of this bill that made it possible to achieve \nwidespread bipartisan support.\n  Certainly I thank his ranking member, Senator Grassley, who played \nsuch a critical role as well.\n  I conclude my thank-yous by again thanking my staff: Tom Mahr, my \nlegislative director, who is exceptional and extraordinary and whose \nintelligence and good judgment have made such an important contribution \nto this result; and certainly to my lead negotiator, Jim Miller, who, \nas I said last night, is encyclopedic in his knowledge, but also wise \nin his construct of policy, and especially in his dealing with people, \nincluding me. Jim, I deeply appreciate the extraordinary sacrifices you \nand your family have made to help us write this bill. And finally, I \nthank Scott Stofferahn, my other lead negotiator, who also has a deep \nknowledge of farm policy, and who played such a key role in the \ndisaster provisions that themselves represent significant reform.\n  Let me conclude by saying: Why a bill at all? Well, because our major \ncompetitors have much more ambitious support for their producers than \nwe have for ours. This is a fact. The Europeans are providing more than \nthree times as much support to their producers than we provide to ours. \nIf we pulled the rug out from under our producers, it would be a \ncalamity for farmers and ranchers in this country. Where does the money \ngo? Well, this chart shows it I think as well as any could. Two-thirds \nof the money in this bill goes for nutrition. This is misnamed when we \ncall it a farm bill. This is a food bill. This is an energy bill \nbecause it helps reduce our dependence on foreign energy, a critically \nimportant priority for this country, and it is a conservation bill. \nConservation of our natural resources is critically important to the \nfuture.\n\n[[Page S4215]]\n\n  The other point I wished to make in conclusion is that this bill is \npaid for. It is pay-go-compliant. These are not my estimates; these are \nnot the Agriculture Committee's estimates, these are the professional \nestimates of the Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Committee on \nTaxation, which show this budget saves $67 million--not a lot of money, \nbut nonetheless it does not add to the deficit; in fact, it slightly \nreduces it. It saves $67 million over 5 years, and it saves $110 \nmillion over 10 years. It is completely paid for with no tax increase.\n  Final point: I received last night from the IRS what I think is a \nvery interesting set of facts. We have seen reported in the mass media \nthat a couple could earn $2.5 million and still get benefits. Well, \nthat is akin to the chance of getting struck by lightning because it \nturns out there are no tax returns in the entire country between $1 \nmillion and $1,250,000 that would have farm income below $750,000 and \nnonfarm income below $500,000. Zero. So all these press reports they \nhave written about how millionaires are going to be able to qualify, \nthey are wrong because there are no people in those rarified \ncategories. You would have to have $750,000 of farm income and $500,000 \nof nonfarm income and both husband and wife would have to be in \nprecisely those categories. Do you know what the problem with all those \nstories is? There are no people in those categories. That is not my \nreport; that is the report from the Internal Revenue Service.\n  Again, I wish to close by thanking those who have provided such \nextraordinary leadership, and I would be remiss in not mentioning Harry \nReid, who played behind the scenes a very quiet but strong leadership \nrole in helping us bring together all the people necessary to get this \nbill done. We should also thank the Speaker of the House on the other \nside and certainly the chairman, Chairman Peterson, who gave blood, \nsweat, and tears to this effort, and our own Congressman Earl Pomeroy, \nthe only Member serving on both the Ways and Means Committee and the \nAgriculture Committee, who made an important contribution to helping us \nget a breakthrough in the Ways and Means Committee on the financing.\n  This is good legislation. It is good for the country and certainly \ngood for my State but also fair to the taxpayers of this country \nbecause it is paid for, and it represents the most dramatic reform \nsince the 1949 act itself. That is a fact.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nMinnesota, Senator Coleman, who also has played a very valuable role in \ncrafting this bill. He has been a strong member of the Senate \nAgriculture Committee and a great advocate for not just the farmers and \nranchers in Minnesota but farmers and ranchers all across America.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Georgia. Along \nwith all the thanks that have been set forth by the Senator from North \nDakota, I wish to thank the Senator from North Dakota.\n  I went to Lake Bronson in northwest Minnesota in 2005, and the room \nwas filled with family farmers who were talking about disaster \nassistance. We look at the farm bill--and today we are at a time when \ncommodity prices are high. Folks look at that and say: Why do we need a \nsafety net? Why do we need a farm bill? Two years ago, I had people who \nwere struggling. The pain and fear on their faces was something I wish \nI had a picture of that I could show you.\n  My colleague from North Dakota has been a champion--a champion--for \nensuring that there is a safety net, particularly regarding disaster \nassistance. With all the partisan divide we have in this body, here we \nhave an example where it is not about partisan politics; it is about \ndoing the right thing. Folks have dirt under their fingernails who are \nhelping provide the safest, most affordable food supply in the world, \nand we are talking about a safety net. My colleague from North Dakota \nhas been a tremendous champion, and I wish to express my thanks.\n  Also, I see the chair of the Finance Committee, Senator Baucus, who \nhas also been involved in providing the kind of safety net that when \nbad things happen, we are going to be proud of this bill; we will be \nproud. So I wish to express my deep appreciation for the continuous \neffort that finally has yielded some fruit right here. It will be a \nshame if we don't make sure this becomes law.\n  These are tough times right now. Folks are worried about their jobs, \nthey are worried about the cost of food, they are worried about the \ncost of energy. I don't need an economist to tell me whether we are in \na recession or talk to Minnesota families and business owners to know \nfolks are worried out there. We need something that promotes job \ngrowth.\n  I come to the floor to ask my colleagues to work with me to pass one \nof the most critical economic stimulus packages this body will have a \nchance to vote on all year. This is a balanced proposal, both ensuring \nthe viability of a key economic sector--agriculture--and helping the \nmany Americans who are struggling to put food on the table. It is a \nfarm bill that we will soon vote to send to the President. At only 1.9 \npercent of the Federal budget, this farm bill will have enormous \nimpact--providing, as I said, a safety net for American agriculture \nthat in turn employs one out of five Americans and contributes roughly \n$3.5 trillion a year to the U.S. economy. In my State of Minnesota, \nagriculture generates $55 billion in economic activity and underpins \n367,000 jobs.\n  We labeled this bill, as folks have said, a farm bill, when in \nreality it is a food bill, a nutrition bill. Over 66 percent goes to \nthe nutrition safety net. We have all seen the rise in foreclosures and \nthe impact of food prices depleting our food shelters. Families are \nbeing hit hard right now. This farm bill helps meet the increased \nneeds. It provides an additional $10 billion above baseline to \nnutrition.\n  As the ranking member of the Nutrition Subcommittee, I worked hard to \nsee that nutrition programs--and the Emergency Food Assistance Program, \nEFAP, in particular--saw substantial increased funding. Well, we got \nit. The farm bill conference agreement will provide an additional $1.3 \nbillion for our food banks. I have been to Second Harvest and Heartland \nin St. Paul. The needs are great, and we are meeting those needs today.\n\n  The Food Stamp Program receives an almost $8 billion boost in this \nbill. Our Nation is too prosperous not to lend a helping hand when it \nis needed.\n  Despite the importance of the farm bill safety net for hungry \nfamilies, most of the attention is centered on the commodity programs. \nCommodity prices are high, critics say. The farmers are doing well. Why \nshould they get a safety net? The reality is the critics don't \nunderstand agriculture. They don't understand that although the \nimportance of agriculture to our economy is certain, the survival of \nindividual farm families is not. Once again, the farm bill supports a \nsector of the American economy that provides millions of jobs, and it \nis insulting to farmers who put their necks on the line every year to \nwake up with the Sun and work all day to say they should be able to \nfarm without a safety net.\n  I urge my colleagues to step into the shoes of one of my Minnesota \nfarmers for a moment. We see high prices in the world market today, but \nwe have no way of knowing whether the drought in Australia is going to \ncontinue or whether the consumption habits in countries on the other \nside of the world will change. Input costs for diesel and fertilizer \nare going through the roof. Meanwhile, depending on where your farm \nlies, Minnesota weather has kept you off the tractor, threatening your \nyields, and not knowing whether you will even have a product to sell \nfor those high prices.\n  What price is too high for a safety net that keeps farmers, such as \nthose in Minnesota, farming, despite all the uncertainty that allows \nthe agricultural economic engine to continue generating trillions of \ndollars? How about 0.27 percent of the Federal budget? That is what \nthis bill's commodity title costs. By the way, this bill's safety net \nis based on the structure of the 2002 farm bill that costs $20 billion \nless than expected.\n  From a jobs perspective, this bill is a bargain, and from a commodity \npayment reform perspective, this bill is historic. I firmly believe we \nshould\n\n[[Page S4216]]\n\neliminate waste, fraud, and abuse in farm programs and try to get the \nTed Turners of the world out of the commodity payment business. At the \nend of the day, no bill is perfect, but this bill is something we can \nbe proud of.\n  This bill will prevent payments from going to nonfarmers with an \nadjusted gross income over $500,000, an 80-percent reduction from \ncurrent law; repeal the triple-entity rule, reducing title I benefits \nby 50 percent for some producers. We require direct attribution of all \nbenefits to natural persons so we know exactly where it is going--100 \npercent transparency. We explicitly prevent farm benefits from ever \ngoing to a deceased person. There are other reforms. I could go on and \non.\n  I read a headline the other day: ``Fiscal Hawks Eye Farm Bill.'' They \nshould, because this is a fiscally responsible piece of legislation \nthat delivers big bang for the buck.\n  When I talked with my farmers, again, they told me the 2002 farm bill \nhad the right safety net, it just needed to be improved. And in this \nconference report, that is what we do. Building on the existing safety \nnet, the bill updates target prices and marketing loan rates for key \nMinnesota commodities such as wheat, barley, and soybeans. For sugar \nbeet farmers who have been waiting 15 years for updated loan rates, \nthere will finally be an increase. Minnesota's dairy farmers will be \nrelieved to hear the payment rate for the MILC Program will return to \n45 percent. I have appreciated Senator Leahy's leadership on this \nissue.\n  In addition to tweaking the current safety net, this farm bill also \ncreates entirely new programs that American farmers desperately need. \nOne I have talked about: permanent agriculture disaster assistance. The \nother is about sugar to ethanol. I take great pride in the sugar-to-\nethanol provision in this bill. This was a proposal that was once met \nwith indignation when I first raised it a few years ago. Even some \nfolks in Minnesota sugar country said it couldn't be done. But I \nbelieved then as I believe now--and clearly the conference report lays \nthis out--that it only makes sense to take excess sugar from trade \nagreements, get it off the market, and use it to help address our \ndependence on foreign oil. I saw what Brazil was achieving with oil \nindependence, largely as a result of the production of sugar ethanol. \nThe technology for sugar ethanol isn't out of reach. It is at our \nfingertips. U.S. sugar producers now share this vision and when this \nsugar ethanol program is implemented, we will be able to quickly add \nmore diversity to our economic food stocks. We have to end our \ndependence on foreign oil. We have to stop sending billions of dollars \nout of this country into the pockets of thugs and tyrants, such as \nAhmadinejad and Chavez, and we need to do it again with the renewables \nbeing a part of it. This bill does it.\n  The renewable energy vision doesn't stop there. It looks to the \nfuture by paving the way for the next generation of biofuels: \ncellulosic ethanol. Included in this bill is a program I have supported \nto promote the production, harvesting, and processing of biomass. The \nbill's biomass loan program will prioritize local ownership--local \nownership--so it is not the fat cats on Wall Street, as some say, but \nit is folks in our local communities who will benefit from America's \nenergy independence movement, which is renewables, which is biofuels.\n  On the tax side, there will be a $1 production tax credit for \ncellulosic ethanol. All in all, this bill provides $1.2 billion in new \nenergy investment.\n  This conference report is a real victory for Americans fighting \nhunger and working to feed the Nation, but it is also a victory for \nbipartisanship. I wish to thank the chairman, Senator Harkin, Senator \nConrad, and Senator Baucus for committing to a bipartisan process from \nthe very start and working with me throughout this process. It has been \na pleasure to sit across from them and my colleague, Senator Chambliss, \nand I appreciate the work they have done to produce something this \nNation needs right now.\n  I am disappointed the President intends to veto this bill. If he does \nthat, that is a mistake. I will work hard with my colleagues to \noverride that veto. This country needs this farm bill. I urge my \ncolleagues to join with me in supporting this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am going to yield 10 minutes to the \nSenator from Montana, Senator Baucus. Before I do, let me publicly \nthank Senator Baucus, the chairman of the Finance Committee, who is \nalso a very valuable member of our Agriculture Committee, for all his \nhelp on this farm bill. I can honestly say we wouldn't be here today \nhad it not been for the effort and the work of Senator Baucus and of \ncourse his ranking member, my colleague from Iowa, Senator Grassley, to \ncome up with the funds we needed not by raising taxes but by closing \nloopholes and thereby saving some money that they were able to give us \nso we could meet our needs in this farm bill. Senator Baucus and I came \nto Congress together in 1974. We were classmates. We have been friends \nthroughout all these years.\n  I thank Senator Baucus for all of his diligence also in attending all \nof the meetings of our conferences which went on and on for hours at a \ntime. He was always there as a valuable member giving his input into \ngetting us to this point. The farmers and ranchers of Montana and the \npeople who live in rural communities in Montana have no stronger voice, \nno better champion for them than the senior Senator from Montana. I \npublicly thank him for all of his help on this bill.\n  I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. First, I deeply thank my good friend from Iowa, Mr. \nHarkin. It has been a wonderful experience working the conference on \nthe farm bill where everybody worked together--both sides of the \naisle--and, frankly, both bodies. Basically, there were eight members \nof the conference, led by Senator Harkin and Senator Chambliss, who \nwere also invaluable. All of the core members of the conference could \ngo on and on about how great everybody was to work with. I have not \nexperienced anything like this before.\n  Mr. President, I am glad the Senate debated the farm bill. I am proud \nwe will pass a strong farm bill. This farm bill is very important to my \nhome State of Montana and for farmers and ranchers across America.\n  But too few Americans realize how important America's farmers and \nranchers are to the economy and the security of this country.\n  As we finish debate on the farm bill I want to take the opportunity \nto discuss how important a robust American agriculture sector is.\n  I also want to address some of the criticisms aimed at America's \nfarmers and ranchers.\n  Over the last few years, major newspapers and Washington special \ninterest groups have been busy demeaning our Nation's farmers and \nranchers.\n  The articles come with some pejorative titles, such as ``High Plains \nGrifters,'' ``Farmers at the Trough,'' and ``Hungry Kids, Greedy \nFarmers.''\n  These attacks are disappointing to many of us who have worked hard \nover the years to enact successful, supportive agriculture policy.\n  But there is a wide gulf between the claims being made in these \narticles and the reality of what is going on in farm and ranch country.\n  The articles waver between portraying farmers and ranchers in \ncompletely opposite ways. Either the corporate businessman leaching off \nthe Government dole or or the hayseed farmer unable to compete in the \nmarket economy without a handout.\n  Either the corporate businessman leaching off the Government dole or \nthe hayseed farmer unable to compete in the market economy without a \nhandout.\n  These portrayals are disappointing to me and disheartening to rural \nAmerica. And they are false.\n  I know that in this high-tech age it is tempting to downplay the \nimportance of those who put food on our table and clothes on our back. \nBut the better part of history would teach us to avoid the temptation.\n  The portrayals also inaccurately depict the agriculture economy while \nentirely missing the underlying problems that plague farmers and \nranchers.\n  One common attack on U.S. farm policy is that it is no longer for the \nfamily farm and ranch, but rather has become corporate welfare.\n  But even the most basic of research quickly uncovers that today \nnearly all\n\n[[Page S4217]]\n\nproducers in America remain family farms and ranches not corporations \nand conglomerates. In fact, only 2.2 percent of farms are nonfamily \nfarms.\n  Negative articles frequently refer to ``protectionist'' policies \nintended to shield farmers and ranchers from competition and to raise \nconsumer prices.\n  One group recently stated that we should simply ignore all the \nsubsidies and trade barriers of other countries. Unilaterally disarm \nour own farmers and ranchers. And then sit back and enjoy the benefits \nof cheaper imported food.\n  This makes zero sense. American consumers today spend a lower \npercentage of their disposable income on food than consumers anywhere \nelse around the world. In fact, American families are the only families \nin the world who spend less than 10 percent of their disposable income \non food.\n  Agriculture is also important to our economy, as became apparent \nearlier this decade when farmers and ranchers helped get the country \nthrough a manufacturing crisis.\n  Our farmers and ranchers managed this even as the average foreign \ntariff rate on agriculture products was and remains about 62 percent, \nwhile the United States average tariff is only around 12 percent.\n  President John F. Kennedy once said ``the Farmer is the only man in \nour economy who buys everything at retail, sells everything he sells at \nwholesale, and pays the freight both ways.'' That is true.\n  Farmers and ranchers are--and in my memory always have been--in the \nmiddle of a never-ending cost squeeze. For too many years we have asked \nour farmers and ranchers to do more and more and always with less.\n  So while all the negative news articles focus on the symptoms, they \nnever seem to get around to identifying and discussing the real \nproblems that plague our farmers and ranchers: skyrocketing costs and \nstagnant returns.\n  The next generation of farmers and ranchers, growing up all across \nrural America, has a more accurate view of what farming and ranching \nlife is really about than do urban newspapers and think tanks.\n  They see long days in the fields, unpredictability caused by \ndroughts, hail storms, hurricanes and floods and a low payoff at the \nend of the day. Too frequently, they decide it is not worth the effort \nto come back to the family farm.\n  That is one reason I was proud to champion the dependable, reliable \ndisaster program that is included in the farm bill. It is wrong when \nour farmers and ranchers are forced to wait up to 3 years for a \ndisaster payment. We can do better for our farmers, and we can do \nbetter for our taxpayers.\n  Farmers deserve a program and provides dependable, equitable relief \nwhen disaster strikes. Taxpayers deserve a program that requires \nfarmers to manage their risk through crop insurance. We have done both.\n  As we finish debate on this farm bill, I am proud to say that my goal \nhas been, and will always be, to increase the net income of America's \nfarmers and ranchers. I want a strong agricultural economy in this \ncountry. I want a strong, homegrown source of safe, affordable, and \nabundant food and fiber.\n  I believe this farm bill will strengthen our farm economy. I want to \nmention a couple provisions in the farm bill that will increase \nproducer's bottom line as well as strengthen rural America's Main \nStreets.\n  One of the biggest reforms in this farm bill is the country-of-origin \nlabeling compromise. The conference report simplifies COOL and makes it \nworkable for both our ranchers and our packers. These changes are a \nmajor step forward and will help as we undergo the transition this fall \nto mandatory COOL. I call this COOL reform.\n  Another major reform we have fought for since the 1990s is allowing \ninterstate shipment of State-inspected meat. There is no reason our \nsmaller packers should not be able to sell their meat out of State. \nNow, nearly 20 years later. This farm bill establishes a program that \nallows smaller, State-inspected packers to market their high quality \nmeat nationwide. This is a huge win for ranchers, packers and rural \nAmerica.\n  Whether it's a dependable disaster program, COOL reform, interstate \nshipment, a $10 billion bump to our nutrition programs, or a $4 billion \nincrease to our working-land conservation programs, there is a lot to \nbe proud of in this farm bill.\n  While the urban media creates visions of agriculture producers lining \nup for Government payments, I am more worried about our next generation \nof producers lining up to leave those family farms and ranches. It's so \nhard and such a tough life.\n  The great irony in the debate that swirls around U.S. farm policy \ntoday is that it is getting so much criticism from so many different \nquarters and yet it remains one of the truly great success stories in \nthe world.\n  As with anything else, there is always room for improvement. And I \nbelieve we have made improvements in this farm bill. But, every now and \nagain, especially in an age of such cynicism, I know my Montana farmers \nand ranchers would like to open their papers, turn on their televisions \nor radios, and just hear a simple thank you.\n  We really appreciate what you do to keep us clothed and fed like \nnobody else in the world has ever been before.\n  Mr. President, Emerson wrote:\n\n       What is a farm but a mute gospel? The chaff and the wheat, \n     weeds and plants, blight, rain, insects, sun--it is a sacred \n     emblem from the first furrow of spring to the last stack \n     which the snow of winter overtakes in the fields.\n\n  The farm bill conference report before us today is a tribute to that \nsacred emblem, that mute gospel, the farm. This bill will help to \naddress some of the challenges facing the farmer and rural America.\n  The conference report provides permanent disaster assistance for \nfarmers and ranchers. And the conference report also includes farm tax \nreforms that fund farm tax relief as well as agricultural and trade \nmeasures.\n  The tax package in the conference report will help farmers to \npreserve land and to protect endangered species. It will provide tax \nrelief for farmers and ranchers, and it will help America find \nhomegrown energy independence.\n  The trade-related measures in the conference report accomplish a \nnumber of vital purposes for this agriculture legislation. Trade \nprovisions help to fund the farm bill's provisions. And trade \nprovisions level the trade playing field for softwood lumber producers.\n  The new program in this conference report for relief from \nagricultural disasters is a notable achievement. Currently, Congress \naddresses agricultural disasters through ad hoc bills. Ad hoc disaster \nbills are not dependable. They are never timely. And they are often \nunfair.\n  After a disaster strikes, farmers and ranchers often have to wait \nyears to receive disaster assistance. We need a permanent disaster \nrelief program for our farmers and ranchers. We need a program that is \ndependable, timely, and equitable. The new program in this conference \nagreement will provide that.\n  Many Americans--including many leaders in Congress--say that \nAmerica's farm policy is ripe for reform. The farm bill conference \nreport includes important farm tax reforms.\n  The conference report will prevent the use of farm losses as a tax \nshelter by limiting the amount of farming losses that a taxpayer may \nuse on nonagricultural business income. It will ensure that farmers \nknow their tax obligations by requiring the Commodity Credit \nCorporation to always provide the IRS and the farmer with information \nreturns when the farmer repays a CCC market assistance loan. It will \nallow farmers to pay additional self-employment taxes to qualify for \nSocial Security.\n  Taken together with a slight decrease in the ethanol tax credit and \nother offsets, these reforms fully offset the tax and trade package in \nthis conference report.\n  American farmers and ranchers want to be responsible stewards of \ntheir land. But the financial pressure to sell to developers can be \nextreme. The farm bill conference report includes tax incentives to \nencourage and enable private landowners to promote conservation on \ntheir land.\n  The conference report provides conservation tax relief for retired \nand disabled farmers. It would exempt CRP payments to these individuals \nfrom self-employment taxes. And it would keep these payments from \nreducing their Social Security or disability payments.\n\n[[Page S4218]]\n\n  Nearly two-thirds of endangered and threatened species are found on \nprivate lands. So the conference report establishes a tax deduction for \nthe cost of landowners' actions to implement recovery plans under the \nEndangered Species Act.\n  More than 10 million acres of conservation easements are held by land \ntrusts nationwide, many of them donated. The enhanced charitable tax \ndeduction for conservation easements has proven to be a valuable \nincentive for making these kinds of gifts. So the conference report \nextends the enhanced deduction for conservation easements.\n  The conference report also includes important provisions to protect \nAmerican timber jobs and American lands. This conference report will \nhelp the American timber industry to remain globally competitive. And \nit will help to keep timber land from being sold for development.\n  America's farming families sacrifice a lot to feed this country. The \nfarm bill conference report includes a number of tax relief provisions \nto help them to start farming, help them to stay financially afloat, \nand help to make the Tax Code fairer for those who make a living \nworking the land.\n  The conference report improves ``Aggie Bonds.'' These are tax-exempt \nbonds that provide low-interest loans for first-time farmers and \nranchers.\n  Agricultural chemicals and pesticides purchased for legitimate uses \nare increasingly vulnerable to theft because of the drug trade and \nnational security threats. The conference report provides support for \nagricultural businesses by providing a credit for the costs of \nprotecting these agricultural chemicals and pesticides.\n  Some State water rules keep farmers and ranchers from selling their \nland when they need to or want to. The conference report will allow the \ntax-free exchange of stock that represents a holding of water rights. \nThis will allow this stock to be treated like real property under \nsection 1031 of the Tax Code.\n  As summer approaches, American families are paying higher prices than \never for gasoline. Our country needs to break its dependence on foreign \noil and fossil-based fuels. And America's agricultural sector can help, \nwith homegrown energy solutions.\n  Cellulosic biofuels can be produced from agricultural waste, \nwoodchips, switchgrass, and other nonfood feedstocks such as brewer's \nspent grains. With an abundant and diverse source of feedstocks \navailable, cellulosic biofuels hold tremendous promise as a homegrown \nalternative to fossil-based fuels.\n  But because cellulosic biofuels are very expensive to make, \ngovernment assistance can help to spur these fuels to commercial \nviability. The farm bill conference report includes a new, temporary \nproduction tax credit for cellulosic biofuels. The credit will be worth \nup to $1.01 per gallon. And it will be available through December 31, \n2012.\n  The farm bill conference report also contains a number of trade-\nrelated measures. Enforcement of the softwood lumber agreements is one \nof these provisions. Timber is an important agricultural product. And \nAmerica both produces and imports significant amounts of timber-related \nproducts, including softwood lumber.\n  As the downturn in the housing market continues to hurt American \nsoftwood lumber producers, America's trading partners must be held to \nfair trade standards for softwood lumber.\n  The conference report includes an importer declaration program that \nwill require American importers of softwood lumber to ensure that their \nimports are consistent with America's international agreements. The \nsoftwood lumber provision will also force the administration to take \naffirmative steps to enforce American softwood trade agreements.\n  And, Mr. President, this is a good conference report. We should pass \nit, and send it to the President.\n  Let us pay tribute to that sacred emblem, that mute gospel, the \nAmerican farm. Let us address the challenges facing the farmer and \nrural America. And let us pass this much-needed conference report.\n  I have never been more proud of what all you do in helping to provide \nfood and fiber for America.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Montana, my good \nfriend for all these years. We first came here in 1974. I thank him for \nworking diligently to make sure we had funding for this bill and some \ntax provisions we had in this bill that help correct inequities we did \nin the past. I thank the Senator. I will have more to say.\n  I have other speakers we need to recognize. I yield 4 minutes to the \nSenator from New Mexico.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Mexico is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague. I will start by \ncongratulating Senator Harkin and Senator Chambliss for their good work \non this legislation, and also Senator Baucus. I know Senator Conrad \nalso had a very important role in completing this legislation. This is \na good bill for New Mexico, a good bill for the Nation. I plan to vote \nfor the conference report.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased with the numerous provisions in this bill \nthat help promote specialty crops like chile and pecans, conserve \nnatural resources, invest in food and nutrition for children, increase \nproduction of advanced biofuels, promote broadband service in rural \nareas and provide fresh fruits and vegetables for schools. The bill \nincludes the consensus language I support on country-of-origin labeling \nof meat and vegetables.\n  I also appreciate the conferees including a provision authorizing a \nnew Southwest Border Regional Commission. I originally introduced the \nSouthwest Border Authority bill, which created this Commission, in \n2002. I have been working since then with Senators Boxer, Feinstein, \nand Hutchison toward its passage. I would also like to commend the work \nof Congressman Silvestre Reyes, who championed the bill in the House. \nThe new commission will give the Southwest border region the ability to \ncoordinate economic activity and innovation. There can be no question \nthat the Southwest border is an area of tremendous promise and economic \nactivity. Unfortunately, this region has long suffered from a lack of \ncoordinated effort among and between the border counties. The Southwest \nBorder Regional Commission will, for the first time, provide the tools \nand personnel necessary to harness the opportunity in the area and \ncreate a dynamic economy that will benefit the entire Nation.\n  Nevertheless, there are provisions in this bill that cause me \nconcern. The dairy industry is New Mexico's single most important \nagricultural commodity. My State is currently the Nation's ninth \nlargest dairy State and sixth in total cheese production. Dairy \nproducers in my State see little in the bill to help them deal with \ntoday's high production costs and believe this bill will hurt them. It \nis unfortunate that the bill extends and expands a subsidy program \ncalled the milk income loss contract at a cost of $1.6 billion over 5 \nyears. I led the opposition to the MILC subsidy in the 2002 farm bill \nand voted against the extension of it in 2006. I do believe the program \nunfairly favors producers in only a few States and is not a good use of \ntaxpayers' money.\n  I am also disappointed that the conferees did not include my \nbipartisan provision that promoted water conservation for producers in \nthe Ogallala aquifer. The Ogallala aquifer is a critical source of \ngroundwater for agricultural and municipal uses. My voluntary program \nwould have helped slow the rapid depletion of this vital resource. In \nplace of my provision, the bill has a new Agriculture Water Enhancement \nProgram. I intend to work with USDA to ensure that priority is given to \nStates and agricultural producers in the Ogallala region to coordinate \nFederal assistance with State programs and to encourage cooperation \namong States in implementing conservation programs and efficient use of \nwater.\n  Let me conclude my statement by spending a minute or two talking \nabout the provision in this bill to expand trade preferences for Haiti, \nand the situation in Haiti more broadly.\n  Haiti is the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere. According to \nUnited Nations Development Programme data, approximately 76 percent of \nHaiti's population subsists on under $2 per day and 55 percent on under \n$1 per day. As much as three-fifths of the population is unemployed or \nunderemployed. One in five Haitian children is malnourished.\n  Since late 2006, President Preval, in conjunction with the United \nNations\n\n[[Page S4219]]\n\nMission for the Stabilization of Haiti, or MINUSTAH, has made real \nprogress in reclaiming the streets from the toughest gangs in Cite \nSoleil and other Port-au-Prince slums. Last month's food riots--and the \ndismissal of Prime Minister Alexis, and the Haitian parliament's \nrejection of Ericq Pierre, the Inter-American Development Bank official \nnominated to replace him--now threaten to reverse these hard-won gains.\n  On balance, though, for the first time in many years, Haiti has a \nreal opportunity to build a future. And we owe it to the Haitian people \nto help them in this task--partly for reasons of preserving stability \nin the Caribbean, and partly to provide an alternative to emigrating to \nthe U.S., but mostly because it is the right thing to do.\n  As part of this ongoing commitment, we must take two immediate \nactions to consolidate stability by fostering economic growth in Haiti. \nI am pleased that one of these steps is taken by this farm bill.\n  The HOPE-II Act contained in this conference report has significant \npotential to create jobs in Haiti's apparel sector by expanding its \nduty-free access to the U.S. market. It also gives Haiti a degree of \naccess to ``third country'' fabric, whose low cost makes the business \ncase for opening an apparel factory in Haiti much more attractive. And \nit helps Haiti to adopt best practices on working conditions by \nauthorizing a program under which the International Labor Organization \nassesses the apparel industry's compliance with core labor standards \nand Haitian labor law. I would like to commend my colleague, Chairman \nRangel, for his efforts to get this provision included, and my \ncolleagues Senators Corker and Harkin and Nelson from Florida, for all \nof their hard work and attention to the urgent needs of Haiti.\n  The second immediate action we must take is to address the food \ncrisis in Haiti. I am pleased that the upcoming emergency supplemental \nappropriations bill will call for significantly increased levels of \nfood aid. I urge my colleagues and the Bush administration to place a \npriority on Haiti when allocating that aid. Specifically, Haiti needs, \nat bare minimum, $75 million in food aid. I also believe we must \ncontinue working with the administration to ensure that our food aid is \ndispersed as efficiently as possible by allowing at least 25 percent of \nit to be used for purchases of food in developing countries.\n  We must not let this pivotal moment slip out of our hands. In an era \nwhen too many countries around the world distrust the U.S., let us work \ntogether to build goodwill among the people of Haiti.\n  Again, I thank Chairman Harkin and Senator Chambliss for all their \ngood work on this bill. I will support the conference report, and I \nhope it will soon be passed into law.\n  Again, I congratulate my colleagues for the good work on this bill, \nand I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, may I inquire how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Salazar). The Senator from Georgia has 28 \nminutes.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. At this time I yield 5 minutes to another very \nvaluable member of the committee, a Senator who has had an awful lot of \ninput into this bill, both policywise and otherwise, Senator Thune of \nSouth Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nGeorgia and the Senator from Iowa, the chairman of the Agriculture \nCommittee, for their extraordinary leadership on this bill and for the \nimposing staff work that was involved in bringing this to conclusion. \nAt long last we are going to have a farm bill.\n  This farm bill is important for a lot of reasons. I don't have time \nto get into all the details of why I think this bill is important, but \nit does preserve a strong safety net. It does provide a permanent \ndisaster title, which is something many of us have sought to achieve \nfor some time, and fought long and hard for. It has conservation \nprovisions that increase funding for certain conservation programs.\n  On balance, this is a farm bill that is reflective of all the needs, \nthe desires, the priorities of the Members--not only of the Agriculture \nCommittee but also of this Congress. I think it will move agriculture \nforward in a positive direction. I congratulate the leaders on the \ncommittee and those who have been involved all through this process for \ntheir hard work in bringing us to where we are today.\n  I want to make one point, though, because I think if there is \nanything in this bill as important as any of it, it is the energy title \nin this farm bill. The reason for that is we have an energy crisis in \nthis country. You cannot go anywhere in my State of South Dakota, I \ndaresay anywhere in this country, without hearing people talk about the \nhigh cost of gasoline. There is one thing we have done that is positive \nin terms of reducing the cost of oil, reducing the cost of gasoline in \nthis country, and that is biofuels, bioenergy.\n  There is a lot of debate. I want to set one thing straight for the \nrecord because there has been a lot of criticism lately of corn-based \nethanol and we talk about this whole food versus fuel debate going on \nin the country today. So people know what the facts are, here are the \nfacts. In 2002, the United States grew 9 billion bushels of corn. Of \nthat, we turned 1.1 billion bushels into 3 billion gallons of ethanol.\n  In 2007, farmers grew 13.1 billion bushels of corn and turned 3 \nbillion bushels of it into 8 billion gallons of ethanol, leaving 10.1 \nbillion bushels for food, more than the 7.9 billion bushels in 2002.\n  If you do the math, despite a nearly threefold increase--growth--in \nthe corn ethanol industry, the net corn food and feed product of the \nUnited States increased 34 percent since 2002.\n  Even though we dramatically increased the amount of ethanol we are \nproducing in this country, we still, because of the great hard work of \nour farmers in this country and the productivity and increases in \ntechnology, produced dramatically more corn, so much so that we have 34 \npercent more corn in 2007 than we did in 2002, notwithstanding the \nthreefold increase in renewable fuels.\n  I say all that to set the record straight because there is a real \ndebate going on in this country about whether ethanol is to be blamed \nfor higher food prices. Frankly, oil has way more to do with the cost \nof food and everything else we purchase in this country than does \nethanol. But that is not enough. We can do a lot more. The reason the \nenergy title in this bill is so important is because it moves us in a \nnew direction. The next generation of biofuels is what we call \ncellulosic ethanol, made from biomass, made from wood chips, made from \ncorncobs, made from switchgrasses and other types of grasses that are \ngrown in abundance on the prairies of South Dakota and other places \nacross this country.\n  We have an enormous opportunity here to not shrink the amount of \nbiofuels we have in this country, but to grow the amount of biofuels \nbecause it is the one thing that is keeping gas prices under control. \nAccording to an analysis that was done by Merrill Lynch that was \nreported upon in the Wall Street Journal a couple of weeks back, if it \nwere not for ethanol, gas prices and oil prices in this country would \nbe 15 percent higher than they are today. That is about 50 cents a \ngallon for gasoline. We do not need less volume of biofuels, we need \nmore volume of biofuels. That is why the energy title in this farm bill \nis so important, because it provides important incentives for the next \ngeneration of biofuels, cellulosic ethanol, to encourage farmers to \ngrow energy-dedicated crops that can be converted into cellulosic \nethanol. As we transition from corn-based ethanol to cellulosic \nethanol, we have an incredible opportunity for this country to become \nless dependent upon foreign sources of energy, to grow our domestic \nsupply of energy in this country in a way that is environmentally \nclean, in a way that helps support the economy of the United States of \nAmerica and does not ship billions and billions of dollars every single \nyear outside the United States to purchase imported oil.\n  This is an important farm bill for a lot of reasons, but the energy \ntitle is critical and I hope my colleagues here in the Senate, if for \nno other reason, will support it because of its energy provisions.\n  I see my time has expired, so I yield the remainder of my time and \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from Washington State, \nSenator Murray.\n\n[[Page S4220]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, farming is a critical part of the economy \nin my home state of Washington. Many people don't know it, but \nWashington is the Nation's 11th-largest farm State. And we are the \nthird-largest producer of fruits and vegetables--which are also known \naround here as specialty crops. So the farm bill we are considering \ntoday will help keep my state healthy and strong. It will help them \nfind markets for their crops here and abroad--and it will help fund \nresearch to ensure they have healthy and safe crops in the future. This \nisn't a perfect bill. But it is a very good bill for Washington state \nfarmers. And that is why I rise today.\n  The biggest victory for Washington state in this bill is the more \nthan $3 billion to help farmers who grow apples, cherries, grapes, \npotatoes, asparagus, and many other fruits and vegetables. This is the \nfirst time Congress has passed a farm bill that includes comprehensive \nprovisions addressing the needs of specialty crop farmers. This \nlegislation will really help our farmers by carrying out programs that \nI have been pushing for over the last several years. And I want to \nthank my colleagues, Senators Harkin, Conrad, Chambliss, Baucus, and \nGrassley for their hard work on this bill.\n  The farm bill conference report includes $224 million in block \ngrants, which will allow local fruit and vegetable growers to increase \nthe competitiveness of their crops and $15 million in badly needed aid \nfor asparagus farmers. Asparagus farmers in my home State--and \nelsewhere--are struggling to compete with a flood of cheap asparagus \nbeing imported from Peru. I worked very hard through conference \nnegotiations to make sure that this market loss program stayed in the \nbill, and I am very grateful to our conference chairs for keeping it \nin.\n  This bill helps farmers find new markets abroad for their crops, \nwhich will allow them to better compete in the global marketplace. For \nexample, it increases funding for the Technical Assistance for \nSpecialty Crops program, which helps our farmers overcome barriers that \nthreaten our exports. And, farmers in my home State are really eager \nfor this program. Last fall, I held a listening session in Yakima, WA, \nwhere I heard from cherry farmers who are trying to develop a new \nmarket in Japan. And this bill would help them build on those efforts.\n  I am especially pleased that this bill includes $20 million for the \nNational Clean Plant Network. Farmers who grow apples, peaches, and \ngrapes depend on this program to ensure we have a source of clean plant \nstock to help prevent the spread of viruses. A single infected plant or \ngrape vine can wipe out an entire established orchard or vineyard. So \nthis is very important. Washington State University has been leading \nthe effort to ensure our farmers have virus- and disease-free plant \nstock. And I am proud that they will be an important part of this \nnational network.\n  Now, a lot of people don't realize that the farm bill isn't just \nabout farmers. Well over half of this bill authorizes funding for \nschool lunches, food stamps, and other nutrition programs. And since \nobesity is one of the biggest nutrition challenges we face in this \ncountry, this bill specifically targets funding to ensure that families \nreceiving food stamps, and kids getting school lunches will have more \naccess to fresh fruits and vegetables. My home State of Washington \nwould get $9 million in nutrition program funding next year alone.\n  And finally, this bill will be a lifeline for food banks and other \nemergency food providers, which have struggled with rising food prices \nand the downturn in the economy.\n  As I said from the beginning, this bill isn't perfect. I wish that we \nwere able to include important improvements to the safety net that is \nso critical to our wheat farmers. I have been working for several years \nwith wheat farmers in Washington State to improve the countercyclical \npayment program to really make it work for them. Unfortunately, we \ncouldn't make significant changes in this bill. But I am happy that it \ncontinues to provide a safety net for our wheat growers.\n  Now, I have just walked through numerous examples of how this farm \nbill is good for my State--and for the Nation. And that is why I am so \ndisappointed to hear President Bush say that he plans to veto it. At \nthe end of the day, none of us got everything we wanted in this bill--\nincluding the administration. But the conference report does do a lot \nof good. It helps farmers, who are struggling as gas prices soar and \nforeign competition threatens their livelihoods. And it helps millions \nof low-income families, who are struggling just to put food on the \ntable.\n  Mr. President, we have got to get beyond politics on this. Making \nsure that our farmers and our kids both benefit from investments in the \nprograms in this bill is absolutely critical. We are not just talking \nabout numbers. These programs can make or break people's livelihoods. \nAnd I urge my colleagues to support them by approving this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I receive \n4 minutes of the time of the majority.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, yesterday afternoon the House of \nRepresentatives passed the farm bill conference report by a vote of 318 \nto 106. The Senate will vote in a few minutes and we expect to have an \noverwhelming majority in favor of this farm bill. I thank Senator \nHarkin for his great leadership, and Senator Chambliss--it was a \nbipartisan effort--as well as Senator Conrad and Senator Baucus, all \nthe members of the committee, and I want to take special note of my \ngood friend Representative Collin Peterson from the State of Minnesota \nwho showed such leadership in the House.\n  America's farm safety net was created during the Great Depression as \nan essential reform to help support rural communities and protect \nstruggling family farmers from the financial shocks of volatile weather \nand equally volatile commodity prices.\n  Almost 75 years later the reasons for maintaining that strong safety \nnet are still there. The weather is still volatile, as we have seen \nthis year. Crops are still subject to blight and disease. Farming is \nstill a very risk-intensive business. We have seen prices going up and \ndown--recently down in Asia--as we have seen investment and speculation \nin the farm market. I think it is very important that we have a safety \nnet as we look at our food security so we don't get in the same place \nas we are with our lack of energy security.\n  I want to mention a few important things to my State in this bill--\nthe sugar program, the dairy program, and the conservation program. I \nknow we have people here in attendance from Pheasants Forever. The \nconservation groups worked very hard on this--the nutrition assistance. \nBut I especially wanted to mention the part of the bill that I worked \non, the cellulosic piece, which looked to the next generation of \nbiofuels--looking at prairie grass, switchgrass, other forms of \nbiomass. As we look to, say, the country of Brazil, which is energy \nefficient--energy independent, based on sugarcane--we can do it in this \ncountry.\n  I believe we have to go beyond our crop-based ethanol and look at \nthese other forms of ethanol and this bill creates the incentives so we \ncan use energy crops such as switchgrass and prairie grass and do it in \na way that is consistent with conservation, which is why I am so proud \nwe have the support of the conservation groups that are with us today.\n  I was a strong proponent for reform in this bill. It didn't have \neverything I asked for, as Senator Murray was discussing; no bill is \nperfect. But we had significant problems in the last few years with a \nsmall number of people--real estate developers from Florida, art \ncollector from San Francisco, 100 people from the Beverly Hills 90210 \narea code--collecting money. This bill eliminates the three-entity \nrule. Also, the conferees have included substantial income limits for \nthose who participate in the commodity program--$500,000 in nonfarm \nincome, and they are banned from getting subsidies; and then third, \n$750,000 for farm-related income.\n  Frankly, you can go a long way in Minnesota without bumping into a \nfarmer who made $750,000 after expenses. The reform in this bill may \nnot be perfect but it is a lot better than where we were before.\n\n[[Page S4221]]\n\n  The 2002 farm bill spurred rural development by allowing farmers in \nMinnesota and across the country to take risks to expand production. \nBecause of productivity gains and innovation, including advances in \nrenewable energy, the farm support programs in the 2002 farm bill \nactually came in $17 billion under budget.\n  As the Senate considers the conference report, it is important not to \nunderestimate the value of a strong bill for states such as Minnesota \nwhere agriculture is so vital to our economy and way of life.\n  That is why, as a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, I \nsupport the new farm bill. It includes an increased focus on \ncellulosic-based ethanol, continued support for a strong commodity \nsafety net and a permanent program of disaster assistance.\n  And, of particular importance is that we have balanced our budget in \nthis farm bill, with every dollar of new spending fully off-set.\n  Traveling around the state during the campaign I was visiting all 87 \ncounties this year, so I have had a good opportunity to talk to farmers \naround our State. They have told me that the 2002 farm bill has worked \nwell for them, and they wanted to see that continued.\n  I am very pleased that this bill continues the same basic structure \nof the three-part safety net--direct payments, countercyclical payments \nand marketing loans--and I am especially pleased that we have succeeded \nin rebalancing the commodity programs to be more equitable to northern \ncrops like wheat, oats, barley, soybeans and--canola, beginning in \n2010.\n  Another top priority for Minnesota farmers was creating a permanent \nprogram of disaster assistance for farmers. I would like to thank \nSenators Conrad and Baucus for their efforts to see this program \nthrough. Farmers are tired of coming back to Congress year after year \nwith a tin cup in their hands.\n  Minnesota has been hit with drought, flooding and everything in \nbetween over the several years, and they have had to wait years on end \nfor Congress to pass adhoc disaster relief bills.\n  The permanent program of disaster relief in this farm bill will give \nfarmers security moving forward, and quick relief when they need it.\n  This bill holds some good news for Minnesota's dairy farmers--we were \nable to restore the MILC payment rate that had been cut to 34 percent, \nback to 45 percent. We also added a feed cost adjuster to the MILC \nprogram, which means that when the price of feed goes up, the payment \nrate will also go up. This is really going to help dairy farmers cope \nwith the high cost of feed and energy.\n  The new farm bill is also going to work well for Minnesota's \nsugarbeet growers. It raises the sugar loan rate by \\3/4\\ of a cent--it \nmay sound small to you and me, but it's a big deal to the farmers in \nthe Red River Valley.\n  We have language in the bill that will give U.S. sugar producers the \nright to supply 85 percent of the domestic market each year before USDA \ncan allow additional sugar imports. And it creates a new sucrose-to-\nethanol program to give us a new source of energy, and provide an \noutlet for potential increases in imports as a result of this \nadministration's trade policies.\n  One of my major goals for this farm bill was to include a strong \ncellulosic ethanol program. Farms can and should play a bigger part in \nthe future of this country's energy security.\n  Instead of investing in oilfields of the Mideast, we should be \ninvesting in the farmers and workers of the Midwest.\n  Our corn-based ethanol and soybean-based biodiesel have taken off in \nMinnesota, and we are ready to expand to the next generation of \nbiofuels: energy from native, perennial crops like switchgrass and \nprairie grass that require less fertilizer, yield more energy, and \nprotect soil, water and wildlife.\n  I was proud to draft first-of-its-kind legislation to provide farmers \nwith an incentive to grow cellulosic energy crops, and I would like to \nthank Chairman Harkin and Chairman Peterson for working with me to \ninclude many of my provisions in the farm bill.\n  Energy crops like switchgrass and prairie grass hold great promise \nfor farmers because they can be grown on marginal land that can't \nproduce a high yield of corn or soybeans, and they restore the land \nwhile they're growing. Their deep root systems sequester carbon and put \norganic material back in the soil.\n  Native grasses can also save fuel and fertilizer because they don't \nrequire lots of passes with farm equipment or heavy fertilizer \napplications.\n  The fact that these crops put carbon back in the soil and take less \nfossil fuel to produce offers us the promise of producing a carbon-\nneutral motor fuel for this country, which would be a huge advance in \nthe fight against global warming.\n  In short, the Biomass Energy Reserve Program is going to allow us to \nexpand upon corn ethanol and soy diesel to a new generation of farm-\nbased energy, and greater freedom from imported oil.\n  I am also pleased that the committee has prioritized beginning \nfarmers and ranchers in the credit title. There are real opportunities \ntoday to start out in farming, especially in growing areas like organic \nfarming and energy production. But beginning farmers also face big \nobstacles, including limited access to credit and technical assistance, \nand the high price of land.\n  The beginning farmer and rancher programs in this farm bill provide \nmentoring and outreach for new farmers, and training in business \nplanning and credit-building--the skills they need to succeed and stay \non the land.\n  So there are a lot of good things for Minnesota and the country in \nthis farm bill. There is, however, one critical area where I fought for \nmore reform, and that was in stopping urban millionaires from pocketing \nfarm subsidies intended for hard-working farmers.\n  This kind of reform is in the best interests of Minnesota farmers. \nHere are the facts.\n  Sixty farmers collected more than $1 million each under the 2002 farm \nbill, but none of them have been Minnesotans, even though Minnesota is \nthe fifth-largest agricultural State. The average income of Minnesota \nfarms, after expenses, is $54,000. But under the current system, a \npart-time farmer can have an income as high as $2.5 million from \noutside sources and still qualify for Federal benefits.\n  It made no sense to hand out payments to multimillionaires when this \nmoney should have been targeted to family farmers.\n  And what we saw so clearly in the media coverage of this farm bill \nwas that big payments to big-city investors were undermining public \nsupport for the entire bill, even though commodity payments account for \njust 16 percent of funding in this bill.\n  But this bill is going to do better for our farmers by closing \nloopholes and tightening income eligibility standards.\n  First, the new farm bill eliminates the ``three-entity rule.'' This \nwill cut down on abuse by applying payment limits strictly to \nindividuals--and married couples--and ending the practice of dividing \nfarms into multiple corporations to multiply payments.\n  Second, I am pleased to report that the conferees have included \nsubstantial income limits for those who participate in the commodity \nprograms, which is an area where I fought hard for reform. What the \nbill says is, if you earn more than $500,000 in nonfarm income--so if \nyou have a high-paying job off the farm, or income from investments, or \nany other source of income off the farm in excess of $500,000--you \ncannot participate in the commodity programs.\n  This makes good sense to me. This will take care of \nmultimillionaires, like David Letterman and Paul Allen of Microsoft, or \nMaurice Wilder, the real-estate developer in Florida, getting farm \npayments intended for family farmers.\n  The bill also says that if you have more than $750,000 in farm-\nrelated income, you lose your direct payments. I think this also makes \nsense. I would venture to say that any farm bringing in that much money \nafter expenses is of a size and scope that they no longer need the \nsupport of taxpayers.\n  So the reform in this bill is not perfect, but it is a lot better \nthen where we were before. And I thank the conferees for taking these \nimportant steps in the bill.\n  In conclusion, there are a lot of important changes in this bill, and \nthere is a lot that is good for rural America, and the safety net is \nvital for farmers. We have made important advances in\n\n[[Page S4222]]\n\nconservation, and made much-needed improvements to our nutrition \nprograms. Perhaps most importantly, this bill lays the groundwork for \nfarmers to play an even greater role in our country's energy security \nand will advance us to the next generation of biofuels. For all of \nthese reasons, I will be proud to vote for this bill, and I urge my \ncolleagues to do the same.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. At this time I wish to yield up to 10 minutes to the \nSenator from South Carolina, Mr. DeMint.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I do not like to be the one to rain on a \nparade, but I am rising today to speak against the farm bill. I wish to \ndo it in the context of thanking the chairman and the ranking member \nfor their work. I think if we assume it is our job to manage the \nfarming industry in this country, they had very little choice but to do \nwhat they have done and try to go through all aspects of farming and \ninclude it in this bill. That took over 2 hours to print out. It came \nout less than 2 days ago. We are getting ready to vote on it. Not one \nMember of the Senate has read probably even part of it--certainly not \nthe whole bill. Yet I think everyone, or at least a large number of \nSenators, want to leave here today saying they voted for the farm bill.\n  I realize nothing I can say that is wrong with the bill--whether it \nviolates budgets or even our own Senate rules, as far as what we are \nsupposed to do in conference--is going to make that much difference. I \nwish to express some concerns--maybe, before I talk specifically about \nthe farm bill, some broader concerns.\n  I heard one of my colleagues yesterday say it in a pretty good way: \nThe Congress is comfortably sitting on a raft floating down a slow, \ndeep river. But some of us hear the waterfall around the corner, and it \nis the waterfall I wish to talk a little bit about today.\n  We all need to remember our oath of office. I don't want to be \npreaching to my more veteran colleagues, but our oath of office is \nsimply to protect and defend the Constitution. The whole point of that \nis the Constitution limits the scope of what we are supposed to do at \nthe Federal level. It keeps us from getting involved in all aspects of \nAmerican business and social life. It limits us so that we can, in \neffect, keep America free. But as we all know, we have continued to \nexpand the scope of the Federal Government, essentially making a \nmockery of our oath of office now to the point where we are trying to \nmanage the education system in America and we are trying to manage the \nhealth care system in America.\n  This week, we are trying to tell local and State governments how they \nare to deal with their public safety officers. We are trying to manage \nthe farming industry in this country, which is very complex. I cannot \npretend to understand it or to tell any other Member of the Senate how \nwe are to manage it. But the fact is, we no longer limit the scope of \nwhat we do at the Federal level. There is no concern in this country or \naround the world that this body would not take up, and we seldom even \ntalk about any restrictions the Constitution might have on what we do.\n  We also do not limit how much we can spend. We have no requirement \nthat we balance our budget year to year. So we don't have to select \npriorities and cut programs when we add programs. So we continue to \ngrow our budget, approaching now $10 trillion in debt as a Nation and \nadding to that every year. Here we are at a time of war and economic \ndownturn, and there is nothing that is too much for us to spend. The \nPresident has proposed $50 billion of AIDS support to Africa. That is \nwonderful, but there is enough human need around the world to bankrupt \nthis country 100 times.\n  This farm bill expands spending. It does not modernize the program in \nany way that does more to make the free and private market work. It \ntakes us deeper and deeper into managing an aspect of the private \neconomy, as we have done with health care and education, and every year \nwe get deeper into trying to manage the private sector. Our role as a \ngovernment should be to make the private sector work better, to make \nfreedom work for everyone and not to use problems as an excuse to \nreplace freedom and the private market with more Government. That is \nessentially what we are doing.\n  I am not just jumping on the farm bill and those who have worked on \nit. We know we continue to subsidize some millionaires, and we \neliminate some key payment limits. I can go through the list my staff \nhas given me of what is wrong with the bill. As I said before, I \nrealize there are provisions that solve problems throughout, that there \nare constituencies for little aspects of this bill throughout. We \npulled it together, and we are going to present it now to our country. \nWhat is wrong with the bill, frankly, has very little relevance today.\n  I appeal to my colleagues, I know we are not going to stop this bill, \nbut we do need to hear the waterfall around the corner. We do need to \naccept there are some restrictions, some limits on what we are supposed \nto do as a Federal Government, some need to balance our budget or to \nbegin to cut our debt and look at, if we are going to expand spending \nin one area, where can we cut it and pay for it in another area. We are \nstretched out as a country. We are on an unsustainable fiscal course. \nWe at least need to bring that into our debate. That is what I would \nlike to bring to everyone's attention today.\n  Again, I appreciate the chairman, the ranking member, and all those \nstaff members who worked so hard on this bill. But, frankly, as a \ngroup, as a Senate, our direction to the committee and those working on \nit should be to reform a system and try to figure out how we can pull \nthe Federal Government out of some aspects of American business. We did \nnot do it with this bill. We have not read it. It is crazy for us as a \nSenate to pass a bill that we have not had for 2 days and have not read \nthat spends the hundreds of billions of dollars that this bill does. \nBut I do want to say I appreciate the work, but I recommend to any of \nmy colleagues who are thinking about the future of America to please \nvote against this bill.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time to the ranking member from \nGeorgia.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I yield up to 4 minutes to another great \nmember of our Agriculture Committee, the Senator from Pennsylvania, Mr. \nCasey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, first of all, I thank Chairman Harkin for \nhis great work and Ranking Member Chambliss for their leadership on \nthis bill, a very difficult piece of legislation.\n  Chairman Harkin was so patient with me when I kept coming to talk \nabout dairy farmers over and over again, as he listened and worked so \nhard to help so many of our farmers in his home State of Iowa and \nacross the country. We are grateful for his help.\n  Also, I wish to mention Senator Chambliss's work and Senator Conrad, \nSenator Baucus, and so many others.\n  On my staff, I mentioned Caryn Long, who did great work, Kasey \nGillette, who has done great work from the beginning of this process, \nand Alex Davis from my staff as well. All have done great work.\n  Let me do some quick highlights of the bill from the perspective of \nPennsylvania but also I think from the perspective of our country \noverall.\n  With regard to dairy, dairy farmers who lead lives of struggle every \nday and have had to work under and survive under the most adverse \ncircumstances one could imagine, this bill is historic in the context \nof what it will do to help our dairy farmers, 98 percent of whom in \nPennsylvania are family farms. For the first time, we are considering \nthe cost of production. I know the Presiding Officer has heard that \nphrase a lot in our deliberations. But for the first time, we are \nconsidering cost of production when we put forth programs and policies \nfor dairy farmers.\n  This farm bill strengthens the safety net provided by the Milk Income \nLoss Contract, the so-called MILC Program, by adding a feed adjuster. I \nwon't go into the details of that, but it is going to help enormously \non the cost of production.\n  This is an idea I worked with many Members of the Senate on, of both \nparties. Senator Specter from my home\n\n[[Page S4223]]\n\nState of Pennsylvania has been very concerned about our dairy farmers \nas well over many years. Senator Leahy worked hard on this issue in \nconference. I appreciate his work.\n  I am also very pleased that some of the amendments I worked on in \ncommittee are retained, such as the mandatory daily price reporting for \ndairy products, the feed and fuel cost being part of the so-called make \nallowances which are very important to balance between what happens to \nour farmers and what happens to processors.\n  Specialty crops were mentioned before. In our State, fruits, \nvegetables, and other speciality crops have never had the kind of focus \nthis bill provides.\n  International food aid is part of this bill. I don't have time to go \ninto that, but everyone knows that prices have enveloped the world. \nAlmost one-fifth of the nations of the world are having problems that \nrelate to food and security.\n  States such as Pennsylvania have been underserved by the Federal Crop \nInsurance Program for many years. This bill includes reforms that help \nproducers in these States to increase the number of acres they have \nenrolled in the Crop Insurance Program.\n  The reform overall in this bill is very significant. There is $300 \nmillion in cuts to direct payments, reforms in the marketing loan \nprogram, it closes loopholes, reduces program abuses, on and on. These \nare changes that are made in this bill.\n  In terms of conservation, the Chesapeake Bay will be provided dollars \nto restore this tremendous natural resource.\n  The Conservation Farmland Protection Program is helped enormously.\n  I conclude with the nutrition program. This farm bill makes \nsubstantial investments in domestic food assistance programs and \nimproves the Food Stamp Program for our families. Mr. President, 1 in \n10 Pennsylvanians is currently receiving food stamps, and we have \ntremendous help for those families in this bill.\n  This is a good bill, and I urge my colleagues to adopt the conference \nreport, and if the President vetoes it, we will override his veto.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from \nLouisiana, Mr. Vitter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I stand in strong support of this \nconsensus, bipartisan farm bill, and I encourage all of my colleagues, \nDemocratic and Republican, to show strong bipartisan support.\n  I support this bill fundamentally for three reasons: First, as the \nlast farm bill, it establishes predictability for our farmers, a stable \nenvironment so they can plan and prosper in the future. Second, it does \nthat in a fiscally responsible way--no tax increases, payment limit \nreform, and other reforms--to move us down the path of fiscal \nresponsibility. Third, it does some very crucial and important work for \nLouisiana farmers in particular in a number of different areas.\n  In the area of sugar, we have a three-quarter of a cent loan rate \nincrease, the first such loan rate increase since 1985. It is long \noverdue.\n  In the rice industry, the industry requested changes to the uniform \nloan rate for different types of rice to make that more uniform and \nhelpful to the industry, and we have done that.\n  In the area of timber, there are tax provisions that reduce maximum \ntaxes on gains from certain timber from 20 percent, the capital gains \nrate, to a maximum of 15 percent. That is enormously important.\n  In the area of milk, as my colleague from Pennsylvania mentioned, \nthere are important improvements and provisions, changes to the MILC \nProgram that will help domestic dairy farmers.\n  There are plenty of good, solid, responsible reasons to be for this \nbill. Fundamentally, it will create that predictability, that stability \nour farmers need to plan into the future and to prosper into the \nfuture, which is good not just for them but for all Americans, \nincluding Americans as consumers, which, of course, is all of us.\n  I encourage all of my colleagues to support this bill. I encourage \nPresident Bush to reconsider his veto threat and not veto the bill. But \ncertainly, if it is necessary, I will stand and vote to support \noverriding that Presidential veto. I encourage my colleagues to also be \nfirm in that regard.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I yield back the remainder of my \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I yield 4 minutes to another valuable \nmember of our committee, Senator Brown from Ohio, whose signature on \nthis bill is the option that farmers have on the ACRE Program. I thank \nhim for all of his efforts in making sure we had that in the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Iowa for his \nterrific work as chairman of this committee, especially the work he \ndoes on conservation, nutrition, and for family farmers.\n  We have for many months been debating the farm bill, legislation that \nwears many hats, all of them important. It is an agriculture bill, it \nis a food bill, it is an energy bill, it is a conservation bill, it is \na world development bill, and it is an economic development bill. \nMelding these priorities, each one critical to our Nation's future, is \na profound accomplishment. I particularly applaud Chairman Harkin for \nhis work.\n  Last spring, I held a series of roundtables throughout Ohio and heard \ndirectly from farmers about what this year's farm bill should look \nlike. They told me a safety net that lends stability to market segments \nbuffeted by unpredictable costs and volatile prices is essential. \nFarmers need a safety net that makes sense, but it is important to \nunderstand that farmers are not looking for a handout. Rather, farmers \nare looking for assistance when prices drop or natural disasters \nstrike.\n  This bill incorporates a safety net proposal I put forward with \nSenator Durbin, the Average Crop Revenue Program, which will help \nfamily farmers in Ohio and consumers and taxpayers across the country \nby strengthening and diversifying the farm safety net. For the first \ntime ever, farmers will be able to enroll in a program that insures \nagainst revenue instability, which, for many farmers, makes more sense \nthan the traditional price-focused safety net.\n  Conservation programs were another frequent topic at the roundtables \nI held. One point is clear: Farmers do not want Washington rhetoric \nabout conservation and alternative energy; they want commonsense \nprograms and meaningful incentives, which this bill begins to provide.\n  As I traveled around Ohio, I met with Mark Schwiebert, a corn farmer \nin northwest Ohio, who will take advantage of the Average Crop Revenue \nElection Program. By targeting overall revenue rather than simply \nprice, farmers can receive better protections against two things: \nnatural disasters--therefore, low yield--and price volatility.\n  I met the same week with Ralph Dull, a hog farmer from Montgomery \nCounty who uses wind turbines to run his farm. Promoting sustainable \nfarm-based renewable energy, such as the wind energy that Ralph's \nturbines produce, is another key element of the farm bill.\n  Encouraging these ventures will help expand and diversify U.S. energy \nsources, while invigorating rural economies.\n  During a roundtable in Chillicothe, I met with fruit and vegetable \nfarmers who asked for more support as they provide fresh and healthy \nproduce to Columbus and that region of the State.\n  The farm bill creates a new program, the Healthy Food Enterprise \nDevelopment Center, that will connect local farmers to communities that \nneed access to healthy, affordable food.\n  During a roundtable in Wayne County, I talked with dairy farmers such \nas Bryan Wolfe who told me about the difficulty he has had meeting \nrising feed costs. The bill provides relief for these dairy farmers by \nlinking the dairy safety net to the cost of feed.\n  This bill does something else. It fights hunger. When the purchasing \npower of food stamps erodes, so does our Nation's progress against \nhunger. This bill increases food stamp benefits and indexes the \nbenefits to inflation. Nearly 400,000 people in Ohio will receive \nadditional benefits from this bill.\n\n[[Page S4224]]\n\nIn Hocking County, OH, more than 2,000 residents went to the local food \nbank in a single day. That is over 7 percent of the local population. \nWhile we need to do more, this bill is a major step, especially in \nnutrition. We need to keep our eye on McGovern-Dole to make sure these \ndollars are available for nutrition all over the world.\n  But this bill moves us forward. Ohio's families need this farm bill, \nand Ohio's rural communities deserve this farm bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I have one more speaker. I think \nSenator Harkin probably is prepared to wrap up. While Senator Cochran \nis on his way over here, let me make some comments relative to wrapping \nthis up. We are finally here. This has been a long process. The \nPresiding Officer is a member of our committee and knows what we have \nbeen through to get to this point. It has been a lot of hard work, a \nlot of strong leadership on the part of the chairman, who has done a \nterrific job, as I said earlier.\n  My friend Kent Conrad and I have spent countless hours together \nworking through this extremely complex piece of legislation. I cannot \nsay enough good things about his leadership, his intellect, as well as \nhis understanding of what good agricultural policy is all about.\n  I want to thank also all of the members of the conference committee \non our side, Senators Cochran, Lugar, Roberts, and Grassley. What \nterrific work they did. It was a long conference, having been begun \nback in December, and from December until now, we have met on a regular \nbasis, and decisions that have been made were sometimes extremely \ndifficult and very emotional. But what great leadership all of these \nSenators have shown.\n  To the other members of the committee on my side, Senators Coleman, \nCrapo, Thune, and Graham, again, we would not be where we are without \ntheir input. I thank each of them.\n  I also want to say a special thanks to Majority Leader Reid and \nMinority Leader McConnell. They have provided terrific leadership on \nboth sides of the aisle. They have been extremely cooperative in \nallowing us to do the technical things we need to do, and at the same \ntime to push Senator Harkin and myself when we needed pushing. And we, \nagain, would not be where we are were it not for their strong \nleadership, their cooperation. I thank each of them individually.\n  Following is a list of folks over at CBO I want to thank: Jim \nLangley, Greg Hitz, Dave Ull and the entire ag team at CBO, as well as \nKathleen FitzGerald, Dan Hoople, Megan Carroll, Kathy Gramp, Tyler \nKruzich, Kim Cawley, Teri Gullo, Sheila Dacey, Mark Booth, Zach \nEpstein, Andrew Langan, Lisa Ramirez-Branum, Burke Doherty, Amy Petz, \nSusan Willie, Sunita D'Monte, Matthew Pickford, and Mark Grabowitz.\n  As we go through the process of putting a bill like this together, we \nhave to constantly call up CBO and ask them for immediate scores on \nportions of the bill, and I have to say, CBO has worked overtime to \nmake sure they accommodated every single request we had, and they did \nit on rush-hour time. They have done a great job over there. I thank \neach of them.\n  Another thing we take for granted around here that we never should is \nthe staff of this Senate. I want to say a particular thanks to Dave \nSchiapa and the folks on his staff, as well as to Lula Davis and the \nfolks on her staff. This has been a partnership that so many people \nhave talked about on both sides of the aisle from an Ag Committee \nstandpoint, but it has also been a partnership between the staff.\n  I do not want to leave out our folks who show up every day early and \nstay late: our clerks, our Parliamentarians, who have been \nunbelievable. They are always here and provide us the professional \nleadership we need on the technical issues. To each of them, we say \nthank you.\n  At this time, I want to turn to Senator Cochran before I ultimately \nconclude. As I turn to Senator Cochran and give him 5 minutes, let me \nsay as a former chairman of this committee, he is an icon in the ag \ncommunity all across this great country. Senator Cochran has been a \ndear personal friend of mine for many years before I came to the \nSenate. As a friend and as somebody whom I looked up to when it comes \nto agricultural policy, it is my pleasure to turn to him now and to \nyield 5 minutes to him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nGeorgia, the ranking Republican member of this committee, for his kind \nwords and for his hard work and diligent efforts to bring us to a \nsuccessful conclusion of this conference report.\n  The chairman of the Committee, Mr. Harkin, has also been relentless \nand thoughtful in the way he has managed the responsibilities of the \nchairman of this committee through this very difficult task.\n  This was not an easy task. I applaud both of them for their \nleadership, their fairness, and their support for farmers' and \nranchers' interests, and truly for the interests of all Americans.\n  I also compliment the staff members of the committee for their \ntireless work on this bill: Mark Halverson, the majority staff director \nof the committee and all of his staff who worked to resolve the many \nissues important to our region of the country; Martha Scott Poindexter, \na former staff member of mine who is now serving as the staff director \nfor Senator Chambliss, deserves high praise for the successful efforts \nto help resolve the issues important to agriculture producers and the \nconsumers in our State of Mississippi.\n  I also want to thank Vernie Hubert, Alan Mackey, Hayden Milberg, \nCameron Bruett, Betsy Croker, Jane Anna Harris, Anne Hazlett, Matt \nColey, Kate Coler, Patty Lawrence, Christy Seyfert, Dawn Stump, and \nCarlisle Clarke for their contributions to this effort.\n  This has been a team effort. I have been very fortunate to have had \nthe pleasure and privilege of working with all of those I mentioned in \nthe drafting and negotiation of this very important legislation.\n  Mr. President, the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 strikes \na careful balance between the many important programs within the farm \nbill. I am pleased that the bill continues the farm income safety net \nprogram developed in the 2002 farm bill. Farmers in Mississippi believe \nthese programs have worked well to ensure an adequate support during \ntimes of depressed prices. Currently, our farmers are fortunate to be \nbenefiting from strong commodities prices. However, we have learned \nfrom past experiences, that these prices can fall as quickly as they \nhave risen and having a safety net in place is necessary for farmers to \nmake the significant investments needed to operate.\n  Conservation is an important part of a farm bill. The continuation of \nprograms such as the Wildlife Habitat Incentives Program, Wetlands \nReserve Program, and Environmental Quality Incentives Program which \nhave broad participation throughout Mississippi. Farmers understand how \ncritical the environment is to the continuation of agriculture and the \nhealth of the community of which they live. The increased funding for \nthese incentive based conservation programs will allow producers to \nadapt these programs with greater success to their land and provide \nreal benefits for their good efforts.\n  The additional funding for nutrition programs will address many of \nthe needs facing many of America's poor, children, and elderly. The \nnutrition programs authorized in this committee touch the lives of one \nout of every five people in this country, including over 37 million \nchildren. Also, I am pleased the conference recognizes the success of \nthe fruit and vegetable pilot program and have expanded the program to \nall States.\n  There are many titles of the farm bill that are often overlooked but \nare important to agriculture and our rural economies. The research \ntitle of the farm bill is crucial to keeping U.S. agriculture a leader \nin food and fiber production. The streamlining of grant programs in the \nresearch title will allow for efficiency and oversight of the \nappropriated funds. The rural development title provides assistance to \nrural communities through housing assistance, rural broadband access, \nwater and wastewater programs, and small\n\n[[Page S4225]]\n\nbusiness development. I am pleased that the conference has maintained \nand improved upon these important programs.\n  The issue of payments limits is always a point of contention in every \nfarm bill. The reductions in payment levels in this bill are a \nsignificant reform from the current payment limit rules. The payment \nlimit levels in this bill will result in a significant hardship for \nmany producers in Mississippi. Some of the best, most diversified \nproducers in Mississippi will be ineligible for income safety net \nprograms. It is important that the supporters of stronger payment \nlimits understand that this will not reduce farm bill spending. The \nland will be farmed by another producer and be eligible for program \nbenefits. The adjusted gross income limitation has the effect of moving \none farmer off the land and putting another farmer in their place. The \nGovernment doesn't ask other businesses to go out of business if they \ngrow and expand, why should farmers be treated differently?\n  Again, I want to thank Senator Harkin and Senator Chambliss for their \ngood work on this bill. I encourage my colleagues to support the \nconference report.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, how much time remains on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia has 6 minutes 20 \nseconds remaining, and the Senator from Iowa has 5 minutes 40 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, let me again thank Senator Cochran for \nhis generous comments and for his leadership on the committee. He has \nbeen such a valuable member of the conference committee but, more than \nthat, he has been a dear friend.\n  I want to continue to acknowledge the hard work of a number of folks \non the other side of the aisle. We had Senator Baucus, chairman of the \nFinance Committee, who worked so closely with Senator Grassley and \nevery member of the conference committee on our side of the Capitol to \ntry to find the funding for this bill. It is completely offset as \nscored by CBO.\n  In addition, he worked out a very fair and equitable tax package for \nagricultural issues, and I emphasize that, to be included in this farm \nbill. And it is that particular amount of spending that has been \ntotally offset as scored by CBO. So Senator Baucus and Senator Grassley \ndeserve an awful lot of credit.\n  To my good friend, Senator Blanche Lincoln, what a real ally she has \nbeen to all of us on the committee. Senator Stabenow has been a \ntireless worker from a conference committee standpoint.\n  This truly has been a bipartisan effort. But the real work hard that \nhas been done on this bill--the policy decisions are made by the \nmembership--was done by the staff.\n  I say to Mark Halverson and Susan Keith, and all of the members of \nthe minority committee, how much we appreciate them for their hard \nwork, their commitment to agriculture. Beginning in December, after \nthese folks had worked so hard to get the bill done and to get the bill \nto the Senate floor, their real work began. Every single day since this \nbill was passed, including weekends, these folks have been working \ntirelessly to try to accommodate the policy decisions the Members have \nbeen making. It has been an unbelievable process. Without their hard \nwork we simply would not be here.\n  Senator Cochran thanked all of the members of my staff, and I will \nnot go back through those again. They know how much I love them and how \nmuch I appreciate them. But to Martha Scott Poindexter, Vernie Hubert, \nand Hayden Milberg I owe a special thanks, because they have had to put \nup with me and me telling them what they needed to do and when they \nneeded to do it. And that is not an easy task from their side. So I \nhave tremendous appreciation for all of the staff who worked so hard to \nmake this happen today.\n  There are some other staff members I particularly want to acknowledge \nbecause they have been, again, tremendous and they have been right \nthere side by side with all of the Ag Committee staff from day one. \nThat is Amanda Taylor, Elizabeth Paris on Senator Grassley's staff; on \nSenator Baucus's staff, John Selib, Brandon Willis, Rebecca Baxter, \nKathy Kock; on Senator Lincoln's staff, Ted Serafini; and on Senator \nConrad's staff, Tom Mahr and Jim Miller. Tom and Jim particularly have \nbeen involved with my staff since literally about a year ago in \nattempting to craft the farm bill that ultimately came to the floor of \nthe Senate. They have been tremendous in providing us numbers, \nproviding us information to help Senator Conrad and myself make policy \ndecisions. To those two gentlemen, I want to say a special thanks.\n  This bill is going to finally come to a vote on the conference \nreport. This is not a perfect bill, as has been said by several \ndifferent folks here. There have been some folks who stood up and \npointed out some objections they have to the bill.\n  This is my third bill, two as a Member of the House and now one as a \nMember of the Senate. All farm bills are extremely controversial. All \nfarm bills are portrayed by the media as being a giant welfare program \nfor farmers.\n  Nothing is further from the truth, particularly in this farm bill. In \nthis farm bill, about 11 percent of the outlays are projected to go to \nfarm programs, 11 percent, and 74 percent of the outlays are going to \ngo for nutrition programs to feed hungry people in this country. We \nhave an obligation, as the richest and most abundant, from a food \nstandpoint country in the world, to take care of those folks who are in \nneed, and we are doing so in this bill.\n  In addition, we are providing conservation measures that are going to \nsave the land, save rural America from being developed in many areas \nwhere it ought not to be developed. We are also going to make sure that \nwe provide future generations with alternative energy sources, and that \nwe do it in the right way.\n  I want to close by making a comment on the point of order Senator \nGregg made. He knows how much respect I have for him. He did a terrific \njob when he was chairman of the Budget Committee and now as the ranking \nmember.\n  Again, he is doing a good job. He knows I have tremendous respect for \nhis position on any issue relative to the budget. But here is what I \nwish to explain to my colleagues. His point is that we are going to \nspend more money above the budget than we actually say we are going to \nspend.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I ask unanimous consent that we have an additional 4 \nminutes equally divided between Senator Harkin and myself.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GREGG. Reserving the right, I ask for an additional 2 minutes as \nwell.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. If anybody in this body can tell me today what the \nprice of corn, cotton or soybeans is going to be 5 or 10 years from \nnow, then we would not have to worry about projecting exactly what the \nexpenditure, from a budget standpoint, in this farm bill is going to \nbe. The fact is, we can't even project what the price of corn and \nsoybeans and other commodities is going to be tomorrow, much less what \nwe can predict it will be 5 years from now. In fact, the 2002 farm \nbill, which is currently in place, had the same budget point of order \nmade against it in 2002, when it was passed. The fact is, in that farm \nbill, not only did we not spend what was projected to be spent, but we \nspent between $15 and $18 billion less than what was projected to be \nspent. The reason is that commodity prices have been high; therefore, \npayments coming out of Washington have been either nonexistent or very \nlow. That is where the $15 to $18 billion in savings has come from. In \nthis bill, as long as commodity prices remain high, again, farmers are \ngoing to have what they want, which is their stream of income coming \nfrom the marketplace versus Washington. Washington is going to have \nwhat we want, which is a reduction and limitations on payments going to \nfarmers. The budget point of order, obviously, is correct in saying we \ndon't know exactly how much money is going to be spent under \ncountercyclical programs. That is the nature of farm bills. But the \nfact is, we spent less under 2002. We are going to spend less under \nthis farm bill, in all probability. But we cannot say that for certain. \nTherefore, I urge my colleagues to vote in opposition to the\n\n[[Page S4226]]\n\nbudget point of order and to vote in favor of the underlying bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. How much time remains on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa has 8 minutes. The time \nof the Senator from Georgia has expired. Senator Gregg has 2 minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I will let Senator Gregg go first, so I may finish debate \non the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I understand that as chairman of the \ncommittee, Senator Harkin should have the right to complete his \nstatement. I am happy to proceed at this time.\n  I would simply make the point, in response to the discussion about \nthis bill and the budget, there is no way anybody with a straight face \ncan represent that this bill is fiscally responsible in the context of \nthe budget. When this bill left the Senate, it was at $285 billion. It \nis now at $300 billion. This bill has $18 billion worth of gimmicks in \nit. The tax years are changed for corporations to pick up money. There \nis an attempt to adjust programs so some basically disappear after a \ncertain number of years on the theory that then they would not score, \nknowing full well that those programs are going to be continued. We \nalso have a situation where this bill violated the pay-go rules of the \nHouse and would violate the pay-go rules of the Senate, to the extent \nthey are ever enforced around here, if we had passed the Senate budget.\n  The irony is that this bill comes to the floor before the budget, \nwhich was voted on and voted in favor of by the Democratic membership. \nThat Democratic budget is violated in this bill. I have to tell my \ncolleagues, if a Democratic budget, which spends a heck of a lot of \nmoney, is violated, then, obviously, the bill itself is spending a lot \nof money. In addition, it uses gimmicks such as custom user's fees. It \nuses gimmicks such as this adjustment of pay-go. It ends up, even using \nall those gimmicks, $18 billion worth of gimmicks, still with a budget \npoint of order against it which is legitimate.\n  The budget is violated. This bill spends money outside the budget. \nThat budget point of order should not be waived.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  The Senator from Iowa has 8 minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, let me bring to a close this debate on the \nfarm bill. First, let me recap. This is not called the farm bill. It is \ncalled the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act for good reason--because \n67 percent of all the new money in this bill goes to nutrition to help \nlow-income Americans, to help our kids in school get a better diet of \nfresh fruits and vegetables. We also lifted the childcare cap that has \nbeen there since 1993. Right now it is $175 a month. The average cost \nof childcare is $631 dollars a month. We have lifted the cap on \nchildcare deductibility for those low income Americans who need food \nassistance. Let me read this quote from Second Harvest, Vicki Escarra, \npresident of America's Second Harvest:\n\n       On behalf of our nation's food banks, I urge Senators to \n     vote in favor of this hunger-fighting farm bill for the \n     millions of low-income Americans on the brink of catastrophe, \n     facing some of the most difficult economic times they have \n     had to endure in years. I urge Senators to support this \n     vitally important and necessary legislation.\n\n  On specialty crops, we have done more on specialty crops than any \nfarm bill before. We put a new title in this bill, almost $3 billion \ngoing to fruits and vegetables, horticulture, all the things that, \nagain, lend themselves to a healthier diet and a healthier America. \nThere is also a quote from the organization supporting specialty crops \nthat says in part: This farm bill represents a sea change in U.S. \nagriculture policy and a historic investment in the future of the fruit \nand vegetable producers across this country. We have taken a bold step \nto expand the fresh fruit and vegetable snack program to all 50 States, \nwhich makes certain this farm bill doesn't just help farmers but helps \nschoolchildren have greater access to fruits and vegetables. ``This \nis truly a win-win for both agriculture and the public.'' On livestock, \nwe improved the protections for livestock producers when they make \ncontracts. I wish to publicly thank my colleague from Iowa, Senator \nGrassley, for making sure we had those provisions in this bill. The \ncountry of origin labeling now will go into effect this fall so we will \nknow where our meat products come from and, finally, we will have the \ninterstate shipment of State-inspected meat after all these years. On \nconservation, we have done more for conservation in this bill than any \nfarm bill ever passed, almost 41 percent of all the money that is paid \nto agricultural producers will be paid through conservation programs to \nprotect our soil, wildlife habitats, and clean water.\n\n  Lastly, I showed this picture yesterday. I show it again. This is the \ncountryside that we want where farmers can plant and grow crops, but \nthey do it in an environmentally sound way, with clean water and clean \nstreams, with buffer strips, wildlife habitat all across the country. \nThat is what is so good about this bill because we have improved the \nconservation programs.\n  This is a bipartisan bill. In fact, I got a note this morning that \nour former Secretary of Agriculture, Mike Johanns, has now said he \nwould vote for the bill. He would support it.\n  In all my years here--this is my seventh farm bill in 30-some years--\nI have never seen so many groups come together to support a farm bill, \nover 500 groups. Farm groups, conservation groups, hunters and \nfishermen, energy groups for renewable energy, antihunger groups, \nreligious groups--I have never seen such a broad coalition of over 500 \ngroups in support of this bill. Now we have the former Secretary of \nAgriculture saying he would support it. All these groups support the \nfarm bill. The President says he wants to veto it. Evidently, he is \nright and everybody else is wrong. I beg to differ. This is a great \nbipartisan bill.\n  We keep hearing from people: Why can't you people work together, quit \nbickering, get things done? We did that here. We worked together in a \nyear and a half to produce this great product.\n  I wish to especially thank my ranking member, Senator Chambliss, for \nall his great work. Senator Chambliss reminds me a little bit of old \nSenator Sam Ervin, who used to say ``I am just a poor, little old \ncountry lawyer from the rural South.'' Senator Chambliss may say \nsomething like that, but I can tell you he is one smart, intelligent, \ngood negotiator. He brought this farm bill forward when he was \nchairman. I couldn't have asked for a better partner and working \nrelationship in getting this bill through. I can honestly say, without \nany fear of contradiction, had it not been for Senator Chambliss and \nall his hard work, we would not have gotten the 79 votes we got for \nthis bill in December. The fact that I think we will have an \noverwhelming vote today is a tribute to Senator Chambliss's leadership \nand hard work on behalf of all agriculture. One thing I will say about \nSenator Chambliss, he is a proud conservative. The only thing he is \nliberal about is giving out those Georgia peanuts. I want him to know, \nI appreciate those peanuts.\n  Let me thank all the members of our committee. In particular, I thank \nthe members of our conference committee. I mentioned Senator Grassley, \nwho worked so hard on the Finance Committee portion of the bill; \nSenator Baucus, who as chairman of the Finance Committee got the money \nfor us. I wish to especially thank Senator Conrad, our budget chairman, \nfor his expertise, knowledge, diligence. Senator Conrad was there for \nevery meeting. He hung in there on this farm bill from the beginning to \nthe end. We could not have gotten where we are without the help, the \nsupport, the knowledge, the expertise of Senator Conrad. I wish to say, \nagain, that the farmers and ranchers of North Dakota have no better \nfighter for them, no stronger advocate than they have in Senator \nConrad. I can tell you nothing escapes his attention. When it comes to \nfighting for the farmers and ranchers of North Dakota, Kent Conrad is \nalways in the lead.\n  I wish to publicly thank him and his staff for all the help on this \nbill.\n  Senator Leahy, the former chairman, who also fights for Vermont \nfarmers, especially dairy producers. He had a great seat at this table. \nHe made sure\n\n[[Page S4227]]\n\nwe took care of dairy farmers and nutrition. There is no stronger \nfighter for our dairy farmers and nutrition than Senator Leahy. Senator \nLincoln, who chairs our Subcommittee on Production, Income Protection, \nand Price Support, a strong advocate for Arkansas rice and grain and \noilseed farmers. Senator Lincoln is a strong fighter for rural \nresidents, people who live in small towns and communities. Senator \nStabenow, another conferee I am now going to refer to as the Senator of \nspecialty crops, because it was Senator Stabenow's strong advocacy that \nled to the first-ever inclusion of a specific title for specialty crops \nin this bill and nearly doubled the support for it.\n  Lastly, let me reach across to the other Chamber and thank \nCongressman Peterson from Minnesota. We have been working together on \nthis over a year, Saturdays and Sundays, and weekdays and nights, on \nthe phone. I also want to thank Congressman Bob Goodlatte. What a great \ncompanion he has been to fight for conservation and rural development, \nworking hard to bring forth this bill.\n  Again, they say the art of good legislation is cooperation and \ncompromise. We had good cooperation between parties, between the House \nand the Senate, and we have a farm bill we can all be proud of.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter from over 500 \norganizations supporting the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                     May 13, 2008.\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: As the U.S. House of Representatives prepares \n     for final consideration of the 2008 Farm Bill, the \n     organizations listed below strongly urge you to vote in favor \n     of the Conference Report.\n       Communities across the nation, from urban to rural have \n     been waiting too long for this legislation. The Conference \n     Report makes significant farm policy reforms, protects the \n     safety net for all of America's food producers, addresses \n     important infrastructure needs for specialty crops, increases \n     funding to feed our nation's poor, and enhances support for \n     important conservation initiatives.\n       This is by no means a perfect piece of legislation, and \n     none of our organizations achieved everything we had \n     individually requested. However, it is a carefully balanced \n     compromise of policy priorities that has broad support among \n     organizations representing the nation's agriculture, \n     conservation, and nutrition interests.\n       Our organizations applaud the strong bipartisan leadership \n     demonstrated in Congress to authorize and approve a strong \n     new five-year Farm Bill. Sound policy and long-term certainty \n     are absolutely essential to everyone served by the Farm Bill, \n     and the final Conference Report provides both.\n       Again, we urge you to support communities across America--\n     rural, urban and suburban, by voting in favor of the 2008 \n     Farm Bill Conference Report.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, I raise a point of order under rule \nXLIV, paragraph 8(a), section 12034 of the farm bill conference report \nviolates this rule in that it is a new directed spending provision.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I move to waive paragraph 8 of rule XLIV \nwith respect to all provisions of the conference report to accompany \nH.R. 2419, the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act, and I ask for the \nyeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

On this vote, the yeas are 62, the nays are \n34. Three-fifths of the Senate duly chosen and sworn having voted in \nthe affirmative, the motion is agreed to.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Would the Senator yield to me for purposes of a \ncolloquy?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I would be pleased to yield\n\n[[Page S4228]]\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Section 8105 of this bill authorizes the Secretary of \nAgriculture to ``provide free of charge to Indian tribes any trees, \nportions of trees or forest products from National Forest Service land \nfor traditional and cultural purposes as long as those products are not \nused for commercial purposes.'' Several Indian tribes in Washington \nState are successors in interest to tribes and bands who were signatory \nto treaties with the United States which expressly reserved the right \nto gather forest products from lands which currently include National \nForest System lands. These treaties are regarded as the supreme law of \nthe land and cannot be modified by Congress unless Congress clearly \nintends to do so. Am I correct that section 8105 is not in any way \nintended to modify or supersede the treaty rights of these tribes?\n  Mr. HARKIN. The Senator is correct. Section 8107 of the bill contains \na ``savings'' provision that explicitly states that nothing in this \nlegislation ``alters, abridges, diminishes, repeals, or affects any \nagreement between the Forest Service and an Indian tribe''. Section \n8105 of this bill does not in any way affect valid treaty rights of \ntribes to gather forest products from National Forest System lands.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I thank the Senator.\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, despite my great admiration for \nAmerica's hardworking farmers and my support for additional food aid \nfor our Nation's most vulnerable, I must oppose the conference \nagreement to H.R. 2419, the Food and Energy Security Act, also known as \nthe farm bill. I recognize that in the days ahead, attempts will be \nmade to use my opposition to this bill for another's political gain, \nbut I have always worked to do my best for America and that is why I \nmust oppose this conference report. And, the American people deserve to \nknow the truth about this farm bill: It is a bloated piece of \nlegislation that will do more harm than good for most farmers and \nconsumers.\n  In today's economy, when hardworking American families buy groceries \nthey feel the sting of misguided Federal agriculture policies. Instead \nof fine tuning our farm programs to improve their efficiency, we have \nallowed them to swell into mammoth government bureaucracies that \ngenerally exist to serve special interests at the behest of \ncongressional benefactors. Sixty-nine years after the Great Depression \nand the advent of the farm bill, well into the 21st century, commodity \nprices have reached record highs. I believe American agriculture has \nprogressed to the point where we no longer need government grown farms.\n  Don't misunderstand. I am not opposed to providing a reasonable level \nof assistance and risk management to farmers when they need America's \nhelp. Farmers never abandon America, and America mustn't abandon them. \nWhen a farmer suffers from a natural disaster such as droughts or \nfloods, they rightly deserve assistance. But they need a hand up, not a \nhand out.\n  The American taxpayer has been told before that farm bills and their \nthirst for subsidies were a necessary evil to provide our country and \nthe world--with affordable, abundant food. Today, as food prices reach \nhistoric highs, they're being told the same thing. We must challenge \nthat notion as grocery bills soar, food banks go bare, and food \nrationing occurs on a global scale. We must question policies that \ndivert over 25 percent of corn out of the food supply and into \nsubsidized ethanol production. Do Americans really want a support \nsystem that costs consumers $2 billion annually in higher sugar prices? \nWill we truly reduce our dependency on foreign oil by extending tariffs \nthat make it too expensive to invest in sugar ethanol production? Can \nwe honestly demand fair and free trade at Doha while domestic cotton \ngrowers dump subsidized cotton on the world market?\n  The farm bill conference report is expected to cost taxpayers around \n$289 billion. According to the Congressional Budget Office, this bill \nwill exceed the government's budget by $10 billion. But the \nadministration points out that with clever accounting made famous by \ncongressional budget dodgers, the real cost of the bill will exceed the \ngovernment's budget by about $18 billion. And even though Democrats and \nRepublicans in both Chambers have promised to rein in pork barrel \nspending, this bill betrays that promise. Buried within its hundreds of \npages are special favors like: $170 million bailout for the west coast \nsalmon industry included at the insistence of the Speaker of the House; \n$93 million in special tax treatment for race horses; $260 million in \ntax cuts for the timber industry; $15 million for asparagus growers. \nDuring debate on the Senate farm bill last year, my colleague Senator \nGregg offered an amendment, which failed, to strike this provision. \nThis is a crop that has never before received farm subsidies; $175 \nmillion would be transferred to Bureau of Reclamation for activities at \nthree Nevada lakes; $500,000 to the Walker River Paiute Tribe for legal \nand professional services in support of settling tribal water claims. \nOther tribes have dealt with water rights without a half million dollar \nearmark; $5 million for joint planning and development activities for \nwater, wastewater, and sewer facilities by the city of Fernley, Nevada, \nand the Pyramid Lake Paiute Tribe.\n  The bill authorizes a myriad of grant programs including grants for \nresearch into pig genetics, grants for the preservation of historic \nbarns, and $300 million for the Sun Grant Program, which provides \ngrants to 6 universities and science centers that conduct bioenergy \nresearch.\n  Twenty million dollars goes to the collection and storage of seeds \nfor research purposes; $75 million for a crop research facility in El \nReno, OK; $35 million to promote the production of ``hard white \nwheat.''\n  A $4 billion disaster assistance package on top of an existing crop \ninsurance program that's subsidized by the Federal Government. And \nthese are only a few examples of the questionable provisions expected \nto hit the President's desk.\n  As you may know, farm subsidies were originally designed to ensure \nfarmers get a fair return on their labors, but the majority of \nsubsidies go to large commercial farms that average $200,000 in annual \nincome and $2 million in net worth. Indeed, these payments aren't going \nto the average hardworking American farmer working in the Heartland. \nThis farm bill actually increases subsidy rates for some crops and a \nmajority of those payments are funneled only to a few staple crops. \nDuring debate on the Senate farm bill last fall, I proudly cosponsored \nan amendment which would have capped subsidies for farmers whose income \nexceeds $250,000. That amendment, which was rejected, was written by \nSenators Byron Dorgan of North Dakota and Chuck Grassley of Iowa--two \ndistinguished colleagues who understand rural America better than most. \nInstead of fixing a system that provides farm payments to millionaire \nland owners, sometimes when they don't grow anything at all, Congress \nignored the cries for reform from small farmers themselves. In fact, \nthis farm bill contains a phony payment limit designed to allow farmers \nto earn up to $750,000 and $500,000 off the farm before hitting any \nsubsidy ceiling. Astounding.\n  This Congressional feeding frenzy is tragic because other areas of \nthe bill have merit, like the increased funding and focus on food \nassistance and nutrition programs. In particular, the bill would index \nfood stamps to reflect the current cost of living and fill shortfalls \nin the Emergency Food Assistance Program. Unfortunately, the bad \noutweighs the good in this bill.\n  More than hand-outs, more than ballooning disaster payments, the \nfamilies and small businesses throughout the Heartland are demanding \naffordable quality health care, better education for their children, \nlower taxes, and relief from government regulation. Rural America has \nseen farm bill after farm bill passed without policies that adequately \npromote economic development or address population loss. We must \nimprove rural life, provide high-tech connectivity essential for jobs \nand education, open trade markets, maintain our competitiveness, and \nreduce overregulation for farmers and ranchers.\n  For now, we need to put an end to flawed government policies that \ndistort the markets, artificially raise prices for consumers, and pit \nproducers against consumers. We have once again failed farmers in that \nregard, which is why I oppose this bill.\n\n[[Page S4229]]\n\n  Mr ENZI. Mr. President, I wish today to speak about the farm bill \nconference report. Without a doubt, our Nation's rural communities are \nin need of a new national agricultural policy. Since the last farm bill \nwas passed in 2002, there have been substantial changes in agriculture \nand this bill is needed to keep American farmers and ranchers on track \nduring a time of growing demand on our food system. In recent weeks, I \nhave come to the floor to ask my colleagues to do something about \nhealth care, do something about high energy prices, and today I am \nasking that we do something for our agricultural producers.\n  When this farm bill passed the Senate in December, it passed with \nsubstantial support. Today we are considering a farm bill that reflects \nthat support and takes steps to improve American agriculture. That \nbeing said, for many agricultural producers this farm bill is coming \nmonths late and dollars over budget. The opportunity to consider a farm \nbill is rarer than an October harvest moon and lawmakers must take \nspecial care to ensure that the seeds we sow today will reap a \nbountiful harvest tomorrow. I wish to make the point that addressing \nthe needs of both producers and consumers goes beyond the language of \nthis farm bill. Successful farm policy begins with lower energy costs, \naffordable health care, and competitive domestic and foreign markets.\n  As the Senate considers this farm bill, the question that should be \non all our minds is at what cost does this farm policy come to our \nproducers, our consumers, and our country. This conference report comes \nto the floor at a time when U.S. farm income is expected to reach an \nall-time high of $92.3 billion. It is true that our Nation's producers \nare facing higher costs to fill their tanks, fertilize their fields, \nfeed their livestock and pay for their health care. However, this farm \nbill does not go far enough to cut the subsidies handed out to the \nwealthiest of farmers. I supported and applauded the efforts of my \ncolleagues when the Senate considered amendments to the farm bill in \nDecember to limit these payments. Family farms are the backbone of \nAmerican agriculture and the farm safety net should only be extended to \nonly those who are in the most need, not to those making nearly \n$750,000 a year. This farm bill balloons to nearly $300 billion because \nthe conference report makes only modest cuts to the largest payments. \nThere is nothing wrong with helping our farmers guarantee a safe and \nsecure food supply, but that assistance does not deserve to go to \nfarmers who fashion diamond studded coveralls and golden pitchforks.\n  It is not just a financial travesty that these payoffs to \nagribusiness are in the bill, it is a policy travesty because this farm \nbill does have some very good policy contained within its pages. Many \nof these provisions I have worked to pass for a long time, but like \ngophers in the garden, these payments to millionaires have ruined a \ngood product.\n  I support provisions that were included in the farm bill that help \nlivestock producers and come at no expense to the U.S. Treasury. For \nthe first time, the farm bill contains a livestock title to promote \ncompetition and fairness in our agricultural markets. In the past, I \nlabeled the farm bill as, ``Do No Harm, Do No Good'' for ranchers \nacross this country. I said this because the farm bill never addressed \nthe needs of hard-working independent livestock producers like those \nfound in Wyoming. Well this farm bill includes something I have been \nworking on since I came to the Senate 11 years ago and that is language \nto implement mandatory country of origin labeling, often referred to as \nCOOL. COOL provides consumers with important information about the \nsource of food and allows our livestock producers, who hands down \nproduce the highest quality meats in the world, to remain competitive \nin a growing global market. No more excuses, no more foot dragging, the \ntime is hot for COOL.\n  The livestock title also contains provisions that will improve the \nLivestock Mandatory Reporting Act by making market information easily \naccessible online and will improve the enforcement of the Packers and \nStockyards Act by requiring the USDA to report annually on its \ninvestigations into violations. All important provisions for livestock \nproducers who simply wish to have a fair and competitive market for \ntheir animals. I was disappointed to see that the conference committee \nleft out an important provision that was passed by the Senate last \nyear, just as it did in 2002. The ban on packer ownership was an \nimportant step in ensuring that independent livestock producers have \naccess to markets in light of growing consolidation among meat packers. \nFinally, I would like to address language in the livestock title that \npromotes the ability for local ranchers to market their product across \nState lines when processed at State-inspected plants. The interstate \nmeat inspection language is critical for the small mom-and-pop \nprocessing plants who meet Federal standards but cannot afford to pay \nfor a full-time Federal inspector. These facilities, that already meet \nrigorous state inspection standards, will now be able to sell \nspecialized products across State lines and ultimately help producers \nfind value-added marketing opportunities for their livestock.\n  For Wyoming and a number of other Western States, another provision \nin this bill that costs little but yields significant results, is this \nNation's investment in animal health programs. I was pleased to see \nlanguage that makes brucellosis a high-priority research initiative in \nthe U.S. Department of Agriculture and clarifications for the Animal \nHealth and Disease Research Program that provides vital applied animal \nresearch to producers on the ground.\n  For conservation, this bill makes significant improvements to the \nincentives and financial assistance offered to land owners who use the \nEnvironmental Quality Incentives and Conservation Reserve programs. I \nam especially pleased to see that the CRP program offers additional \nassistance to beginning farmers and ranchers since we all know that one \nof the greatest challenges to the future of agriculture is attracting \nyoung people into the industry.\n  There are some positive changes made in the farm bill, but the \nconference report clearly lacks alternatives and only makes small steps \nto improve the condition of agricultural producers across our country. \nOne alternative that I would like to present to my colleagues is to \ncontinue promoting new markets for American agricultural products \nthrough trade overseas and develop better markets domestically by \npromoting fair and competitive markets for our livestock producers. In \naddition to these steps, there are scores of things this Congress can \ndo today to ease the burden on rural America that cannot be solved in \nfarm legislation. The Senate should take action to address the cost of \nrising energy costs and more importantly reduce the cost of health care \nfor Americans. For the past several months, I have come to the Senate \nfloor to speak about my 10 steps to transform health care in America \nand policies to lower energy prices by increasing supply and developing \ndomestic sources of production. All of these things being said, this \ncountry desperately needs a new agricultural policy, and I hope that we \nwill not stop merely with this farm bill. Sound farm policy goes beyond \ncommodity payments and nutrition programs. It begins with providing the \nmen and women sitting in the saddle with affordable energy, affordable \nhealth care, and fair and competitive markets to sell their products.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise in support of the farm bill \nconference report.\n  The bill takes many positive steps to level the playing field in \nAmerican agriculture by recognizing the importance of specialty crops \nto the nation's economy and the need to provide more funding for \nprograms that promote renewable energy, protect our environmental \nresources, and keep our children healthy.\n  This is by no means a perfect bill, but it is a great improvement \nover our current, outdated farm policy that for too long has hurt \nCalifornia's farmers and growers.\n  California is the Nation's largest agricultural state, with more than \n350 different crops worth $32 billion per year. Yet our State has been \nlargely overlooked when it comes to the billions in federal support for \nagriculture.\n  For the first time, the farm bill is recognizing the importance of \nspecialty crops to our Nation's economy.\n  Included in the Senate bill is mandatory funding for specialty crops \nblock\n\n[[Page S4230]]\n\ngrants, organic farmers, farmers market programs, trade assistance and \nforeign market access programs, the community foods program, and \nimportant specialty crops and organics research.\n  The bill also provides over $1 billion in funding for the Fresh Fruit \nand Vegetable Snack Program, expanding participation in the program to \nall 50 States. This program provides a critically important strategy in \nthe fight to prevent and reduce childhood obesity by providing as many \nas 3 million low-income elementary school children in 5,000 schools \nnationwide the ability to receive a fresh fruit or vegetable snack \nevery day at school.\n  Numerous studies have indicated that eating fruits and vegetables can \nprevent cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer, and hypertension, in \naddition to obesity. Yet less than one out of every six children eats \nthe USDA recommended amount of fresh fruit, and only 1 out of 5 \nchildren eats the recommended amount of vegetables. The funding \nincluded in the farm bill will ensure that schools in California and in \nevery State in the Nation can implement this important child nutrition \nprogram.\n  Also included in the nutrition title are much needed modernizations \nand updates to the food stamp assistance program. The bill not only \nrenames this program as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, \nor SNAP, but it also provides critical improvements that will greatly \nhelp families in need. As a result of deep cuts to the Food Stamp \nProgram in the mid-1990s, the purchasing power of families' food \nassistance benefits has eroded greatly over time. The farm bill invests \nsignificant resources; $5.4 billion over the next 10 years, to end that \nerosion and partially restore benefit levels that have been lost. The \nbill increases the minimum SNAP benefit to $14, up from the current \n$10, and indexes that level to future inflation. The bill also \nincreases assistance to families with high childcare expenses by \nallowing a full deduction for childcare expenses in calculating family \nincome and benefit levels.\n  And with our Nation's food banks experiencing unprecedented shortages \nduring this period of high demand for supplemental food assistance, the \nbill nearly doubles the amount authorized for the Emergency Food \nAssistance Program, providing $1.25 billion over 10 years and providing \n$50 million in emergency money for food banks currently enduring severe \nshortages.\n  The farm bill also provides an important opportunity to increase \nprotection of our Nation's natural resources and its open space. \nFarmers can enroll in a number of conservation programs that allow them \nto provide habitat protection for native species, protect wetlands and \ngrasslands, and undertake initiatives to make their farms more \nenvironmentally friendly--but the last farm bill did not do enough to \nprovide farmers with the resources they need to fully participate in \nconservation activities.\n  In 2004, California had a $143 million backlog in payments and \nenrollments in conservation programs due to lack of funding and low \nacreage caps. An average of 4,000 farmers and landowners in California \nare rejected each year when they apply to USDA conservation programs. \nSixty-eight percent of California's farmers seeking Environmental \nQuality Incentives Program, EQIP, funding turned away. Nationwide, $18 \nbillion worth of conservation applications have gone unfunded during \nthe life of the 2002 farm bill.\n  As a result of inadequate funding for conservation programs, \nCalifornia is rapidly losing thousands of acres of farmland and open \nspace. Ninety-five percent of the wetlands in the Central Valley have \nbeen lost, and 171,000 acres of farmland were lost in California from \n2002 to 2004.\n  The conference report takes important steps to provide farmers with \nmore access to conservation programs, and while I am disappointed that \nmore funding was not included, the $4 billion in new spending will \nallow many more farmers and landowners in California to participate in \nimportant resource protection programs like the Wetlands Reserve \nProgram, the Grasslands Reserve Program, and EQIP.\n  I am also grateful that the conferees pushed back against efforts to \nrestrict full-time farmers from participating in conservation programs. \nThe purpose of conservation programs is to encourage farmers and \nlandowners to provide a public benefit by protecting their land from \ndevelopment, and in the future we must ensure that income eligibility \ncaps are not applied to conservation programs, as these would be very \ndetrimental to resource protection efforts in California.\n  The farm bill also authorizes a number of programs that will benefit \nCalifornia's rural communities, such as low-interest loans to rural \nelectric cooperatives for renewable energy production and grants and \nloan guarantees to develop broadband access in rural areas.\n  I am also pleased that the bill contains significant investments for \nfarm-based energy, including the development of cellulosic ethanol. I \nam concerned about the impact of corn ethanol on food and feed prices, \nespecially in light of the fact that alternative, renewable fuels can \nbe created from a number of other agricultural sources, many of which \nare produced in California. This farm bill takes great steps to \nencourage the development of cellulosic fuels that can be produced in \nCalifornia by providing loan guarantees to encourage farmers to grow \nbiomass crops and incentives to drive the advancement of commercial \nscale biorefineries for advanced biofuels.\n\n  The conference report also includes important reforms to commodity \nprograms, including the elimination of the three-entity rule, a direct \nattribution requirement, and income means tests to prevent very wealthy \nfarmers from receiving certain commodity payments. I would have liked \nto see some additional reforms, but the conference report represents a \npositive first step in the effort to improve and update our commodity \nprograms.\n  I would also like to thank Chairman Harkin and the conferees for \nincluding a number of provisions I authored into the farm bill.\n  Air quality improvements in agricultural areas: In rural areas around \nthe country, smog and soot are threatening public health, fouling \ncommunities, and reducing crop productivity from pollution generated on \nfarms. I joined forces with Congressman Cardoza to include language \nauthorizing a new program in the existing Environmental Quality \nIncentives Program, EQIP, that will allocate $150 million in funds over \nthe next 5 years toward air quality mitigation efforts in agricultural \ncommunities with poor air quality. USDA has invested money in \nCalifornia since 1998 that has produced measurable and permanent \npollution reductions in a region that has some of the worst air quality \nin the Nation. With this new program in place, these efforts can be \nexpanded in California and replicated throughout the Nation.\n  Pollinator Protection Act: This provision authorizes up to $100 \nmillion over 5 years for high priority research dedicated to \nmaintaining and protecting our honey bee and native pollinator \npopulations. There has been a loss of about 25 percent of the Nation's \nhoney bee population, and it is estimated that crops nationwide that \ndepend on a healthy honey bee and native pollinator population are \nvalued near $18 billion.\n  Protecting sugar beet farmers and hundreds of jobs in Fresno County: \nI helped negotiate a change in the national sugar allocation program \nthat will provide a sugar beet grower cooperative in the Central Valley \nwith the necessary allocation to continue growing sugar beets and keep \nthe Mendota sugar refinery open. The grower cooperative is working to \npurchase the sugar refinery from an out-of-state owner, and if \nsuccessful, they will keep the refinery operating and save 400 full-\ntime and seasonal jobs in Fresno County, where the March unemployment \nrate was 11.1 percent.\n  Pest Detection and Surveillance Act: This provision authorizes $407 \nmillion to give USDA the authority to enter into cooperative funding \nagreements with States to enhance their pest and disease detection and \nsurveillance programs and increase inspections at domestic points of \nentry, implement pest trapping systems, and create pest eradication and \nprevention programs, among many other pest detection and surveillance \ninitiatives. This program will help protect California's agricultural \neconomy from harmful pests and diseases and keep our farmers \ncompetitive.\n\n[[Page S4231]]\n\n  Preservation of 40-year-old meat inspection laws: The House-passed \nbill included language that would allow meat and poultry plants to \nforgo Federal inspections in favor of more lax and uneven State-run \ninspections--potentially putting the health of millions of Americans at \nrisk. I worked with Senator Harkin, consumer groups, and labor unions \nto protect the integrity of the Federal meat inspection process. In the \nwake of the largest recall of beef in our Nation's history, Congress \nshould be working to strengthen food safety standards, not rolling back \nthe Federal Government's crucial role in protecting our people.\n  Agricultural watershed enhancement: The Sacramento River watershed \nand other national regional watersheds have been identified by \nconservation groups as watersheds most in need of water quality and \nwater quantity enhancement. I worked to ensure that the Sacramento \nRiver watershed is treated as a priority-funding area.\n  Protection against use of harmful pesticides: I led an effort to \nprevent the inclusion of language that would have jeopardized the \nability of conservation managers to encourage the use of the safest, \nleast toxic, and most environmentally friendly pesticides in carrying \nout activities under key farm bill programs. The House-passed bill \nincluded this harmful provision at the urging of pesticide \nmanufacturers, and it would have tied the hands of local managers to \nencourage viable alternatives to pesticides that can be harmful to our \nair, water, wildlife, pollinators, and human health.\n  Edible schoolyards: The bill strengthens the Access to Local Foods \nand School Gardens Program by supporting the development of school \ncurriculum that teaches the principles of ecology, origins of food, and \npromotes healthy food choices. This language supports the replication \nof the successful Edible Schoolyard Program in Berkeley, CA. The bill \nalso includes $50 million over 5 years in mandatory funding for the \nCommunity Foods Program, which funds programs like edible schoolyards.\n  I also worked with Chairman Harkin and the conferees to include an \navocado marketing order agreement, a national study on biofuels \ninfrastructure, language prioritizing edible schoolyards programs in \nschools under the Community Foods Program, and a $15 million asparagus \nmarket loss program to help growers in California.\n  This bill had significant and widespread support from stakeholders in \nCalifornia and throughout the Nation. I want to recognize and thank the \ngroups from my State that expressed their support for the bill. These \ngroups include Western Growers Association, California Farmers Union, \nCalifornia Farm Bureau Federation, California Grape and Tree Fruit \nLeague, California Cattlemen's Association, California Rice Commission, \nCalifornia Citrus Mutual, California Association of County Agriculture \nCommissioners, California Association of Winegrape Growers, The Wine \nInstitute, California Rangeland Conservation Coalition of California, \nCalifornia Apple Commission, Nisei Farmers League, California Kiwi \nCommission, Merced-Mariposa Cattlemen's Association, Northeast \nCalifornia Farm Credit, Blue Diamond Growers, Buy California Marketing \nAgreement, California Dried Plum Board, California Fig Institute, \nCalifornia Fresh Fig Growers Association, California Strawberry \nCommission, California Table Grape Association, California Walnut \nCommission, California-Arizona Watermelon Association, Grower-Shipper \nAssociation of Central California, Sunkist Growers, California \nAssociation and Nursery and Garden Centers, California Association of \nWheat Growers, California Association of Food Banks, Alameda County \nCommunity Food Bank, California Food Policy Advocates, California \nHunger Action Coalition, California School Employees Association, \nCatholic Charities, Diocese of Stockton, Coalition of California \nWelfare Rights Organizations, Congregation Emanu-El, Desert Cities \nHunger Action, Emergency Food Bank Stockton/San Joaquin, Food Bank \nCoalition of San Luis Obispo Co., Food Bank of Monterey County, Food \nBank of Contra Costa and Solano, Food Bank of San Luis Obispo County, \nFOOD Share, Inc., Fresno Metro Ministry, Fresno Community Good Bank, \nGrace Resource Center, HRC Food Bank, Calaveras County, Imperial Valley \nFood Bank, Insight Center for Community Economic Development, \nInterfaith Council of Amador, Oceano Community Center, Peggy Cole \nMinistries Int'l, Redwood Empire Food Bank, San Luis Obispo County \nYMCA, San Luis Obispo Food Bank Coalition, San Luis Obispo Supported \nLiving, Inc., Transitional Food and Shelter, Inc., Transitions Mental \nHealth Association, Village Community Resource Center, Los Angeles \nRegional Food Bank, Stockton Food Bank, Oakland Insight Center for \nCommunity Economic Development, Greater Stockton Emergency Food Bank, \nSecond Harvest of Santa Clara County, Second Harvest of Santa Cruz \nCounty, Second Harvest of San Benito County, Second Harvest of San \nMateo County, Food Bank for Humboldt County, Community Action \nPartnership of Orange County, San Francisco Food Bank, San Diego Hunger \nCoalition, Alameda County Community Food Bank, and Eureka Food for \nPeople.\n  This farm bill is important for California's farmers, families, its \nenvironmental resources, our consumers, and for the State's economy, \nand I am pleased support it.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the farm bill \nconference report, which would provide unprecedented amounts of funding \nfor nutrition programs and food stamps. These programs are vital, \nespecially in this time of high food prices and our struggling economy. \nThe farm bill invests nearly $396 billion over 10 years into the Food \nStamp Program, which is nearly $10 billion more than current law. In \naddition, for the first time this farm bill recognizes that the minimum \nbenefits provided through food stamps should be indexed for inflation, \nso they increase as the cost of living increases. We have a \nresponsibility to help those who are most in need, and this farm bill \nrecognizes that.\n  This farm bill also makes substantial investments in Conservation \nProgram. With the high price of land in New Jersey and the competitive \nmarkets facing New Jersey's farmers, there is a great incentive to \nover-farm and not enough money to implement the best environmental \npractices. Providing $2.4 billion for programs like the Environmental \nQuality Incentive Program, EQIP, will help farmers bring their products \ndirectly to market while preserving their land for the future and \nwithout taking a toll on the environment. This is a dramatic \nimprovement from the Senate-passed bill, which did not include any \nfunding for this program. New Jersey's farmers frequently utilize EQIP \nto improve the environmental condition of their farms, and the increase \nof funding in this conference report is critical.\n  This farm bill also recognizes for the first time the importance of \nfruits and vegetables to our health and to our agricultural economy. \nNew Jersey is the second largest producer of blueberries and the third \nlargest grower of cranberries. These crops are not only nutritious, but \nthey are vital to New Jersey's economy. This farm bill makes major \ninvestments for fruit and vegetable growers, as well as purchasers. It \nprovides nearly $500 million to the Specialty Crop Block Grant Program, \nwhich provides assistance to these farmers--an increase of \napproximately $200 million over the Senate-passed farm bill. It would \nalso provide over $1 billion for the Fruit and Vegetable Snack Program, \nwhich provides healthy, nutritious fruits and vegetables to our \nschools, so that our children can avoid the health risks of a poor \ndiet.\n  Finally, this farm bill takes incremental steps towards providing the \nkind of real reform that our Nation's agricultural policy needs. It \nimposes payment limitations to restrict farmers above certain income \nlevels from being eligible for commodity payments, and it reduces \nspending for direct payments by over $300 million. These reforms are a \nsignificant improvement from the Senate-passed bill, and I thank the \nbill's managers for responding to the increasing chorus of calls for \nfarm bill reform.\n  I still believe that we need more substantial reform of our \nagricultural policy and that the FRESH Act that I offered on the Senate \nfloor with Senator Dick Lugar would provide that much needed reform. I \nwill continue to work with Senator Lugar and all of my colleagues in \nthe Senate to replace the\n\n[[Page S4232]]\n\ncurrent system of subsidies for just a handful of crops and implement a \nsystem that benefits all crops. And I will continue to advocate and \nfight for a policy that provides more incentives for the production of \nhealthy foods such as fruits and vegetables. While the farm bill that \nhas emerged from conference is by no means perfect, it is better than \nthe farm bill the Senate originally passed, and I intend to support it.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I intend to support this conference report \nand encourage my colleagues to do likewise.\n  Achieving consensus on farm bills is a notoriously difficult task. \nFor all their hard work on this measure, I want to express my \nappreciation to Chairman Harkin, Ranking Member Chambliss, and the \ntalented staff who put in long hours to get us to this point.\n  The end result of these hard-fought negotiations is a better safety \nnet for dairy producers in Wisconsin and across the Nation. This bill \nrestores and strengthens the original MILC Program, which was a hard-\nwon effort designed to end regional dairy battles and provide a safety \nnet for small and midsized producers. Since its implementation 6 years \nago, MILC has proven to be a critical backstop for thousands of family \nfarmers when milk prices plummet. The ``feed cost adjuster'' included \nin this bill acknowledges that rising feed costs have become a real \nchallenge for dairy farmers. My colleague and friend Senator Leahy and \nhis staff played a pivotal roll in guiding these provisions and I \ncommend their work.\n  This measure also moves forward in allowing interstate commerce in \nState-inspected meat products. This has been a significant priority for \nme. Wisconsin has more State-inspected plants run by Main Street \nentrepreneurs than any other State in the Nation. They make great \nproducts. At a time of further proposed market concentration among \nmajor slaughterhouses, we ought to find a way for these smaller \nentrepreneurs to safely expand their markets and compete across State \nborders. Doing so will be good for livestock producers, consumers, and \nMain Street businesses.\n  The nutrition title of this bill is also noteworthy. It incorporates \nurgently needed updates to the Food Stamp Program, to be known \nhereafter as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. Over the \nyears, low-income households have suffered erosion of benefits due to \ninflation. The current minimum food stamp benefit has not been raised \nin over 30 years. This bill raises the minimum benefit and indexes it \nto inflation. It removes disincentives for retirement and education \nsavings and takes childcare costs into consideration when calculating \neligibility. It strengthens support for food banks and will help get \nmore fresh fruits and vegetables into our schools.\n  The conference report includes a compromise on easement valuations \nunder the Wetlands Reserve Program, WRP. Administrative changes to the \nWRP have diminished its usefulness in Wisconsin and other parts of the \nNation, and these changes are intended to correct that problem. This is \nan area, like several others, where I intend to closely monitor the \nUSDA's implementation of the law\n  I am very pleased that the 2007 farm bill conference report includes \nthe authorization of funds for the Housing Assistance Council. HAC is a \nnonprofit organization that is dedicated to the development of \naffordable rural housing. The Housing Assistance Council offers loans \nand technical support to local nonprofit entities across the country to \ndevelop safe and affordable housing in rural communities. With nearly \none-fifth of the Nation's population living in rural communities and \n7.5 million of that population living in poverty, decent affordable \nhousing is in short supply. HAC provides the necessary tools to create \nand develop housing opportunities in areas of our country that are \noften overlooked.\n  This bill, like any bill, has shortcomings in some people's eyes. \nMany of us wish more could be done to reform payment limits and target \nbenefits. But at the end of the day this bill is superior to extension \nof current law and makes some meaningful improvements in critical \nareas.\n  As chairman of the Senate Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee, I \nhave the honor and responsibility of working on a farm bill each year \nin the form of an annual appropriations bill for the USDA. There are a \nnumber of provisions and programs in this measure which are directly \ntied to discretionary, appropriated funding. Of course, the \nsubcommittee's ability to act on those objectives in the appropriations \nprocess is directly tied to the resources made available to the \nsubcommittee. I look forward to working with my colleagues and the \nexecutive branch as we try to balance all of these critical health, \nsafety, conservation, nutrition, research, and rural development \nobjectives.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, as this Senate takes up the farm bill \nconference report, I want to share with my colleagues several important \nways that this bill will benefit the farmers and the people of \nKentucky.\n  Agriculture generates $4 billion in cash receipts in Kentucky every \nyear. We rank fourth in the Nation in the number of farms per State, \nand 54 percent of Kentucky's acreage is farmland. We are the largest \nbeef-cattle producing State east of the Mississippi, and we produce a \ndiverse array of crops. So the contents of this report are very \nimportant to Kentucky.\n  I received a letter this week from the Kentucky Farm Bureau \nreiterating this bill's importance to Kentucky and America. They wrote, \n``While the bill is not perfect, it is a carefully crafted bill . . . \nthat continues to provide a solid foundation for American agriculture \nto continue production of food and fiber not only for Americans, but \nthe world.''\n  Because agricultural production varies greatly across my State, \nKentucky benefits from a wide array of conservation efforts, including \nthe Conservation Reserve Program, the Environmental Quality Incentives \nProgram, the Wildlife Habitat Incentives Program, the Farm and Ranch \nLands Protection Program, and others.\n  As a supporter of conservation efforts with a long record of working \nto protect Kentucky's natural resources, it is important to me that \nthis conference report continues to support these initiatives.\n  Approximately 50 percent of Kentucky's land is forested, so it was \nimportant that this legislation open many USDA conservation programs to \nforest landowners. That will yield improved air quality, cleaner \ndrinking water, and less soil erosion, among other environmental \nbenefits to our State.\n  Kentucky also has an interest in the production of renewable fuels; \nthis conference report includes important incentives to spur the growth \nof this industry as well.\n  On another note, I am glad the conference committee has seen fit to \ninclude my provision addressing the need for better nutrition for our \nschoolchildren. I cast the deciding vote to save the School Lunch \nProgram in 1995, and educating our kids about the food they eat remains \na priority.\n  This provision calls on USDA to survey what schools are serving to \nour children. This information will help USDA provide guidance to \nschools to serve healthier meals and it is sorely needed, as USDA's \nmost recent data on this question is over a decade old.\n  In the last 30 years, the childhood obesity rate has more than \ntripled. Today, over 4.5 million American children are facing a \nlifetime of all the increased health risks that obesity causes. This \nnutrition provision can be the first step towards reversing that \nunfortunate trend.\n  Let me also note that this conference report retains a number of \nprovisions I authored to support Kentucky's largest agricultural \nproduct, the horse industry. While the world's eyes focus on Kentucky \none day each year for the running of the Kentucky Derby, I point out to \nmy colleagues that the horse industry employs 50,000 Kentuckians and \ncontributes $3.5 billion to our economy year-round. I want to ensure \nthis important part of our farm economy is treated fairly.\n  On one final topic, I would be remiss if I didn't mention my \ndisappointment that this bill will unfairly punish Kentucky's small \nfarmers by making all farmers with less than 10 base acres ineligible \nfor farm payments. That disproportionately hurts Kentucky because we \nhave such a high proportion\n\n[[Page S4233]]\n\nof small farms. I am concerned this punitive portion of the bill will \nhave broader consequences than the authors realize and will punish some \nof those farmers who might be most in need of assistance.\n  However, the good appears to outweigh the troubling aspects of this \nconference report, and a lot of Kentuckians will benefit from the many \nimportant programs that are promoted and preserved in this bill. I will \nsupport it and by doing so, support the hard-working farmers in \nKentucky who are feeding our Nation and the world while providing a \nliving for so many citizens in America.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the conference \nreport to H.R. 2419, the Food and Energy Security Act of 2007.\n  I am pleased to vote in favor of passage of the conference report, as \nthis legislation includes a number of programs of paramount importance \nto the Commonwealth of Virginia, including the creation of the \nChesapeake Bay Watershed Program to replenish the bay.\n  Virginia, Maryland, and others in the Chesapeake Bay Watershed have \nworked diligently to implement programs to reduce nutrient run-off and \nother sources of pollution that enter the Bay, all in an effort to \nachieve a cleaner Chesapeake Bay. The Chesapeake Bay Watershed Program \nwill provide the Federal assistance necessary to support regional and \nState efforts to reach this important goal.\n  In addition, this bill will enhance conservation across the United \nStates. Its provisions, such as technical assistance and conservation \neasements, will help protect more land for preservation and \nenvironmental initiatives.\n  Also, I note that provisions of this conference report provide \ngreater research support and assistance for growers of specialty crops \nand significant changes to the nutrition title to promote better health \nfor schoolchildren and increase support for our Nation's food banks.\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues in the Senate \nto join me in supporting final passage of the farm bill conference \nreport.\n  I would like to thank the Senator from Iowa, Mr. Harkin, for his \nleadership in crafting this 5 year, $289 billion bill, which, for the \nfirst time, directs more than two-thirds of the spending towards \nnutrition and food assistance. It provides a strong safety net for \nfarmers, and gives them the certainty needed in a sector that provides \nan important human resource--food--amidst the unpredictable dynamics of \nweather and markets. The bill provides stronger financial support for \nconservation programs and needed improvements for livestock producers \nwhen dealing with the packing industry.\n  It is not a perfect bill, but it is a good bill. Of particular note \nis $10 billion in new spending for food assistance programs for low-\nincome individuals, which is particularly timely in this period of high \nfood prices. Potential recipients are no longer disqualified because of \nchild care or if they have money saved in tax-deferred education or \nhealth care accounts. For the first time, food assistance is indexed \nfor inflation, and for the first time in 30 years, the minimum monthly \nbenefit is increased from $10 to $14. This is good news and will help \nreach more of the 35 million Americans who struggle each day to feed \ntheir children and families.\n  The bill provides $4 billion in new conservation spending, with \ngreater focus on working lands. It provides a more fiscally responsive \napproach to disaster assistance funding by establishing a permanent \nprogram.\n  The bill also recognizes our national priority to begin shifting to \ngreater production of cellulosic ethanol as part of our biofuels mix. \nThe bill includes an important tax incentive for cellulosic ethanol \nproduction--first proposed by my colleague from Indiana, Dick Lugar, \nand myself. There are also several incentives that will help to \nestablish croplands dedicated to cellulosic feedstock production, and \nconcurrent research and development towards these objectives.\n  I am particularly pleased that this legislation includes a program \nauthored by my esteemed senior colleague from Illinois, Mr. Durbin, \nwhich creates a new optional revenue-based program for farmers, called \nthe average crop revenue election, a forward-thinking initiative that \nwill help Midwestern corn growers.\n  No, this bill does not include the level of reform to farm programs \nthat I think was warranted. I believe that the payment and income \nlimitations could have gone much further. The bill does, however, \nprovide long overdue improvements to existing law. It stops the \nremarkable practice of sending payments to deceased farmers. It ends \nthe so-called three entity rule, which was the abuse of manipulating \ncurrent law by collecting triple payments. It requires direct \nattribution of farm payments to a person, rather than a company or an \nentity. And it refocuses the original intent of farm payments to serve \nas a safety net to those who need it most by ending payments to \nindividuals who make more than $750,000 in farm income or $500,000 in \nnonfarm income.\n  And this bill provides important relief to America's black farmers. \nFor far too long, our country's hardworking African-American farmers \nwere discriminated against by the Federal Government and county \ncommittees, which denied them credit and benefit programs because of \ntheir race. This injustice ran deep and had devastating effects.\n  Because so many of these farmers were denied credit and benefits, the \nnumber of African American farmers from 1920 until the early 1990s \ndeclined by almost 98 percent. During this time, too many African-\nAmerican farmers saw their land foreclosed upon or were forced out of \nfarming altogether.\n  In 1999, the Department of Agriculture settled a class action lawsuit \nwith African-American farmers in the case of Pigford v. Glickman, which \nallowed many of these farmers to file claims against the USDA for \nfailing to respond to racial discrimination. A Federal court approved \nthis settlement as ``a good first step towards assuring that this kind \nof discrimination that has been visited on African American farmers \nsince Reconstruction will not continue into the next century.'' This \nPigford settlement brought relief to more than 20,000 Black farmers.\n  Yet the USDA underestimated the number of potential claimants and \ngave inadequate notice to farmers about the Pigford settlement. \nTherefore, many farmers were unable to file their claims before the \nfiling deadline. About 75,000 additional African-American farmers who \nfiled their claims of discrimination after the filing deadline were \ndenied any opportunity to have their claims heard and evaluated on the \nmerits.\n  That is why I introduced legislation in the Senate to provide tens of \nthousands of eligible late Pigford claimants a right to go to court and \nhave their cases heard. Thanks to bipartisan support by the Senate \nAgriculture Committee, this legislation is included in the conference \nreport before us today.\n  Again, I thank Senator Harkin for his efforts on this important \nlegislation, and I call on my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the \nconference report to accompany the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act \nof 2008. It is a good bill for Florida and I commend Chairman Harkin, \nSenator Chambliss, Chairman Baucus, Senator Grassley, and the members \nof both committees for all of their tireless work to pass this bill.\n  First and foremost, this bill provides a substantial increase in food \nassistance to our Nation's low-income families. Nearly three-fourths of \nthe total spending of the farm bill goes in fact to nutrition programs \nsuch as food stamps, now known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance \nProgram. Not only do we increase purchasing power of these benefits but \nwe also change how a family's need may be calculated; it will take into \naccount childcare costs and education and retirement savings.\n  For the first time in history the farm bill also takes into account \nan agricultural sector that is of the utmost importance in Florida--\nspecialty crops. Florida is the leading producer of citrus, tomatoes, \ncucumbers, snap beans, bell peppers, squash and watermelon, and is the \nsecond leading producer of strawberries, sweet corn, and greenhouse and \nnursery products. This legislation recognizes the importance of\n\n[[Page S4234]]\n\ncrops such as these as an integral part of our Nation's food supply, \nand provides nearly $3 billion in research, block grants to states, \npest and disease control, farmers' market promotion, and the Fresh \nFruit and Vegetable Program.\n  Of similar importance are the strides made in this bill for \nconservation and energy programs. Florida's natural resources stand to \nbenefit tremendously from increased funding for conservation, which \nwill allow the State to optimize participation in land preservation, \nenvironmentally friendly land management practices, and easement \nprograms. Correspondingly, the bill notably encourages advancements in \ncellulosic energy, which will allow us to explore the production of \nethanol from agricultural products that we don't otherwise eat--\nproducts in which Florida is rich.\n  There are many significant improvements for Florida in this \nconference report. It is not a perfect bill, but it increases funding \nand support for integral programs while also making reforms to a \nsometimes abused system. It is a good bill for Florida, and I encourage \nthe President to support it.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the 2008 \nfarm bill. I thank the chairman, Tom Harkin of Iowa, and Senator Saxby \nChambliss of Georgia for their leadership on this bill.\n  This is, on balance, a good bill, but it could be better. In \nparticular, I am concerned that we were not more aggressive in making \nsure that the commodity program payments are targeted and justified. At \na time when millions of middle-class Americans are struggling to keep \nup with higher gas prices, grocery bills, and health care costs, the \nFederal Government should not be in the business of sending checks to \nmillionaire land owners.\n  Currently, most full-time farmers are eligible for farm subsidies \nregardless of income. Many of my colleagues and I began this process \nhoping that Congress would change this situation in the farm bill. \nUnfortunately, the conference agreement rejected all farmer income \ntests for the countercyclical and marketing loan subsidy programs and \nincludes only a weak net income cap for direct payments: $750,000 for \nsingle farmers and $1.5 million for married farmers after all business \ndeductions.\n  The conference report also waives payment limits for the Marketing \nLoan Program. The current cap is $75,000. Millionaire land owners are \nnow eligible for unlimited LDP payments without any income test.\n  In addition, the bill puts in place provisions that shield our \ndomestic sugar program from all international competition. Sugar \ngrowers secured an increase in price supports and a guarantee of 85 \npercent of the domestic sugar market at these guaranteed prices. This \nisn't reform and it isn't justified.\n  I am disappointed with other aspects of the bill as well.\n  There is less than $100 million in the bill for rural development. \nRural communities are aching for water and wastewater infrastructure, \nhigh speed telecommunications, and financing for business development. \nThis bill underfunds that key priority. In conference, a program \ndesigned to improve broadband deployment by providing cost-share \nassistance to statewide nonprofits was removed. This was a missed \nopportunity to improve access to broadband in rural areas at a time \nwhen the United States is falling farther and farther behind in this \nkey area.\n  The bill provides marginal funding for agricultural research. The \nbill provides less than $100 million for the McGovern-Dole School \nFeeding Program, which uses U.S. commodities to feed some of the \nworld's poorest children in schools.\n  However, the bill makes significant investments in nutrition, \nconservation, and renewable energy programs. It creates a forward-\nthinking revenue-based safety net. The members of the Senate \nAgriculture Committee can be proud of these components of the package.\n  The most significant impact of this package may be in the nutrition \ntitle.\n  In Illinois, over 158,000 households experienced hunger in 2005. If \nwe include households that have had to struggle to put food on the \ntable or have had to skip meals to make sure the food would last \nthrough the week, it adds up to 500,000 households in Illinois living \nwith food insecurity. These are working families who just are not able \nto make ends meet.\n  This farm bill provides $10 billion more over 10 years for domestic \nnutrition programs that help lower income families put food on the \ntable, including $7.8 billion for the Food Stamp Program, $1.25 billion \nfor the Emergency Food Assistance Program, TEFAP, and $1 billion for \nthe fresh fruits and vegetables snack program.\n  In Illinois, over the next 10 years, this bill will provide $373 \nmillion in additional funding to help families that haven't been able \nto outrun hunger.\n  In the Food Stamp Program, the bill will raise the standard deduction \nand the minimum benefit and index them for inflation. Nationwide, that \nhelps 11 million low income people, including families with children, \nseniors, and people with disabilities. The adjustment to the standard \ndeduction will increase benefits for 415,000 Illinois residents, and \nthe minimum benefit increase will boost benefits for 27,000 Illinois \nrecipients.\n  This farm bill also eliminates the cap on the dependent care \ndeduction and no longer counts retirement accounts and education \naccounts toward the asset limit.\n  The conference report helps food banks and soup kitchens meet the \ngrowing demand for assistance by increasing funding for commodity \npurchases for TEFAP--The Emergency Food Assistance Program--by $110 \nmillion each year. The bill increases the availability of fruits and \nvegetables in low-income schools.\n  And, I am glad to report that this package includes a modified \nversion of the Hunger Free Communities Act, a grant program I have long \nsupported that will help fight hunger in communities. This antihunger \ngrant program is the first program that will encourage communities to \nwork together to identify and address hunger locally.\n  What we see here is strong bipartisan support to end hunger. Even \nwith a war abroad and budget deficits at home, this Senate made the \ndecision that progress against hunger is possible.\n  This farm bill makes another important investment, to protect open \nlands and restore habitat for future generations to enjoy. The USDA \nadministers the largest conservation easement programs and this bill \ncontinues and expands those programs.\n  In Illinois, there are a total of 78,000 contracts statewide and more \nthan 1 million acres in the CRP program, including more than 55,000 \nacres of wetlands. The Wetlands Reserve Program is aiding in what will \nbecome the second largest restoration of wetlands in the United States, \nin Emiquon in Fulton County, IL.\n  These open spaces provide important wildlife habitat and recreation \nbenefits and prevent erosion of sensitive ground. The conservation \ntitle makes significant investments in the Wetlands Reserve Program, \nthe Environmental Quality Incentives Program, the Conservation Security \nProgram, and the Farmland Protection Program.\n  Unfortunately, a key provision that I originally authored in the 2002 \nfarm bill to prevent over-planting on sensitive land, called Sodsaver, \nwas significantly weakened in conference. These weak protections, \ncombined what can only be called the most generous Commodity Title in \nhistory relative to market conditions, provides perverse incentives to \noverproduce, which will result in the breaking up of sensitive ground.\n  The investments made in conservation are tempered by the fact that we \nare missing an opportunity to protect wildlife and native habitats in \nsome of the few areas that have never been farmed in this country.\n  Another important feature of the bill is that we were able to secure \na modified version of a revenue-based safety net that Senator Brown and \nI originally proposed last summer. The version in the conference report \nallows farmers to elect to enter into this program starting in 2009 and \nprovides a revenue guarantee to producers in the program depending on \nmarket conditions and previous earnings.\n  It is a good step forward for Illinois producers and for the future \nstructure of our commodity programs. At this time of high prices, the \nprogram provides producers a risk-management tool they can really use.\n\n[[Page S4235]]\n\n  The energy title funds renewable energy technology, particularly \nfocused on next-generation biofuels. These should diversify our energy \nportfolio and help us lower U.S. dependence on petroleum. America's \nheartland is poised to become this nation's power plant if we make the \nright investments in wind, solar, and bioenergy.\n  The bill provides $230 million for grants and loan guarantees to \nbuild and develop next-generation biofuels plants. It provides $250 \nmillion in loans and grants for smaller-scale renewable energy projects \nin rural parts of the country and about $200 million in cellulosic \nfeedstock and harvesting research.\n  I do think we missed an opportunity to make further reforms, to \ninvest in rural America, and to help address the international food \ncrisis with a strong commitment to McGovern-Dole. But we also made \nimportant commitments to nutrition and conservation, and I thank \nChairman Harkin and the committee for their work.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased to have the opportunity \ntoday to support the farm bill conference report. This bill, while far \nfrom perfect, is an important step in the right direction in a number \nof areas. This incremental improvement in farm programs and significant \nimprovement in nutrition is preferable to the President's proposal to \nextend the status quo for several more years. I would like to commend \nChairmen Harkin and Peterson, Ranking Members Chambliss and Goodlatte, \nand the rest of the conferees and their staffs on their hard work over \nthe past few months on this bill.\n  While I share the concerns I have heard from some Wisconsinites, as \nwell as some of my colleagues, about the lack of reform to the \ncommodity programs, I believe the good in this bill outweighs the bad. \nThis bill makes significant improvements to programs that help farmers \nin Wisconsin every day, such as the Milk Income Loss Contract, MILC, \nOrganic Certification Cost Share, and the Beginning Farmer and Rancher \nPrograms. It is important to point out that for the first time the farm \nbill contains a separate title dedicated to nonprogram or specialty \ncrops to assist a broader group of farmers with their pressing research \nand disease concerns, among other provisions.\n  The nutrition title of this bill makes significant steps forward in \nthe fight against hunger in America. My colleagues and the American \npeople are well aware of the erosion in food stamp benefits over the \npast decade. In this time of increasing food and fuel costs, which are \ncrippling many low- and middle-income Americans, it is a moral \nimperative to act to increase these benefits. In addition, the $50 \nmillion in immediate funding for the Temporary Emergency Food \nAssistance Program will make a real difference for food banks in \nWisconsin. I commend the conferees for recognizing the critical need \nfor improvement in these programs and addressing it, despite the tight \nbudget constraints we face.\n  I am extremely pleased that the bill makes improvements to the Milk \nIncome Loss Contract, MILC, Program. Along with several of my \ncolleagues, including Senator Kohl, I have called for the MILC \nProgram's reimbursement rate to be raised to its original 45 percent. I \nalso strongly support the feed cost adjustor that was including in \nconference to help ensure the MILC safety net can keep up with the \nrapidly rising costs of production. The MILC Program is an important \nsafety net for Wisconsin's dairy farmers and one that operates in a \nresponsible way--only kicking in and providing payments to farmers when \ntimes are tough. Further, the MILC Program caps the amount of payments \none farmer can receive, ensuring that it helps small and medium farmers \nsurvive tough times without subsidizing expansion of larger farms. The \nimprovements to this program are vital to farmers in Wisconsin.\n  I am also pleased that long-overdue oversight of energy markets is \nincluded in the final farm bill. It is past time to prevent market \nmanipulation by energy traders. Energy market speculation is part of \nthe reason we are facing high gas prices and the farm bill takes an \nimportant step to close the ``Enron loophole'' that has allowed oil and \ngas traders to make electronic energy trades without Federal oversight. \nWe cannot allow energy traders to secretively bid up the price of oil \nand saddle Americans with the price at the gas pump. I am a cosponsor \nof Senator Feinstein's Oil and Gas Traders Oversight Act that has been \nincorporated into the farm bill. In a February 2008 letter, a \nbipartisan group of my colleagues and I urged the conference to retain \nthe Senate-passed provision in the final farm bill. Our letter stated: \n``With energy prices at or near record high levels, farmers and \nforesters are struggling to fill their tractors, heat their homes, \nfertilize their crops, and transport their goods to market. It is \ncritical that the Congress take advantage of this opportunity on the \nFarm bill to increase transparency and reduce the threats of \nmanipulation and excessive speculation that have plagued our energy \ncommodity markets over the past several years.'' I am pleased we \nsucceeded.\n  The conference report included a number of provisions I included in \nlegislation that I introduced last year, the Rural Opportunities Act, \nto help sustain and strengthen rural economies for the future, and \ncreate more opportunities in rural communities. I am pleased that the \nconference committee included a number of provisions similar to my \nlegislation to support local bioeconomies and food markets, encourage \nlocal renewable fuels and biobased products, expand broadband Internet \nservice in rural areas, and help develop the next generation of \nfarmers, ranchers and land managers.\n  In addition, the bill includes significant improvements to programs \nsupporting organic agriculture. Wisconsin has a number of organic \nfarmers and consumers who will benefit from the extra funding for the \nOrganic Certification Cost Share and Organic Transition Assistance \nPrograms, among others. This farm bill is the first to recognize the \nspecific challenges faced by organic farmers, particularly as more and \nmore consumers seek out their products.\n  On a related note, I am pleased that the bill contains a provision \nsimilar to one I first proposed in 2006 allowing schools and other \nentities participating in Federal food programs to use local preference \nwhen purchasing products, which they are not currently allowed to do. \nThis will allow schools to select in-season food grown locally, and \nwill complement a number of programs, like the Fresh Fruit and \nVegetable Snack Program, by providing a link between farmers and \nconsumers, particularly children. This is better for farmers and \nconsumers, Mr. President, and a commonsense reform that is long \noverdue.\n  For some time I have worked to keep dairy imports from free-loading \noff of the dairy promotion money paid for by our hard-working dairy \nfarmers. I am glad that the conference report makes every U.S. State \nand territory eligible and allows this assessment to be charged on \nimports as was intended in the 2002 farm bill. I am somewhat \ndisappointed that the payment rate for imports is less than that paid \nby domestic producers, but half a loaf is better than none. I will \ncontinue to seek to level the playing field.\n  In addition to the Agriculture Committee's portion of the bill, the \nFinance Committee also made a significant contribution to this \nlegislation. I was glad that a provision similar to my Farmer Tax \nFairness Act was included in the Finance portion of the conference \nreport. This legislation will update the optional ability for farmers \nand other self-employed individuals to remain eligible for social \nsecurity and disability benefits that had been eroded by inflation. It \nalso indexes the program to inflation, so we are not in the same \nsituation again sometime in the future.\n  I was also pleased that several of my amendments that were included \nin the Senate bill were included in some form in the conference report. \nFirst, in a continuation of an effort I began with Senator Jeffords in \n1998, I am pleased that the Senate accepted my amendment to improve the \nauthority of what we had called the Small Farm Advocate in a previous \namendment. I continued this effort with Senator Sanders, and while the \nconference report made this office a division within the new Office of \nAdvocacy and Outreach, I expect that this will continue to help \nAmerica's small and beginning farmers.\n  Ensuring transparency and fair competition in the dairy industry has \nbeen\n\n[[Page S4236]]\n\na priority throughout my Senate career. Over the past year and a half, \na couple developments showed a need for further action in this area. \nFirst, a GAO report on cash cheese trading that I requested with \nseveral of my colleagues confirmed that the market remains prone to \nmanipulation even though there have been some improvements. Secondly, a \nsustained nonfat dry milk price reporting error that lasted over a year \nwas found to have cost dairy farmers millions in reduced prices. I was \nglad to have an amendment accepted in the Senate that would require \nregular auditing of the dairy price reporting and require the USDA to \nbetter coordinate oversight of the dairy industry both within the \ndepartment and with other federal agencies. The conference report \nretained the auditing requirement and shifted the improved oversight to \na directive in the Joint Managers Statement. I hope that this added \ndiligence and transparency can help give dairy farmers added confidence \nin the system.\n  As we look to expand our Nation's renewable energy and lessen our \ndependence on oil, we need to provide opportunities for farmers and \nrural communities. Several key elements of my Rural Opportunities Act \nsupporting local bioenergy were included in the farm bill. One \namendment I got accepted encourages the USDA's continued support for \nand the expansion of regional bioeconomy consortiums, which can consist \nof land grant universities and State agriculture agencies dedicated to \nresearching and promoting sustainable and locally supported bioenergy. \nThe final bill maintains report language supporting these consortia. I \nwas also pleased to work with Senator Coleman on another ``rural \nopportunity'' provision, which is based on our legislation, S. 1813, to \nprovide local residents an opportunity to invest in biorefineries \nlocated in their communities. The farm bill provision gives priority to \ngrants and loan guarantees for biorefineries with significant local \nownership. This bill also makes significant strides in providing \nincreased support for cellulosic ethanol and other innovative solutions \nto the energy problems we face as a nation.\n  While Wisconsin is perhaps more widely known as a leader in milk and \ncheese production, we also lead the Nation in the production of \ncranberries and ginseng. I was glad to see a priority competitive \nresearch area for cranberries continue through the Senate bill and \nconference report. Similarly, I was glad that my legislation with \nSenator Kohl and Representative Obey to require country of harvest \nlabeling for ginseng was accepted as an amendment in the Senate and \ncontinued as country of origin labeling in the conference report. This \nis an important step to help combat mislabeling of foreign ginseng as \nU.S. or Wisconsin grown, which receives a premium price for its higher \nquality.\n  Overall, I was pleased that this bill provides a significant increase \nin conservation programs. I am particularly glad to see an emphasis on \nworking lands programs like the popular Environmental Quality Incentive \nProgram and an updated Conservation Stewardship Program, which benefit \nfarmers and the environment. The farm bill also included provisions \nbased on Senator Wyden's Combat Illegal Logging Act of 2007, S. 1930, \nwhich I cosponsored, to address rampant, unsustainable illegal logging \npractices in developing nations. The bill also reauthorizes and the \nGreat Lakes Basin Soil Erosion and Sediment Control Program and allows \nthe Secretary of Agriculture to use this program to carry out projects \nto implement the Great Lakes Regional Collaboration Strategy. While I \nwas disappointed that the funding levels of certain programs like the \nWetlands Reserve Program were not what they should be and that the \n``sodsaver'' provision was not a national protection, this bill is \nlargely a step forward for conservation.\n  Continuing in the category of mixed results, I was extremely pleased \nto see the addition of a new livestock title in the bill to promote \ncompetition and fair practices in agriculture but was disappointed that \nmany of the Senate's commonsense provisions were removed or watered \ndown in conference. I am pleased that producers will be able to have a \nchoice to accept or decline arbitration when they sign agricultural \ncontracts under the conference report, even though I was disappointed \nthat a stronger Senate provision that mirrors legislation I have with \nSenator Grassley was not retained. On balance, this is a step in the \nright direction and I hope the USDA works to ensure that this remains a \nreal choice for producers and there is no intimidation.\n  In addition to the handful of improved competition protections that \nwill benefit livestock producers, the underlying bill contains two \nother provisions that are also especially beneficial. I was glad to \nsupport Senator Kohl's longstanding efforts to find a way for meat from \nsmall and often specialty State-inspected meat processors to be sold \nacross State lines so that consumers nationwide can enjoy these high \nquality Wisconsin products. The conference report contains a compromise \nthat appears to strike a fair balance on this issue and this is a \nsignificant benefit to Wisconsin's local livestock producers and \nprocessors. I was also glad that the conference report will finally \nallow a country-of-origin labeling requirement for meat and produce to \nbe enforced.\n  While I have discussed at length the positive aspects of the \nlegislation, let me be clear that the reforms in the commodity title \nshould go further. I authored an amendment with Senator Menendez to \nmake modest trims to direct payments and was disappointed the Senate \ndid not vote on it. In addition, I supported the Dorgan-Grassley \namendment to lower payment limits, the Klobuchar amendment to lower the \nAGI cap, and the Brown amendment to trim subsidies for crop insurers. I \nwas disappointed that these efforts to make the commodity support \nprograms more balanced and better targeted toward family farms and not \nconcentrate payments in larger corporate-scale operations were \nunsuccessful. With these defeats, both the Senate-passed bill and the \nconference report missed an important opportunity for meaningful \ntargeted reform of the farm support programs.\n  There were some small steps in the right direction to be sure. Direct \npayments were trimmed by a few percent, excessive insurance company \nsubsidies were trimmed and the cap on wealthy nonfarmers was lowered. \nBut there was an opportunity to do much more and I will continue that \nfight.\n  One other provision I am concerned about is the cut to the McGovern-\nDole International Food for Education and Child Nutrition Program. In \nlight of food shortages across the globe, reducing the level of aid we \nprovide to poor countries is simply wrong. I hope that, through the \nappropriations process, Congress will be able to continue providing \nfunding for this important program.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I rise today in support of the Food and Energy \nSecurity Act. The provisions of the conference report represent a \ntremendous step forward in ensuring the health of American consumers, \nfor example by providing low-income citizens with better access to \nhealthy food choices by increasing the amount of funding for nutrition \nprograms, increasing food stamp payments, bringing more fruits and \nvegetables into schools, and providing assistance to low-income seniors \nso that they can shop at farmers markets. This bill also recognizes the \nimportant place that specialty crops have on the dinner table.\n  In addition to the benefits that Americans will see at their tables, \nthis bill also provides unique opportunities to better the environment \nand look out for those who cannot speak for themselves. The bill \ncontinues to support land conservation and expands protection for \nwetlands, grazing land, wildlife habitats, and forests. The bill \nincreases our investment in biofuels research and production so that we \ncan move away from foreign oil, and instead use American-made \ncellulosic and sugar-based ethanol and biodiesel. It also strengthens \nprotections for animals by quadrupling penalties for Animal Welfare Act \nviolations and prohibiting dog fighting.\n  For these and other reasons I will support this farm bill \nlegislation. However, I am troubled by the bill managers' use of the \nnarrow provisions in the bill addressing agriculture security to \nexpound in the Joint Explanatory Statement about the proper roles of \nthe Departments of Homeland Security and Agriculture, and the \nperformance of DHS, in this area. Allow me to address a few of my \nconcerns.\n\n[[Page S4237]]\n\n  The managers assert, for example, that DHS has ``claimed Federal \njurisdiction as the lead agency'' for activities ``traditionally \nmanaged by USDA.'' This statement is unnecessarily dismissive and \nignores numerous laws that establish the current Federal framework for \naddressing threats to agriculture and food security, a framework in \nwhich the Secretary of Homeland Security is the principal Federal \nofficial to lead and coordinate efforts among Federal departments and \nagencies, State and local governments, and the private sector to \nprotect critical infrastructure and key resources in all sectors. Among \nthe laws that make up the framework are the Homeland Security Act of \n2002, the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004, \nIntel Reform Act, the Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act of \n2006, Post-Katrina Act, the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act, \nPAHPA, and the Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act \nof 2007, 9/11 Commission Act. Various Homeland Security Presidential \ndirectives further undergird the current structure--including HSPD-5, \nManagement of Domestic Incidents, HSPD-7, Critical Infrastructure \nIdentification, Prioritization and Protection, HSPD-8, National \nPreparedness, HSPD-9, Defense of U.S. Agriculture and Food, and HSPD-\n10, Biodefense for the 21st Century.\n  Under these laws and directives, a number of agencies have \nresponsibilities specifically relevant to agriculture and food \nsecurity. These include the U.S. Department of Agriculture, USDA, which \nis responsible for infrastructure protection for the agriculture sector \nand matters pertaining to meat, poultry, and egg products; the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services, HHS, is responsible for the \nremainder of the food sector, as well as for public health and \nhealthcare; and the Environmental Protection Agency is responsible for \ndrinking water and water treatment systems. HSPD-9 details the roles \nand responsibilities of these and other Federal agencies regarding \nspecific aspects of agriculture and food security, including awareness \nand warning, vulnerability assessments, mitigation strategies, and \nresearch and development. Since enactment and issuance of the \naforementioned bills and directives, numerous activities to advance \nagriculture and food security have been undertaken throughout the \nFederal Government in reliance on, and within, this framework.\n  That said, I agree with the bill managers that USDA is the agency \nbest equipped to handle routine agricultural disease emergencies. USDA \ncontinues to serve that function, and DHS relies on USDA to do so.\n  The managers also assert that agricultural inspections have degraded \nsince the inspectors were incorporated into DHS--as required by the \nHomeland Security Act of 2002. This statement ignores the factual \nrecord:\n\n       While there were initial problems, not entirely \n     unexpectedly, integrating various components into one \n     Department, the situation has improved dramatically, and the \n     agriculture inspection mission has a clear roadmap for how to \n     improve further. The number of agriculture inspectors has \n     increased, as has the number of canine teams, beyond those at \n     the time of the transition. The same high educational \n     standards for agriculture specialists apply, but now they get \n     more field training. The Customs and Border Protection, CPB, \n     primary inspectors, which in their legacy roles have always \n     been responsible for referring agriculture products to \n     secondary screening, now get substantially more training to \n     recognize products and pests that need further examination.\n       The Joint USDA-DHS task force has outlined 10 concrete \n     action plans for further improvement and is making \n     considerable progress in implementing them. Last month, the \n     joint agency task force met with agriculture stakeholders to \n     further refine their recommendations and to draft new \n     recommendations.\n       USDA remains integrally involved in the inspection process, \n     with continuing responsibilities for the training of CBP \n     agricultural specialists and CBP officers, training of canine \n     teams, setting rules and regulations for the agriculture \n     inspection process, and for identifying the pests that CBP \n     agricultural specialists intercept.\n\n  I do appreciate the managers' recognition that the agricultural \nspecialists within CBP who are responsible for inspecting agricultural \nproducts at the border need to remain within DHS. The Homeland Security \nAct of 2002 brought together in the CBP directorate of DHS customs \ninspectors from the Treasury Department, immigration inspectors from \nthe Justice Department, and agricultural inspectors from the \nAgriculture Department. The purpose was to create a single, integrated \nforce at our borders to keep out people and goods that pose a threat. \nFor the first time, all those who protect our borders report up a \nsingle chain of command. To do otherwise than to keep the agricultural \ninspectors within CBP would splinter the integrated border security \nforce we have been building for 5 years, and weaken both our homeland \nand agricultural security.\n  The managers further suggest that DHS may not be placing sufficient \npriority on agricultural security and agricultural inspections and they \nappear to be concerned that DHS may not be paying sufficient attention \nto the concerns of the agricultural community. In fact, the agriculture \nmission has repeatedly received the highest level of attention. DHS \nSecretary Chertoff addressed the agriculture inspection stakeholders' \nmeeting just last month. A directive reiterating the importance of the \nagricultural mission has been disseminated to every CBP office. A new \nposition--the Deputy Executive Director, Agriculture Operational \nOversight at Customs and Border Protection--has just been created to \nprovide oversight of all agriculture inspectors no matter where they \nserve to ensure that mission needs are being met.\n  Finally, the managers suggest that USDA should oversee DHS's \nagricultural inspection program and issue comprehensive reports on it \nto Congress. I cannot recall an example of one executive branch \ndepartment overseeing and reporting to Congress on another executive \nbranch department. The proposal is unprecedented, unnecessary, and \nfundamentally misapprehends the roles of the respective independent \ndepartments, and threatens what has become a productive partnership \nbetween the agencies of the two departments.\n  Rather than pitting Departments against one another, we should be \nencouraging the cooperation between DHS and USDA that, in fact, is now \noccurring. USDA and DHS are working together to a greater extent than \never has historically been the case in the relationship between \nagriculture and border officials. While challenges remain, the current \nlevel of partnership should serve as a model for interagency \ncooperation.\n  With active participation by USDA and the Federal Drug \nAdministration, FDA, DHS is assessing agro-terrorist threats, \ncapitalizing on the substantial assets at its National Biodefense \nAnalysis and Countermeasure Center and its connections with the \nintelligence community that have been applied to other biological and \nWMD threats to the Nation. USDA is also participating in the DHS-\noperated National Biosurveillance Integration Center, NBIC, authorized \nby the 9/11 Commission Act, to bring together information from multiple \nsources to detect and contain biological incidents as rapidly as \npossible.\n  The agricultural biosecurity communications center authorized by the \nbill, as the managers note, is expected to provide a central collection \npoint for USDA generated information and to provide important \ninformation to DHS's National Operations Center, which acts as the \ncentral source for homeland security situational awareness for the \nFederal Government.\n  DHS and USDA also engage in research and development together to \npromote agricultural security. DHS's role includes its sponsorship of \nthe National Center for Foreign Animal and Zoonotic Disease and its \nPlum Island Animal Disease Center at which both DHS and USDA \nresearchers work collaboratively to address the catastrophic threat of \nfoot and mouth disease.\n  The Office of Homeland Security at USDA, also authorized by the bill, \nshould be helpful in coordinating the homeland security activities of \nthe various offices and agencies within USDA, thereby providing a \nprimary point of contact between USDA and DHS for agricultural security \nissues.\n  While I find the manager's statement troubling and unfounded, I have \nworked with the Agriculture Committee to ensure that the bill itself \nwill not endanger homeland and agriculture security.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the conference \nreport on the Food, Conservation, and\n\n[[Page S4238]]\n\nEnergy Act of 2008, a tremendously important piece of legislation that \nwill set our Nation's agricultural policy for the next 5 years. It is \nan immense piece of legislation; and obviously, in any bill of this \nsize, any Senator will find provisions with which he or she will \ndisagree. I am no different. Nevertheless, on the whole it is a strong \nbill and a good compromise that my colleagues and their staffs have \nspent months preparing, and I hope, for the sake of our farmers and the \ncountry as a whole, that it will be approved by both Houses of Congress \nand signed into law by the President.\n  The 2008 farm bill strengthens the safety net for farmers struggling \nwith abrupt shifts in the agricultural market. In many ways, these \nfarmers are the backbone of our economy, and we must ensure that they \nare adequately protected. Included in this safety net is an expanded \nMilk Income Loss Compensation, or MILC, Program, which is of critical \nimportance to dairy farmers in my home State of Connecticut and across \nthe country. The farm bill conference report would increase the MILC \nProgram's payment rate for dairy producers when the price of milk falls \nbelow a statutorily set target price; it also allows for adjustments of \nthat price when the price of feed increases. In addition, this bill \ncreates important protections for specialty crop producers by providing \nnearly $466 million over the next 10 years to the Specialty Crop Block \nGrants Program. This new initiative is especially important for farmers \nin the State of Connecticut, as nearly 47 percent of our agricultural \nreceipts come from nursery and greenhouse products.\n  I am particularly pleased that the conference committee adopted much \nstricter income limits on commodity payments by significantly lowering \nthe adjusted gross income test. To qualify for benefits, individuals \nwould have to prove that they earn less than $500,000 per year from \nnonfarming sources and only up to $750,000 per year in farm income. \nThese new income tests will help ensure that the farm bill's safety net \nprograms actually help the people that they were originally intended \nfor: those small, family farmers who make up the backbone of American \nagriculture and who operate all too often on razor-thin margins.\n  I am also very pleased by the much needed attention this bill gives \nto nutrition programs, particularly those that serve American families \nstruggling on the verge of hunger or food insecurity. All told, this \nbill provides over $10 billion in new money for nutrition programs. It \nbeefs up the Food Stamp Program by stopping benefit erosion and \nexpanding eligibility, and it provides more than $1 billion in \nassistance to local area food banks. In addition, to help children \ndevelop healthier eating habits, this legislation extends to all 50 \nStates a program that provides fresh fruits and vegetables to \nunderprivileged schools. I have seen the success of the Fresh Fruits \nand Vegetables Program firsthand, in its Connecticut pilot test. I know \nhow vital fresh produce is to the health of all Americans; in the case \nof underprivileged schoolchildren, those who need it the most have \ngotten it the least and I am glad this bill goes a long way toward \ncorrecting that disparity.\n  Finally, the farm bill conference report aims to preserve our fragile \nenvironment by funding critical land conservation programs and \ninvesting in renewable sources of energy. To help American farmers act \nas responsible stewards of the land they work, this legislation \nallocates nearly $8 billion in new funding to help farmers and \nlandowners be better and more responsible stewards of the environment. \nThis bill also includes provisions to encourage the production of \ndomestic biofuels, including funds to promote biomass crop production, \nloan guarantees for commercial scale biorefineries, and dramatically \nincreased funding for biomass research and development. The farm bill's \nenergy title in particular is critical to ensuring that our country \nfinally breaks its longstanding over-reliance on costly and \nenvironmentally harmful fossil fuels.\n  In sum, I am satisfied that the farm bill takes great steps to \nprotect our struggling farmers, our low-income families and children, \nand our threatened environment. In my view, the farm bill embodies an \napproach to agricultural policy characterized first and foremost by a \nconcern for the long-term well-being of all Americans. I therefore urge \nmy colleagues to support this vital piece of legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we don't often have the opportunity to \ncelebrate on the Senate floor. There is oftentimes, we must \nacknowledge, a lot of acrimony and finger-pointing.\n  Today, I want to take a minute to express my appreciation to all \nthose involved in this bill. We know there were Senators Harkin, \nChambliss, Baucus, and Grassley, but many other people were involved in \nthis process to get us where we are today.\n  This is a tremendously important piece of legislation. This was dead \non at least 15 different occasions, but it was revived. There was true \nbipartisanship--a true situation where we had conferences, where people \nmet in open session and voted. It was what we all should come here to \nlook forward to doing--legislating such as we did here.\n  This is a very complicated and difficult piece of legislation. Was \nthere enough reform? I don't know how much is enough. Certain groups \nlook at these farm programs, and there is nothing you can do to satisfy \nthem. No matter what is done, it is not enough for them. Every time we \ndo a farm bill, the editorial boards from around the country roll out \nthe old editorials, they change a few lines and send out the same \neditorial they did before.\n  This bill has reform in it. Could we have done more? Perhaps, but had \nwe done more, we would not have gotten a bill. What did we get as a \nresult of the compromises made? We got nutrition. What a wonderful \nthing. We got food stamps. For us in Nevada this is important. Since \n2000, the numbers of food stamps-qualified people have gone up more \nthan 100 percent. We didn't change the rules to let more people into \nthe program. They qualified under the old rules, and now, by more than \n100 percent, that has been increased. This legislation takes care of \nthat.\n  Children going to schools all around America, as a result of this \nlegislation, will get fresh fruits and vegetables in their lunch \nprograms. That is remarkable. There are people in this Chamber who \ndidn't have the opportunity when they were kids in school to have fresh \nfruits and vegetables. That is the way it is all over America, \nespecially with kids who grew up in these urban centers. Fresh fruits \nand vegetables are something they don't get often. This is wonderful.\n  Food banks, I have heard Sherrod Brown and others talk about how the \nfood banks are going empty. We have a lot of hungry people in America, \nand we have to acknowledge that. This farm bill acknowledges that. We \nare going to increase food bank money by $100 million each year. That \nis a lot of money. It is very important.\n  We have conservation. My friend, Tom Harkin, has caused me so much \ngrief on this conservation program. It was his idea to do some \nconservation programs. The administrations--plural--a lot of times \ndidn't want to give him what he felt was the law. He held up a lot of \nthings going on in the Senate as a result of that. So the conservation \nprograms, because of the dedication of Tom Harkin, are remarkable. I \nwatched Senator Harkin, last night, show the pictures of what takes \nplace when there is good conservation. Now farmers and ranchers will be \nrewarded as a result of that. That is extremely important.\n  Even the State of Nevada will be able to compete for money in the \nconservation programs.\n  There are disaster programs. We in the West have been ravaged by \nwildfires. As a result of being ravaged, the Bureau of Land Management \nand other land managers close up rangeland, and there is nothing the \nranchers can do; they close them up. They will now qualify for disaster \nrelief, which is in this bill.\n  For the first time, this is going to be the case: compensation for \nwildlife damage.\n  One of the favorite talking topics is energy. This bill actually does \nsomething about it. There is a demand we stop using corn and other such \nitems that are edibles to make fuel. This legislation recognizes that \npoint.\n  I have talked about reform. This bill contains reforms. There are \nreforms on caps on payments to farmers. Remember, farm programs count \nfor less than\n\n[[Page S4239]]\n\n13 percent of this bill's spending and are expected to climb by $60 \nbillion over the next 10 years. That sounds pretty good.\n  This bill, as other important legislation, is one of compromise. That \nis what legislation is all about.\n  I know we have a lot to do. I extend my congratulations for this \nremarkable piece of legislation. This is how we should legislate. I am \nso appreciative of the bipartisan nature of this legislation. I look \nfor a real big vote. I hope we have a strong vote indicating the \nbipartisan nature of this legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). The question is on agreeing \nto the conference report to accompany H.R. 2419.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from New York (Mrs. Clinton), \nthe Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kennedy), and the Senator from \nIllinois (Mr. Obama) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. KYL. The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Arizona (Mr. McCain).\n  The result was announced--yeas 81, nays 15, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 130 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--81\n\n     Akaka\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Barrasso\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Brown\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burr\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Cardin\n     Carper\n     Casey\n     Chambliss\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Conrad\n     Corker\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Dodd\n     Dole\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Enzi\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Isakson\n     Johnson\n     Kerry\n     Klobuchar\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Martinez\n     McCaskill\n     McConnell\n     Menendez\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Pryor\n     Reid\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Salazar\n     Sanders\n     Schumer\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Stevens\n     Tester\n     Thune\n     Vitter\n     Warner\n     Webb\n     Wicker\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--15\n\n     Bennett\n     Coburn\n     Collins\n     DeMint\n     Domenici\n     Ensign\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Kyl\n     Lugar\n     Murkowski\n     Reed\n     Sununu\n     Voinovich\n     Whitehouse\n\n                             NOT VOTING--4\n\n     Clinton\n     Kennedy\n     McCain\n     Obama\n  The conference report was agreed to.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote and I move \nto lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, we have had a very significant vote here \non this farm bill. I will have to check the record, but this has to be \none of the strongest votes for any farm bill in the history of farm \nbill legislation in the Senate.\n  It has truly been a team effort. It took a long time--about a year \nand a half; 2 years, actually. Senator Chambliss, when he was chairman \nof the committee, started the whole process, so it has been a couple of \nyears in the making. It has been a great team effort. As I said, we \nhave all worked together. It has been a very long road with a lot of \ntough negotiations. We did it in a manner in which the people of this \ncountry want us to operate around here.\n  We worked hard and got the bill through committee. We brought it to \nthe floor. We had our amendments, we had good debates in December, \npassed it at that time, then we went to conference. We had a good \nnumber of conference meetings, frankly. But they were good conference \nmeetings. That is the way we ought to do legislation around here. The \nproof of doing it in that manner--in an open, cooperative manner, \nhaving all sides being able to have their viewpoints heard and input \nmade--is that we came up with good legislation as an end product.\n  I want to thank and congratulate all of the members of the \nAgriculture Committee, on both sides, for all of their hard work in \nbringing this bill to this vote today. I especially want to thank \nSenator Chambliss for his leadership in starting this off and then \nserving as the ranking member for the last year and a half and working \nso closely with me and others to get this bill done. I especially want \nto thank all the Senators who were conferees. There were some long \nsessions that went on for hours and hours and days and days. But we \nhung in there.\n  I will start with Senator Baucus and Senator Grassley from Iowa, the \nchairman and ranking member of the Finance Committee, for their help in \ncoming up with the funds we needed to put this bill together. \nEspecially I thanked my colleague from Iowa earlier, but I want to \nthank him also for his diligent work and effort to make sure we had a \ngood livestock, poultry, and competition title.\n  I see my good friend, Kent Conrad. I said earlier, we certainly \nbenefited from his expertise, his knowledge. It is wonderful having the \nbudget chairman on the Agriculture Committee helps keep us on track so \nwe know what we can and cannot do to stay within the bounds of the \nbudget rules.\n  So I cannot thank Senator Conrad and his staff enough for helping us \ncomply with the budget requirements. I say to the people of North \nDakota, the farmers, the ranchers, the people who live in your small \ntowns and communities, I can honestly say I know Kent Conrad well. And \nthere is nothing that escapes his attention when it comes to the \nfarmers and ranchers and rural people of North Dakota. They do not have \na better fighter for their interests. I might even expand that further. \nFarmers and ranchers and rural people all over America have no greater \na fighter for their interests than Kent Conrad.\n  I see Senator Stabenow. I said earlier I am going to start calling \nher the Senator of specialty crops. We would not have had a specialty \ncrop title in this bill if it had not been for Senator Stabenow. She is \nunique, the only person, as far as I know, who has served on the \nAgriculture Committees of her State legislature, the Agriculture \nCommittee of the House of Representatives, and the Agriculture \nCommittee of the Senate. And that expertise shows through, believe me, \nin what she has accomplished in this farm bill.\n  I see my good friend, Senator Salazar, who did so much to make sure \nwe had a good energy title; that we start focusing much more on ethanol \nfrom cellulose.\n  Senator Lincoln from Arkansas, a strong fighter for the rice farmers, \nher cotton, grain, and oilseed farmers. I might also say that Senator \nLincoln is a very strong fighter for nutrition programs and rural \ndevelopment. I thank her for all of her help on this committee.\n  I am going to read a list and recognize all of the staff members who \nwork for me on the committee. They deserve to have their names in this \nRecord because as hard as we worked, they worked three or four times as \nhard. A lot of times we went home at night and they were still here. A \nlot of times we were gone on the weekends, they were here.\n  And, of course, first and foremost, I would thank Mark Halverson. \nMark has been with me on this committee since 1988. And he has brought \na wealth of experience as a farmer in Iowa, and also as a lawyer. So he \nbrings together a lot of knowledge and expertise in guiding and \ndirecting the staff. He has done a wonderful job. I cannot thank Mark \nHalverson enough for his patience, his leadership, and in juggling all \nof the balls and keeping tabs on everything. Mark Halverson has \nperformed above and beyond the call of duty.\n  Susan Keith, our general counsel in commodities; Stephanie Mercier, \nour chief economist, trade and international food assistance and crop \ninsurance; Phil Buchan, who worked so hard on conservation, and \nespecially the conservation stewardship program and the EQIP Program; \nEldon Boes, who came to us from the National Renewable Energy \nLaboratory. He has done so much work on the energy title.\n  Derek Miller--Derek came to us from the House side where he worked on \nthe 2002 farm bill. He is probably the most knowledgeable person I have \never met on nutrition and how the nutrition programs work. And due in \nno small part to Derek Miller, we have a great nutrition title.\n\n[[Page S4240]]\n\n  Richard Bender, a long-time member of my staff who handles rural \ndevelopment and the tax provisions; Todd Batta handled the forestry and \ncredit titles; and John Ferrell, who did all of our livestock work and \nthe programs for organic farmers.\n  Adela Ramos, who does a great job keeping track of all of the ag \nresearch and food safety; Dave White from Montana who as a detailee \nfrom the Natural Resources Conservation Service, was with us for a year \nand a half, and worked so hard on conservation; Dan Christenson, who \ndid so much on specialty crops and helping with nutrition; Kerri \nJohannsen, who worked on energy; Tina May on conservation; Amy \nLowenthal, who is our counsel providing legal advice on many issues.\n  Eric Juzenas, who came to us as a detailee from the CFTC for the \nreauthorization of the Commodities Exchange Act; Katharine Ferguson, \nwho is a professional staff member who assists our staff director, Mark \nHalveson. We call her our ``utility player''. Whenever we need someone, \nKatharine is there. She can fill in for anybody and does it extremely \nwell.\n  Kate Cyrul, our communications director; Bob Sturm, our chief clerk \nwho retired last year. He was here for many of the hearings on this \nbill and came back to fill in periodically; Jessie Williams, our chief \nclerk who has done such a great job of succeeding Bob Sturm; Jacob \nChaney, our systems administrator; Jonathan Urban, who did so much on \nthe CFTC reauthorization, before he left the staff to head to law \nschool. We wish him the best in law school. Peter Kelley, our assistant \nclerk and legislative correspondent, who sort of runs interference for \nall of us; Cory Claussen, our legislative correspondent; Micah Wortham, \nthe Government Printing Office detailee who is here to make sure our \ndocuments are printed properly; Ellen Huntoon, who covers rural \ndevelopment and agricultural topics.\n  Now, again, I know that Senator Chambliss has thanked all of his \nstaff. I do not know every single person there, but I do know Martha \nScott Poindexter and Vernie Hubert. I particularly want to thank both \nof them for their great efforts, for their leadership, and for all the \ntime and the efforts and the weekends, the nights. You ought to take a \nvacation too.\n  Also, I want to thank the Office of Legislative Counsel, the \nCongressional Budget Office, the Senate floor staff, the Department of \nAgriculture staff. Now, I know the administration has not agreed with \nus on everything in this bill. But I have to say, the technical \nassistance provided by the Department was very helpful in putting \neverything together.\n  Again, I thank and congratulate all of the staffs of the Senators on \nour committee--especially Senators Baucus, Grassley, Conrad. I feel \nvery good about this bill and the overwhelming vote. I still remain \nhopeful the President will sign this bill. Hope springs eternal that he \nwill sign it. If he does not, I guess we will have to face that down \nthe road. I hope we have the votes to override. Team effort, \ncooperation, conciliation, bipartisanship, those are the keys to \nsuccessful legislation. I am gratified to have played this role in \ngetting this bill passed.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I voted against the Senate-passed version \nof the farm bill because it lacked the fiscal discipline required of \nCongress during a time of deficit spending and exponential growth of \nthe Federal Government. Unfortunately, the conference report is just as \nunacceptable as the Senate-passed version of the farm bill. As a \nresult, I cannot support it.\n  Congress first approved the Federal farm assistance policies in the \nearly 1930s to help struggling farmers during times of economic \nhardship due to low commodity prices. Over the last six decades, \nhowever, the farm bill has swelled significantly, and now provides \nextensive subsidies for farmers and agricultural landowners who may not \nbe in true financial need.\n  The conference report continues this trend, spending approximately \n$730 billion over 10 years. And, as the administration correctly points \nout, it increases spending by approximately $20 billion over the \ncurrent baseline, not $10 billion as claimed by the conferees. The \nroughly $10 billion difference is achieved through a number of \ngimmicks, including using timing shifts and funding cliffs.\n  To make matters worse, at a time when the United States' net farm \nincome is projected to be $92.3 billion this year--51 percent greater \nthan the 10-year average--the conference report would increase subsidy \nrates, create additional subsidies for a number of crops, and continue \ndirect payments regardless of crop prices. Now is not the time to \nmaintain or increase subsidies; now is the time to reduce or eliminate \nthem.\n  The conference report would also continue to pay subsidies to \nmillionaire farmers and nonfarmers. It would allow married couples who \nfarm and have an adjusted gross income of $1.5 million to continue to \nreceive subsidies. It would also allow married couples with an adjusted \ngross income of $1,000,000 who are not full-time farmers to receive \nsubsidies. Farm payments should go only to those who actually need \nthem, not to some of the wealthiest individuals in the country.\n  Congress could use the farm bill to make substantive reforms and cut \nfederal spending. Instead, it appears that Congress will pass a bloated \nfarm bill that is just another example of a broken and mismanaged \nCongress. Consequently, I cannot support it and urge my colleagues to \nalso oppose the bill.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, this year's farm bill includes many \nimportant programs that will benefit Michigan and the Nation as a \nwhole. Few States have Michigan's diversity of agricultural crops, and \nI am pleased that this farm bill contains a range of measures that will \nbenefit farmers throughout my State. Agriculture is Michigan's second \nlargest industry and this bill will help support this industry at a \ntime when Michigan's economy is struggling.\n  This bill will provide significant additional assistance to specialty \ncrop growers that has been severely lacking in past farm legislation. \nSpecialty crops are an important part of the agriculture industry and a \nhealthy part of our Nation's food supply. While Michigan is a leading \nproducer of traditional crops, such as corn, wheat, and soybeans, our \nState is also a leader in the production of specialty crops, such as \napples, asparagus, beans, blueberries, and cherries. This farm bill \nwill provide much needed support for the specialty crop community \nthroughout Michigan and that means a more assured supply of U.S. grown \nfruits and vegetables so important to Americans nutritional needs.\n  Nutrition programs, such as the Food Stamp Program, provide \nassistance to children, low-income working families, seniors, and \npersons with disabilities. This bill includes a significant increase in \nfunding for our Nation's critical food and nutrition programs on which \nour Nation's least fortunate and most vulnerable rely. In my State of \nMichigan, over 500,000 households will benefit from increased nutrition \nassistance, and the bill will also help to alleviate some of the stress \nlocal food banks all across Michigan are experiencing at this time.\n  The farm bill includes measures to improve conservation. These \nprograms, which are aimed at both working lands and lands taken out of \nproduction, are intended to protect and improve soil quality, prevent \nerosion, benefit water quality, and preserve and restore habitats. This \nlegislation expands the Conservation Stewardship Program, CSP, \nincreases funding for the Environmental Quality Incentives Program, \nEQIP, and reauthorizes the Conservation Reserve Program, CRP, and \nWetlands Reserve Program, WRP, to protect environmentally sensitive \nlands.\n  I am pleased that this bill also includes incentives that will \nencourage continued development of biofuels and increased production of \nrenewable fuels. I have long supported incentives for new technologies \nthat can move us away from our significant reliance on foreign oil, and \nthis bill makes critical investments in alternative energy that will \nhelp move us toward that goal.\n  While this bill includes modest reforms to our current producer \nprotection programs, these reforms do not go far enough. It would have \nbeen my hope that this bill would have included more innovative \nmeasures, such as farm savings accounts, and additional reforms to our \nagricultural subsidy programs. I am hopeful that we can work to enact \nfurther reforms when Congress next considers farm legislation.\n\n[[Page S4241]]\n\n  There is another important reason to support the farm bill. It \ncontains a key provision which would finally close the Enron loophole \nthat has contributed for so many years to the problem of rampant \nspeculation in our energy markets. It would close the Enron loophole by \nrequiring government oversight of electronic trading of energy \ncommodities by large traders to prevent price manipulation and \nexcessive speculation.\n  In 2000, at the behest of Enron and others, a provision was slipped \ninto law--section 2(h)(3) of the Commodity Exchange Act--that exempted \nfrom oversight and regulation the electronic trading of energy and \nmetal commodities by large traders. This loophole took the cop off the \nbeat in those electronic markets and allowed traders to operate with \nless supervision and fewer controls than regulated commodity markets \nlike the New York Mercantile Exchange, NYMEX.\n  Beginning in 2003, my Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, PSI, \nissued a series of reports exposing how these unregulated markets and \ntheir unregulated trades had opened the door to energy price \nmanipulation and excessive speculation. A 2006 subcommittee report, for \nexample, presented evidence that excessive speculation was adding \nsubstantially to energy prices, including as much as $20 out of a $70 \nbarrel of crude oil. In 2007, the subcommittee issued a report and held \n2 days of hearings showing how excessive speculation in futures \ncontracts by a single hedge fund named ``Amaranth'' on the unregulated \nmarkets had increased consumer prices for natural gas. The report \nshowed how Amaranth deliberately avoided trading limits on NYMEX by \nmoving its trades to an unregulated electronic exchange.\n  Our reports repeatedly recommended legislation to close the Enron \nloophole, and over several Congresses, I introduced or cosponsored \nlegislation to do just that. In 2007, for example, I introduced S. \n2058, the Close the Enron Loophole Act which was endorsed by a wide \nrange of consumer, business, and agricultural groups. In response to \nthis legislation, our reports and hearings, the Commodity Futures \nTrading Commission, CFTC, suggested its own legislative approach to \nclose the Enron loophole. I then worked with my colleagues, Senators \nFeinstein, Snowe, and others to come up with legislation that was \nacceptable to both sides of the aisle as well as the administration. \nThat legislation was offered as an amendment to the Senate farm bill, \nand a closely related version of that amendment is now part of the \nconference report before us today.\n  The farm bill provisions are designed to put the cop back on the beat \nin all U.S. commodity markets to protect against price manipulation and \nexcessive speculation. Specifically, the bill provides that any \ncontract that is traded on an electronic trading facility and serves a \nsignificant price discovery function is subject to CFTC oversight to \nprevent price manipulation and excessive speculation, just as it is \nsubject to that oversight on regulated markets such as NYMEX.\n  For each such contract, an electronic trading facility is required to \ncomply with the same key standards--called ``core principles''--that \napply to regulated exchanges, like NYMEX, to prevent price manipulation \nand excessive speculation. For example, electronic exchanges are \nrequired to list only contracts which are not readily susceptible to \nmanipulation; monitor trading to prevent manipulation and price \ndistortion; establish rules to obtain information from traders and \nprovide it to the CFTC upon request; establish position limits or \naccountability levels that trigger review of a trader's positions in \norder to reduce the potential threat of manipulation; possess emergency \nauthority to require traders to reduce positions; publish daily trading \ninformation; and enforce trader compliance with its rules.\n  Essentially, an electronic trading facility will now have to function \nas a self-regulatory organization under CFTC oversight in the same \nmanner as a regulated futures exchange like NYMEX. The bill gives the \nCFTC the same oversight and enforcement authority over the electronic \nexchange with respect to these contracts as it has with respect to a \nfutures exchange. The days of unregulated electronic energy markets are \nover.\n  Passage of this critically important legislation is the culmination \nof many years of work by Senator Feinstein, myself, Senator Snowe, and \nothers, and I thank them for their sustained effort to close the Enron \nloophole. I also would like to thank Senators Harkin and Chambliss for \nworking with us to include this legislation in the farm bill. In \naddition, I would like to thank our many friends in the other body who \nworked diligently to get this legislation done. The legislation to \nclose the Enron loophole is a bipartisan, bicameral success story and \nthe winners are the American people who will gain greater protection \nagainst price manipulation and excessive speculation.\n  This farm bill is a bipartisan piece of legislation which includes \nmany programs that are beneficial to Michigan. While this bill is not \nperfect, I believe the combination of improved assistance for specialty \ncrops, enhanced conservation spending, increased funding for nutrition \nprograms, investment in renewable energy programs, and the provisions \nclosing the Enron loophole which are included in this bill are worthy \nof support. I am pleased we are finally able to send a farm bill to the \nPresident's desk that will benefit our Nation's farmers and rural \ncommunities, and I urge the President to sign this bill into law.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, with today's passage of the Food, \nConservation, and Energy Act of 2008, we have taken a step in the right \ndirection for rural America after well over a year of work on this \nbill. This legislation will result in new opportunities for U.S. \nfarmers, rural business owners, and those who require food assistance \nduring a time of rising food prices. I am pleased that the Senate has \nfinally voted in favor of its implementation.\n  None of this would have been possible without the leadership of our \nchairman and ranking member on the Senate Agriculture Committee, \nSenator Harkin and Senator Chambliss. I want to thank both of their \nstaffs and in particular Mark Halverson, majority staff director, and \nMartha Scott Poindexter, minority staff director, for their hard work \nand dedication to bring this 5-month conference to a conclusion.\n  For the first time in the process of writing a farm bill, the tax \nwriting committees were asked to help fund a portion of the spending. I \nhave strong concerns about this, which I have expressed previously. \nStill, we would not be here today without the hard work and leadership \nof the chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Max Baucus. And he is \nsupported by a strong staff. That starts with the Democratic staff \ndirector on the Finance Committee, Russ Sullivan, and the deputy staff \ndirector, Bill Dauster, as well as his legislative director, Jon Selib, \nwho were each critical to the process. I also want to thank Brandon \nWillis on his personal staff, Pat Bousilmann on the Senate Finance \nCommittee, and Cathy Koch and Rebecca Baxter on his tax staff. And I \nwant to thank his chief international trade counsel, Demetrios \nMarantis, as well as the other members of the Democratic trade staff, \nDarci Vetter, Amber Cottle, Janis Lazda, Chelsea Thomas, and Hun Quach, \nand three individuals serving on detail to Senator Baucus, Russ Ugone, \nAyesha Khanna, and Chuck Kovatch.\n  Of course, I am grateful for the outstanding effort of my staff as \nwell. First I want to thank Amanda Taylor, my agriculture counsel on my \npersonal staff for her many months and countless hours of dedication \nand hard work on this bill. I also want to thank my chief tax counsel \nand deputy staff director, Mark Prater, as well as Elizabeth Paris, my \nenergy and agricultural tax counsel. I am pleased that with their hard \nwork we were able to provide long overdue agricultural tax relief to \nour nation's farmers. In addition, from my trade staff, Stephen \nSchaefer, David Johanson, Claudia Poteet, and David Ross, each deserve \nmy thanks for their contributions. I also want to thank John Kalitka, \nwho is on detail to my staff from the U.S. Department of Commerce.\n  Today's vote is long overdue. The September 2007 deadline of the farm \nbill has long come and gone. The farm bill hasn't happened as quickly \nas I would have liked, and we've had multiple extensions. Still, \ntoday's vote is critical to giving our agricultural policy a face lift. \nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture should begin to implement\n\n[[Page S4242]]\n\nthese new laws as soon as possible, and I will work hard to oversee the \nDepartment in its administration of this important legislation.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, nearly 3 years after the tragedy of \nHurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma, we have enacted meaningful reforms \nin the way the Small Business Administration comes to the aid of \ndisaster victims.\n  The farm bill conference report includes bipartisan legislation which \nI have been working on since the fall of 2005 with my ranking member, \nSenator Snowe, and Senators Landrieu and Vitter. Both Louisiana \nSenators are members of the Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship. We held many hearings in our committee and received \ntestimony regarding the inadequate response of the Small Business \nAdministration to the destructive gulf coast hurricanes of 2005. S. \n163, the Small Business Disaster Response and Loan Improvements Act of \n2007, the latest version of the Senate's small business disaster \nlegislation, was included as an amendment to the farm bill late last \nyear. During the last several months, we conferenced with our \ncolleagues in the House to reconcile the differences between our \nlegislation and companion legislation adopted by the House. I am \npleased that we were able to come to an agreement. I want to \nacknowledge the hard work of all the staffs, and the support of Senator \nHarkin and his Agriculture Committee staff as we conferenced on this \nbill. I also want to thank SBA Administrator Preston for his support of \nthis legislation back in August when it first passed the Senate, and \nduring the conference negotiations. This package of provisions does not \ninclude everything I would have wanted but it is a significant response \nto the gulf coast hurricanes of 2005.\n  These large-scale disasters taught us lessons and showed us our \nvulnerabilities in their wake. They also inspired novel ideas as to how \nto respond which we have incorporated into these reforms.\n  This bill gives the SBA several tools to better and more quickly \nassist disaster victims. One of the key issues after Hurricane Katrina \nwas getting money to people quickly so they could keep their businesses \nafloat and start rebuilding their lives. This bill creates two bridge \nloan programs for the private sector to administer small-dollar, short-\nterm disaster loans to businesses. It allows the SBA, in a catastrophic \ndisaster, to authorize private lenders to make 180-day loans of up to \n$150,000 at not more then 1 percent over the prime rate to businesses \nthat are otherwise eligible for a disaster loan. In all disasters, \nprivate lenders can make loans of up to $25,000 and receive an SBA \nguaranty within 36 hours for up to 85 percent of the loan amount. Both \nloans would be rolled into a standard SBA disaster loan once it has \nbeen made. These bridge loans will get financial assistance to \nbusinesses while they await processing or disbursement of their \nconventional SBA loan or insurance payments.\n  This bill also creates a program to allow private lenders to make \ndisaster loans after a catastrophic disaster. This will leverage the \nrelationships people already have with their local lenders and ease the \nburden on the SBA to make a huge volume of loans quickly. These loans \nwill carry the same terms and benefits as conventional SBA disaster \nloans. All lenders would be eligible to make loans to small businesses, \nbut only lenders who are preferred lenders could make loans to \nindividuals. The bill also provides the SBA with authority to pay a fee \nto private lenders to process loans during times when the SBA's \nprocessing capabilities are overwhelmed in order to prevent application \nbacklogs and ensure timely approval and disbursement of loan proceeds. \nTools such as these will dramatically cut the time it takes to process \nand disburse loans in the event of a future disaster.\n  After a catastrophic disaster, while the disaster area clearly feels \nthe brunt of the damage, businesses throughout the country can be \ndramatically affected by the incident. This could be because one of \ntheir suppliers or buyers is located in the disaster area, because they \nreceive energy from the disaster area, or a myriad of other reasons. \nThis bill authorizes the SBA to make economic injury disaster loans to \nbusinesses located outside the geographic area of a catastrophic \ndisaster, if they suffer economic injury as a direct result of the \ndisaster.\n  This bill also updates and increases the maximum amount of an SBA \ndisaster loan from the current level of $1,500,000 to $2,000,000, and \nraises the maximum amount of unsecured disaster loans from $10,000 to \n$14,000. It was well past time to raise these caps given the increasing \ncosts of doing business and these provisions give the SBA the \nflexibility to get people the help that they need. The bill also gives \nthe SBA Administrator the authority to make new disaster loans and \nrefinance existing loans from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita with a 4-year \ndeferment period giving people time to get back on their feet before \ntheir payments come due.\n  Finally, the bill improves SBA's coordination with other agencies, \nits communication with the public, and its preparation for a future \ndisaster. The bill adds several requirements to improve the SBA's \ncoordination with FEMA as they are the two main agencies responsible to \nrespond to a major disaster. The agency will also be required to \nconduct biennial disaster simulation exercises and create a \ncomprehensive disaster response plan for various disaster scenarios. \nThe SBA will be required to improve its communication with the public \nwhen disaster assistance is made available. The bill also creates a new \nposition for high-level disaster planning to oversee the disaster \nplanning and readiness of the agency.\n  I applaud my colleagues for helping pass this important piece of \nlegislation as part of the farm bill. I expect to see immediate \ndividends as the SBA is better able to assist disaster victims in the \nshort term, and I know that the passage of these provisions will be \nlooked upon as an essential rebuilding tool if we ever have another \ntragedy on the scale of 9/11 or Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, today the Senate voted on the farm bill. \nLeading up to that vote, we had two procedural votes which are required \nwhen budget points of order are raised against a legislative provision.\n  My vote on this farm bill was a difficult one. Certainly, opposition \nto this bill is justified. There are simply too many subsidies in this \nbill, there are Davis-Bacon provisions that I strongly oppose, and I \nbelieve that some provisions may violate our trade agreements.\n  To express my frustration with the negative aspects of the bill, I \nchose to support the procedural obstacles leading up to the vote on the \nbill itself. However, in response to very strong support for the farm \nbill from the preponderance of agricultural interests in my State, and \nto the fact that the farm bill has some provisions that are very \nimportant to me, I chose to vote in favor of the legislation.\n  I would like to say a few words about a provision in the bill which I \nsponsored and promoted for over a decade. The provision lifts the ban \non the interstate distribution of State-inspected meat. I began the \neffort with Senator Daschle, and more recently worked with Senators \nKohl and Baucus, to include it in the farm bill.\n  Let me give a little background on this issue. With the passage of \nthe Federal Meat Inspection Act of 1906, the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture was required to inspect all cattle, sheep, swine, goats, \nand horses slaughtered for human consumption. The USDA was also made \nresponsible for setting national standards for meat and poultry \ninspection. In 1957, the Poultry Products Inspection Act made poultry \nsubject to USDA inspection. Later, these two laws were amended to set \nup a system of State inspection programs separate from the Federal \nprogram. At that time, due to some uncertainty about new State \ninspection programs, a prohibition on interstate distribution was \nplaced on State-inspected beef, poultry, pork, and lamb.\n  It is important to note that the prohibition does not apply to other \nmeats such as venison, pheasant, quail, rabbit, alligator, and others \nthat are typically inspected under the state programs. Neither does the \nprohibition apply to other perishable products, including milk, other \ndairy items, fruits, vegetables and fish. All of these products which \nare inspected under State\n\n[[Page S4243]]\n\nprograms are shipped freely across State lines and to our trading \npartners.\n  If a State can inspect these products sufficiently for international \ndistribution, they can certainly continue to do so for our more \nstandard meat and poultry products. In the nearly 30 years that the \nUSDA has reviewed State programs, the Department has never unilaterally \nfound that a State inspection program should be discontinued due to an \ninability to meet Federal food safety regulations.\n  In Utah, we have 32 meat plants under our State inspection program. \nThese establishments, like the nearly 2,000 similar plants nationwide, \nare mostly small businesses. Generally speaking, they cater to the \nneeds of small, family-run farms and ranches. The outdated ban on \ninterstate shipment of State-inspected meats clearly disrupts the free \nflow of trade, restricts access to the market, and creates an unfair \nadvantage for big businesses.\n  Let's not forget that meat inspected in 34 foreign countries can be \nshipped anywhere in the U.S. because the USDA has certified that the \nforeign inspection programs are equivalent to the Federal program, yet \nour domestic products inspected by States cannot. This is a ridiculous \nsituation, and it is well past time to remedy it.\n  So I am very pleased that the farm bill will remove the outdated and \nunjust ban that puts our small businesses at such a disadvantage. \nRemoving this prohibition will increase competition and innovation. It \nwill provide farmers and ranchers an increased opportunity to innovate \nand compete to serve their consumers.\n  I am also very pleased that the farm bill includes a provision by \nSenator Max Baucus, which I cosponsored, that will set up a disaster \nprogram for the livestock industry. In Utah, we have agricultural \ndisasters almost every year. Farmers in my State never know what Mother \nNature may send their way, and my goal is to provide them greater \nstability. I am grateful that this farm bill will provide our livestock \nproducers the security and certainty they have sought for so long.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee \non Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs be authorized to meet during the \nsession of the Senate on May 15, 2008, at 3 p.m., in executive session, \nto conduct a markup of the following: an original bill entitled ``The \nFederal Housing Finance Regulatory Reform Act of 2008''; H.R. 634, \n``American Veterans Disabled For Life Commemorative Coin Act'' and an \noriginal bill to make technical corrections to title II of the SAFETEA-\nLU bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CORKER. Madam President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. CORKER. Madam President, the bill the chairman of the Banking \nCommittee, the distinguished Senator from Connecticut, is speaking \nabout is over 400 pages long. It has been amended verbally numerous \ntimes over the past week. We are going to have a meeting at 3 o'clock \ntoday. None of us has seen the bill. None of us has seen the \namendments.\n  I have tremendous respect for the chairman of this committee. He is, \nto me, one of the best Senators in this body to work with. I respect \nthe ranking committee member. I know time is of the essence, if you \nwill, as to addressing some of the issues that are in this bill. I am \nvery disappointed that today at 3 we are going to be going through a \nvery technical bill many Senators in this body, candidly, may not ever \ntake the time to look at because of the technicalities that exist and \nthe specialties that will be addressed, if you will, by this bill.\n  I am very tempted to object to this, not because it is taking place \ntoday at 3, but because of the fact that we do not have any of the \ndocumentation regarding the agreements that have been made.\n  Out of my respect for this chairman and out of my respect for the \nranking member, I will not object at this time. But I will say, in the \nfuture I hope for a technical bill such as this that is more than a few \nlines--something that is over 400 pages long--there will be time to \nactually go through the bill prior to a very strenuous markup. I in no \nway assert any negativity toward the Senator. I know he is doing the \nbest he can to hold this bill together. I know there are a lot of \ncompeting interests. It is actually out of respect for him trying to do \nthe job he is doing today, in order to move something forward in this \nbody, that I will not object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I appreciate the Senator not objecting, \nbut let me, for the purpose of the record, inform him that the \ncommittee print has not been changed. There were no verbal agreements. \nThe bill was available a week ago for anyone to read. It was in the \nCongressional Record. It has been on a Web page as well so the public \nat large could read it here.\n  It is a long involved process, an involved process. The only reason \nwe are meeting at 3 today is because of the request of the ranking \nmember to delay the markup this morning. I am here to work out some \nadditional provisions. I want to let my colleague know that. I \nappreciate my colleague very much. He is a very active and constructive \nmember of the Banking Committee, but this is a product that has been \navailable for people to review almost for a week now, before the markup \nactually was to occur this morning.\n  I appreciate his not objecting. We will see how things progress. \nNonetheless, we will keep working at it, but his involvement will be \ncritical.\n  Mr. CORKER. Madam President, I wish to say that portions--while no \ndoubt we have the original text, it is my understanding negotiations \nwere taking place throughout the night. I was getting e-mails at 1:30 \nin the morning regarding the negotiations, and yet I have seen no \nwritten copies of any of the agreements that have been made. I would \nsay that would be nice to see prior to a markup of this type, but again \nout of respect I will not object, and thank you very much for this \ncolloquy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I come to the floor to rebut the \nscapegoating of ethanol, which is part of the food versus fuel debate.\n  I do not do it for a one-way conversation. I hope I can encourage \nconversation on this subject among my colleagues so we can look at this \nfrom a scientific and economic point of view and avoid scapegoating.\n\n[[Page S4244]]\n\n  For almost 30 years, I have been leading an effort with many of my \ncolleagues to promote policies to grow a domestic renewable fuels \nindustry. We have promoted homegrown renewable fuels as a way to lessen \nour dependance on foreign oil and to improve our air quality.\n  For all these years, we have hardly heard anything negative about \nthese policies. Now, ethanol and other biofuels are being made a \nscapegoat for a whole variety of problems. Never before in 30 years has \nthe virtuous benefits of ethanol and renewable fuels been so questioned \nand so criticized.\n  The problem is, none of these criticisms are based on sound science, \nsound economics, or for that matter even common sense. I had the \nopportunity to hear an intelligent discussion of this, maybe it only \nlasted a couple of minutes, on a program on Fox News Saturday night \ncalled, ``The Beltway Boys.'' And these people are very intelligent \npeople.\n  I heard Mort Kondracke, a veteran journalist, falling prey to some of \nthe same erroneous talking points that I have heard over and over for \nthe past couple of weeks.\n  Mr. Kondracke is one-half of that intelligent duo on Fox News that I \nreferred to as ``The Beltway Boys.'' Maybe Mr. Kondracke has spent too \nmuch time inside the beltway and could use a little real world \nexplanation from a family farmer like me from the Midwest.\n  Some of my colleagues in the Senate have also gotten involved in this \nmisinformation campaign, and that is why I did not come to the floor to \nspeak; I come to the floor to encourage dialogue with my colleagues on \nthis subject because it seems there is a ``group-think'' mentality when \nit comes to scapegoating ethanol for everything from high gas prices, \nglobal food shortages, global warming, and even deforestation.\n  But, as was recently reported, this anti-ethanol campaign is not a \ncoincidence. It has been well thought out, well programmed, and that \nprogram is going on. It turns out that a $300,000, 6-month retainer of \na beltway public relations firm is behind the smear campaign against \nethanol. And they have been hired by a trade association referred to as \nthe Grocery Manufacturers Association. They have outlined their \nstrategy of using environmental, hunger, and food aid groups to \ndemonstrate their contrived crisis. And it is right here in a 26-page \ndocument put out by the Glover Park Group, called ``The Food and Fuel \nCampaign.'' They enlist the support of these other nonprofit groups \nthat are involved with environment and hunger.\n  I think it is important for policymakers and the American people to \nknow who is behind this effort. According to reports, downtown DC \nlobbyists, the Glover Park Group, and the Dutko Worldwide are leading \nthe effort to undermine and denigrate the patriotic achievements of \nAmerican farmers to reduce our dependence on foreign oil, while also \nproviding a safe and affordable food environment.\n  The principal leaders behind the Glover Park Group's proposal reads \nlike a who's who of Democratic operatives. The effort is led by former \nPresident Clinton's Press Secretary, Joe Lockhart. Another is 8-year \nveteran of the Clinton-Gore White House, Michael Feldman.\n  Other leaders in this misinformation campaign include Carter Eskew, \nMike Donilon, Joel Johnson, and Susan Brophy, all of which proudly \ndisplay their ties to the Clinton-Gore White House and their \ncredentials of helping elect Democratic candidates.\n  This campaign against ethanol is more sophisticated than anything I \nhave seen put on by big oil over the last 30 years, as big oil has been \na constant fighter. I will show you how this is a well-sophisticated \npolitical operation and public relations effort. For instance, the \nmedia relations public affairs responsibility comes under the partners \nin charge, Joe Lockhart and Michael Feldman. The advocacy and image \nadvertising comes under the leadership of partners in charge, Carter \nEskew and Mike Donilon. The legislative affairs part of it is directed \nby partners in charge, Joel Johnson and Susan Brophy.\n  Now, these people are outstanding people. They are going to be able \nto deliver what they have said they could do. That is why we have to \ntake it very seriously.\n\n  I suggest that Democrats in the Senate who claim to support our \nNation's drive toward energy independence should be alarmed by this \ngroup's planned campaign and the tactics being used.\n  I happen to be one who fought President Clinton during his 8 years in \noffice at every turn when he tried to undermine our renewable fuels \nindustry. The outstanding example I remember is when California made \napplication to the EPA for a waiver under the Clean Air Act at the very \ntime that MTBE was being outlawed because it was poisoning the \ngroundwater. The only oxygenate that you could use in gasoline then was \nethanol. California sought an exemption. We were able to win that by \nthe Clinton administration not allowing it. Now, of course, we find \nourselves fighting President Clinton's former staff and staff who \nworked for the Gore and Kerry Presidential campaigns, leading an effort \nfor the grocery manufacturers to smear ethanol, after 30 years of \ndeveloping an industry because people called for more renewable energy. \nThey wanted renewable, clean-burning energy. They didn't want to be \nreliant upon dirty-burning petroleum. They didn't want to be relying \nupon importing so much.\n  I imagine that they are leading this effort partly because they are \nbeing paid well for doing so, but they maybe can't stand the fact that \nPresident Bush has proved to be the best friend the renewable fuels \nindustry has had. Because their old boss failed miserably at crafting \npolicies to promote ethanol, they are doing everything they can to tear \ndown the success President George W. Bush has helped foster.\n  There are a lot of intelligent people who have been misled by this \ncampaign and are simply wrong. They are using in their speeches a lot \nof the rhetoric that comes out of this effort. The facts don't back up \nthe argument. I invite my colleagues to look at the facts, challenge \nme, have a dialog on this subject so we can use science as a basis for \nwhat we are doing, and economics as well.\n  It is time to dispel the myths perpetuated by Mr. Kondracke, one of \nthe Beltway boys--he was probably reporting this misinformation because \nhe is a smart person--the Glover Park Group, and others.\n  The Grocery Manufacturers Association, I have come to the conclusion, \nneeds an excuse to gouge consumers of America with higher food prices, \nand an easy scapegoat for increasing food prices is, of course, \nethanol. One myth that pops up again and again is that ethanol takes \nmore energy to produce than it provides. I heard Mr. Kondracke say \nthat. Let's look at the facts. In 2005, the Argonne National Laboratory \nstudy concluded that it takes only seven-tenths of one unit of fossil \nenergy to make one unit of ethanol. That is a positive net energy \nbalance. In comparison, it takes 1.23 units of fossil energy to make \none unit of petroleum gasoline. So why aren't the grocery manufacturers \nof America bringing up the point that petroleum processing into \ngasoline is not energy positive? Because gasoline requires more than 1 \nBtu of energy to deliver 1 Btu to your car. That is a negative net \nenergy balance.\n  A 2004 U.S. Department of Agriculture study concluded that ethanol \nyields 67 percent more energy than is used to grow and harvest the \ngrain and to process that grain into ethanol. These figures take into \naccount the energy required to not just process grain into ethanol, it \ntakes into consideration the energy the farmer takes to plant, to grow, \nto harvest the corn, as well as the energy required to manufacture and \ndistribute the ethanol.\n  Of 15 different peer-review studies we have looked at and that have \nbeen conducted on this issue, 12 of the 15 found that ethanol has a \npositive net energy balance. Only a single individual from Cornell \nUniversity, who authored the other three studies, disagrees with this \nanalysis. The Cornell studies have consistently used old data, some \nfrom 1979. Remember, in 1979, farmers weren't producing as much corn \nper acre as they do today. Corn yields then were 91 bushels per acre. \nIt was at 137 bushels per acre in the year 2000. The average is now up \nto 150 to 160 bushels per acre. The flawed studies also rely on 1979 \nfigures for energy use to manufacture\n\n[[Page S4245]]\n\nethanol. This energy consumption was cut in half between the years 1979 \nand 2000 and continues efficiency gains every year. I could quantify \nthat better than just using a broad sweep.\n  In the early 1980s, we were producing about 2.3 gallons of ethanol \nfrom a bushel of corn. Today, we are producing 2.8 gallons of ethanol \nper bushel. And pretty soon, the industry believes they might be able \nto produce 3 gallons per bushel.\n  So these erroneous Cornell conclusions have been refuted by experts \nfrom entities as diverse as the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the \nDepartment of Energy, the Argonne National Laboratory, Michigan State \nUniversity, and the Colorado School of Mines. The fact is, studies \nusing old data overestimate energy use by not taking into account \nefficiencies gained in agriculture, the greater use of fertilizer, and \nethanol production.\n  I don't understand how intelligent people, then, can continue to \nargue that ethanol has a negative net energy balance. But that is what \nI heard on television Saturday night from very intelligent people. That \nis what I hear in this smear campaign. The net energy balance of \nethanol production continues to improve because ethanol production is \nbecoming more efficient. A March 2008 study by Argonne National \nLaboratory found significant gains just since 2001. Ethanol production \nsince 2001 has reduced water use by 27 percent, reduced electricity use \nby 16 percent, and reduced total energy use by 22 percent.\n  Another myth being perpetuated by opponents of a renewable fuels \neffort and by Mr. Kondracke is that ethanol harms the environment and \ncontributes more in greenhouse gases than petroleum. This claim is \nlikewise hogwash. Science magazine and Time magazine made wildly \nerroneous claims about corn ethanol that are now being used by these \ndetractors. They claim that ethanol production is the driving force \nbehind rain forest deforestation and grassland conversion to \nagricultural production. This is an oversimplification to say the \nleast. How could intelligent people ignore the effects of a growing \nglobal population? How can one simply ignore the surging global demands \nfor food from growing populations in China and India? Wouldn't urban \ndevelopment and sprawl also be a contributor to the increased demand \nfor arable land?\n  Secretary of Agriculture Ed Schafer and Energy Secretary Sam Bodman \nstated in a letter to Time magazine, when they ran this outrageous \nstory that was based on a Science magazine article, that it was ``one-\nsided and scientifically uninformed.'' They further stated that the \nScience magazine article had been ``thoroughly rebutted by leading \nscientists at the Department of Energy's Argonne National Laboratory.'' \nIn fact, Dr. Wang at the Argonne Laboratory stated:\n\n       There has been no indication that the U.S. corn ethanol \n     production has so far caused indirect land use changes in \n     other countries. No claim can be made that U.S. ethanol \n     production leads to the clearing of rain forests.\n\n  In fact, since 2002, U.S. corn exports increased by 60 percent. Even \nwith the growth in the ethanol industry, our corn exports have steadily \nincreased, meeting growing global demands. So when it comes to the \nUnited States and food, we allow exports to other areas where they need \nour overproduction.\n  But one of the things that is driving up the price of rice now is a \nlot of prohibition in countries that produce rice to exports. So the \nglobal trading system is not efficiently distributing rice to where it \nis needed to feed hungry people. Think of that as a detraction, but \nalso think that in the whole world, 95 percent of all grain produced is \nconsumed and not made into something else.\n  While some claim that corn ethanol increases greenhouse gas emissions \nbecause of land use changes around the globe, they need to think again. \nAccording to the U.S. Department of Energy, today's corn ethanol \nproduces about 20 percent fewer greenhouse gas emissions on a life-\ncycle basis. Ethanol blended fuel emits cleaner tailpipe emissions and, \nunlike petroleum, ethanol doesn't harm the environment or groundwater \nthe way the petroleum-based product MTBE did for the 20 years it was \nused in gasoline as an oxygenate, where ethanol can be used as an \noxygenate and it doesn't do that.\n  In recent weeks, a new argument has come forward about the effect of \ncorn ethanol on domestic and global food prices. Food prices are going \nup. Of course, we all have to be sympathetic to that, whether it is in \nAmerica or abroad. People are struggling with higher prices for food is \nnot something we like to hear. But to put all the blame at the feet of \nthe U.S. ethanol industry is outrageous and misplaced, and that is what \nthis smear campaign is all about, just so the grocery manufacturers of \nAmerica can have an excuse to increase the price of food here.\n  Watching the news and listening to some of my colleagues, there was \neven a hearing on this a couple weeks ago in the Senate. I have even \nheard expressed in this hearing that the price of oranges was going up \nbecause of ethanol. We have heard that the domestic ethanol industry \nwas blamed for shortages not only in oranges but apples, broccoli, \nrice, wheat, lentils, peppers, even bananas.\n  Let's stop to think about the people who are saying: You are growing \nmore corn, so we are growing less wheat or rice. We don't make ethanol \nout of wheat or rice. But for people to say that fruits are going up or \nbananas are going up because we are growing more corn, well, let me \nassure everybody I do not know of anybody who is plowing up and tearing \nout an apple orchard, an orange orchard or a banana plantation to plant \ncorn for ethanol. But that is the ignorance about the people who are \nmaking those mistakes, trying to make the argument that more land is \ngoing into corn and less going into wheat, so the price of bread is \ngoing up.\n\n  With regard to wheat, rice, and lentils, the global demand for food \nfrom a growing middle class in China and India have the most impact is \nwhat economists are telling us.\n  Weather trends, including a 100-year historic--how to say it--the \nworst drought in 100 years in Australia and poor growing conditions in \nSoutheast Asia and Eastern Europe have had a much greater impact on the \nsupply of rice and wheat.\n  Many of these countries also have government production policies that \nmanipulate production, supply, and trading of these commodities. Think \nof some of the dictators in Africa who want a cheap food policy. \nFarmers cannot make enough producing food, so the farmers move to town \nand live in the slums, when they could be producing something back \nhome, if the governments had policies that would encourage the \nproduction. There is so much resource in Africa that there is no reason \nto have anybody starving in Africa.\n  The fact is, the global demand and price for all commodities has \nincreased. Some of this could even be due to speculation. You read that \nin the business papers in the United States quite regularly.\n  One of the biggest culprits behind rising food prices is the cost of \noil at $125 a barrel. We had a recent Texas A study concluding that \nthe biggest driving force behind the higher food costs is higher energy \ncosts. So if Texas A is saying that, let's look at what the Iowa \nState University Center for Agriculture and Rural Development is saying \nabout ethanol's impact upon the price of gasoline and energy to move \nfood around. They say, without the ethanol we have, you would be paying \n30 or 40 cents more for a gallon of gasoline. In turn, then, since \nTexas A says energy is the biggest reason for the increased costs of \nfood, you would have yet higher food prices without having ethanol.\n  Joseph Glauber, chief economist at the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture, recently testified that rising prices for corn and \nsoybeans have had little or no effect on the high price for wheat, \nrice, and other food commodities.\n  Dr. Glauber cited the worldwide economic growth--that would be China \nand India, as examples of a couple countries--global weather problems--\nthat would be the drought in Australia--rising marketing costs, and a \nweak U.S. dollar as having a greater role than biofuels in the cost of \nfood being higher and even being scarce.\n  A U.N. official has recently referred to biofuels as ``a crime \nagainst humanity.'' Mr. Ziegler, from the country of Switzerland, might \nbenefit from a review of European policies that ban or restrict the \ngrowth and import of genetically modified crops.\n  Let me explain that genetically modified crops have had a great deal \nto\n\n[[Page S4246]]\n\ndo with the increased production of corn per acre, from 91 bushels per \nacre in 1979, to 107 bushels per acre in 2000, to 150 to 160 bushels \nper acre in 2007.\n  While U.S. farmers are taking great strides, through the use of \ngenetically modified grains, to feed the world, Europe is taking a step \nbackward--the same Europe that Mr. Ziegler lives in, who is saying that \nbiofuels is ``a crime against humanity.''\n  As a result, you have a ripple effect of the policies in Europe \nbecause African countries are reluctant to grow genetically modified \ngrains, even though their production gains are great, because European \ncountries might restrict their imports from those African countries.\n  I might suggest Mr. Ziegler focus more of his efforts on \nopportunities lost as to growing more grains in Europe and focus on \nGMOs and their use in Europe than our biofuels policy.\n  U.S. farmers responded to these increased demands for grain and \nproduced a record corn crop in 2007. Now, we grew more acres of corn in \n2007 than any year since 1944. We produced 2.6 billion more bushels of \ncorn in 2007 than 2006. Now, out of that 2.7 billion bushels, ethanol \nonly used 600 million of them. So for all the people complaining about \nnot having enough corn, are they going to use 2.1 billion bushels more \nthat we raised in the greatest acreage since 1944 that was not used for \nethanol? Are they going to take that into consideration or are they \ngoing to still complain that there is not enough corn around?\n  Exports have grown as well. Our U.S. Department of Agriculture \nestimates that this year's corn exports will be a record 2.5 billion \nbushels--up 18 percent over last year. We are getting that surplus \nproduction in the United States around the world, where it is needed. \nOne of the places it is needed is in China. They do not export corn \nanymore. In the 1980s, the Chinese were eating 44 pounds of meat a \nyear; this year--while I guess the figures are for a couple years ago--\n111 pounds of meat. They are going from rice to value-added food \nproducts. They have to have some of our corn to do that, and we are \nglad to sell it to them.\n  With these facts, it is hard for critics to argue that the domestic \nethanol industry is diverting corn from feed or food markets. Yet that \nis what this smear campaign is saying.\n  It is also important to keep in mind that a tiny fraction of the cost \nof retail food is the result of farm inputs. Would you think farmers \nare getting rich because the price of food is going up?\n  First of all, let's look at all the income from farmers. They only \nget back 19 cents\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, since I do not see any other \ncolleagues asking for time, I ask unanimous consent for an additional \n10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Thank you, Madam President.\n  Out of $1 that you, as a consumer, spend for food, the farmer gets 19 \ncents. Look at a $5 box of corn flakes. For an interview here, I bought \na $5 box of corn flakes. I think I had to pay a little bit more because \nI bought it on the Hill. But the family farmer's share of that $5 box \nof corn flakes--and it happened to be a little bigger box than normal--\nwas about less than 10 cents. I think the real figure is about 8 cents. \nThat is what the farmer gets out of a box of corn flakes.\n  Yet the farmer is being blamed for the high price of food because we \ngrow some corn to make ethanol because the American people, 30 years \nago, were demanding that we go to a renewable, clean-burning fuel \ninstead of depending upon dirty-burning petroleum, putting more \nCO2 into the air. The value of corn in a pound of beef or \npork is about 20 or 30 cents. Yet some have suggested we should suspend \nour policies that promote the use of renewable fuels to help drive down \nfood prices.\n  If all the evidence suggests that biofuels have little, if any, \nimpact on the rising cost of food, what good can come from lifting our \nbiofuels policies? If people look at the facts, how can a public \nrelations firm of former Clinton employees get a $300,000 contract from \na very respectable organization such as the Grocery Manufacturers of \nAmerica, whose Members need an excuse to raise the price of food? How \ndo they get away with it? Well, they get away with it because nobody is \nlooking at the facts.\n  I was pleased to join 15 of my colleagues in signing a letter to the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency, expressing our opposition to this \nmisguided idea. We had about that same number of Senators in this \nbody--some of them even voting for ethanol in the past years--sending a \nletter down to the same EPA, saying we have to stop ethanol, probably \nsome of the very same people who are complaining about the dirty air we \nhave or the global warming.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord a copy of that letter.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 6, 2008.\n     Hon. Stephen Johnson,\n     Administrator, Environmental Protection Agency, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Administrator Johnson: We're writing to express our \n     strong opposition to any request to partially or completely \n     waive the Renewable Fuels Standard. We strongly disagree with \n     the assumption that the renewable fuels mandate is harming \n     the U.S. economy or that it's primarily responsible for the \n     global escalation of food costs.\n       We recognize that global food prices have seen a \n     significant increase in recent years. However, waiving the \n     RFS would not cause an immediate or near term reduction in \n     food prices. Ed Lazear, Chairman of the Council of Economic \n     Advisors, recently estimated that global food prices have \n     increased 43 percent since last year, and domestic food \n     inflation was 4.5 percent. Importantly, Chairman Lazear noted \n     that the increased production of ethanol accounted for only 3 \n     percent of the 43 percent global increase and only a quarter \n     of one percent of the 4.5 percent increase in U.S. food \n     prices. This data is evidence that ethanol accounts for less \n     than 3 percent of the increase in global food prices.\n       There are many factors behind the rise in food costs. The \n     increased demand in emerging markets, increased cost of \n     energy inputs, weather conditions in Australia, China and \n     Eastern Europe, and export restrictions have all contributed \n     to the rising costs, according to Chairman Lazear.\n       Corn production and consumption in the United States has \n     very little or no impact at all on global rice, wheat or \n     lentil markets. Joseph Glauber, Chief Economist at the U.S. \n     Department of Agriculture, recently testified before Congress \n     that rising prices for corn and soybeans have had little \n     effect on the high prices for wheat, rice and other food \n     commodities. He indicated that many factors have a greater \n     role than biofuels, including worldwide economic growth, \n     global weather problems affecting wheat production, rising \n     marketing costs, and the weak U.S. dollar.\n       While we're all sympathetic to those struggling to cope \n     with the higher cost of food both domestically and \n     internationally, we must be intellectually honest about the \n     real causes behind the increases. Waiving the renewable fuels \n     mandate will have a negligible impact on corn and food \n     prices. A recent Texas A study concluded that relaxing the \n     Renewable Fuels Standard will not result in significantly \n     lower corn prices. \n       At a time when a barrel of crude oil costs nearly $120 and \n     gasoline prices are approaching $4 a gallon, the fuel \n     produced by the U.S. ethanol industry is helping to extend \n     our fuel supply and keep prices lower. A Merrill Lynch \n     analyst recently estimated that oil and gas prices would be \n     15 percent higher if biofuels weren't added to our nation's \n     fuel supply. According to Iowa State University's Center for \n     Agriculture and Rural Development, ethanol use has lowered \n     gas prices by 30 to 40 cents a gallon, while relaxing the \n     mandate would reduce corn prices by only 5 percent. The fact \n     is, reducing the amount of ethanol in our nation's fuel mix \n     will have little if any impact on food prices and will \n     actually increase prices at the pump for American's \n     consumers.\n       As world demand for biofuels and food increases in the \n     coming years, we will need to continue to develop \n     technologies and feedstocks that meet that demand in a \n     sustainable manner. We strongly support efforts to develop \n     alternative feedstocks and technologies that can satisfy this \n     global demand in a way that addresses the goals of energy \n     security and food security.\n       The U.S. renewable fuels industry has made tremendous \n     strides to produce a home-grown, alternative energy that is \n     improving our environment, reducing our dependence on foreign \n     oil and increasing our national security. America's farmers \n     are continuing to provide an ample supply of safe, affordable \n     food for the U.S. and global markets. Therefore, we strongly \n     urge you to reject any action that would reduce the \n     production and use of domestically produced renewable fuels.\n           Sincerely,\n         Charles E. Grassley; John Thune; Norm Coleman; Kit Bond; \n           Tim Johnson; E. Benjamin Nelson; Amy Klobuchar; Byron \n           Dorgan; Richard G. Lugar; Ken Salazar; Kent Conrad; Jon \n           Tester; Claire McCaskill; Tom Harkin; Debbie Stabenow; \n           Evan Bayh.\n\n\n[[Page S4247]]\n\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. An investment researcher with UBS recently said that \nlifting the biofuels mandate will not ease corn or food prices because \nenergy costs and commodity speculation--speculation--are greater \nfactors. Lifting the renewable fuels mandate will not drive down the \ncost of corn or the price of groceries. But it will increase our demand \nfor crude oil--dirty-burning crude oil. Big oil wins.\n  A Merrill Lynch analyst recently estimated that oil and gas prices \nwould be up 15 percent higher without biofuels. I have already spoken \nto the Iowa State University study: 30 or 40 cents higher for gasoline \nwithout having the ethanol industry.\n  Another economist estimated an even higher price, that gas would go \nup $1.40 if we removed 50 percent of the ethanol scheduled to be used \nthis year--as these letters from my colleagues suggest that we do away \nwith half the mandate.\n  It is clear, then, reducing the amount of ethanol in our Nation's \nfuel mix will have little, if any, impact on food prices and will \nactually increase prices at the pump for all Americans.\n  So to the critics, let me say loudly and clearly: Ethanol is not the \ncause of all that ails you. While it is easy to blame, it is \nintellectually dishonest to make these claims. It is time for critics \nto take an independent look at the facts. They have a responsibility to \nbrush aside this sort of ``herd mentality'' that is being encouraged by \nthe Grocery Manufacturers Association. It eventually gets taken over by \nthe pundits and talking heads on TV who claim that everything about \nethanol is bad. And it is getting louder. It is not only bad, but it is \nbad, bad, bad.\n  I wish to tell you what is good, good, good about ethanol because the \ntruth is, ethanol is reducing our dependence upon foreign oil. Ethanol \nhas a significant net energy balance. The same cannot be said for \ngasoline. Ethanol is reducing our greenhouse gas emissions. Ethanol is \nnot the culprit behind rising food and feed prices here at home or \nabroad. Ethanol is lowering the price of crude oil and lowering the \nprice of gasoline. Ethanol is increasing our national security, helping \nour balance of trade, reducing our dependence upon Middle East oil and \nthe whims of big oil.\n  It is time we clear the air, look at the facts, and recognize, once \nagain, that everything about our domestic renewable fuels is good, \ngood, good--good for agriculture; good for the refinery business, \nproviding jobs in rural America; good for the environment; good for \nnational defense; good for the balance of payments--good, good, good.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that ``Ethanol Myths and \nFacts'' from the U.S. Department of Energy be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                        Ethanol Myths and Facts\n\n       Myth: Ethanol cannot be produced from corn in large enough \n     quantities to make a real difference without disrupting food \n     and feed supplies.\n       Fact: Corn is only one source of ethanol. As we develop \n     new, cost-effective methods for producing biofuels, a \n     significant amount of ethanol will be made from more abundant \n     cellulosic biomass sources.\n       Future ethanol will be produced increasingly from cellulose \n     found in crop residues (e.g, stalks, hulls), forestry \n     residues (e.g., from forest thinning), energy crops (e.g., \n     switchgrass, sorghum), and sorted municipal wastes. Some \n     promising energy crops grow on marginal soils not suited for \n     traditional agriculture.\n       A high-protein animal feed, known as Distillers Dried \n     Grains with Solubles (DDGS), is produced in the process of \n     making corn ethanol.\n       The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA) \n     requires that U.S. transportation fuels contain at least 36 \n     billion gallons of renewable fuels by 2022. Of that quantity, \n     16 billion gallons must be cellulosic biofuels, while ethanol \n     from corn is capped at 15 billion gallons.\n       The U.S. Departments of Energy and Agriculture's Billion \n     Ton Study found that we can grow adequate biomass feedstocks \n     to displace about 30% of current gasoline use by 2030 on a \n     sustainable basis--with only modest changes in land use. It \n     determined that 1.3 billion tons of U.S. biomass feedstock is \n     potentially available for the production of biofuels-more \n     than enough biomass to meet the new renewable fuel standard \n     mandated by EISA.\n       Myth: In terms of emissions, ethanol pollutes the same as \n     gasoline or more.\n       Fact: Ethanol results in fewer greenhouse gas (GHG) \n     emissions than gasoline and is fully biodegradable, unlike \n     some fuel additives.\n       Today, on a life cycle basis, corn ethanol produces about \n     20% fewer GHG emissions than gasoline. With improved \n     efficiency and use of renewable energy, this reduction could \n     reach 52%.\n       In the future, ethanol produced from cellulose has the \n     potential to cut life- cycle GHG emissions by up to 86% \n     relative to gasoline.\n       Ethanol-blended fuels currently in the market--whether E10 \n     or E85--meet stringent tailpipe emission standards.\n       Ethanol readily biodegrades without harm to the environment \n     and is a safe, high-performance replacement for fuel \n     additives such as MTBE.\n       Myth: More energy goes into producing ethanol than it \n     delivers as a fuel.\n       Fact: In terms of fossil energy, each gallon of ethanol \n     produced from corn today delivers one third or more energy \n     than is used to produce it.\n       Ethanol has a positive energy balance that is, the energy \n     content of ethanol is greater than the fossil energy used to \n     produce it--and this balance is constantly improving with new \n     technologies.\n       Over the last 20 years, the amount of energy needed to \n     produce ethanol from corn has significantly decreased because \n     of improved farming techniques, more efficient use of \n     fertilizers and pesticides, higher-yielding crops, and more \n     energy-efficient conversion technology.\n       Most studies that claim a negative energy balance for \n     ethanol fail to take into account the energy contained in the \n     co-products.\n       Myth: Rainforests will be destroyed to create the new \n     croplands required to meet food, feed, and biofuels needs, \n     thus accelerating climate change and destroying valuable \n     ecosystems.\n       Fact: Biofuels have the potential to significantly reduce \n     global GHG emissions associated with transportation, but--as \n     with all types of development--controls are needed to protect \n     ecologically important lands.\n       In Brazil and elsewhere, laws have already slowed \n     deforestation, and for the past decade China has converted \n     marginal croplands to grasslands and forests to control \n     erosion.\n       Links between U.S. ethanol production and land use changes \n     elsewhere are uncertain. We cannot simply assume that \n     increases in U.S. ethanol production will lead to increased \n     crop production abroad. In fact, since 2002, during the \n     greatest period of ethanol growth, U.S. corn exports \n     increased by 60% and exports of Distillers Dried Grains \n     (DDGs) also increased steadily. In part, improvements in U.S. \n     corn yield (about 1.6% annually since 1980) have enabled \n     simultaneous growth in corn and ethanol production.\n       Greenhouse gas emissions will decrease dramatically as \n     biofuels of the future are increasingly made from cellulosic \n     feedstocks and as the associated farming, harvesting, \n     transport, and production processes increasingly use clean, \n     renewable energy sources.\n       Myth: Ethanol-gasoline blends can lower, fuel economy and \n     may harm your engine.\n       Fact: Most ethanol blends in use today have little impact \n     on fuel economy or vehicle performance.\n       While ethanol delivers less energy than gasoline on a \n     gallon-for-gallon basis, today's vehicles are designed to run \n     on gasoline blended with small amounts of ethanol (10% or \n     less) with no perceptible effect on fuel economy.\n       Flex-fuel vehicles designed to run on higher ethanol blends \n     (E85 or 85% ethanol) do experience reduced miles per gallon, \n     but show a significant gain in horsepower.\n       As a high-octane fuel additive and substitute for MTBE, \n     ethanol enhances engine performance and adds oxygen to meet \n     requirements for reformulated gasoline.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

Without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Motion to Instruct\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I send a motion to the desk.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Hampshire. [Mr. Gregg] moves that the \n     conferees on the part of the Senate on the disagreeing votes \n     of the two Houses on the concurrent resolution S. Con. Res. \n     70 (the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year \n     2009) be instructed to reject the revenue levels in both the \n     Senate-passed and the House-passed budget resolutions, both \n     of which assume the largest tax increase in history, and \n     include revenue levels consistent with extension of the \n     tax.rates currently in place.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Hampshire is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, this motion to instruct is necessary \nbecause the budget, as it left the Senate and it is represented, has \nbeen agreed to between the House and Senate Democratic leadership and \nmembership, with no Republican input other than the courtesy of telling \nus what they have agreed to, has in it the largest tax increase in the \nhistory of the world--the history of the world, not just the history of \nthe United States. It is a $1.2 trillion tax increase. It means that \nall Americans' taxes will go up significantly as a result of this tax \nincrease. Mr. President, 7.8 million people today who do not pay taxes \nwill find that they are paying taxes. These are low- and moderate-\nincome Americans who are not liable to pay taxes because their income \nhas them in a level where there is no tax event, but under this budget \nresolution, which assumes the termination of the tax policies that were \nput in place in 2001 and 2003, those 7.8 million people will be \nreturned to the tax rolls and will have to pay taxes.\n  Families of four, earning $50,000--a husband, a wife and two \nchildren--in 2011, under this bill, would see their taxes go up $2,300. \nA single mom raising two kids--which is the toughest job in America, in \nmy opinion--earning $30,000 a year, that mother would see her taxes go \nup by $1,100. That is a lot of food, a lot of clothing, and a lot of \nbetter lifestyle that will be lost to that family.\n  A family of four earning $110,000 would see their taxes--that would \nbe, for example, a mother who is teaching or a father who is teaching \nand a mother who is a police officer, one making $50,000 and one \nmaking, say, $60,000--that family with two children could see their \ntaxes go up $4,300 under this bill.\n  Small businesses--which are defined by the Democratic Party as the \nrich, will pay more taxes. In fact right now in the House of \nRepresentatives they are debating a bill which they claim taxes the \nrich, which it turns out are small businesses who file as individuals--\n75 percent of all individual returns with income above $300,000 include \nbusiness income, and 83 percent of all individual returns with income \nabove $1 million include business income. They will be subject to the \nhigh-end tax which the Democratic Party is proposing in the House. \nMeanwhile, small businesses, who pay 54 percent of all individual \nincome taxes--those small businesses, 27 million in total, will see \ntheir tax bill go up by $4,100 under this budget resolution. That could \neasily put a lot of those small businesses out of business, that type \nof a tax hike. A lot of these businesses work at the margin. Even \nthough they may have high income, they are still spending a lot of that \nin order to maintain their business.\n  Elderly couples with incomes of $40,000, if the Democratic budget \ngoes forward, an elderly taxpayer, someone over 65 with $40,000 of \nincome, will see their taxes go up $2,200. That is a lot of money for \nsomebody who is probably on a fixed income and does not have too many \nways to increase their income and are trying to make fixed costs, which \nthey also cannot reduce. To be hit with a $2,200 tax bill in 2011 is a \npretty stiff penalty to pay so the party in power, the Democratic \nParty, can spend their money on some program they deem more appropriate \nthan allowing that individual to keep their money in their pocket. \nEighteen million seniors will see taxes go up under this bill as the \ntax policies of 2001 and 2003 are repealed and taxes are increased.\n  There was an argument made on the other side of the aisle that we are \nnot going to do that, we are going to collect this money from \nuncollected taxes. That argument has no viability any longer. They made \nthat argument last year, and the amount of money which was collected \nfrom uncollected taxes went up a minuscule amount, so that argument has \nno credibility. There is an argument made, primarily by Senator Obama \nin his campaign for the Presidency, that all these new programs and all \nthis cost will be paid for by taxing the wealthiest Americans--only the \nwealthiest Americans; that the other tax breaks will be left in place.\n  This budget does not assume that. This budget does not assume that at \nall. This budget assumes the full repeal of all the tax rates as they \nwere put in place in 2001 and 2003. In addition, it assumes the full \nrepeal of the capital gains rate, full repeal of the dividend rate--\nwhich, by the way, taxes on capital gains and dividends are paid \ndisproportionately by senior citizens. They are the ones who sell their \nhomes and end up with capital gains, they are the ones who have fixed \nincomes usually tied to dividends from their pensions.\n  So that argument that this proposal is just going to tax the \nwealthiest of Americans does not fly, on the basis of the language of \nthe Democratic budget. The Democratic budget says they are going to \nrepeal and raise, by $1.2 trillion, those taxes--taxes which all \nAmericans will have to pay.\n  Senator Obama says if he just taxes the wealthy, he can pay for all \nhis new spending programs. Those new spending programs total up to well \nover $300 billion a year. He has proposed over 185 new programs. If you \nscore just 143 of those programs he is proposing--his new or additional \nprograms--it totals $300 billion in new spending. That is on top of the \nnew spending already in this budget resolution. This budget radically \nexpands spending. It is well over $200 billion in new discretionary \nspending over the 5-year period of this budget and of course you put \nthe Obama ``spend-orama'' on top of that and you are up another $300 \nbillion. All of this is going to be paid for, allegedly, by just taxing \nthe wealthy.\n  You have to look at the language of the bill. That is not the way it \nis going to be paid for. As I outlined, it is going to be paid for by \ntaxing working Americans, elderly Americans, single moms with families \nand individuals who run small businesses.\n  In fact, if you took Senator Obama at face value, and what he is \nproposing, he is going to raise all of these taxes on the wealthy to \npay for his $300 billion of new spending and the $200 billion in this \nbill. The $300 billion figure is an annual number, by the way.\n  The maximum amount, if you were to return to the top rate in America, \nback to the rate during the Clinton years, which is what has been \nproposed by Senator Obama, the maximum amount that generates annually \nis $25 billion. The fact is, we will not get that much. These are \nwealthy people. They understand how to hire tax accountants and avoid \ntaxes when taxes become disproportionate, and they view them as \nsomething that should be avoided rather than paid.\n  The great advantage we have from the tax cuts which were put in place \nby President Bush and which caused this economy to expand and caused \nFederal revenues to grow in the most aggressive way in our recent \nhistory, was that tax laws have reached fair levels.\n  Take, for example, the capital gains tax which, under this bill, \nunder this\n\n[[Page S4249]]\n\nbudget, will be doubled. The capital gains tax today, because it is at \na reasonable rate, 15 percent, is generating huge increases in Federal \nrevenues.\n  In fact, CBO estimated when the capital gains rate went to 15 \npercent, it would generate about $100 billion less than what it has \nactually generated over the last 3 years. And why did we obtain an \nadditional $100 billion in tax revenue as a result of having a lower \ncapital gains rate? For two reasons: One, because the capital gains \nrate was fair so people were investing in activity that was taxable, \nand they were not trying to avoid taxes by investing in nontaxable \nactivity; and, two, because when you set a fair capital gains rate, \nwhat you do is incentivize people to go out, recognize their capital \ngains--in other words, sell the asset which they obtained gain in, and \nthen take that new money they have gotten and reinvest it in some other \nactivity which also generates capital gains.\n  Instead of having the capital gains event locked down, instead of \nhaving assets held simply because people do not want to pay taxes, and \nthose assets may be nonproductive assets, thus not having productive \nuse of those dollars, a reasonable capital gains rate, which is what we \nnow have in this country, causes people to go out and invest and act in \nthe most efficient way with the money they have.\n  As a result, not only do they generate more taxes to the Federal \nGovernment, $100 billion more than was estimated, but they also, at the \nsame time, create more jobs. Because those dollars are used more \nefficiently, there is more entrepreneurship, there is more risk taking, \nand more people are willing to go out and take the risks to create a \njob because they know they are going to have a chance to get an \nadequate return, and their efforts will not be taxed away.\n  But this budget rejects all of that. This budget rejects that whole \nconcept. It says: Let's go back to the period where we taxed people at \nextremely high rates. And why? Why do they tax people at extremely high \nrates? Is it to reduce the deficit? No, the deficit goes up \ndramatically under this bill.\n  Does it reduce the national debt? No, the national debt goes up \ndramatically under this bill. The reason they want your tax dollars is \nbecause they want to spend your tax dollars. There is a genuine \nphilosophy on the other side of the aisle that says they know how to \nspend your money better than you do. You, the working American, you, \nthe small business man or woman, you, the single mother, they know \nbetter how to spend your money than you know how to spend your money. \nThus, they want to raise your taxes in order to reprogram it in some \nsort of program that they deem to be of a better social purpose than \nallowing the person who earned that income to keep their money in their \npocket so they can make decisions which benefit them and their family \nwith those dollars.\n  That is the philosophical difference that divides us and could not be \nshown in a more stark way than in this budget as it left the Senate and \nwhich will be conferenced, because this budget repealed almost all the \nconstructive tax policy that was pro-growth oriented in the President's \nproposals of 2001 and 2003, and as a result it drives this massive \nincrease in the tax burden on the American people.\n  This is not a tax on the wealthy. This is a tax on the middle class \nbecause it is middle-class America who will have to pay for the $1.2 \ntrillion tax increase. To review the numbers, 7.8 million people who do \nnot pay taxes today will have to pay them under this bill; 27 million \npeople who run small businesses will see their taxes go up by $4,100; \n43 million working Americans who have children will see their taxes go \nup by $2,300; and senior citizens, 18 million senior citizens, will see \ntheir taxes go up by $2,200.\n  Obviously, we have a deep philosophical difference with the majority \non this point. And that is why we are suggesting an instruction which \nsays we should not proceed down the path of having the world's largest \ntax increase. Let's at least tell our conferees: Do not do that to the \nAmerican people. Keep the tax laws at a level that is fair and is \nresponsible.\n  By ``responsible'' I mean the tax laws, as they presently are \nstructured today, are returning more revenue to the Federal Government \nfrom our income tax than we have ever had in our history. And even as a \npercentage of the gross national product, they are returning more \nrevenues to the Federal Government than has been the historical \naverage. Mr. President, 18.7 percent of gross national product today is \nbeing collected in tax revenue. Historically, it was only 18.2 percent. \nSo these tax laws have not reduced Federal revenue, they have actually \nincreased Federal revenue, as I pointed out when I discussed the \ncapital gains rates.\n  We should not be putting in place a tax burden on working Americans \nwhich is going to be counter to the idea of creating jobs, creating \neconomic incentives, and giving and allowing people to keep in their \npockets money which they have earned and which they know better how to \nspend than we as a government know how to spend.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time. I look forward to continuing this \ndiscussion as we proceed through the afternoon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill.) The Senator from North \nDakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I have enjoyed listening to my \ncolleagues describe this budget resolution. But it has nothing \nwhatsoever to do with the budget resolution we have produced. It is a \nwonderful speech. It is the same speech they give every year no matter \nwhat the budget resolution says. But it absolutely has no attachment to \nwhat we have presented.\n  I hear this talk about the biggest tax increase ever in the world \nhistory. He said the same thing last year. And you know what happened. \nWe have cut taxes. In fact, I have that chart too. It is very \ninteresting because he gave precisely the same speech last year. It may \nhave been exactly the same speech.\n  And what has happened with this Democratic-controlled Congress? Well, \nhere are the tax cuts we have enacted, $194 billion. After they said we \nwere going to have the biggest tax increase in the history of the world \nlast year, we have cut taxes by $194 billion, with $7 billion of \nrevenue raised through loophole closers that have been enacted, \nloophole closers that, frankly, many of them supported to advance the \nlegislation that was important to us all. But that is the record.\n  After the speech, the identical speech, virtually the identical \nspeech he gave last year, that we were going to have the biggest tax \nincrease in the history of the world--what is the record? We have cut \ntaxes by $194 billion, overwhelmingly on the middle class.\n  Now, let's look at this budget resolution. The green line is the \nrevenue that is in our resolution. The red line is the President's. \nThat is a very small difference, as you can see, a very small \ndifference between the two. In fact, here is the difference: $15.6 \ntrillion of revenue in our resolution, $15.2 trillion of revenue in the \nPresident's proposed budget. That is a difference of 2.6 percent. So I \ndo not know what he is talking about when he is talking about the \nbiggest tax increase in the history of the world. That has nothing \nwhatever to do with our resolution.\n  In fact, our resolution has substantial tax relief. The Baucus \namendment adopted on the Senate floor with bipartisan support extended \nthe middle-class tax relief by providing for marriage penalty relief, \nby providing for extension of the child tax credit, by extending the \n10-percent bracket.\n  We also provided alternative minimum tax relief to prevent 26 million \npeople from being caught up in the alternative minimum tax, almost an \neightfold increase from the number affected now. We have taken \neffective action to prevent that from happening. We have estate tax \nreform that will provide that only two-tenths of 1 percent of estates \nwill face any taxes.\n  We provide for energy and education tax cuts. We provide for property \ntax relief, and we provide for extension of the popular tax extenders. \nAll of that is done in this bill. Now, there is a difference in \nrevenue, as I indicated, a very modest 2.6 percent between what is in \nour budget resolution and what the President called for.\n  Well, where are we going to get that revenue if we are not going to \nhave a tax increase? Well, the first thing we do is go after the tax \ngap which is now estimated at $345 billion a year. That is the \ndifference between what is paid and what is owed, $345 billion a year.\n\n[[Page S4250]]\n\n  If we got 20 percent of that amount alone we could meet our numbers \nwith no tax increase. But that is not the only place we can look \nbecause, as I have shown before on the floor of the Senate, this \nbuilding down in the Cayman Islands called Ugland House, this little \nmodest, five-story building is the home to 12,748 companies.\n  Now, I have said this is the most efficient building in the world. \nThink of that. That little building down in the Cayman Islands, and \n12,748 companies claim they are doing business out of that little \nbuilding. Of course, the only business they are doing in this building \nis monkey business because what they are doing is claiming they are \ndoing business there in order to engage in tax avoidance. That is the \nbusiness they are engaged in in Ugland House.\n  Now, if anybody doubts it, here is a recent story from the Boston \nGlobe from March 6 of this year: Shell companies in Cayman Islands \nallow Kellogg, Brown and Root to avoid Medicare and Social Security \ntaxes in the United States. What they have done down there this is the \nNation's top Iraq war contractor until last year, a subsidiary of \nHalliburton, is to avoid paying hundreds of millions of dollars in \nFederal Medicare and Social Security taxes by hiring workers through \nshell companies based in this tropical tax haven.\n  Now, what we are saying is, let's shut down this kind of scam. How \nmuch is there? Well, the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations said \nthere is $100 billion a year that is being lost to the U.S. Treasury in \ntax scams being run in these offshore tax evasion schemes. So if you \nhave $345 billion a year in the tax gap, money that is owed that is not \nbeing paid, and the vast majority of us pay what we owe, it is \noutrageous that some are getting away without paying what they owe. And \nour argument on our side is that we ought to go after those folks who \nare not paying what they owe and are cheating all the rest of us.\n  On our side we say: Let's shut down these offshore tax havens that \nare costing us another $100 billion a year, these tax scams that are \ncheating all of the rest of us. You add those two together, that is \n$445 billion a year.\n  Again, now we need less than 20 percent of that in order to \ncompletely close this revenue gap.\n  But it doesn't end there, because I have shown this chart on the \nfloor of the Senate too. This is a picture of a sewer system in Europe. \nWhat does a sewer system have to do with the budget of the United \nStates? We have companies in America buying European sewer systems to \nwrite them off on their books to reduce their taxes here. Then they \nlease the sewer systems back to the European cities that built them in \nthe first place. Is that unbelievable? Our friends on the other side \ndon't want to do anything about that. They don't want to shut that \ndown. They think that is OK. We don't. We think that should be shut \ndown. This is another tens of billions of dollars a year in these types \nof tax scams.\n  We have things we have done to try to shut down some of these \noperations. We have put these in bills that the President has \nthreatened to veto. This is almost hard to believe, but this is what \nhas been going on. We proposed shutting down these scams. One of the \nthings we propose is codifying economic substance, prohibiting \ntransactions with no economic rationale done solely to evade taxes. We \nproposed shutting down schemes to lease foreign subway and sewer \nsystems and depreciate their assets on the books of the United States \nto avoid taxes here. We have proposed ending deferral of offshore \ncompensation by hedge fund managers trying to avoid taxation in this \ncountry. One of those people, by the way, earned over $1 billion last \nyear alone. And there is not just one; there are many of them who \nearned over a billion dollars a year last year. Then they cook up a \nscheme where they move their money offshore to avoid paying taxes in \nthis country and stick all the rest of us with the bill. We have said \nno, let's shut that down. The President has threatened to veto that.\n  We have talked about expanding broker information reporting to \nprevent this evasion and taxing people who leave this country and give \nup their citizenship to evade taxes they owe here. As unbelievable as \nit may sound, we have people who give up their U.S. citizenship, go to \none of these tax havens and say: We don't owe any taxes in America \nbecause we don't live there anymore. We are no longer a citizen of that \ncountry. We are now down in the Cayman Islands or another one of these \ntax havens.\n  In fact, I went on the Internet. It is amazing to go on, put in \n``offshore tax havens.'' Punch that in and then do a search. You will \nget over 1 million hits. One of my favorites is ``live offshore in a \nluxury yacht, never pay taxes again.'' This is the kind of scam that is \ngoing on. We say shut it down. If we only got back 15 percent of the \nmoney in the tax gap--not 50 percent, 15 percent--if we got back 15 \npercent of this tax gap, of these abusive tax shelters, we could meet \nour numbers with no tax increase. Remember, in our resolution, we have \nhundreds of billions of dollars of tax reduction on middle-income \npeople, because we have extended all the middle-class tax cuts. That is \nwhat this resolution does. The other side doesn't want to do that. What \nthey want to do is make sure to protect the wealthiest among us. They \nwant to protect those who are engaged in these scams. I don't know why \nthey want to. I don't get it. But that, apparently, is their position. \nThey are going to have to defend it.\n  As I have indicated, there is no assumed tax increase in this budget \nresolution--none. There are substantial tax reductions, hundreds of \nbillions of tax reductions.\n  I will end as I began. Last year the Senator on the opposing side \ngave the same speech, that our budget resolution had the biggest tax \nincreases in the history of the world. Here is the record. Now we can \nlook back and we can see what happened. Did Democrats increase taxes? \nNo. Democrats cut taxes by $194 billion. In fact, people all across the \ncountry are getting checks from the Federal Government right now that \nrepresent those tax reductions enacted and, by the way, enacted on a \nbipartisan basis. The President signed the bill. So people know they \ngot a tax reduction from Democrats when we have been in control of \nCongress this year, because they are getting the checks in the mailbox \nright now.\n  After the Senator asserted last year we were going to have the \nbiggest tax increase in the history of the world, it didn't happen. \nThere wasn't any tax increase. Instead, there were tax reductions.\n  There is no tax increase in this budget resolution either. None. None \nis assumed. We don't need any to meet the revenue numbers which are \nonly 2.6 percent more than the President's revenue numbers. In fact, we \nhave substantial middle-class tax relief. The middle-class tax relief \nthat is in this package is right here. We extend the middle-class tax \nprovisions that provide marriage penalty relief. We extend the \nimportant child tax credit. We extend the 10-percent bracket that \nprovides such good relief to middle-income people. We have provided for \nrelief from the alternative minimum tax. We have provided for estate \ntax reform. We have provided energy and education tax cuts, property \ntax relief, and the popular tax extenders. All of that tax relief is in \nthis package.\n  I hope our colleagues will reject the assertion that is in the \nSenator's motion because it bears absolutely no relationship to the \nbudget resolution before us.\n  I yield the floor, suggest the absence of a quorum, and ask unanimous \nconsent that the time be charged equally.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, 2 years ago, Democrats campaigned on \ntax relief for middle-class families. They called for fiscal restraint \nand lowering the national debt. But as we have seen over the last year, \nour good friends are more concerned with increasing taxation, \nincreasing regulation, and increasing litigation. The budget they \nunveiled this year is the latest example.\n  If we were to follow this budget, it would go a long way toward \nturning us into a country like France, at a time when even the French, \nas we all know,\n\n[[Page S4251]]\n\nare trying to pull back and trying to get out of the ditch into which \nthey have put themselves.\n  This budget lifts the curtain on what they have in store for \nAmerica's already overburdened taxpayers. Instead of lowering taxes on \nAmerica's working families and small businesses, this budget contains \nthe largest tax hike in U.S. history.\n  It is not just the rich who would see their tax bills increase by an \naverage of $2,300 a year; it is taxpayers making as little as $31,850, \nand couples earning $63,700. These are families the Democrats are \ncalling rich and on whom they want to raise taxes.\n  Under this budget, every American would see his or her share of the \nnational debt rise by $6,440 as a result of dramatically higher \nspending requests.\n  At a time when American families are tightening their belts and \nchecking their own spending habits, Washington should be doing the \nsame. Yet they are proposing the opposite. At a time of serious \neconomic concern, they want to grow the Federal budget to over $1 \ntrillion in nonemergency spending.\n  We have heard a lot of talk over the last few months from the other \nside about how middle-class families are struggling to make ends meet. \nWe even worked together to pass a stimulus package that puts money back \nin the wallets of middle-class families. But now our good friends on \nthe other side want to take that money back--and then some--to fund \ntheir irresponsible spending hikes.\n  Let's be clear about what this budget is: It is the Democrats' way of \nsaying yes to the failed tax-and-spend policies of the past. American \nfamilies cannot afford this budget, American job creators cannot afford \nthis budget, and neither can our economy.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Well, Madam President, it is the same song, second verse. \nAgain, it is words. It is no wonder our friends on the other side have \nlost three congressional elections in a row because they keep chanting \nthe same mantra that has no relationship to reality. These are the \nexact same speeches they gave last year: biggest tax increase in the \nhistory of the world.\n  Now we can come and we can check the record. We do not have to guess; \nwe do not have to suppose; we do not have to engage in make-believe. We \ncan look at the record. Here it is: Democrats lowered taxes by $194 \nbillion. If you are listening, you do not have to wonder if that is \ntrue. All you have to do is go to your mailbox because all across \nAmerica people are getting checks from the United States that represent \nthe tax cuts Democrats in Congress passed. So this is not a question; \nthis is a matter of fact. Democrats cut taxes $194 billion. Those are \nnot my numbers. Those are the numbers from the Congressional Budget \nOffice.\n  All of this talk about big tax increases is just talk. It has no \nrelationship to this budget and no relationship to last year's budget. \nIt has no relationship to this year's budget.\n  I present the factual record. It is as clear as it can be. We lowered \ntaxes $194 billion in the year under the budget resolution we passed \nlast year.\n  With that, Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask unanimous consent that the \ntime be charged equally.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Klobuchar). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I now suggest we yield back the time \nremaining on this motion and that we turn to the motion to instruct by \nSenator Kyl. So I ask unanimous consent to yield back all time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I will not object. So let's go forward \nwith that, and then I will seek recognition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I ask that we enter into a unanimous \nconsent agreement on the Kyl motion--there will also be a side by \nside--that we do an hour on the two, equally divided.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, to my knowledge we have not seen the side \nby side.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Oh, they are typing up the comprehensive agreement. So \nshall we----\n  Mr. GREGG. Why don't we proceed with Senator Kyl, and after we see \nyour side by side, we can talk about time agreements because we already \nhave an hour.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Let's proceed on the basis that we will make a good-faith \nattempt that we try to do this in an hour. Is that OK?\n  Mr. GREGG. That is fine with me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Thank you, Madam President. I am going to take a couple of \nminutes to lay this motion down and then leave the floor. I will come \nback. Senator Grassley will be here in about a half an hour. I know he \nwants to speak to this motion. So the total time consumed should not be \nmore than that, but exactly when we will do the time I am not precisely \nsure.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, if I can say, maybe we can work things \nout. We will try to be flexible and work in people as they come. We \nwill do our best effort to get it done in an hour.\n\n\n                           Motion To Instruct\n\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I have a motion at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. Kyl] moves that the conferees \n     on the part of the Senate on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the concurrent resolution S. Con. Res. 70 \n     (the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year \n     2009) be instructed to reject the House amendment that \n     assumes $110 billion in tax increases as a result of \n     having to offset the extension of tax policies that \n     expired at the end of 2007 and will expire at the end of \n     2008 (including the AMT patch, the research and \n     experimentation tax credit, the State and local sales tax \n     deduction, the combat pay earned income tax credit, \n     education tax credits, and the alternative energy tax \n     credits) and insist that the final conference report \n     include in the recommended levels and amounts in Title I \n     reductions in revenues commensurate with extending these \n     tax policies without offsetting tax increases.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, let me simply describe in about 90 seconds \nwhat this motion does, and then I will come back and make the \npresentation for it in a moment. This motion would instruct the House \nand Senate budget conferees to assume a 1-year extension of the \nalternative minimum tax so-called patch, in other words, that the \nfilers who have not had to pay that would not have to pay it in the \nfuture for another year.\n  Also, it assumes an extension of the tax extenders, as we call them. \nThose are the provisions of the Tax Code that have already expired, \nthings such as the R tax credit; plus those that expire at the end of \nthis year, things such as the various energy tax credits; and some \ninternational tax credits that have always been the subject of our \nextender policy.\n  These tax extenders and the AMT, alternative minimum tax, fix would \nnot have to be offset by raising taxes on others. That is the key point \nof this motion, that we extend the relief we have given to filers--\nabout 26 million filers this year--from the alternative minimum tax, \nand extend the various so-called tax extender provisions that are \ntraditionally extended here, and that in neither case would we be \nraising taxes in order to pay for them.\n  Madam President, I will reserve discussing this further until some of \nthe other speakers are here to make the motion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I will offer a side-by-side amendment \nthat seeks to achieve the same goal. This is one place where we have an \nagreement. None of us want to see the alternative minimum tax imposed \non the American people. That would involve 26 million people, up from \n4.2 million now. All of us want the so-called tax extenders to be \nextended. It would involve the research and development tax credit and \nothers.\n  We would add this additional caveat: We ask that every effort be made \nto\n\n[[Page S4252]]\n\noffset the cost of these policies by closing the tax gap, shutting down \nabusive tax shelters, and addressing these offshore tax havens that are \nturning out to be so abusive. We think that is better policy.\n  We absolutely agree that the alternative minimum tax should not be \nexpanded. We absolutely agree that the so-called tax extenders, such \nthings as the research and experimentation tax credit, the deduction \nfor State and local taxes, the deduction for classroom expenses, the \ndeduction for qualified education expenses, the incentive for the \ncharitable IRA rollover, the combat pay earned-income tax credit, and \nvarious energy tax incentives, be extended. But we believe that rather \nthan just putting that on the charge card and adding to the debt--\nmeaning that we go out with a tin cup and borrow more money from the \nChinese and the Japanese--we pay for it by going after these abusive \ntax shelters, going after these tax scams, these offshore tax havens, \nand do it without raising taxes. So I hope my colleagues will support \nthat as a general principle and an instruction to the conference \ncommittee.\n  With that, I note the absence of a quorum and ask unanimous consent \nthat the time be charged equally.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The journal clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I am going to extend my remarks.\n  I think many people in the country hear the phrase ``AMT'' and they \nwonder: What is that? It is the alternative minimum tax. It was \nestablished decades ago because they found there were people making \n$200,000 a year who weren't paying any taxes. To address that, they \ncreated the so-called alternative minimum tax.\n  The problem with it is that it was never indexed for inflation. The \nresult is that now, instead of affecting just a few people, it is \naffecting millions of people. In fact, the estimates are that if we \ndon't do anything about this, it will increase from 4 million people in \n2007 to 26 million people in 2008.\n  In this budget resolution we say: No, no, don't let that happen. \nDon't increase taxes on 26 million American families. Don't do that.\n  In this instruction to the conferees, we say: Yes, absolutely, don't \nallow the alternative minimum tax to grow like a cancer. Instead, let's \ntake care of that. Let's remove it as an option, and let's try to pay \nfor it by closing down these abusive tax shelters, these offshore tax \nhavens, and closing the tax gap.\n  Our friends on the other side have a different approach. They just \nwant to put it on the charge card. The problem with that is if you \neliminate the alternative minimum tax without paying for it, it adds \n$1.7 trillion to the debt. That is trillion with a ``t.'' Where do we \nget the money? Well, we borrow it.\n  We have been doing a lot of borrowing under this President. This is \nhis record. He is building a wall of debt that is almost unprecedented \nin the history of the finances of this country. When he came in at the \nend of his first year, the debt was $5.8 trillion. At the end of his \ntenure, it will be $10.4 trillion. In the 8 years he is responsible \nfor, the debt will have risen to $10.4 trillion. In fact, he will have \nnearly doubled the debt of the country.\n  More alarming is where we are getting it from because increasingly we \nare getting this money by borrowing from Japan and China. We even owe \nKorea money. This chart shows it. This chart shows that it took 42 \nPresidents 224 years to run up $1 trillion of U.S. debt held abroad; $1 \ntrillion of foreign-held debt--foreign-held U.S. debt. It took 224 \nyears to run up $1 trillion of foreign-held debt and all these \nPresidents, 42 of them. This President tops them all. He increased \nforeign holdings of our debt by $1.51 trillion so far, and counting. He \nhas dug a very deep hole.\n  We have proposed a series of reforms.\n  I held up just moments ago a picture of a French sewer system and \nasked the question: What does this have to do with the U.S. budget? \nWell, it turns out it has quite a bit to do with the U.S. budget \nbecause we now find companies in this country--wealthy individuals \nbuying European sewer systems, not because they are in the sewer \nbusiness but because they want to avoid taxes in this country. How do \nthe two have any relationship? Well, here is how it works: They buy a \nEuropean sewer system, they put it on their books here, they depreciate \nit for tax purposes here, reducing their tax bill, and they lease the \nsewer system back to the European cities that built them in the first \nplace. What a scam.\n  I just held up a picture of this little five-story building. Here it \nis. This little building down in the Cayman Islands is home to 12,748 \ncompanies. What a remarkable building this is. That little five-story \nbuilding is supposedly the corporate headquarters of 12,748 companies. \nNow, are they all really doing business out of that little building \ndown in the Cayman Islands? No, of course not. They are not doing \nbusiness down there. They have a postal drop down there in order to \nclaim that it is their headquarters for tax purposes. Why would they do \nthat? Because the Cayman Islands doesn't have any taxes. So what they \ndo is they have a subsidiary of this company that sells to another \nsubsidiary that is wholly owned, and they sell at cost to subsidiary \nNo. 2. Then they sell from subsidiary No. 2 to subsidiary No. 3 that is \ndown in the Cayman Islands. They sell to them at cost. Then the \nsubsidiary in the Cayman Islands sells to another subsidiary over in \nGermany or France and shows a big profit in the Cayman Islands where \nthere are no taxes. That is an outrage. The vast majority of us pay \nwhat we owe. We have some who don't, and they are getting away with it \nwith these scams. We say shut it down.\n\n  Let's not go borrow more from China and Japan and dig the hole deeper \nthe way the President wants us to do. That is what our budget \nresolution says. That is what my amendment says. Yes, absolutely, don't \nlet the alternative minimum tax be expanded from 4.2 million people in \nthis country to 26 million. Don't let that happen. Yes, extend the \nresearch and experimentation credit. Yes, extend the sales tax \ndeduction. Yes, provide for these other important tax incentives, \nespecially the energy tax incentives. But instead of borrowing the \nmoney, instead of just going back hat in hand to China and Japan and \nasking them for more money, let's shut down these offshore tax havens, \nthese abusive tax shelters and this tax gap where we have people who \nowe money but aren't paying it. Let's go after them instead of going \nover to China and being dependent on the kindness of strangers to \nfinance our country.\n  We are headed for a cliff here because under this administration the \ndebt has skyrocketed before the baby boomers ever retire. I have shown \nthe chart that shows what has happened to the debt. The debt has gone \nup like a scalded cat.\n  Here is what has happened to the debt under this President and these \npolicies: up, up, and away. He has nearly doubled the federal debt. He \nhas more than doubled the foreign holdings of our debt. In fact, the \nincrease in foreign-held debt under this President is now 150 percent \nof the amount accumulated by all previous Presidents combined over 224 \nyears. As a result, we now owe the Chinese hundreds of billions of \ndollars. We owe the Japanese even more. We even owe Korea now over $40 \nbillion. Enough is enough. Enough is enough. Let's quit digging the \nhole deeper. Yes, absolutely, let's provide middle-class tax relief. \nThat is in this budget.\n  As I have said before, with all the talk from the other side about \nthe biggest tax increase in the history of the world, here is the \nrecord. Democrats had been in charge for 1 year and we have provided \n$194 billion of tax relief, and you don't have to wonder if that is \ntrue. Just go home and check your mailbox. You are receiving a check \npassed by this Congress, signed by the President--a stimulus package--\nwith $150 billion in that package alone. But we have taken other steps \nto provide other tax relief as well, including not allowing, last year, \nthe alternative minimum tax to be expanded, and we are not going to let \nthe alternative minimum tax be expanded this year either. That is a \nfact. That is the record. It is not rhetoric, it is a fact.\n\n[[Page S4253]]\n\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Perhaps, I would ask the ranking member, could we just \nagree that whenever we go into a quorum call, we equally divide the \ntime?\n  Mr. GREGG. Yes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I ask unanimous consent that we adopt that as a rule, \nthat any time we go into a quorum call, we equally divide the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I would ask the Senator from South Carolina, would it be \nacceptable--I understand it is with Senator Boxer who has a matching \nmotion to yours--to have 30 minutes equally divided?\n  Mr. DeMINT. Yes.\n  Mr. GREGG. On both motions?\n  Mr. DeMINT. I just have one. Thirty minutes equally divided?\n  Mr. CONRAD. On the two.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Yes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. That would help very much. I appreciate the Senator's \ncourtesy.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that we have 30 minutes \nequally divided on the DeMint and the Boxer motions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n\n\n                           Motion to Instruct\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Madam President, I send a motion to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Carolina [Mr. DeMint] moves that the \n     conferees on the part of the Senate on the disagreeing \n     votes of the two Houses on the concurrent resolution S. \n     Con. Res. 70 (the concurrent resolution on the budget for \n     fiscal year 2009) be instructed to insist that if the \n     final conference report includes section 304 of S. Con. \n     Res. 70, the deficit neutral reserve fund to invest in \n     clean energy, preserve the environment and provide for \n     certain settlements, as passed by the Senate, that such \n     section shall include an additional requirement that \n     legislation providing for new mandates on greenhouse gas \n     emissions that would harm the United States economy or \n     result in a loss of jobs should not be enacted unless \n     similar mandates are enacted by China and India.\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Madam President, I want to take a few moments to explain \nthis motion. I hope we can all agree on it. If there is one thing that \nwe hear from both sides when we are talking about trade around the \nworld, and trade agreements, it is there needs to be a level playing \nfield; that trade needs to be fair; that the terms should be the same \non both sides.\n  This motion to instruct the conferees addresses that one issue. It \nwould prevent Congress from passing any law with new mandates on \ngreenhouse gas emissions that would harm the U.S. economy or result in \njob loss unless both China and India had the same mandates--in other \nwords, if we had a level playing field. It is not going to help the \nenvironment in the United States or the world if we pass mandates that \nraise the cost of doing business in our country, particularly those \ncompanies that are energy intensive, especially manufacturing, if we \ncreate mandates that do not exist in India or China. Our companies will \nsimply relocate to other countries, taking American jobs with them.\n  The point of this motion is to put in front of all of the conferees \nthe idea that it is important for us to reduce greenhouse emissions, to \nreduce CO2 emissions all over the world. But it is also \nimportant for us to keep in mind that if we do something that is \nisolated to the United States, that hurts our economy and costs us \njobs. It makes no sense if we don't require the major industrial \ncountries, such as China and India, to do the same.\n  So we have seen over the last 15 years that CO2 emissions \nin the United States have actually grown less than the economy has \ngrown. So our productivity is increasing, and our use per capita, as \nfar as CO2, is actually declining. We see at the same time a \n100-percent increase in emissions from China and India. Anybody who \nwatched the prelude to the Olympics in China can see the results of \nthat in the air.\n  So I ask my colleagues--particularly the conferees--to support the \nidea that we will not do anything that puts new emissions standards on \nour companies in this country, if we know it is going to hurt the \neconomy or jobs, and that we need to insist the same standards apply in \nChina and India.\n  With that, I will yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I rise to speak against the DeMint \nmotion and in favor of the Boxer motion, which takes on the issue of \nglobal warming in a way that is consistent with the information and the \nfacts that we have today.\n  The DeMint motion is a throwback to 10, 11 years ago when everybody \naround here, including myself, was saying we better watch out and not \ndo anything about global warming until the undeveloped world acts. We \nbetter sit back and do nothing. You know what. We cannot do that \nanymore. This is a time of change. This is a time where we have to \nchallenge the status quo. This is a time when we need to stand up as \nthe leading country in the world and say that we can fight global \nwarming, and we can win this fight. As a matter of fact, if we approach \nit with hope, not fear, we are going to create tens of thousands, \nhundreds of thousands of new jobs. We are going to get our people off \nof fossil fuel, not having to worry about gas prices anymore, and we \nwill create new technologies that will spur us on to an economic \nrenaissance.\n  But what happens with the DeMint motion, he gives China and India a \nveto power over what we should be doing. Imagine sitting back and \nsaying we are not going to do anything about human rights until China \nacts. We are not going to do anything about a better educational system \nuntil India acts.\n  Why would we give up our chance to take the mantle of leadership and \nfinally grab hold of this issue, and do it in a way that makes us quite \nstrong in the global marketplace? So when you look at the DeMint \nmotion, it is very similar to what passed in the last century, if you \nwill, more than 10 years ago. That is why I think my friend's party is \nin so much trouble--because they fight against change, they fight for \nthe status quo, they fear change, and this is a time of change.\n  I didn't ask for this moment during the budget debate. I don't think \nthis is the right place to debate a cap-and-trade system because we \nwill be tackling this subject matter soon enough. It is not going to be \neasy. Change isn't easy. But this is positive change, where America \nsays we will lead. We know from the Pentagon, and we know from our \nintelligence officials that if we do nothing, we become less secure in \nthe world because global warming, we know, will have an impact on \ndrought, floods, cyclones--all of the things we are already seeing--if \nwe do nothing because we have given over our chance to act to India and \nChina, and our people will suffer.\n  Yesterday, the Bush administration declared that the polar bear is a \nthreatened species because the polar bears' habitat is shrinking away. \nThe permafrost and the ice that the polar bear stands on to hunt is \nliterally melting out from under them. Now, for the Bush administration \nto declare that is extraordinary. They said it is because of global \nwarming, and that in 30, 40 years we will not have any more polar \nbears. That is one example.\n  Scientists tell us 50 percent of God's species could be gone. For \nthose of us who happen to believe there is a spirituality to this \nworld--and I do--it is\n\n[[Page S4254]]\n\nour destiny to save the planet. It is not our destiny to support the \nDeMint motion, which leaves it up to China and India.\n  We have a better way. We say in our substitute that no legislation \nshould pass mandates on greenhouse gas emissions until it effectively \naddresses imports from China and India and other nations that have no \nsimilar emissions programs. We agree that no bill should pass unless it \naddresses the imports from these nations. So that is our alternative--\nnot to say stop the world, I want to get off; not to say that America \nwill be missing in action in the biggest domestic challenge of our \ntime, but to grab hold of that challenge and make sure we do it in a \nway that is fair to our industry, fair to our workers, fair to our \nconsumers, fair to our manufacturers. And when those imports come in at \nour ports, if those countries seeking entry into our country do not \nhave equivalent programs, then they will have to get the allowances at \nthe border in order to bring those goods into the country.\n  That is the way we are going to handle this problem. So, once again, \nI say to my colleagues, we are going to have a debate on global warming \nvery soon, thanks to Senator Reid putting it on the schedule for June \n2.\n  When we are told by the leading scientists of the world that if \nglobal warming is left unchecked, our planet will become inhospitable \nto us as human beings, to our children, to our grandchildren, and that \nthere will be vectors around that we cannot combat, there will be \namoebas in our water, bacteria that have never been there before; there \nwill be storms, cyclones, droughts, and floods--extreme weather \nconditions; when we see that the habitat for beautiful animals--God's \ncreatures, such as the polar bear--is already being impacted now as we \nspeak, for us to say we will do nothing until China acts--I don't want \nChina dictating what I do in this country. I don't want India dictating \nwhat I do in this country. I want to make sure that we handle this \nissue right and that we are not disadvantaged because they may not act. \nThat is what our alternative does.\n  I hope we will have a good vote on that alternative and reject the \nstatus quo--the throwback position of Senator DeMint.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Madam President, I appreciate the comments by my \ncolleague from California. Certainly, it should be our highest priority \nas a nation to continue to remove CO2 emissions throughout \nour country. We don't need to wait for any other country to act, only \nour own.\n  We do need to recognize that if we put such a burden on our \nindustries in America, they will move production to China, and they \nwill do their polluting somewhere else rather than here. If that is \nwhat our legislation does, then we do nothing for the environment, and \nthe only thing we do for our country is send jobs overseas. We need to \nbe smarter in how we deal with this matter.\n  The side-by-side motion by my colleague from California would add \ninsult to injury. She wants to leave us open to lose jobs in America by \nputting mandates on our companies that hurt our economy and cost us \njobs. Then she wants to add taxes on products that are coming from \nother countries that don't abide by our mandates so that products cost \nmore for the people who live here, many of whom would not have jobs.\n  We cannot solve our environmental problems with this kind of \nconvoluted logic. The motion I have put forward simply says if--and \nonly if--a mandate is known to hurt our economy and costs our jobs, \nthen we need to figure out a different way to deal with it than to put \na mandate on a U.S. company in competition with businesses that don't \nhave the same mandate in other countries we trade with.\n  It is only common sense, and it doesn't make sense, again, to send \njobs overseas and then try to add taxes to products that we buy from \naround the world. I encourage my colleagues to think this through. Let \nme provide a few more facts about what we are trying to do.\n  We need to work to reduce greenhouse gases, and there are many things \nwe can do that do not hurt our economy and don't drive jobs out of our \ncountry. In fact, if we look at it closely, good economics is usually \ngood for the environment. We see that if we move with all compassion \nbut just knee-jerk reactions, we end up with programs, such as an \nethanol mandate, that do not help the environment, raise the price of \nfood, and hurt people all over the world. I am afraid that same type of \nthinking is going on right now.\n  It is a laudable goal, one with which I agree, that we should \ncontinue to work in all reasonable ways to reduce CO2 \nemissions in our country.\n  One recent study from the University of California found that China \npassed the United States in carbon emissions in 2006 and is now the \nlargest pollution-producing country in the world. This has just been in \na few short years, and they are growing much faster than we are.\n  We do need to keep in mind that carbon in the air that comes from \nChina does as much to hurt the worldwide environment, if, in fact, it \ndoes affect global warming--it doesn't matter if it is coming from the \nUnited States or China. If we ignore what other countries are doing, we \ndo it at our own peril.\n  My motion is very similar to bipartisan agreements that we had in the \nCongress when discussing the Kyoto agreement. It makes no sense to bind \nour own companies with expensive mandates if we do not have cooperation \nfrom countries in other parts of the world. We simply move our \nproduction and our jobs somewhere else. So we need to be logical about \nit.\n  I mentioned before, according to a World Bank study, both China and \nIndia have increased CO2 emissions by nearly 100 percent \nfrom 1990 to 2004, while the United States emissions in that same \nperiod only increased by 25 percent, which is less than the growth of \nour economy during that period.\n  This emissions scheme we have talked about would export American \nmanufacturing jobs to China and India. With the solution that is being \npresented by my colleague from California, she is basically saying: OK, \nlet's hurt the economy and lose jobs in this country, but we can make \nup for it by raising prices of goods that come to us from China and \nIndia. That is not going to help anyone in this country, and it is not \ngoing to do anything to reduce emissions in the world. It is playing \nmusical chairs with American jobs and basically encouraging the \nenvironment to be spoiled in other parts of the world.\n  In order to truly address greenhouse gas emissions, it is imperative \nthat China, India, and other countries that are emitting need to work \ntogether. So if we take this on simply as one country, we will hurt \nourselves, we would not help the environment and we will send jobs \noverseas and actually encourage pollution, magnified, in effect, by not \nacting in a way that tries to seek cooperation around the world.\n  I certainly encourage my colleagues to respond to the need to reduce \nCO2 emissions and to look at ways we are doing it already \nthat actually create jobs and don't take them from our country. But \nlet's not solve the problem by making it worse and shipping our jobs \nand pollution overseas and expect to do any good with our legislation.\n  Madam President, I reserve the remainder of my time and yield the \nfloor.\n  Mrs. BOXER. How much time remains on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California has 5 minutes 57 \nseconds. The Senator from South Carolina has 6 minutes 51 seconds.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, will you let me know when I have used up \n5 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will so advise.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I say to my colleagues that Senator \nDeMint's motion is a back-to-the-future position. Again, it is why his \nparty is in so much trouble. It is not looking ahead with hope; it is \nlooking ahead with fear. It is giving veto power to countries that we \nshould not be following. We should not be following the environmental \npolicies of China. You can barely breathe over there. Yet they are \ngoing to have the same until they decide to act and we sit here and do \nnothing about one of the greatest challenges to face our generation.\n\n[[Page S4255]]\n\n  I cannot look into the eyes of my grandchildren and tell them: Sorry, \nI am giving over my proxy to China, I am giving over my proxy to India, \nand I can't do anything about it.\n  I don't know exactly what my colleague is talking about. He is \ntelling me what I support, and he has no right to do that. He has no \nright to say I support higher taxes on consumers because I don't. He \nhas no right to say I want to give away jobs. I have more support from \nworking men and women in my State than probably almost anyone in this \nbody. I take second to none in that category of fighting for the \nenvironment and fighting for jobs.\n  Actually, if my friend knew a little bit more about what we are \ntalking about, he would understand that the bill we are going to come \nup with has one of the biggest tax cuts in history in it--let me repeat \nthat, one of the biggest tax cuts in history in it--which is going to \nease the pain and ease the burden on consumers and on our people and \nhelp them pay for high prices of gasoline.\n  My bill has cuts in carbon of 2 percent a year that we think is \ndoable, and our bill is deficit neutral. It is, as my friend should \nknow, a very bipartisan bill--Boxer, a Democrat; Lieberman, an \nIndependent; Warner, a Republican, and it has bipartisan support.\n  For someone to stand up and say the purpose of that bill is to hurt \nconsumers, hurt America, hurt jobs, then they have not read the bill or \nthey are giving a political speech. You can put lipstick on a pig, but \nit is still a pig.\n  I look at my friend's motion as a sad one. It is a position of \nsurrender. It takes us back to the nineties, when we didn't know what \nwe now know about global warming. It takes us back to the nineties, \nwhen we feared taking on that challenge. But our time has come. The \ntime for change is here. It is time, once and for all, to stand up and \nsay we are not going to depend on foreign oil anymore, we are going to \nmake sure we have technology developed in this country that will get us \naway from foreign oil and away from the countries that hold such a vise \naround our neck. That is why Senator Warner is on this bill, that is \nwhy Senator Lieberman is on this bill, that is why I am on this bill, \nand many other colleagues on both sides of the aisle.\n  So for my colleague to bring this issue up on the budget resolution \nis unbelievable because he has not even seen the bill. To stand up and \nsay that what I want to do and what those of us who want to act against \nglobal warming will do is bad for our country is quite the opposite.\n  In Great Britain, over the last 10 years, they have reduced carbon \nemissions by 15 percent. Their GDP rose by 45 percent, and 500,000 jobs \nwere created that are green-collar jobs.\n  You can stand in the corner and shiver and shake and say: Please, \nChina, please act so we can act. You can say: Oh, India, please act so \nwe can act. Or you can stand up like an American and say: We lead.\n  This vote is an important vote because what I say in my side-by-side \nmotion is we will not support legislation that does not address the \nissue of imports from countries such as China and India that have no \nemissions program.\n\n\n                           Motion to Instruct\n\n  Madam President, I have a motion to instruct at the desk. I wish to \nmake that clear.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Boxer] moves that the \n     conferees on the part of the Senate on the disagreeing votes \n     of the two Houses on the concurrent resolution, S. Con. Res. \n     70, the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year \n     2009, be instructed that--\n       no legislation providing for new mandates on greenhouse gas \n     emissions should be enacted until it effectively addresses \n     imports from China, India, and other nations that have no \n     similar emissions programs.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. I didn't want to forget to offer the motion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has consumed 5 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I reserve the remainder of my time. I look forward to a \ngood vote on the Boxer motion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I ask to take 10 minutes off the Kyl \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I believe we should adopt Senator \nKyl's motion to instruct the budget conferees. First of all, I wish to \ncomment on the status of the alternative minimum tax. There is some \ngood news regarding the need to do a patch to protect over 20 million \nfamilies. The Democratic leadership in this body recognized the \nimportance of halting the effect of this tax on these families and \nprovided room in the budget for a patch for this year.\n  I commend my friend, the chairman of the Budget Committee, for that \nimprovement of the budget resolution over previous years. I do so again \nand note that the Kyl instruction is consistent with the chairman's \nposition in that regard.\n  The bad news is, we are halfway through the year and the patch has \nnot been done. The reason is that Blue Dog Democrats in the other body \nwill not supply the votes for an un-offset patch in the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  By the way, the only Blue Dog answer to deficit reduction is to raise \ntaxes. We have seen it on the AMT, and we have seen it on spending \nlegislation. We are seeing now the GI benefit provisions in the war \nsupplemental bill. Why they think of only raising taxes and not of \nwhere to cut spending levels to offset the need to spend someplace else \nI don't understand. They never seem to propose spending cuts as a \nremedy. I think it is fair for me to say they never do. They only ask \nfor higher taxes.\n  I hope people in this body will start to pay attention to this issue. \nThe Blue Dogs' bark is deficit reduction, but their bite is always more \ntaxes.\n  In addition to the AMT patch, both bodies need to deal with several \nexpired provisions of tax law. We need to focus on this problem and get \nlegislation ready.\n  Earlier today, the House began work on an extenders bill. It is \noffset with tax increases. I urge them to send the bill to the Senate \nso Chairman Baucus and I will have a vehicle to deal with this pressing \nproblem. We need to act ahead of time. We need to act before the IRS \nforms are finalized. We cannot go through another filing season fiasco, \nsuch as waiting until December last year when it finally got passed, \nand the IRS had a lot of extra work after the forms had already gone \nout. Let's not create big problems for our taxpayers and the Internal \nRevenue Service.\n  Senator Kyl's motion then is very important to assure us of the \nquickest route to complete action on AMT and extenders. The quickest \nroute is the same route as last year: Drop the offset demand.\n  Folks on the other side happen to be complaining all the time that \noffsets are essential. I would like to make it clear that the policy \nissues behind offsets are one thing. We ought to ask ourselves the same \nquestion on any tax policy proposal, whether it raises revenue or loses \nrevenue. The question should be: Does a tax legislative proposal make \ntax policy sense? It ought to be decided on the basis of policy. That \nis the bottom line.\n  On the matters of tax policy, Senator Kyl's motion to instruct, the \nanswer is very evident. On the AMT patch and extenders, the answer is \noverwhelmingly clear. The answer is ``yes'' on the motion to instruct. \nThe policy call is a slam dunk. It is backed up by the politics; that \nis, supermajority votes for an AMT patch and extenders in the House and \nSenate that are very difficult to get.\n  We have to divorce the merits of the current law provisions from the \noffset question. Offsets should be judged on their merits. An AMT patch \nand extenders should be judged on their merits. Why should we seek \ndivorce of the two, some might ask. Here is the reason.\n  Right now, we have a budget process, including pay-go, that is biased \ntoward higher taxes and, of course, higher spending. As evidence, take \na look at expiring spending provisions. According to the CBO, they \ntotal $1.3 trillion--a whole $1.3 trillion. That is double a permanent \nAMT patch score. That spending is not subject to pay-go. It, unlike \nexpiring tax provisions, is included in the baseline; hence, it is home \nfree. Just like the record tax increases built into this budget, so too \nis a record spending increase.\n\n[[Page S4256]]\n\n  I have not even talked about appropriations increases. That \nadditional above-baseline spending is included as permanent, once \npassed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, through you, I ask the Senator if he \nwould yield for the purpose of a unanimous consent agreement we have \nworked out?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Yes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I think it would be helpful to the overall process that \nwe do this.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Yes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nfollowing motions to instruct conferees be the only motions, except the \npending motions, with no amendment in order to the motions, and that \nwould be the Conrad AMT and the Kyl AMT amendments, with 60 minutes \nequally divided, with the time already consumed being applied to the 60 \nminutes; that there be a Democratic nuclear energy reserve fund \namendment and a Republican nuclear energy reserve fund amendment and \nthe two amendments be limited to 30 minutes equally divided; that there \nbe a Democratic OCS amendment and a Vitter OCS amendment, with 30 \nminutes equally divided.\n  We have already had initial debate on the Boxer China-India and the \nDeMint China-India amendment with 30 minutes equally divided, and we \nwill apply all time already consumed to that 30-minute limit.\n  Finally, a Gregg or Republican $1 trillion cap on discretionary \nspending amendment with 30 minutes equally divided; that points of \norder be waived; that upon the use of debate time on each motion, it be \nset aside and the motions to be voted in the order listed; that there \nbe 2 minutes prior to each vote, and then after the first vote, the \nvote time be limited to 10 minutes each; that upon the use of all time, \nthe Senate proceed to vote in relation to each motion; that there be 60 \nminutes of general debate time available to the chair and the ranking \nmember.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I would note that obviously the \namendment that has already been debated in the time consumed, the Gregg \namendment, would be the first amendment to be voted on and these other \namendments voted on in the order indicated, or we will do it as \noffered. I guess we can do it as offered, if that would accommodate the \nSenator from California, because we did the Boxer-DeMint amendment \noffered earlier. We will do it as offered.\n  I thank the Senator from Iowa for his courtesy.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Would you give me 1 more minute added to what I had?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Absolutely, an additional minute. Always, anytime, to the \nSenator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I have been given 1 additional minute, \nso I have 5 minutes left at this point?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. The bottom line is that it is about time we start \ntreating spending and taxes the same, under pay-go. So the Kyl motion \nto instruct treats expiring tax relief the same as expiring spending. \nThat reason alone, aside from the merits of the AMT patch and \nextenders, should be enough to get the support from all of us on the \nKyl motion to instruct.\n  The bottom line is that pay-go has a bias toward tax increases and \nincreased spending. We ought to have the same rules apply to the \nexpenditure side as to the tax side. Presently, they do not. But this \nwould make it possible for that to be the case.\n  The chairman of the Budget Committee continues to say he is going to \nbring in all this money from shutting down abusive tax shelters, which \nI also favor. Some examples are cross-border leases of foreign sewer \nsystems, which he mentioned, or shutting down tax havens, which he \nmentioned. I would support him in every one of those efforts.\n  But Congress has done a great deal already, shutting down abusive \nleasing deals. We did that in 2004. The Senate has tried to shut off \ntax benefits from older deals, but the House Democrats have rejected \nclosing those loopholes. So I do not see how the distinguished chairman \ncan count on this revenue even though he keeps saying this is the \nanswer to all of our offset problems--in other words, getting enough \nnew revenue to offset tax cuts someplace else.\n  The chairman also continues to say we can get $100 billion per year \nfrom shutting down offshore tax havens, according to the Permanent \nSubcommittee on Investigations. The fact is, there are no legislative \nproposals out there that the Joint Tax Committee has scored to bring in \nanywhere close to the $100 billion we are led by the other side, by the \nmajority, to believe we are going to be able to do.\n  The 12,748 companies the chairman says are in the Ugland House in the \nCayman Islands are not claiming to be doing business there. It is \nsimply their registered address, just like an address in Nevada or \nDelaware is a registered address of many more thousands of companies. \nDoes the chairman have a picture of an office building in Wilmington, \nDE, or Reno, NV? I assume the chairman is just as willing to go after \nonshore tax evasion facilities by State corporate law as offshore tax \nevasion, and he would want to do so in a way that does not put our \ninformation exchange network at risk.\n  The chairman knows that it is the Joint Committee on Taxation that \nprovides Congress with revenue scores, not the Permanent Subcommittee \non Investigations. Anything that would raise the kind of money assumed \nin this budget would involve a significant change in tax policy, which \nis the last thing the chairman says he wants to do.\n  Again, I do not see how the distinguished chairman can count on all \nthis revenue without assuming substantial tax increases when the Joint \nCommittee on Taxation, the ``god'' of assuming revenue coming in under \ntax law changes--if that ``god'' cannot score it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Klobuchar). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I had earlier filed and Senator Grassley \nhad spoken on a motion to instruct conferees. An alternative has been \npresented by Senator Conrad. I wish to discuss both of them, this \nmotion to instruct conferees on the alternative minimum tax, and the \nso-called tax extenders.\n  Each year Congress is required to fix the AMT because without such a \nfix--around here it is called a patch--but without such a fix, it would \napply to, last year 22 million people, this year 26 million people. It \nwas never intended to apply to those people.\n  It was originated about 20 years ago because there were a couple \nhundred millionaires who were not paying taxes because of all of their \ncredits, deductions, offsets, and so on. People in Congress thought \nthat was not right, so we said: Well, no matter what, even if you have \nenough other tax shelters to eliminate your tax liability, we are going \nto make you pay an alternative minimum tax, no matter what. But it was \nnot indexed for inflation, so now everyone is going to have to be \npaying it. Each year Congress says: Well, we did not intend that, so we \nwill fix it so you do not have to pay it this year.\n  The question is not whether we are going to relieve taxpayers from \nthat--we will--but whether the rules of the Democratic majority that it \nhas to be paid for will, in fact, be implemented so that we have to \nraise taxes in order to save taxes, save people from having to pay \ntaxes. Obviously it does not make any sense to say to taxpayers: You \nshould have not to pay the alternative minimum tax, but under the \nDemocratic rules we have to raise your taxes so that the Government \ndoes not lose any money from us relieving you of that tax liability. \nThat does not make any sense.\n  So each year we waive that requirement. All we are saying here is we \nneed to do that again this year. I understand the pay-go requirement is \npart of the Democratic rule around here. It has not been applied in the \npast for a very good reason: It makes no sense, and it should not be \napplied here either.\n\n[[Page S4257]]\n\n  We never intended that this tax apply to 26 million taxpayers, we \nnever intended to collect the revenue, we are not going to collect the \nrevenue. So why do we have to make the Government whole for revenue \nthat we never intended to give it in the first place, especially since \nit means raising taxes on people in order to ``pay for the reduction in \nrevenues to the Treasury''? That is what this resolution is about.\n  The other half of it is to instruct the conferees that we need to \nalso extend the so-called extenders. Now, that is shorthand around here \nfor a variety of tax provisions which provide various credits and other \nrelief to taxpayers such as the research and development tax credit. \nBut we only do that a year at a time, so every year about this time we \nhave to start talking about passing the extenders package. We are going \nto do it; there is not going to be any debate about it. The \ndistinguished chairman of the Budget Committee made the point earlier \nthat agrees with us that this needs to be done; it is a question of how \nwe do it.\n  What we are doing is saying here, today, we need to do it in the \nfollowing way: Pass it as we did last year. You do not have to raise \ntaxes somewhere else in order to ``pay for it.''\n  This is not a case that make any sense for us. If you are going to \ngive tax relief, why would you raise taxes to have to pay for it? We \nare not counting on any revenue. Every year we do it this way. So why \nthe charade that somehow we have to raise taxes to pay for something we \nnever intended to collect revenue from in the first place?\n  That is what this resolution does. Let's strip away the pretense here \nthat somehow or other we are going to pay for it. ``Pay for'' are not \nthe right words anyway. That starts from the presumption that the \nGovernment owns all of this money, and that if we ever decide to give \nthe taxpayers a break so they do not have to pay for it all, the \nGovernment gets to make up the revenue some other way.\n  How does the Government make up revenue? It taxes people. That is the \nonly way the Government makes revenue. So the assumption is, well, the \nGovernment deserves all of this money, and if we ever say we are not \ngoing to collect some of it because we want people to keep more of it, \nthen we have to make that up some other way, obviously by raising \ntaxes.\n  I would rather start from the other premise, which is that the money \nbelongs to the people and especially in times of economic downturn it \nis important that they be able to use, in the way that they deem most \nbeneficial, the income they have earned, and that when we say we are \ngoing to relieve them of the alternative minimum tax liability, for \nexample, we are doing that for a reason, and we do not need to start \nfrom the premise that it is the Government's money and somehow we have \nto keep the Government whole and give the Government money by raising \ntaxes even though they were never going to collect this AMT revenue in \nthe first place.\n  This must sound like a strange debate to the American people. But \nthat is what the rule the Democratic majority has in place would \nrequire. That is what the budget would require. All we are saying is, \nsince we are going to be passing a budget, let's instruct the conferees \non the budget here that is not what we are going to do here. We are \ngoing to do it as we have in the past, as we did last year. We are \ngoing to pass the AMT relief, we are going to pass the extenders, and, \nno, we are not going to raise taxes on someone in order to pay for \nthem.\n  Now, what is the alternative that the distinguished chairman of the \nCommittee comes up with? It is the identical motion I have, with one \nother provision. It is this addition:\n\n       And that we should insist that every effort should be \n     made--\n\n  That is a sure sign for: We are not really going to do anything about \nthis, but we at least want to make it sound good--\n\n     to offset the cost of these policies by closing the tax gap, \n     shutting down abusive tax shelters, addressing offshore tax \n     havens without raising taxes.\n\n  Well, I am glad we have the ``without raising taxes'' in there, \nbecause none of us wants to raise taxes. But this reminds me of the \ncandidates, and we have all seen them out on the stump: Yes, we have a \nhuge Federal budget deficit, but I want to spend more money. The way we \nare going to pay for it is we are going to end waste, fraud, and abuse \nin Government. That is a sure sign for a politician who has not figured \nout how to get the money in any other way. Everyone is going to end \nwaste, fraud, and abuse. You know, I used that phrase in a sort of \nfacetious way, but actually I think it is in here.\n  Shutting down abusive tax shelters. There we are. Abuse. Waste, \nfraud, and abuse. Addressing offshore tax havens. The reality is, the \nFinance Committee on which we sit comes up with offsets to offset true \ntax policy whenever we can, and we have wrung out our Tax Code for \nevery last dollar we can find that involves waste, fraud, and abuse.\n  There are not any abusive tax shelters out there. If they are out \nthere, we have not found them or we would sure enough have gotten the \nmoney from them. The same thing about offshore tax havens. We have \ngotten about $60 or $70 billion from these, and there is no more to \nget. If there is, we would have gotten it by now.\n  Then there is the tax gap. The tax gap is this: Not everyone pays all \nof the income taxes the IRS thinks they owe, and the problem is we do \nnot know exactly who has not paid. But the estimates are that if most \nbusinesses in an industry pay $100, and some only pay $80, the \nassumption is that maybe those that only pay $80 probably ought to be \npaying more. We cannot figure it out, but we think the money would be \nthere if we had a better way to account for it.\n  We have held hearings, and the experts basically say: There is not \nmuch more you can get. You probably would have to pay more to find it \nthan it is worth to collect.\n  We did do one thing, though. We actually subcontracted out to some \ntax collectors. If they can go out and find some and they can bring it \nback, they get a little piece of the action. It would help us because \nthey would collect some of these revenues.\n  The only thing from the other side is, well, let's eliminate that \npolicy. We are not going to send these guys out to try find where these \ntaxes are. So if they intended to collect the revenue or to end or \nminimize the tax gap, they would not be sponsoring the legislation to \nfire all of the people we hired to go out there and find the revenue.\n  The bottom line is, this is a nice sounding phrase, but it is like \nthe person that goes out and says: I am going to end waste, fraud, and \nabuse. That is how I am going to pay for all of the new spending I am \nrecommending.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the motion I have filed, the motion \nthat Senator Grassley spoke to, and to reject the motion of the \nchairman of the Budget Committee which, at the end of the day, \nrecognizes the reality. We are going to do the AMT patch. We are going \nto do the tax extenders. We are not going to pay for them. So let's \ndon't pretend like we have to find revenue from someplace else in order \nto make this happen.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time and inquire how much remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 7 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. KYL. How much remains on the other side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The other side has 16 minutes.\n  Mr. KYL. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n\n\n                           Motion to Instruct\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I am not speaking on Senator Kyl's \nmotion. He has reserved his time. I am going to ask to set aside his \nmotion and send another motion to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the motion.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. Gregg] moves that the \n     conferees on the part of the Senate on the disagreeing votes \n     of the two Houses on the concurrent resolution S. Con. Res. \n     70 (the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year \n     2009) be instructed to insist that the final conference \n     report includes a level for 2009 budget authority not to \n     exceed $1 trillion for non-emergency discretionary \n     appropriations.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. As I understand the order, we have pending the motion to \ninstruct that I offered, the motion to instruct which Senator Kyl \noffered, the motion to instruct which Senator\n\n[[Page S4258]]\n\nConrad offered relative to the motion of Senator Kyl, the motion to \ninstruct which Senator DeMint offered, the motion to instruct which \nSenator Boxer offered in relationship to Senator DeMint's motion, and \nthis motion; is that correct? Is there anything else pending right now?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is one correction; otherwise, you are \ncorrect. The Conrad motion is not pending.\n  Mr. GREGG. The Conrad motion relative to the Kyl motion has not been \nsent to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. GREGG. Relative to the unanimous consent agreement, other than \nthe motion I have just sent to the desk, which is a trillion-dollar \nspending cap, we would still have available to be sent to the desk the \nmotion relative to nuclear energy reserve and the motion relative to \noffshore drilling, with the side by sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. GREGG. I thank the Chair. I believe all the motions that are \npending, to the extent they still have time remaining on those motions \npursuant to the unanimous consent request, that time is reserved; is \nthat correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. GREGG. So right now I will address the trillion-dollar spending \none and have that come off that time which is, I believe, 30 minutes \nequally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. GREGG. What this instruction says is, we should not be spending \n$1 trillion on discretionary accounts around here. This budget for the \nfirst time, the Democratic budget, because of its increases last year \non top of the increases in this budget, has hit the trillion-dollar \nmark. That should be a fairly big red flag, that we are now going to \nspend $1 trillion in discretionary spending. I have trouble \ncomprehending what a trillion dollars is. I suspect almost everybody \ndoes. But if you take all the taxes paid since we began as a republic, \nI believe it totals something like $42 trillion. That would be over 200 \nyears. So this one budget is going to spend a fairly significant amount \nof what has been raised in taxes since our country began. It is a big \nnumber, $1 trillion. It seems to me we ought to sort of maybe draw a \nline here, take a breath, and say: Let's stop. Let's think about what \nwe are doing. Let's see if rather than spending this huge amount of \nmoney, we can't save a little money.\n  Last year the Democratic budget, and then the Democratic \nappropriations bills, increased spending by $22 billion. That was what \nthey proposed. It is not just a 1-year event when you raise spending \naround here by $22 billion. That compounds over 5 years. It is $22 \nbillion plus $22 billion plus interest, plus $22 billion. It adds up. \nIn fact, a 5-year number is probably closer to $220 billion, $250 \nbillion, when you spend $22 billion in 1 year or increase spending by \nthat much. So it is a lot of money. Last year they increased spending \nby $22 billion on nondefense discretionary spending. This year it is \nnot absolutely clear, because it hasn't actually been disclosed to us, \nbut we know it is going to be well over $20 billion on nondefense \ndiscretionary spending again.\n  That is why the Democratic budget takes us over $1 trillion; $1.9 \ntrillion, I believe, will be spent under this budget on discretionary \nspending. As I said, it is time for a timeout. That is what this motion \nto instruct says. It says: Let's go back and rethink this effort. Can't \nwe somewhere in that trillion dollars find enough savings to get us \nback under $1 trillion? Shouldn't we certainly be saying we are not \ngoing to push the American taxpayer over the trillion-dollar number; \nrather, we will make a little extra effort to try to reduce spending in \nthis account if we want to increase spending in that account, rather \nthan constantly add on to the spending?\n  This Democratic budget has absolutely no programmatic savings in it. \nThe President suggested some programmatic savings. I believe his \nprogrammatic savings added up to about $15 billion. None of those was \naccepted and none of those was put in this budget. None of those are \nassumed. In fact, all it does is add to spending and add to programs. \nIt is hard to believe that in a trillion-dollar budget, we couldn't \nfind a mere 1 percent or 2 percent of savings by reducing programs \nwhich have either outserved their usefulness or which, in the order of \npriorities, we simply can't afford, and we should make difficult \ndecisions of maybe not increasing them as much as proposed or maybe \neven reducing them. In most instances, we are talking about slowing the \nrate of increase. We are not actually talking about reducing.\n  This is a red-flag motion. It says: Let's pause. Let's think about \nthis. Do we want to blow through the trillion-dollar mark on the \ndiscretionary side of the ledger without having made some effort to try \nto save some money around here, to reallocate money, to set priorities, \nand to do what is affordable? I don't think we do. That is why we are \ncalling on the conferees to take some action to bring this number back \nunder $1 trillion. That means they have to save $9 billion, $10 \nbillion. That is 1 percent. They ought to be able to do that. I know it \nis a lot of money, $10 billion, but on a trillion-dollar budget, it \ncertainly ought to be a doable event. It does seem to me the American \npeople deserve that type of effort. We could all earn our pay around \nhere, a number of times over, if we were to save the American people \n$10 billion or $20 billion and allow them to keep that money so they \ncan spend it and make their lives better rather than have the \nGovernment spend it for them.\n  That is what this motion does. It instructs the conferees to bring \nthis budget back under the trillion-dollar level in the discretionary \nside.\n  With that, I reserve the balance of my time and suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Motion to Instruct\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending motion and send to the desk a motion on behalf of Senator \nGraham dealing with nuclear power.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n       The Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. Gregg], for Mr. Graham, \n     moves that the conferees on the part of the Senate on the \n     disagreeing votes of the two Houses on the concurrent \n     resolution S. Con. Res. 70 (the concurrent resolution on the \n     budget for fiscal year 2009) be instructed to insist on the \n     inclusion in the final conference report section 311 of S. \n     Con. Res. 70, the deficit neutral reserve fund to improve \n     energy efficiency and production, as passed by the Senate, \n     and that such section include an additional requirement that \n     the legislation also encourages the removal of existing \n     barriers to building new zero-emission nuclear power plants \n     in the United States.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I note that the Senator from Louisiana is \non the Senate floor. I had planned to offer this motion on behalf of \nSenator Graham in order to move the process along. He is in accordance \nwith that as he is in a meeting he could not get out of, a briefing on \nsecurity. I will reserve the remainder of the time on the motion so \nSenator Vitter can be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Mr. VITTER. Thank you, Madam President.\n  I thank the distinguished ranking member for the courtesy.\n\n\n                           Motion To Instruct\n\n  Madam President, I have a motion I send to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the motion.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Louisiana [Mr. Vitter] moves that the \n     conferees on the part of the Senate on the disagreeing \n     votes of the two Houses on the concurrent resolution S. \n     Con. Res. 70 (the concurrent resolution on the budget for \n     fiscal year 2009) be instructed to insist that the \n     conference report include a reserve fund that requires the \n     Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee to adjust budget \n     aggregates and the allocation of the Energy Committee, if \n     the Senate considers legislation that allows a Governor, \n     with the\n\n[[Page S4259]]\n\n     concurrence of the State legislature to petition for \n     increased energy exploration on the Outer Continental \n     Shelf and that allows for revenue sharing for such \n     producing States on new areas of production and new leases \n     made available, if the average price of regular gasoline \n     in the United States reaches $5 per gallon.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, if I could briefly explain this motion, \nit attempts to, again, get us to deal directly with the enormously \nimportant issue, the real crisis that consumers across America face; \nthat is, the high and escalating cost of energy, including gasoline at \nthe pump.\n  This will finally suggest to the American people that we get it, that \nwe understand their plight, that we feel their pain, if you will, to \nuse an often used phrase, and we are actually going to do something \nabout it. We are going to act.\n  This motion to instruct the conferees would show the Senate is \nserious about increasing energy supplies and doing that to decrease \ngasoline prices.\n  The motion is very simple. It would instruct the budget conferees to \ninclude a reserve fund for future legislation that we would be \nexpressing an intention to pass. That legislation would allow a \nGovernor, with the concurrence of his or her State legislature, to \npetition for increased energy exploration on the Outer Continental \nShelf off of that State.\n  It would also allow for revenue sharing coming from such exploration \nand production, to give producing States a fair share on new areas of \nproduction and new leases made available.\n  Specifically, I would suggest that we follow the precedent and the \npolicy we set a few years ago. As we opened new areas of the gulf, we \nsaid the producing States will have a fair share, will finally get \nrevenue sharing--37.5 percent of the revenue from that new production.\n  Finally, this would only happen if the price of regular gasoline in \nthe United States reaches $5 a gallon at the pump.\n  The American people are wondering right now if we understand what \ntheir daily lives are all about because as gasoline prices at the pump \nare high, and higher the next day, and much higher the next month, we \nseem to want to do absolutely nothing about it.\n  This Congress, under Democratic leadership, came into power in \nJanuary of 2007. As that happened, the Democratic leadership of this \nnew Congress was very clear that an absolute top priority was to deal \nwith sky-high energy prices.\n  At the time fuel prices were about $2.33 a gallon at the pump. Well, \nif that was sky high then, I do not know what adjective to use for \ntoday because since that time, from January 2007 to today, we have gone \nfrom $2.33 a gallon at the pump to about $3.72 a gallon--a 61-percent \nincrease. Unfortunately, there does not seem to be any real end in \nsight.\n  Now, the American people get this because they live it. They go to \nthe gas pump weekly. They live it. They see that bill for filling up \ntheir tank go higher and higher. They have to wonder if we get it \nbecause we talk a lot on the Senate floor, we debate a lot, but what \nhave we done? In my opinion, very, little on this crucial challenge--\neven crisis--facing the American people.\n  When I look at this issue, I go back to economics 101: supply and \ndemand. Price is set by the intersection of demand and supply. So you \ncan try to stabilize or lower prices in two ways: You can try to \ndecrease demand; you can try to increase supply.\n  I think our energy situation is so dire, so challenging, the \nescalating prices are so great, the pace of escalation is so \nstaggering, that we need to take action on both sides of the equation. \nWe need to do everything possible on both sides of the equation.\n  We need to lessen demand or at least mitigate increasing demand from \nother countries worldwide, such as China and India. We cannot control \nwhat they do. Their demand is increasing enormously. But at least we \ncan try to mitigate that with demand reductions in our own economy. I \nsupport those measures: greater efficiency, greater conservation, \nmoving to alternative forms of fuel and energy. That is all absolutely \ncrucial. We need to do that. We have done a little of it; we need to do \nmore.\n  But as we do that, we cannot ignore the supply side of the equation. \nWe need to address both sides at the same time. We need to do \neverything reasonable we can on both sides of the equation at the same \ntime.\n  That brings us to supply. For far too long, Congress has absolutely \nignored the supply side of the equation, has absolutely refused to do \nanything to increase supply in this country--by increased exploration \nand drilling on our Outer Continental Shelf or in Alaska or anywhere \nelse.\n  I do not know how long we are going to wait. What does the price have \nto get to before we hear the American people and before we finally act \nmore on the demand side, yes, and more on the supply side?\n  Again, my motion to instruct would address this challenge head on. It \nwould say, if the price at the pump gets to $5 a gallon--we are not \nthere yet. We are below $4, but if it gets to $5 a gallon, is that high \nenough to get us to act, to get us to do something, to get us to, yes, \naddress demand but also address supply?\n  I think the American people think that is plenty high enough to get \nus to act. If we push past that point, then under my motion to \ninstruct, we would support a reserve fund for legislation to allow \nexploration and production off our coasts on the Outer Continental \nShelf.\n  But, again, I want to emphasize there would be two important rules we \nwould have to follow with this increased exploration and production. \nNo. 1, the host State coast we are talking about would have to want \nthat activity to happen. That Governor and that State legislature would \nboth have to say: Yes, we believe this is good for the country; we \nbelieve this is good for the State; we want this activity to happen.\n  Secondly, when the activity does happen, that host State would get a \nfair share of the revenue, would get the same share as we set for the \nhost States in the gulf when we opened new areas of the gulf a couple \nyears ago: 37.5 percent. That host State could then use that revenue \nfor its priorities: education, K-12, higher education, highways, \nenvironmental cleanup, beach restoration.\n  In the case of my State, Louisiana, it is perfectly clear what our \npriority for that money is. We have already passed not only legislation \nbut State constitutional amendments regarding how we are going to use \nthat money. It is to address the crisis that is happening on our coast, \nto battle coastal erosion, to enhance coastal restoration, to build \nhurricane protection, and to build hurricane evacuation routes.\n  To me, that is a very commonsense consensus approach. The price of \ngasoline has been rising astronomically. As I said, from the start of \nthis Democratically led Congress, it has already risen 61 percent. The \nDemocratic leadership of this Congress began in January 2007 saying \nthis is a top priority. Yet little to nothing has happened, as that \nprice has risen 61 percent.\n  Are we finally going to hear the pleas of the American people? Are we \nfinally going to act on all sorts of fronts to try to stabilize and \nbring down these prices? This is a sensible solution on the supply side \nthat can have a real impact.\n  Let me reiterate. We need to do everything conceivable, both on the \ndemand side and the supply side, because our challenge is that great. I \nsupport demand side measures. I supported increased efficiency \nstandards. I supported the measure we passed a couple days ago \ntemporarily ceasing filling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. So we \ndecrease demand in that very modest way. We need to do more in terms of \nfuel efficiency, conservation, and new forms of fuel and energy.\n  But as we address much more aggressively the demand side of the \nequation, we cannot ignore the supply side. We need to increase supply, \nparticularly domestic supply, at the same time. We have enormous \nreserves in this country off our coasts, as well as in Alaska, as well \nas places on shore to do that. What we have not mustered so far is the \npolitical will and the votes in Congress to allow our people and our \nindustry to do it.\n  My motion would say $5 a gallon--if we get there, we sure as heck \nneed to act. We sure as heck need to do all of those sensible things on \nthe supply side, just as we should on the demand side.\n\n[[Page S4260]]\n\n  I urge all of my colleagues, Republicans and Democrats, to support \nthis sensible measure. The leadership of this new Congress has been \ntalking about energy prices since the Congress came in in January 2007. \nThe only thing that talk has done is be concurrent with the rise in \nprices at the pump of 61 percent, from about $2.33 a gallon to $3.73 a \ngallon.\n  Talk is not good enough. The American people deserve action. They \ndeserve action on the demand side, much more aggressive action than we \nhave taken to date. They sure as heck also deserve action on the supply \nside to increase our domestic supply, which can have a major impact on \nprice at the pump.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this sensible motion in that regard.\n  I yield back my time.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I believe there is time in opposition to \nthis motion?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. WHITEHOUSE). The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I wish to claim about 10 minutes of that time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, here we go again. Yet again my friends \non the other side of the aisle are trying to sell the American people a \nbill of goods to try to convince them that drilling along our shores \nwill do something to lower gas prices. Opening our shores to drilling \nwas a bad idea in June of last year when we voted down an amendment to \nthe Energy bill--very similar--it was a bad idea when this body voted \nit down in March of this year on an amendment to the budget resolution, \nand it was a bad idea when we voted this idea down by well over 14 \nvotes 2 days ago on an amendment to the flood insurance bill.\n  Ending a bipartisan, 26-year moratoria on oil drilling on the Outer \nContinental Shelf will do nothing but jeopardize our precious natural \nresources. The Energy Information Administration projects that even if \nwe opened the entire Outer Continental Shelf to drilling off the east \ncoast, off the west coast, and opened the entire eastern Gulf of \nMexico, nothing would happen to gas prices--nothing. Why?\n  First, because production wouldn't begin until the year 2017. The \ninfrastructure to drill for oil is not just a large oil platform but a \nnetwork of hundreds of miles of pipelines that transport oil from the \nplatform on to the land and then on to the refineries. This kind of \ninfrastructure simply does not exist on the east coast and in only \nlimited exceptions on the west coast.\n  The second reason why opening all our shores to oil drilling will not \nlower gas prices is because by the time full production actually ramped \nup in 2030, drilling off all of the coasts full tilt--full tilt--would \nonly result in a whopping 3-percent increase in domestic production. \nEven in 2030, as our continent is rung all the way around by oil \nplatforms, all of this new supply would be eaten up by a 7-percent \nincrease in domestic demand. So the Energy Information Administration \npredicts: ``Any impact on average wellhead prices is expected to be \ninsignificant.''\n  The fact is that over 80 percent of the resources in the Outer \nContinental Shelf are already open for exploration. Since 2001, the \nBush administration has issued over 100 new leases. Many of these \nleases are in the eastern gulf where the oil industry already has much \nof the infrastructure necessary to go into production. Yet only 12 of \nthese new wells have been drilled. The industry is only developing a \nsmall fraction of the area already open for drilling. So why isn't \nExxonMobil pumping some of its profits into developing some of these \nareas? If companies are not interested in developing the large fields \nalready in the Gulf of Mexico, why is it so critical to open \nenvironmentally sensitive areas to more drilling?\n  My home State of New Jersey and the New Jersey shore is a priceless \ntreasure that my home State will protect at any cost. The shore also \ngenerates tens of billions of dollars in revenues each year and \nsupports almost half a million jobs. If we open the east coast to \ndrilling, we jeopardize a tourism and fishing economy worth tens of \nbillions of dollars in exchange for a cumulative total of only a half \nyear's supply of oil--a half year's supply of oil--jeopardizing, \nhowever, tens of billions of dollars. The people of New Jersey cannot \nafford the risk that will take place to our wildlife, to our economy \nand, in fact, I believe, the people up and down the coast as well.\n  Florida beaches generate billions of dollars each year. In South \nCarolina, Myrtle Beach alone brought in more than $3 billion in \nrevenue. Do we want oil washing up into the pristine Cape Hatteras \nNational Seashore? What about Virginia Beach? And can Maryland's famous \nblue crab survive yet another environmental assault?\n  The bottom line is this proposal will do nothing to lower gas prices, \nbut it will jeopardize coastal economies all along both coasts.\n  Now to simply say: Well, it is up to an individual State, that \ndoesn't work. The ocean doesn't have neat little boxes which it is \ndivided into. So the reality is that the ability to open the Outer \nContinental Shelf in one location threatens, if there is an accident, \nthe beaches along the shoreline along that same region. This isn't \nabout making it one versus another; this is a continuity.\n  There are other things we can do about gas prices. Hopefully the \nPresident will soon sign into law the Democratic proposal that passed \nCongress overwhelmingly to suspend filling the Strategic Petroleum \nReserve through December of 2008. When the people of this country are \nsuffering from paying $4 a gallon for gas and when gas prices are \npushing up the cost of food, and the price of oil has broken $125 a \nbarrel, it makes no sense to be buying at this high level and then \nputting that oil in the ground when we are already 97 percent of where \nwe need to be for the Nation's security, burying this precious \ncommodity when we need it the most. Hopefully the President will sign \nthis important measure and we can truly begin to help gas prices go \nback down and offer some relief.\n  But it begs even a bigger question, and that is breaking our \ndependency on foreign oil, seeking renewable sources, and finding new \nautomobiles which we drive in our country; moving on to mass transit, \nhaving greater conservation--these are all of the elements that are \nnecessary. It is also about ending speculation in the marketplace. Why \nis it that when we have testimony before House and Senate committees \nthat says the price of oil should be somewhere between $50 and $70 a \nbarrel between demand and supply that we are looking at $125? Let's go \nafter the speculators. Let's go through a regulatory process that \nensures this one market that is so critical ultimately has the \nregulation necessary.\n  Finally, we can't drill our way out of oil addiction. We can't drill \nour way out of oil addiction. We must promote sustainable alternative \nfuels and incentivize people to buy more efficient cars, raise the fuel \neconomy standards and--something we don't do well in the United \nStates--help commercialize technologies that allow us to run our cars, \nfor example, on electricity. General Motors plans to introduce a plug-\nin hybrid in 2010 and Nissan announced it will start selling an \nelectric car that same year. Once we get this type of technology right, \nour constituents will be able to run their cars much more cheaply. Some \nstudies project electricity will be the equivalent of 60 cents per \ngallon of gasoline. That as a fuel source for the future is just around \nthe corner. We understand that. We want to incentivize it and move it \nin the right direction.\n  On the other side, if all you want to do is create more addiction to \nthe oil, find another vein in which to pop into and go ahead and drill \neven when all that is already open is not being drilled. It is the \nwrong policy. We have defeated three times in the Senate over the last \nyear or so such provisions. I urge my colleagues to defeat the Vitter \nmotion to instruct and make sure we keep this bipartisan, 26-year \nmoratoria intact.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of the time that may be \nleft in opposition, and I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The journal clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S4261]]\n\n                           Motion to Instruct\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I understand the Kyl motion regarding \nthe alternative minimum tax is already pending, so I ask that my motion \non the alternative minimum tax, which is at the desk, also be called up \nand be made pending.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Conrad] moves that the \n     managers on the part of the Senate at the conference on \n     the disagreeing votes of the two houses on the House \n     amendment to the concurrent resolution S. Con. Res. 70 \n     (setting forth the congressional budget for the United \n     States Government for fiscal year 2009 and including the \n     appropriate budgetary levels for fiscal years 2008 and \n     2009 through 2013) be instructed to--\n       (A) insist that the revenue levels in the resolution \n     include the cost of providing relief from the Alternative \n     Minimum Tax in 2008, so that the number of taxpayers affected \n     by the AMT does not increase and thereby more than 20 million \n     middle-class families would be protected from paying higher \n     taxes;\n       (B) insist on the Senate position of providing for the \n     extension of expiring and expired tax relief that has been \n     routinely extended in past years, including tax relief such \n     as the research and experimentation tax credit, the deduction \n     for state and local sales taxes, the deduction for classroom \n     expenses, the deduction for qualified education expenses, the \n     incentive for the charitable IRA rollover, the combat pay \n     earned income tax credit, and various energy tax incentives; \n     and\n       (C) insist that every effort should be made to offset the \n     cost of these policies by closing the tax gap, shutting down \n     abusive tax shelters, addressing offshore tax havens, and \n     without raising taxes.\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote \nsequence with respect to the pending motions be as follows: the Gregg \namendment, the Conrad AMT amendment, the Kyl AMT amendment, the Boxer \nChina-India amendment, the DeMint China-India amendment--those are both \nwith respect to energy provisions--the Vitter OCS amendment, the Graham \nenergy nuclear reserve fund, and the Gregg discretionary spending cap, \nwith the remaining provisions of the previous order in effect.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there be no \nfurther motions to be brought forward.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request of the \nSenator from North Dakota?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Is there objection to the request of the Senator from New Hampshire?\n  Mr. CONRAD. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I wish now to turn to the Gregg amendment \nthat was previously offered with respect to a $1 trillion cap.\n  Let me indicate that the spending in the budget resolution that has \ngone to the conference committee takes spending down as a share of GDP \neach and every year from 20.8 percent of GDP in 2008 and 2009, every \nyear stepping it down until we get to 19.1 percent of GDP in 2012 and \n2013. I might add, we balance the budget in 2012 and 2013 under the \nbudget.\n  The comparison of the spending under the resolution and the \nPresident's budget is depicted by these lines: The green line is the \nbudget resolution spending line; the President's is the red line. You \ncan see almost no difference. That is because there is almost no \ndifference between the spending in the President's budget and the \nspending in the Senate budget resolution. In fact, here are the \ndifferences: The Senate budget resolution has $3.08 trillion of \nspending over the period of the 5 years. The President has $3.84 \ntrillion of spending over the period.\n  What are the differences? Let me indicate as a percentage, that is a \n1-percent difference--1 percent. Why do we have 1 percent more than the \nPresident? Well, because first we rejected his Medicare cuts. That is \n45 percent of the difference. Forty-three percent of the difference is \nwe rejected his cuts to law enforcement. We rejected his cut to \nveterans. We rejected his cuts to transportation. My goodness. We just \nhad a bridge collapse in Minnesota, 35W. Can you imagine the horror? \nYou are driving home and the bridge collapses. We don't think it is \nwise to be cutting transportation funding when we are not maintaining \nthe roads and bridges we have now, much less dealing with the gridlock \nthat exists around the country as well. So we have rejected those cuts \nby the President.\n  We specifically rejected his proposal to cut the COPS program, not by \n10 percent and not by 20 percent. The President proposed cutting the \nCOPS program 100 percent. What is the COPS program? That is a program \nthat has put 100,000 police officers on the street in this country. In \nmy State, it has put over 200 officers on the street. I just held a \nhearing with every part of law enforcement represented: the police \nchiefs, the sheriffs, the States' attorneys--open testimony. They said \nit was absolutely beyond their understanding why the President would \npropose cutting the COPS program 100 percent, but he did.\n  He proposed cutting weatherization assistance 100 percent. Why would \nyou cut weatherization assistance when that is designed to reduce fuel \nbills when oil is $120 a barrel? He says cut weatherization assistance \n100 percent.\n  He says cut first responder grants 78 percent. I just held a hearing \nthat involved all of the first responders in my State: The fire chiefs, \nthe police chiefs, and all of the others, including the EMS personnel, \nemergency medical services. I asked them: Do they think it makes any \nsense to cut the first responder grants 78 percent? They unanimously \nsaid absolutely not. What are we going to do in terms of \ninteroperability of communications if we are not upgrading those \nsystems? One of the things we learned on that fateful day, September \n11, was that the failure to have interoperable communications created a \nfiasco at the Pentagon when all the emergency responders were going \nthere to try to help and they couldn't communicate with each other. \nThat is what these grants are for, to provide interoperable \ncommunications, to provide the training to respond to disasters, both \nnatural and manmade. The President says cut it 78 percent. The \nPresident said cut community development funds 24 percent. He said cut \nclean water grants 21 percent. He said cut low-income home energy \nassistance--the very popular LIHEAP program--which is already \nunderfunded, another 15 percent. We said, no, that doesn't make any \nsense; yet we produced a budget that balances. It balances in the \nfourth year--not by much, but it does balance, according to CBO. We \nstay in balance in the fifth year, unlike the President's budget. The \nPresident balanced in the fourth year but went right back out of \nbalance in the fifth.\n\n  He has an addiction to debt unlike anything I have ever seen. This \nPresident has almost doubled the national debt in just 7 years. He has \nmore than doubled foreign holdings of our debt in that period. We owe \nthe Chinese hundreds of billions, we owe the Japanese hundreds of \nbillions, and we even owe Mexico. This President's legacy is one of \ndebt.\n  In this budget, we bring down the debt as a share of GDP in each and \nevery year, according to the scoring of the budget resolution, from \n69.6 percent down to 66 percent. That is not as much progress as I \nwould like to make.\n  Senator Gregg and I have a separate proposal to deal with the long-\nterm entitlement problems and those challenges, to deal with that in a \nbipartisan special task force that would have the power to come back \nwith a recommendation that would get a vote in the Congress of the \nUnited States if a supermajority of the members of the task force, who \nare completely bipartisan, would agree on the plan.\n  Mr. President, I am proud of this budget resolution. I think this \ntrillion-dollar cap on discretionary spending is a pure political \ngambit.\n  Let me add one other thing. If this cap were imposed, part of what is \nincluded in that spending is spending on our national defense. So that \nwould put defense under the gun and put it at risk of additional cuts. \nI am a little surprised that the Republicans are proposing that. I \ndon't think this is the time to be making cuts in national defense, but \nthat would be in the pot and be subject to cuts under their proposal. I \nhope we reject that approach.\n  With that, I think we are very close to being ready to go to votes.\n  I see my colleague, the Senator from Florida, here.\n  I wonder if the Parliamentarian could advise us on the time remaining\n\n[[Page S4262]]\n\non the Conrad-Kyl AMT amendment and the Gregg $1 trillion cap. How much \ntime is left on those two?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On the Kyl AMT amendment, Senator Kyl has 7 \nminutes and Senator Conrad has 16 minutes. On the Conrad AMT amendment, \nthere is 16 minutes remaining, equally divided.\n  Mr. CONRAD. No, there is not. That is not correct. That was part of a \nunanimous consent agreement. There was 16 minutes for Kyl and Conrad \ncombined, and all time consumed was credited against that 60 minutes. \nSo there is virtually no time. I think we will just yield back all time \non that motion.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I think we will yield back all time on the \nKyl-Conrad motion.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Senator Nelson may want to speak on OCS. How much time is \nleft on that?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator Vitter has 3 minutes. The majority has \n7 minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am happy to yield 7 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Florida.\n  Mr. GREGG. I would like to retain 2 minutes to respond to my spending \na trillion dollars.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I will retain 2 minutes on that too. So we each will \nretain 2 minutes on that amendment and yield back all other time, \nexcept for the 7 minutes on OCS.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that 4 minutes be \nequally divided between Senator Conrad and myself when we get to the \nKyl-Conrad AMT amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, here we go again. The oil \ncompanies are trying to have it exactly the way they have had it in the \npast. They have developed an amendment that is very seductive by saying \nthat you can have offshore drilling with the concurrence of the State \nif gasoline reaches $5 a gallon. What they have not told you is that if \nthe price of gas goes up to $5 a gallon, of which the oil companies are \nmaking money hand over fist, they are going to utilize that to \nperpetuate the myth that they need to drill off the coast of a State \nlike Florida, when, in fact, what they have not told you is that the \noil companies already have under lease, which has not been drilled, 33 \nmillion acres offshore. The oil companies also have another 31 million \nacres onshore that have not been drilled. And the myth that they \nperpetuate, now using the fright of $5-a-gallon gas, is that we have to \nhave more supply and therefore we have to go offshore. This is the \nseductive red herring of this amendment which was offered by a Senator \nwhose State, Louisiana, has a big oil industry that drills off of \nLouisiana, where, in fact, there are deposits of oil. But when you get \nto a State such as Florida, there have been several dry holes, and the \ngeology shows very little oil, plus we have the adverse interests.\n  Now, why do we have to keep going through this drill over and over? \nIt is because the oil companies are insatiable. Do we not remember what \nwe did just a year and a half ago, where the oil interests wanted to \ndrill toward Tampa, FL, 2 million acres? We worked out a compromise--\nwhich wasn't 2 million acres, it was 8.3 million acres--but we kept it \nfurther to the south, away from the military training and testing area, \nwhere you cannot put oil rigs on the surface of the water, where we \nhave our largest training and testing area in the world for our U.S. \nmilitary. That is where we are training pilots for the F-22, where we \ntrain all of the pilots for the new Joint Strike Fighter being \ndeveloped. That is where we are testing some of the most sophisticated \nweapons. That is because we have the area that is restricted airspace. \nAs you are shooting that live ordnance and you are testing in your \nresearch and development of weapons systems, you cannot have oil rigs \ndown there on the surface of the Gulf of Mexico. We etched that into \nlaw.\n  But here we go again. Having gone through this and having the oil \nindustry have 33 million acres that is already available for lease but \nhas not been drilled, they want to make an exception and are using the \nscare of this $4 gas--maybe going to $5 gas--in order to do that. That \nis wrong, and we ought to put a stop to it.\n  Here is the greatest wrong it perpetuates. What it does is it keeps \nus in the same old mindset where we stay married to oil. The emphasis \nis drill, drill, drill to solve the problem, as evidenced by $5 gas, \nwhen, in fact, that is not going to solve our problem. What is going to \nsolve our problem is using our technology to go to alternative fuels. \nWhat is going to solve our problem is to go to renewables. What is \ngoing to solve our problem is going to be to have a new President of \nthe United States who says he is going to commit to making the United \nStates independent of foreign oil, of which we now import 60 percent \nfor our daily consumption from places such as Nigeria, Venezuela, and \nthe Persian Gulf.\n  So what we have to do is change the mindset of the old way of doing \nthings, which this amendment by the Senator from Louisiana is \nsuggestive of; that is, to go to the alternative fuels, to go to a \nserious research and development program for a new engine on down the \nline, to encourage the increase of miles per gallon. In Japan, they are \ndriving cars that get 50 miles per gallon. In Europe, they are driving \ncars, on a fleet average, that are getting in the area of 40 miles per \ngallon. Why can't the United States--if we had the political will--\nchange our way of doing things as oil guzzlers through our consumption \nin our personal vehicles? We can if we have the political will.\n  Mr. VITTER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I appreciate the Senator from Louisiana asking \nme to yield. But I have a lot on my mind, and the Senator has already \nhad his 15 minutes, so this Senator is going to complete his thoughts.\n  So here we go again. The emphasis is drill, drill, drill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Well, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized. The \nSenator has 3 minutes.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, if I can briefly respond on my own time--\nand I invite a conversation or colloquy with the distinguished Senator \nfrom Florida--I hope the distinguished Senator realizes that in this \nproposal, in order for any offshore drilling to take place, both the \nGovernor and the State legislature of the host State have to say, yes, \nwe want it. That is an absolute requirement under this proposal. The \ndistinguished Senator from Florida knows Florida politics far better \nthan I, but based on everything I know, that is not going to happen in \nFlorida, including under Republican Governors and Republican \nlegislatures, anytime soon. So I don't understand why he considers this \na threat to the State of Florida, because they are in absolute control \nof their own destiny under the details of my motion. If the Senator has \na response to that simple fact, I would love to hear it and engage in a \ndiscussion.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, I am \nvery grateful to him for giving me this opportunity. When it comes to \nthe defense interests of the United States, I think it would be folly \nto allow a State legislature to impose their will with regard to the \ndefense interests. This Senator has already given the example of the \nlargest testing and training area in the world for the U.S. military, \nwhich is the Gulf of Mexico off of Florida, which we have prohibited in \nlaw from being drilled.\n  Let's take, for example, the Atlantic coast of Florida. Thirty years \nago, this Senator had to oppose the Secretary of the Interior James \nWatt from drilling off the east coast. The only way this Senator was \nable to beat him then was because it finally dawned on the \nadministration that we were launching from the Cape Canaveral Air Force \nstation from west to east and launching from the Kennedy Space Center \nfrom west to east, therefore dropping the solid rocket boosters into \nthe Atlantic Ocean along with the first stages of the expendable \nbooster rocket out of the Air Force station, and that, in fact, we \ncannot have oil rigs down there.\n  So a State legislature might well not understand and be able to \nimpose its will on the security interests of the U.S. Government.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, if I can reclaim my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. VITTER. I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional minute since I \nseemed to cede all my time.\n\n[[Page S4263]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the time is reserved \nto the manager. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I will allow the Senator an additional minute if the \nSenator in opposition will be given an additional minute as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. VITTER. I thank the Chair.\n  Quite honestly, I am not sure I understood that response. My simple \npoint was that Florida under my motion is in control of its own \ndestiny, and if Florida doesn't want drilling, the Governor and the \nState legislature, Florida doesn't get drilling.\n  There is a little bit of caveat to that. I think the Cubans are going \nto drill off Florida if we do nothing. That is moving forward anyway. \nOr the Chinese through Cuba. But otherwise, Florida doesn't get \ndrilling.\n  My other response is, here we are caught in a stale debate again. It \nisn't either/or. It isn't oil and gas or alternative fuels. Our energy \npicture is so challenging it clearly has to be both. We need a future \nof new fuels and new technology. We also need to get to that future in \nthe short and medium term. We need to do both things on the demand and \nthe supply side. Let's start acting for the good of the American \npeople.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I say to my friend, the Senator \nfrom Louisiana, perhaps since he is from the gulf coast, he does not \nunderstand that all the way up the Atlantic seaboard, there are areas \nwith restricted airspace where live fire training is done. A State \nlegislature would not necessarily be attuned to the security interests \nof the U.S. Government.\n  If a State legislature were at the beck and call of a particular \nlobby--in this case the oil industry--wanting to drill, it would be at \ncross-purposes with the security interests in many of those regions off \nFlorida, off Georgia, off the Carolinas, off Virginia, and further up \nthe seaboard and, therefore, would have a veto over the U.S. \nGovernment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Under the previous order, there is now 4 minutes equally divided.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we turn to two \nother items that need to be taken up prior to the time limit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          Motions to Instruct\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I send two motions to the desk dealing with \nbudget enforcement. I ask they be reported in seriatim.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the motions.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. Gregg] moves that the \n     conferees on the part of the Senate on the disagreeing votes \n     of the two Houses on the concurrent resolution S. Con. Res. \n     70 (the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year \n     2009) be instructed to insist on the inclusion in the final \n     conference report the point of order against the \n     consideration of a budget resolution in the Senate that does \n     not contain a section regarding gross federal debt disclosure \n     as contained in section 223 of the concurrent resolution as \n     passed by the Senate, and further, that the conferees be \n     instructed to include a debt disclosure section in the final \n     conference report that itemizes the overall debt increase and \n     the per person debt increase assumed by the final conference \n     report.\n       The Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. Gregg] moves that the \n     conferees on the part of the Senate on the disagreeing votes \n     of the two Houses on the concurrent resolution S. Con. Res. \n     70 (the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year \n     2009) be instructed to insist that the final conference \n     report include the individual points of order that empowers \n     the Senate to prevent future budget resolutions from raiding \n     Social Security; enforces transparency during Senate \n     consideration of the congressional budget by requiring \n     disclosure of the gross federal debt held by the nation; \n     strengthens the integrity of the reconciliation process; and \n     provides an additional tool to thwart any net increase in \n     deficits in the long term (four ten-year periods after 2018), \n     as contained in sections 226, 223/224, 202 and 201, \n     respectively, of the concurrent resolution as passed by the \n     Senate.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, these are two motions, one of which says \nthat under the rules of the budget, there will be a disclosure of the \ndebt owed by the United States in a manner that is comprehensible.\n  Right now the budget is a very hard, very complex document to read \nfor those of us who are involved in it, but it is extremely difficult \nto glean what actually is the debt and how the debt relates to the \noverall budget. The first motion says that will be made clearer for the \npurpose of transparency.\n  The second motion has four elements. The first one is a point of \norder that says the budget resolution, which will be live, does not put \nus on a path to a balanced budget over a 5-year period. The second one \nis a point of order against a reconciliation bill which spends more \nthan 20 percent of what it saves. The third is a point of order against \na budget resolution that does not provide a debt disclosure statement, \nsuch as the first motion included. And fourth is a long-term deficit \npoint of order that should prohibit any deficit increases outside the \nbudget window.\n  I talked about these with the chairman. The chairman seems amenable \nto accepting these motions. I hope they can be accepted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, the first motion I like very much, the \ndebt disclosure. I think that would be a very useful item for Members \nof Congress and for the people of the country. So I readily accept \nmotion No. 1. Can we accept that motion by a voice vote?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion of \nthe Senator from New Hampshire, Mr. Gregg, on debt disclosure.\n  The motion was agreed to.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, on the second motion, we have no objection \non this side to adopting that motion by unanimous consent.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the second \nmotion be adopted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The motion was agreed to.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Chair, and I thank my colleague very much. I \nthank Senator Gregg. We have had an interesting day. Senator Gregg, we \ncan see by his head with that nasty bruise, is bloodied but unbowed.\n  Mr. GREGG. That came from the farm bill.\n  Mr. CONRAD. He said he got hit by a farmer with a lamb chop or \nasparagus, I don't know which.\n  Mr. GREGG. It must have been asparagus.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I think we are ready to proceed to vote.\n  Mr. GREGG. We are. I suggest we have 2 minutes equally divided before \neach vote to explain what we are voting on for our colleagues.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I think that is fair.\n  Mr. GREGG. And after the first vote, the votes be 10 minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I think we would be well advised as well. We advise \ncolleagues, after the first vote, there will be 10 minutes. We will \nhave eight votes. Typically, that will take us 3 hours. If Members will \ncome and stay here, we can conceivably get done in 2\\1/2\\ hours. It is \nup to the Members whether we are able to do that.\n  With that, I go to my colleague for an explanation of the first \nmotion.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, it being my motion, I am sure the chairman \nwould like to go first.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I will be happy to go first. The Senator is talking about \nthis being the biggest tax increase in history. That is the same speech \nhe gave last year. We can now check the record and see what actually \nhappened and, lo and behold, there was not the biggest tax increase \never. In fact, there was no tax increase. In fact, there were tax cuts. \nThe Democrats in both Houses of Congress cut taxes by $194 billion.\n  In this legislation before us, we have no tax increases. We have \nadditional tax reductions. Included in this resolution are the middle-\nclass tax cuts, the marriage penalty relief, the child tax credit, the \n10-percent bracket, further alternative minimum tax relief, estate tax \nreform, energy and education, property tax relief, and extenders.\n  The difference in revenue, which is only 2.6 percent between our bill \nand the President's, can completely be met by closing down these \noffshore tax havens, abusive tax shelters, and aggressively going after \nthe tax gap, the difference between what some owe and what they are \nfailing to pay.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, there is a tax increase in this resolution. \nIf there\n\n[[Page S4264]]\n\nisn't, then the budget doesn't make any sense because it assumes $1.2 \ntrillion of new revenues in order to reach its targets, and that means \n78 million taxpayers who don't pay taxes today are going to end up \npaying taxes under this budget.\n  It means a working family of four with $50,000 income will end up \nwith a $2,300 tax bill increase in 2011. It means a single mom with two \nkids earning $30,000 will have a $1,000 tax increase in 2011. It means \nthat 18 million senior citizens will have their taxes increased by over \n$2,000, and that 27 million small businesses will have their taxes \nincreased by over $4,000 in the year 2011.\n  The simple fact is this budget assumes massive tax increases, the \nlargest tax increase in the history of the world. I hope people will \noppose that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the question is now \non agreeing to the motion of the Senator from New Hampshire, Mr. Gregg.\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from New York (Mrs. Clinton) \nand the Senator from Illinois (Mr. Obama) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. KYL. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Tennessee (Mr. Alexander), the Senator from Tennessee (Mr. \nCorker), and the Senator from Arizona (Mr. McCain).\n  Further, if present and voting, the Senator from Tennessee (Mr. \nAlexander) would have voted ``aye.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. (Mr. Nelson of Florida). Are there any other \nSenators in the Chamber desiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 44, nays 51, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 131 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--44\n\n     Allard\n     Barrasso\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burr\n     Chambliss\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeMint\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Isakson\n     Kyl\n     Lugar\n     Martinez\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Roberts\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Thune\n     Vitter\n     Warner\n     Wicker\n\n                                NAYS--51\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Brown\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Cardin\n     Carper\n     Casey\n     Conrad\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Harkin\n     Inouye\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Klobuchar\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     McCaskill\n     Menendez\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Salazar\n     Sanders\n     Schumer\n     Snowe\n     Stabenow\n     Tester\n     Voinovich\n     Webb\n     Whitehouse\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--5\n\n     Alexander\n     Clinton\n     Corker\n     McCain\n     Obama\n  The motion was rejected.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is about to \nexplain what is going to happen in the next few minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, two of our colleagues and a third, \ncounting me, have very graciously agreed to take voice votes to shorten \nthis process. Now we will turn to Senator Kyl for an explanation of his \nmotion.\n  Mr. KYL. Both the chairman of the committee and I have resolutions \nthat are almost identical. They both call for us to extend the so-\ncalled patch for the alternative minimum tax which otherwise would \naffect about 26 million taxpayers this year; to extend the so-called \ntax extenders package that has tax provisions like the R tax credit \nin it for another year, and to do so without raising taxes.\n  The addition on the Conrad motion is to use our best efforts to shut \ndown abusive tax shelters, address offshore tax havens, and to close \nthe tax gap.\n  Since I assume we are all for ending any waste, fraud, and abuse, I \ncannot disagree. I would be pleased to take votes on both of these \nmotions by voice vote.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank Senator Kyl for his willingness to \ndo this on a voice vote. He has described the amendments well. I see no \npurpose in further discussion.\n  I ask for a voice vote on the Conrad and Kyl motions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion \noffered by the Senator from Arizona, Mr. Kyl, on the AMT.\n  The motion was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion \noffered by the Senator from North Dakota, Mr. Conrad, on the AMT.\n  The motion was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from South \nCarolina, Mr. Graham, has a motion on nuclear energy. The Senator from \nSouth Carolina has also graciously agreed to take it on a voice vote.\n  Would the Senator like to take 30 seconds to explain the motion?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. No.\n  Mr. CONRAD. The Senator from South Carolina continues to rise in the \njudgment of his colleagues.\n  Can we then go to a voice vote on the Graham motion?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion \noffered by the Senator from South Carolina, Mr. Graham, on nuclear \nenergy.\n  The motion was agreed to.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, that takes us to the Boxer motion on cap \nand trade. We have 2 minutes equally divided. These are motions that \nwill require votes, the Boxer and DeMint motions.\n  If the Senator from California would take time to explain her motion.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, colleagues, I hope you pay attention to \nthis because there are two motions that deal with global warming. The \nfirst one is the Boxer motion, and what it says is, we should not enact \nany global warming legislation until we address the issue of goods \nimported from nations such as India and China, countries that do not \nhave their own global warming program. So we protect our people and yet \nwe allow global warming legislation to proceed.\n  Senator DeMint's motion is a back-to-the-future motion. He basically \nsays we can do nothing--nothing--until India and China act. This is \nwrong. We should not be held hostage to the actions of China and India \nor any other nation when it comes to our own country, when it comes to \nan issue which is so serious that even the administration, that has \nbeen kind of dragging on this, yesterday found that global warming is \nthreatening a beautiful species called the polar bear.\n  We do not want to be held hostage to India and China. Vote aye on the \nBoxer motion, and no on the DeMint motion.\n  Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, my motion has been mischaracterized, I am \nafraid. I am opposed to the Boxer motion because it would clearly, from \nthe language, add tariffs or some kind of penalties to imports from \naround the world, unless emissions standards in other countries match \nours, I guess, exactly.\n  This would add to the cost of products that are purchased by \nAmericans. My motion is one that tries to keep jobs in this country. \nUnfortunately, my colleague is suggesting, I am afraid, as many have \nover the years, that we have two false choices. We either have a good \neconomy or we have a good environment. Those are not the choices.\n  In fact, my motion would allow us to continue to develop nuclear \ngeneration, which is good for the environment and the economy, or \nhydrogen cars or electric cars or hybrid cars. Most of what we can do \nis good for the environment and improves the economy. My motion simply \nsays: We cannot pass legislation unless other countries go along, \notherwise we are exporting jobs and pollution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is agreeing to the motion of the \nSenator from California, Mrs. Boxer.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n\n[[Page S4265]]\n\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes equally divided prior to a vote on the motion to instruct \noffered by the Senator from South Carolina, Mr. DeMint.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, during the last vote, some of my \nRepublican and Democratic colleagues asked me if it didn't make sense \nto vote for both these motions. Both understand we need to be careful \nin mandates that hurt our economy and jobs, unless we recognize what \nother countries are doing when they are polluting.\n  My motion focuses on here at home. I want to make sure folks \nunderstand what it is about.\n  Most of the things we can do to improve our environment and to stop \nCO2 emissions can actually improve our economy. We know, as \nwe try to build dozens, if not hundreds, of nuclear plants, it will \ncreate new jobs all over the country and improve our economy, just as \nEurope has done. Solar panels and wind, as well as hybrid cars and \nhydrogen fuel--all of these things are good for the economy and energy. \nMy motion--\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Could I get another minute?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DeMINT. I thank the Chair.\n  My motion does not affect any of the attempts to reduce \nCO2 emissions except when we know it is hurting the economy \nand hurting jobs. In that case, we cannot move ahead with penalties and \nmandates unless China and India--the two largest polluting countries--\nhave similar emissions standards. So it is just a ``hold on,'' let's \nnot hurt our economy and ourselves. There are many ways we can reduce \nCO2 emissions without hurting jobs in this country.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support this motion.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, how much additional time did Senator \nDeMint get?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator had an additional \\1/2\\ minute.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Then, Mr. President, I would ask for the same amount of \ntime, equally divided, between myself and Senator Warner.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. What is the request of the Senator?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I have the \nsame amount of time Senator DeMint had, divided equally between myself \nand Senator Warner.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to 1 minute being equally \ndivided between Senator Boxer and Senator Warner?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. If the Presiding Officer will tell me when I have used \nhalf the time so I can stop.\n  Colleagues, this is a very important vote. We already voted to level \nthe playing field for America in that last vote so that countries \ncannot take advantage of us. But I have to say, this motion would hold \nthis Nation hostage to China and India. Since when do we wait around \nfor countries such as China to act on human rights issues, on economic \nissues, on environmental issues? That is not America.\n  I believe this is a motion that looks to fear, not hope. This is the \ngreatest country on Earth, and I do not think we should tell ourselves \nwe can do nothing about a pressing issue until a foreign country acts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used half the time.\n  The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I have been working with Senator Boxer and \nSenator Lieberman for almost 10 months on a bill with regard to global \nclimate change. This week--perhaps tomorrow or the first of next week--\nwe will offer a managers' amendment which will address the important \nissues my colleague raises.\n  I simply ask this Chamber to consider that when our bill comes up \nthere will be ample opportunity to address your issues and that we have \na provision in the managers' amendment giving the President of the \nUnited States the chance to proceed to correct the very things the \nSenator seeks to be corrected with his motion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion of the Senator from South \nCarolina, Mr. DeMint.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are now 2 minutes equally divided prior \nto the vote on the motion to instruct by the Senator from Louisiana.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, this motion is very straightforward. It \ncreates a reserve fund in support of the following bill, a bill that \nwould say: If the price at the pump, the price of gasoline reaches $5 a \ngallon--if it reaches $5 a gallon--then we are going to allow \nexploration and production off our coasts in the Outer Continental \nShelf, but only if two conditions are met. No. 1, the host State wants \nit; the Governor and the State legislature of the host State say yes, \nwe want that activity; and No. 2, the host State gets a fair revenue \nshare of 37.5 percent which is the policy and the precedent we set \nabout 2 years ago.\n  It would also ensure that nothing in this bill would disrupt military \ntraining, military activity off the coast, and that also a host State \ncould decide to do natural gas only.\n  We can't drill our way out of this energy problem, but increased \ndomestic supply is part of the solution. We need a new energy future, \nbut we also need to get to that future.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, what the Senator didn't say is \nthat this puts a State's veto power over the U.S. Government as to its \nsecurity arrangements in restricted areas off the coast which you never \nwant to put at stake.\n  What the Senator also didn't tell you is there are already 31 million \nacres offshore that are ready for lease that have not been drilled.\n  I yield to the Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, the Senate has on three different \noccasions over the last year defeated similar efforts to end the 26-\nyear bipartisan moratoria on the Outer Continental Shelf. This is \nanother attempt to get at it. Even the Energy Information \nAdministration projects that if we opened the entire east and west \ncoasts, we wouldn't achieve anything because it would take up to 2017 \nto ramp up and 2030 to actually achieve results.\n  So this isn't about gas prices; this is about tapping into another \nvein of oil, continuing our addiction, and putting our shores at risk.\n  I urge my colleagues, particularly from coastal States, to oppose it.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be a cosponsor \nof the motion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be a cosponsor \nof the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  All time has expired.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion of the Senator from \nLouisiana, Mr. Vitter.\n  Mr. GREGG.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote, and I move to \nlay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, for all Senators, I have been talking this \nafternoon with Senators Kennedy, Enzi, Gregg, and McConnell, of course. \nWe believe it would be in the best interests of the Senate to vitiate \nthe cloture vote in the morning. Senator Kennedy and Enzi have agreed \nto continue working on the firefighters bill. Yesterday, it was \ninterrupted by the farm bill, and the Graham amendment was an \ninterruption.\n  As I have said on a number of occasions, there is not more of a \ngentleman in the Senate than Mike Enzi. He felt aggrieved--that is my \nword, not his--and he needs more time on this. Again, I have talked to \nhim and Senator Kennedy. They believe they can get from here to there \nand work out something so that we can wind up completing the bill.\n  I have asked the managers to work together to see if they can reach \nagreement on the process that will permit the Senate to complete action \non the bill in a timely way.\n  Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that the cloture vote be withdrawn \nwith respect to H.R. 980.\n\n\n =========================== NOTE =========================== \n\n  \n  On Page S4266, May 15, 2008, the Record reads: . . . with \nrespect to H.

Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, let me further say that when these two good \nSenators come back to me with that process, I will confer with the \nRepublican leader, and then I will make a decision when to return to \nthis. I favor this a lot. I think it is a great piece of legislation. I \nhope we can complete it.\n  We should continue the bipartisan approach we have had up to this \ntime on that legislation. I appreciate the understanding of the Senate \nin allowing us to approach this in a different way. This is not unique. \nWe have done it on other occasions. For a lot of reasons, cloture would \nnot be invoked tomorrow. I think people favor this legislation and they \nwould vote for cloture if there is more of an opportunity to work on \namendments. I appreciate the cooperation of everybody.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, if I may add, I think the majority \nleader has made a wise decision, after consultation with both sides. \nCloture would not have been invoked tomorrow. Senators Kennedy and Enzi \ncan work out an orderly process. I think it is an approach that I \napplaud and recommend.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I wish to personally thank the two \nleaders and Senator Enzi. This is important legislation involving \nnational security. I am grateful for the opportunity to work with my \nfriend and colleague, Senator Enzi, to try to make recommendations here \nin the Senate. I\n\n[[Page S4267]]\n\nknow there are diverse views on this issue. We will try to work out an \norderly procedure so that Members will be able to get their views out \nand considered in the Senate and do it in a timely way.\n  Again, I thank the two leaders and the Senator from Wyoming as well \nfor his cooperation, as always.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n\n\n               UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT--S.J. RES. 28\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that, upon \ndisposition of the House message on S. Con. Res. 70, the Senate proceed \nto the consideration of Calendar No. 731, S.J. Res. 28, a joint \nresolution disapproving the rule submitted by the FCC with respect to \nbroadcast media ownership, the statutory time be reduced to 2 minutes \nequally divided and controlled between Senators Dorgan and Stevens or \ntheir designees; that upon the use or yielding back of the time, the \nSenate proceed to vote on passage of the joint resolution; provided \nfurther that all remaining provisions of the statute remain in effect. \nI further ask that all statements relating to the matter be printed in \nthe Record prior to the vote on this important piece of legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Finally, as I understand, we have one more rollcall vote we \nare going to have now. There will be no votes tomorrow. This will be \nthe last vote until Tuesday morning, unless someone has an objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is now 2 minutes equally divided prior \nto vote on a motion offered by the Senator from New Hampshire, Mr. \nGregg, on discretionary spending.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, under the budget resolution, spending goes \ndown each and every year as a share of domestic product, 20.8 percent \ndown to 19.1 percent\n  The Senator opposite seeks to make those reductions more steep and \nembrace the President's proposal which would eliminate the COPS \nProgram--not just cut it but eliminate it, a program that puts 100,000 \npolice on the street--cut the Weatherization Assistance Program 100 \npercent at a time of $120 oil; cut the first responder grants--police, \nfire, emergency medical 78 percent; cut community development 24 \npercent; cut clean water 21 percent; cut LIHEAP 15 percent.\n  More than that, because of the way this amendment has been written, \nthis would put defense in the pool to be cut. If you want to do that, \nvote for the Senator's motion. I urge a ``no'' vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I have no charts. I simply have a number: \n$1 trillion. We should draw the line somewhere around here. We should \nsay to the American people: It is time that we exercise fiscal \ndiscipline. Let's do it at $1 trillion. That means that in this budget, \nyou only have to reduce it 1 percent to get back underneath that \nnumber.\n  We don't have to look to the President to do that. We can't, amongst \nourselves, come up with $10 billion of savings on a $1 trillion budget? \nIf we can't, we should all go home.\n  Vote to draw the line at $1 trillion. Vote for the American taxpayer.\n  Mr. President, I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion of \nthe Senator from New Hampshire, Mr. Gregg.\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to the consideration of S.J. Res. 28, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S.J. Res. 28) disapproving the rules \n     submitted by the Federal Communications Commission with \n     respect to broadcast media donorship.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 2 minutes equally divided. The \nSenator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. This is a resolution of disapproval of an FCC rule \ndealing with media ownership. The Commerce Committee has passed this \nout to the floor of the Senate. I will not go into great length on the \nmerits of the issue except to say we have visited this issue \npreviously. I think there is too much concentration in the media. The \nFCC rule moves in exactly the wrong direction, adding more \nconcentration.\n  I ask that Members of the Senate who wish to would be able to make \nstatements that appear prior to this vote. I believe we have agreed to \na voice vote.\n  I yield the floor. I reserve my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. STEVENS.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          Cross Ownership Rule\n\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I rise today to thank my colleague from \nNorth Dakota for his work on media ownership issues and to engage him \nin a colloquy to clarify one point about the resolution of disapproval. \nI note that Senator Dorgan has long been a champion of media localism \nand diversity, issues that are quite important to me as well.\n  Because I believe that the Federal Communications Commission ignored \nCongress's repeated admonitions about following appropriate processes \nin reaching the agency's new cross-ownership rules, I support this \nbipartisan resolution.\n\n[[Page S4268]]\n\n  Yet I believe that if the Senate adopts this resolution, the existing \nwaivers contemplated under the FCC cross-ownership rule should be \nprotected. This means that those waivers would not be a part of this \nresolution.\n  I have significant concerns that if these waivers are not protected, \nthis legislation could harm some media markets and constituents' access \nto news and information in my State of Virginia.\n  I would like to confirm that this resolution, while it would nullify \nthe revised version of the FCC's newspaper cross-ownership ban, would \nnot undo or in any manner change the FCC's decision to grant permanent \nwaivers to five existing newspaper-broadcast combinations, and thus \ngrandfather them, as set forth in paragraphs 77 and 158 of the FCC's \nDecember 18, 2007 Report and Order. It is my understanding that this \nresolution will not affect these five specific waivers, and I would \nlike to clarify this understanding\n  Senator Dorgan, is it your goal and understanding that the waivers \nthat the FCC granted in conjunction with the cross-ownership rule be \nprotected?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Under the Congressional Review Act, the resolution of \ndisapproval is intended to overturn a specific rule, not other parts of \nan agency's order. The waivers are not rules.\n  The resolution is written in a specific way referring to an order, \nbut it is the rule that is nullified. These waivers could have been \ngranted alone or under the previous cross-ownership ban. It is not the \nintention of this resolution to affect the waivers in the order.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \nresolution of disapproval that repeals the recent Federal \nCommunications Commission's media ownership rulemaking.\n  As an original cosponsor of this measure, I applaud Senator Dorgan \nfor once again taking the lead in introducing critical legislation to \noverturn a misguided attempt by the commission to relax crucial media \nownership rules--a move that will only lead to further consolidation \nwithin the industry that will ultimately harm consumers.\n  As my colleagues are well aware, consolidation in the media market \nhas led to fewer locally owned stations, and less local programming and \ncontent. Indeed, it speaks volumes that the number of independent radio \nowners has plunged in the past 11 years by 39 percent.\n  Just in 1996 and 1997 alone, more than 4,400 radio stations were sold \nfollowing the first round of consolidation following passage of The \nTelecommunications Act of 1996. Between 1995 and 2003, ownership of the \ntop 10 largest television stations increased from 104 owners to 299 \nowners.\n  At the same time, we know that locally owned stations aired more \nlocal news and programming than non-locally owned stations--and that is \nnot just me talking. That is according to the FCC's own studies, which \nalso found that smaller station groups overall tended to produce higher \nquality newscasts compared to stations owned by larger companies.\n  So there should be no mistake--fewer independent, local stations mean \nless local content and programming.\n  Minority and women-ownership of media outlets are also at perilously \nlow levels--currently only 6 percent of full-power commercial broadcast \nradio stations are owned by women and 7.7 percent are owned by \nminorities. Ownership of broadcast television is even lower--5 percent \nfor women and only 3.3 percent for minorities. Instead of being a \ncatalyst promoting localism and ownership diversity, the FCC's action \nwill actually hasten the decline in these crucial areas.\n  The Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation last \nfall held a hearing to consider these very issues, and the actions \nrequired for improvement. During that hearing, I and several of my \ncolleagues voiced strong concern about Chairman Martin's intent to ease \ncurrent media ownership rules, particularly because of the potential \nimpact on localism and diversity in broadcasting.\n  That is why I, along with many committee members, joined Senators \nDorgan and Lott in introducing The Media Ownership Act of 2007, which \nwas reported out of the committee favorably in December. This \nconstitutes yet another step in the mounting opposition to the \nloosening of these crucial rules. We had hoped that Chairman Martin \nwould heed not only our urgings, but the concerns expressed by the \nAmerican public, and complete the 4-year-old rulemaking on localism.\n  However, on November 13, less than a week after that hearing, the \nChairman issued a new proposal to lift the 32-year-old newspaper-\nbroadcast cross-ownership ban in the top 20 media markets. Worse still, \nthe FCC allowed only 28 days for the public to comment on the proposal \nwhen it has historically provided 60 to 90 days on pivotal matters such \nas this.\n\n  Clearly, the FCC's actions demonstrate a litany of highly-misguided \npriorities that neglect to consider the full impact of the FCC's rule \nchange on the American people. Therefore, this resolution of \ndisapproval is necessary to rescind this haphazard approach.\n  I must say it feels a little like deja vu all over again, when nearly \n5 years ago the FCC attempted a similar effort to relax another set of \nmedia ownership rules. And fittingly, the opposition to the \ncommission's attempt then mirrors the opposition that is coalescing \nnow. And the action we are considering now is reminiscent of the joint \nresolution passed by the U.S. Senate in September 2003, which I \ncosponsored, condemning the Commission's efforts to rewrite those \nrules.\n  So that naturally begs the question--why would the commission \ncontinue to attempt to weaken media ownership rules when the American \npublic has vociferously opposed these efforts time and again? When the \nU.S. Congress in 2004 enacted a statute prohibiting the FCC from \nraising national ownership limits above 39 percent? When the Third \nCircuit Court of Appeals rejected as arbitrary and capricious this \nattempt at revising the rules after finding the FCC had no factual \nbasis for the limits it set? We deserve an answer.\n  Many proponents for relaxing media ownership rules have pointed to \nthe precipitous decline of the newspaper industry as the reason change \nis mandatory. They have even cited a recent report by the Newspaper \nAssociation of America, NAA, which found print ad revenue for the \nindustry fell by 9.4 percent last year--the biggest decline since it \nstarted keeping records in 1950.\n  However, what these proponents are neglecting to mention is that the \nNAA also found that online newspaper advertising revenue increased 19 \npercent last year.\n  Furthermore the NAA president and CEO John Sturm stated ``newspaper \npublishers are continuing to drive strong revenue growth from their \nincreasingly robust Web platforms.'' This hardly sounds like an \nindustry in irreversible peril if this longstanding rule remains in \nplace.\n  Opponents of this resolution will also argue that the FCC crafted a \nvery narrow revision, lifting the cross-ownership ban for only the top \n20 media markets, so this resolution is unnecessary. However, the FCC \nalso adopted ``four factors'' and two broad ``special circumstances'' \nthat would allow this ban to be lifted for a station in any media \nmarket.\n  These scenarios and factors include evaluating financial condition, \npossible increased local news, as well as existing market media \nconcentration, and news independency. Given the vagueness and loopholes \nthat exist with the rulemaking, the ``high hurdle'' that the Commission \nhas supposedly set for proposed combinations could be easily cleared by \nusing only a stepladder.\n  Preventing further media consolidation has been a bipartisan effort, \nand the resolution before us today is no different. We must not allow \nthe indispensable role the media plays in promoting diversity and \nlocalism to be further marginalized and miniaturized by unchecked \nconsolidation within the industry.\n  We owe it to the American people to restore confidence in the FCC's \ncommitment not only to uphold the public interest but to advance it and \nstrengthen it. That is why it is undeniably incumbent upon the \ncommission members to revisit these rules and establish a set of \nstandards that will effectively promote localism and minority and \nwomen-ownership, not more media consolidation. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this resolution.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, today we are considering a critical\n\n[[Page S4269]]\n\npiece of legislation. The resolution of disapproval is critical to the \ndiversity of our media and I would like to thank Senator Dorgan for his \nleadership on the issue. In December, the FCC pushed through new media \nownership rules on a partisan three to two vote. The proposal strips \nnewspaper-broadcast cross-ownership rules that have protected diversity \nfor 32 years in the top 20 markets.\n  This proposal has been described by the chairman as a modest rules \nchange. That since it is restricted to the top 20 markets, and since it \nonly applies to television stations not in the top 4 in ratings in \nthose markets, its some sort of compromise. The reality is that is \nsimply not true.\n  To begin with, 44 percent of Americans live in the top 20 markets. \nThis includes my State of New Jersey, which is split by two of the \nlargest markets in the country. And there are a number of loopholes in \nthe rule. Companies looking to consolidate either outside the top 20 \nmarkets or to purchase one of the 4 largest stations need only be \ngranted a waiver from the FCC.\n  The standards for granting these waivers are vague at best. Here is \nan example: one of the standards a company must show in order for a \nwaiver to be granted is whether the broadcast station has enough \neditorial independence. How does anybody quantify that?\n  The fact is there is no way to objectively judge the parameters \nChairman Martin's rule requires to grant the waivers. This means that \ndepending on who is running the FCC, a waiver can be granted in any \nmarket or for any station. As Commissioner Adelstein put it so \nappropriately, this proposal is nothing more than a wolf in sheep's \nclothing.\n  While the FCC devotes its resources to opening up more loopholes for \nconsolidation, the commission has done virtually nothing to address the \nissue of minority ownership. The reality of diversity in our Nation's \nbroadcast ownership is a far cry from the reality in which we live.\n  Despite making up 35 percent of the population and owning roughly 18 \npercent of all nonfarm businesses, minorities currently own only 3 \npercent of all broadcast TV stations.\n  It is in the best interests of our democracy that media ownership \nreflect the wealth of this Nation's diversity. As a public trustee of \nthe broadcast spectrum, it is the responsibility of the FCC to advocate \non behalf of women and minorities.\n  Yet this Commission under President Bush has failed in this pursuit. \nIn fact, the FCC has so mishandled the issue, nobody even uses their \nstatistics on minority ownership anymore. The best estimates we have on \nminority ownership have to come from outside groups because the FCC \nsimply doesn't have accurate reporting numbers.\n  In 2000, the FCC released five studies conducted to help the \ncommission comply with its own regulations that require the elimination \nof market-entry barriers for small business. These studies largely \nfound that media consolidation negatively impacted minority ownership, \nand noted that minority owners face historic barriers to accessing \ncapital from lending institutions to purchase broadcast outlets. But \nrather than act on these studies to address the underlying problems, \nthe FCC took 4 years to even issue a notice for public comment.\n  So today we have a chance to overturn a misguided decision by the \nFCC. And we have a chance to tell the Commission that rather than spend \ntheir time on finding loopholes for major media corporations to buy up \nmore outlets throughout our country, the FCC should be working to its \ncharge as the trustee for America's airwaves.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S.J. Res. 28, a \njoint resolution disapproving the Federal Communications Commission, \nFCC, rule relaxing newspaper-broadcast media cross-ownership.\n  Like many of my colleagues, I am deeply troubled by the FCC's \nrulemaking that would allow greater consolidation of our media. The \nmedia is a tremendous force in our society. It can inform, educate, and \nentertain, as well as nourish our democratic dialogue. Unfortunately, \nthe media also has less savory powers.\n  In recent years, we have seen an increase in coarse and violent \nprogramming, coupled with a decrease in local news and hardhitting \njournalism. To say these trends are not in the best interest of the \nAmerican people, and especially our youngest citizens, is clearly an \nunderstatement.\n  In addition, as corporate ownership over our media grows more \nconcentrated, we see less and less of the diversity of our Nation. When \nprogramming is the same from coast to coast, our airwaves will no \nlonger reflect the rich mosaic of our country and our citizens. Such a \nlandscape should prompt the FCC to act with an overabundance of \ncaution, but it has not.\n  Five years ago, the FCC substantially relaxed the rules that govern \nmedia ownership in this country. Millions of Americans contacted the \nFCC to complain. The U.S. Senate voted to support a ``resolution of \ndisapproval'' in response to the FCC's decision. Next, the courts got \ninvolved, and the Third Circuit Court of Appeals shipped the agency's \nhandiwork right back to the FCC.\n  In 2006, the FCC began a new rulemaking, and in November of 2007, the \nCommerce Committee held a hearing to discuss the effects of \nconsolidation on localism and diversity in news and entertainment.\n  Over the following month, the Senate made clear to the Commission \nthat it had serious concerns about the FCC's process and its apparent \nrush to issue a new rule. But on December 18, 2007, over the objections \nof Commissioners Michael Copps and Jonathan Adelstein, the FCC approved \na relaxed set of ownership rules under which newspaper- broadcast \ncross-ownership is permissible in the top 20 markets.\n  I commend Senator Dorgan for introducing S.J. Res. 28, a joint \nresolution disapproving the FCC rule. I am pleased to join him as a \ncosponsor of this resolution. I hope that my colleagues will join me in \nsupporting S.J. Res. 28.\n  Together we can send a strong and united message that media diversity \nis clearly in the national interest and that the U.S. Senate will \ndefend that interest with all the tools at its disposal.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask that I be recorded as voting no \non S.J. Res. 28, a resolution disapproving the rule submitted by the \nFederal Communications Commission with respect to broadcast media \nownership.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the resolution \nof disapproval of the Federal Communications Commission, FCC, recently \nissued rules on media cross-ownership. I want to commend my colleague \nfrom North Dakota for his leadership on this most important of issues. \nThis resolution will nullify the ill-considered and hastily-passed \nrules pushed through by the FCC in December of last year.\n  Over the last several years, the effects of media consolidation have \nbecome extremely clear to the American people: Less local control and \ncommunity-oriented programming; less independently produced \nprogramming; fewer divergent views and opinions; fewer minority-owned \nbroadcast stations.\n  And now, the FCC has green-lighted further media concentration by \nvoting to overturn a 32-year-old rule prohibiting the cross-ownership \nof newspapers and broadcast stations--a rule that could impact markets \nin which nearly half of the American public lives and works.\n  Put simply, the FCC rule change would harm local and independent \nowners and help big media owners. In particular, the change further \ndisadvantages minority media owners. While such owners control a mere 3 \npercent of the Nation's commercial TV stations, as many as 90 percent \nof minority media owners would be subject to these new rules. Further \nconsolidation will simply reduce the number of opportunities for \nminorities to enter the market while putting those already in the \nmarket more at risk of being forced out by larger media conglomerates.\n  The FCC argues that this rule is necessary to ``save'' the newspaper \nindustry. But as an internal FCC study showed, despite all the stories \nwe are hearing about newspaper cutbacks, publicly traded newspapers \nearn 16 to 18 percent annual rates of return. An internal FCC memo \nfound the industry as a whole to be profitable. That is to say nothing \nof the fact that the FCC has given no compelling reason for it to be in \nthe newspaper business in the\n\n[[Page S4270]]\n\nfirst place. The FCC regulates the broadcast airwaves--and it should \nremain that way.\n  Perhaps most disturbing is the way the FCC went about implementing \nthis radical new rule. First, it completely ignored Congress's \nbipartisan bill, the Media Ownership Act, of which I am a proud \ncosponsor. Then it ignored the public. Indeed, the Chairman's proposed \nrule changes were first made public in an op-ed he published in the New \nYork Times outlining the changes for the first time--which might have \nbeen helpful had the public comment period not already closed the day \nhis column appeared.\n  Public comments are not merely a formality, Mr. President--they are a \nvital piece of the rulemaking process and an integral part of \nresponsive, open government. Five years ago, more than 3 million \nAmericans spoke out when the FCC voted without any public input \nwhatsoever to allow a single company to own up to three television \nstations, a local newspaper, a cable system, and as many as eight radio \nstations in a single media market. In large part because of the public \noutcry, the courts overturned the rules.\n  Mr. President, it isn't more consolidation and homogenization the \nAmerican people want from their media--it is less. No one can seriously \nargue that the consolidation of the media in recent years has been a \ngood development for the fourth estate. As coverage has become \nincreasingly superficial, people wonder more than ever about the \nquality of the information they are receiving from the media. And quite \nfrankly, I do not blame them.\n  Must we act to ensure the strength and vitality of the American media \nin the 21st century? Absolutely. But that should be accomplished within \nan open and transparent framework as prescribed in the Media Ownership \nAct--a process that gives the public a voice in this fight. As the \nSenator from North Dakota has said, ``Localism and diversity of media \nownership is vital in a democracy.''\n  Indeed it is, Mr. President. It is time to tell the FCC that this is \nno way to maintain a free, open and diverse media, and I urge all my \ncolleagues to support this resolution of disapproval.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask the Senator from Washington to use the remainder of \nmy time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise, obviously, to encourage my \ncolleagues here. This is an issue we dealt with before. While media \nconsolidation might be good for Wall Street, it is not good for Main \nStreet. The diversity of voices has been a key component to our \nsociety, and preserving them by making sure we don't have a \nconsolidation of media is very important.\n  I urge my colleagues to disapprove of the FCC rule on media \nconsolidation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  The question is on the passage of the joint resolution.\n  The joint resolution (S.J. Res. 28) was ordered to be engrossed for a \nthird reading, was read the third time, and passed, as follows:\n\n                              S.J. Res. 28\n\n       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the \n     United States of America in Congress assembled, That Congress \n     disapproves the rule submitted by the Federal Communications \n     Commission relating to broadcast media ownership (Report and \n     Order FCC 07-216), received by Congress on February 22, 2008, \n     and such rule shall have no force or effect.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote and I move \nto lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/15/senate-section/article/S4270-1", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4270]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. DORGAN.

Mr. President, for those who may not have observed that \nvoice vote, it was a very positive result for the voices of America \nsupporting diversity. I want to spend a few minutes talking about this \nissue, to make sure we give it the due consideration that is important.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I wonder if the Senator from Washington will yield for a \nquestion. I have to leave the Chamber due to another event.\n  First, I thank the Senator from Washington. Senator Cantwell has been \nunbelievably strong and supportive in getting us to this point of \nhaving passed the resolution of disapproval. We got it through the \nCommerce Committee. She was a leader in that effort. We now have voice \nvoted it. It has passed the Senate.\n  I did want to say, as I said earlier, the issue here is simple. We \nhave far too much concentration in the media. The Federal \nCommunications Commission, at least the Chairman and two others who \nhave been members, have become cheerleaders of more concentration. That \nmeans less localism. It means your local radio station, in many cases \nyour television station, other media outlets, are run by somebody \nliving 1,500 miles away, running homogenized music through a radio \nstation having nothing to do with covering the local baseball team or \nnews events. I think this moves in exactly the wrong direction. I \nbelieve there needs to be more localism and I think there has to be a \nprocedure on localism at the Federal Communications Commission. There \nneed to be public interest standards with respect to broadcasters that \ndo not now exist. The standards have been emasculated. We have a lot to \ndo to put this back on track.\n  Suffice it to say, the FCC was anxious to move in the direction of \nmore consolidation, allowing newspapers to buy up television stations. \nWe have had a ban on that for three decades. We prohibited the cross \nownership in a market. The reason we have done that is pretty simple: \nWe don't want there to be only one or a couple of dominant voices in a \nmarket. We want there to be many voices.\n  That is what our purpose is, to bring this resolution of disapproval. \nIt is unusual to do this, but we did it. It got through the Commerce \nCommittee, now through the Senate. It says to the Federal \nCommunications Commission, get things right, do things right, don't \ntruncate these things and cut the American people out of this process.\n  We have also said today we believe this is moving in the wrong \ndirection. Everybody says there are more voices out there in the \nInternet and cable channels and so on. More voices but the same \nventriloquist. We had one person testify from Los Angeles who came and \nsaid in my office we have 48 cable channels. I went through who owns \nthe channels--42 of them are owned by the same few companies and that \nis the problem with concentration.\n  I again thank the Senator from Washington. She has done a great job \nand I am proud to work with her and Senator Snowe especially, on the \nother side, and Senator Lott when he was here, to accomplish this \nresult.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I thank the Senator from North Dakota. The praise \nshould go to Senator Dorgan for his leadership on this issue for the \nlast year-plus time, continuing to make sure the Senate holds the FCC \naccountable for their actions, trying to pass a rule on media \nconsolidation when they know there have been dissenting views all \nacross America about this issue. Certainly there has been a dissent \nfrom the Senate.\n  The ownership of broadcast and print media does touch on some of the \ncore values Americans hold for freedom of speech, open and diverse \nviewpoints, to have vibrant economic competition from a variety of \nsources, and local diversity.\n  Attention to diversity and localism has served our economy well and \nhas also provided us a good civics lesson. These opportunities--when we \nhear from small companies, when we hear from minorities, when we hear \nfrom women--are the types of diversity we want to protect. We did that \ntonight.\n  The diversity in media does energize our democracy. Viewpoint \ndiversity that comes from the various views that\n\n[[Page S4271]]\n\ncan now be expressed are key to making us a stronger nation.\n  Having independent sources of news helps citizens to take opinions, \nnot just locally but nationally and even globally. That is why I am \nglad we stopped the FCC from moving forward on their media \nconsolidation proposal.\n  I remind my colleagues of the history here because I have a feeling \nthis issue may come up again. Back in 2002, the FCC initiated its \nbiennial review process, announcing the agency would fulfill and review \nthe full range of broadcast ownership rules, but the announcement of \nthe review was the only thing that was truly conducted in public.\n  On June 23, 2003, on a 3-to-2 party line vote, the FCC issued its new \nrules on media consolidation. Then-Chairman Powell did not issue the \nproposed rule for public comment prior to the vote.\n  The reason I am bringing this up is because what ensued is millions \nof people sent e-mails and weighed in with postcards and petitions to \noppose the rule. In fact, the Senate sent a very clear message to the \nFCC at the time invalidating that proposed media consolidation \nproposal.\n  The Third Circuit Court of Appeals reviewed the FCC decision from \n2003 and they determined it was ``not supported by reasonable \nanalysis.''\n  What happened after that? Obviously there were a lot of people in \nloud chorus saying they disapproved of the FCC's action to further \nconcentrate the media in this country. In 2007 the FCC passed the new \nmedia ownership rule, barely a month after it was proposed, allowing \nfor little public comment and for even less time for consideration of \nthe comments that came in. I know Chairman Martin likes to talk about \nallowing public comment for over 120 days and 6 hearings around the \ncountry, but all of that was done before the rule was even out there in \npublic, what the actual changes would be.\n  In one example, they came to Seattle on November 9 and I think we had \na mere 1-week notice for that. They had the meeting on a Friday \nafternoon. I think it was a 3-day weekend. Maybe they thought no one \nwould show up, but it does not take a lot of notice in Seattle to get \npeople to show up for a hearing about media consolidation, so 800 \npeople showed up and spent 9 hours letting the Commission know their \nthoughts on what they thought the impact of increased media \nconcentration would be.\n  It would hurt competition. It would lessen diversity. It would impact \nlocalism and was not in the broader public interest. I know Chairman \nMartin received an earful in Seattle, but clearly he didn't pay much \nattention to what we said, because a few days later he proposed new \nmedia ownership rules. They were released in a November 13 op-ed piece, \nI think in the New York Times, in a Commission press release.\n  So what we are saying is we do not like the process which the FCC \npursued in not having the broadest public comment in this, and also \nwhen it looks at some of the issues that were discussed in trying to \nvalidate why the Commission continues to try to push for media \nconsolidation.\n  I think it is very important. We have seen a pattern emerge. We see \neconomic studies from the Commission where they cannot hold up to peer \nreview, where data are not supportive of the predetermined conclusions \nthat the FCC had, and that maybe they were ``checking the box'' when it \ncomes to these public hearings and maybe giving mere lip service to \nlocalism and to women and minority ownership issues.\n  So all of those issues are going to continue to be duly noted by the \nCommerce Committee, and certainly we are going to continue to fight on \nthis issue. The FCC media ownership rules were created decades ago to \nfoster these longstanding goals that our country has to promote \ncompetition, to promote localism, to have diversity of voices.\n  The courts and industry experts and elected officials of all ranks \nacross America have come together in an overwhelming chorus saying \n``no'' to the FCC move to try to further consolidate the media.\n  I am glad my colleagues tonight as well disapproved of their action \nso we can continue to have the diversity of voices in America that I \nbelieve my constituents and Americans all across this country deserve.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/15/senate-section/article/S4271-1", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4271-S4272]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE NATIONAL GOVERNORS ASSOCIATION\n\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I want to say a few words on the 100th \nanniversary of the National Governors Association.\n  I especially want to thank my friend and colleague Senator Durbin for \nyielding to me to speak first this evening.\n  It was 100 years ago today that the first meeting of our Nation's \nGovernors took place. In recognition of the National Governors \nAssociation's Centennial today, I, along with a number of my \ncolleagues, including Senator Voinovich of Ohio and Senator Alexander \nof Tennessee, have submitted a resolution commemorating the 100th \nanniversary of the National Governors Association.\n  It is my hope we will be able to clear this resolution honoring the \n100th anniversary this evening. As former Governors currently serving \nin the Senate, Senators Bayh, Bond, Gregg, and Ben Nelson will also be \njoining myself and Senator Alexander, along with Senator Rockefeller, \nin sponsoring this resolution.\n  If you think about it, that is all of the former Governors who now \nserve in the Senate and who were at one time members of the National \nGovernors Association. I was privileged to serve, along with Senators \nVoinovich and Alexander, as chairman of the National Governors \nAssociation at one time.\n  It is a special privilege for me to take a moment to reflect on the \norganization's growth and its accomplishments over the last 100 years. \nOn May 15, 1908, 100 years ago today, President Teddy Roosevelt hosted \nthe first meeting of our Nation's Governors at the White House. They \ngathered to discuss conserving America's natural resources.\n  Now, 100 years later, the Federal Government is still working with \nour Nation's Governors in an ongoing effort to protect America's \nnatural resources through conservation provisions such as the farm bill \nthat we adopted here today or addressing climate change or protecting \nour air through legislation such as the Clean Air Planning Act.\n  Today, 100 years later, the National Governors Association serves as \nthe collective voice of our Nation's Governors and remains one of \nWashington, DC's most respected public policy organizations.\n  Through this bipartisan organization, Governors are able to identify \nand discuss a broad range of issues relating to public policy and to \ngovernance. I have long said the 50 States are laboratories of \ndemocracy, and we should use them as such, and we do.\n  Today we do that. From the redwood forests to the gulf stream waters, \ninitiatives and policy recommendations that have come from the \nGovernors often serve as catalysts for change both in the States and at \nthe national level.\n  I was Governor of Delaware back in 1995 when Congress was actively \ndebating how to reform a failing Federal welfare program, trying to \ndecide how do we make work pay more than welfare. Without solutions \ncoming from the Congress, the States had already begun taking reform \nefforts into their own hands. Over half the States, including my own \nState of Delaware, and I believe the State of Vermont, had made \nsignificant changes to their own welfare programs by seeking waivers \nfrom the Federal rules.\n  Many of the welfare policies and practices tested by States were \nultimately adopted by the Federal Government in the sweeping 1996 \nwelfare reform legislation passed by the Congress and signed by \nPresident Clinton, which the Governors helped to write.\n  As with welfare reform, the National Governors Association has played \nand continues to play a key role in developing national policies \nranging from\n\n[[Page S4272]]\n\ntransportation to education, to environmental protection and health \ncare, to name a few.\n  In the 1950s, President Eisenhower enlisted the Governors' help to \nhelp build our very first interstate highway system. The State-Federal \npartnership forever changed the face of transportation in America and \nunderscored how critical States' participation has been to realizing \nnational goals.\n  The same is true of Medicaid and the SCHIP program, the State \nChildren's Health Insurance Program. The same is true of the \nimplementation of the Clean Air and Clean Water Acts, and as we fight \nwars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the National Guard units of all 50 \nStates.\n  Over the past century, the National Governors Association has played \na key role in shaping public policy and addressing America's most \npressing challenges. On behalf of each of the former Governors who are \nprivileged to serve today here in the Senate, it is my honor to \nacknowledge the leadership of Governors both past and present, to \ncelebrate what they have achieved over the last 100 years by working \ntogether, and to look toward with anticipation of what lies ahead for \nour Nation's National Governors Association and for the Governors who \nwill help to lead it in this century and beyond.\n  If I could just add a footnote, I always think of the States as \nlaboratories of democracy. We can test policies or programs to see if \nthey work at the State level, and if they do, maybe see if they would \nwork on a national level.\n  One of the things I especially liked about being part of the National \nGovernors Association was that every even-numbered year, right after \nthe election in mid-November, the National Governors Association would \nhost a school for new Governors and spouses. For 3 days, a different \nGovernor would host in his or her State the NGA's school for new \nGovernors and spouses. The students were the newly elected Governors \nwho had been elected 2 weeks earlier. They were Democrats and \nRepublicans, in some cases an Independent. The faculty were the current \nGovernors and their spouses. We would spend 3 days together. Usually, \nit was as many as 20 Governors and spouses on faculty.\n  We would spend those 3 days together in different places around the \ncountry--no press, very little staff. The idea was for the grizzled \nveterans to really bare our souls to the new guys and gals, incoming \nGovernors, and tell them the mistakes we made and to say to them: Learn \nfrom our mistakes. Don't make the same ones we did, whether it is \nputting together your team, developing your communications plan, \nworking with the legislature, deciding where you are going to live and \ntrying to be a chief executive and still be a good parent, a good \nspouse. But during those 3 days we spent together, a remarkable bonding \noccurred between the old Governors, the veterans, and the new \nGovernors, and across party lines. I am convinced one of the reasons \nwhy the Nation's Governors tend to be less partisan is what happens in \nnew Governor school.\n  Among my closest friends are Governor Mark Racicot, former Governor \nof Montana, who later went on to be national committee chair and \ngeneral campaign manager for President Bush's reelection; Mike Leavitt, \nformer Governor of Utah, who succeeded me as chair and who serves today \nas a Cabinet secretary in this administration. What we have tried to do \nin the Senate, those of us who used to be Governors who serve here \ntoday but went through new Governors school, is take that idea and \ntransplant it here. I call it Senators school. It is really \norientation.\n  This fall, in November, 2 weeks after the election, we will have new \nSenators, newly elected Senators, their spouses will come. They will \nspend 3 days together; some sessions with spouses, others not with \nspouses. The faculty will be current Senators and our spouses. We will \nhave 3 days to get to know each other, to try to teach the new guys and \ngals the ropes and to begin to develop new personal relationships that \nreally are needed here to make this place work. I look forward to being \na part of doing that this November. But the idea was one of those ideas \nthat came from the National Governors Association.\n  Again, the NGA and the States are laboratories of democracy. Taking \nthat lesson and applying it here on the national level will have good \neffect.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate \nconsideration of S. Res. 568 submitted earlier today by yours truly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 568) commemorating the 100th \n     anniversary of the founding of the National Governors \n     Association.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. CARPER. I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed to, \nthe preamble be agreed to, the motions to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, with no intervening action or debate, and any statements \nrelating to the resolution be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 568) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 568\n\n       Whereas, in 1908, President Theodore Roosevelt invited the \n     Nation's Governors to the White House to discuss conserving \n     America's natural resources;\n       Whereas the Governors decided to form an association \n     through which they could continue to come together on a \n     bipartisan basis to discuss mutual concerns and share State \n     practices;\n       Whereas, 100 years later, the National Governors \n     Association serves as the collective voice of the 55 \n     Governors of States, commonwealths, and territories;\n       Whereas, for the past century, Governors have utilized the \n     organization to explore issues, develop solutions, and build \n     consensus on diverse national policies;\n       Whereas the National Governors Association has played a key \n     role in shaping public policy and addressing America's most \n     pressing challenges; and\n       Whereas the National Governors Association is celebrating \n     100 years of gubernatorial leadership--honoring the past, \n     celebrating the present, and embracing the future: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes the leadership of the Nation's Governors and \n     honors their contributions to American politics and society; \n     and\n       (2) commemorates the 100th anniversary of the founding of \n     the National Governors Association.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, tomorrow we celebrate Armed Forces Day. \nCommunities across my State, from Van Wert to St. Clairsville, from \nSandusky to Ironton, will pause to honor the service and sacrifice of \nthe men and women in all branches of the military service as they and \nwe celebrate Armed Forces Day.\n  I have held close to 100 roundtables around my State where, in many \nof them, I had the opportunity to speak with dozens of these honorable \nman and women. Those conversations reinforced my profound respect for \ntheir unstinting bravery, their unshakable sense of duty, and their \nunwavering commitment to our national security.\n  Not long ago, at Walter Reed I visited two Ohio marines recovering \nfrom wounds suffered in Iraq. I asked each of them what was the first \nthing they thought about when they realized they were wounded. Both \nmarines, independently of one another, said: ``Can I stay in the \nMarines.'' That simple statement speaks volumes about our men and women \nin uniform.\n  Armed Forces Day is an opportunity to honor our troops, an \nopportunity to honor the sacrifices they and, equally importantly, \ntheir families have made to protect our Nation, and an opportunity to \nhonor the promises our Nation has made to repay their services and \nsacrifices. That is so important. We are stewards of those promises. We \nhave a responsibility to work every day, against opposition sometimes, \nto ensure that our Armed Forces receive the wages and benefits and \nservices they have earned. Honoring our troops should be more than \nsentiment. It should be action. When we make promises to our troops, we \nshould keep them. They most certainly have kept their promises to us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n\n[[Page S4273]]\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I join the remarks of the Senator from \nOhio acknowledging the great contribution made to America by our men \nand women in uniform. I hope we can honor their service, not only by \nproviding for them while they are at war but providing for them as well \nwhen they come home. I am sure the Senator joins me in believing that a \nnew GI bill which will provide for those returning soldiers is a \nfitting tribute to their service and a great investment in our future.\n  Our initial GI bill after World War II was born in conflict. After \nWorld War I, those returning soldiers marched on Washington time and \nagain, demanding some payment for their service to our country. They \nwere rebuffed and even attacked at times by our then Army in uniform. \nBy the Second World War, we understood that we owed a great debt to the \n16 million men and women who served, and 8 million of them took \nadvantage of the GI bill.\n  That GI bill was groundbreaking and revolutionary. It paid for their \ntuition, their books, their room and board, as well as a monthly \nallotment so they could go to school. Those graduates of the GI bill \nbecame the thriving middle class of America that built our great Nation \nin the late 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s. It was the greatest single \ninvestment in returning soldiers in our history, and it should be \nreplicated.\n  Those who honor the armed services should also honor them when they \ncome home, to make sure they receive all the health care and benefits \npromised and are given a chance to have a full life after having served \nour country so well.\n  I am happy to identify myself with the remarks of the Senator from \nOhio.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/15/senate-section/article/S4273-1", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4273]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REPUBLICAN FILIBUSTERS\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I also want to say that this has been a \nweek when we have achieved a few things in the Senate but not nearly \nenough. We started off the Senate with a historic occasion, one which \nis not likely to be remembered by great historians but should be \nremembered by all who follow the business of the Senate. As of this \nweek, the Republicans, the minority in the Senate, have now engaged in \n71 Republican filibusters. A filibuster is an effort to stop the \nbusiness on the floor of the Senate or at least to slow it down. It is \na time-honored tradition in the Senate, but it is a tradition which has \nnot been overused until this session of Congress.\n  In the entire history of the Senate, the total number of filibusters \nin any 2-year period, the maximum, was 57. So far in this 2-year \nperiod, the Republicans have engaged in 71 filibusters, and, of course, \nwe have another 6 or 7 months to go in this session of Congress. It is \nclear that their ambition is to stop the Senate from addressing the \nmajor issues facing our Nation, or at least to slow us down to a crawl.\n  We have what we believe are good ideas and good proposals to deal \nwith the high gasoline prices facing America's families and businesses, \nfarmers and truckers. We have good proposals to deal with tax breaks \nfor working families so they can meet the needs of their families with \nescalating prices for food and health care and daycare and the cost of \ndaily living. Again, the Republicans have done their best to slow us \ndown, if not stop us.\n  It reached a point several weeks ago that was nothing short of \nridiculous. The Republicans initiated a filibuster to slow down the \nconsideration of a bill known as a technical corrections bill. That is \na bill that takes care of spelling and grammar errors. They engaged in \na filibuster to slow down the Senate so it would take us a whole week \nto finish a technical corrections bill. When we finally reached the \npoint and asked them for amendments, they had three or four that could \nhave been dispensed with quickly.\n  They are dragging their feet and slowing us down with this record \nnumber of filibusters. But that isn't it alone. There is also a device \nin the Senate known as a hold. Most every Senator has used a hold, \neither on a bill or a nomination. Some of the holds that have been \napplied recently are so-called secret holds. Senators don't step \nforward to identify why they have held up a nomination or bill.\n  I have used holds. I am currently using those. But I have been very \npublic about it. I have said exactly why I am doing it and the \nconditions for my releasing the hold. For example, when the Department \nof Justice wanted the approval of the Deputy Attorney General Mark \nFilip, a good man from Chicago, I said I would hold his nomination \nuntil I had received responses to questions I had submitted to the \nDepartment months before. Well, to his credit, Attorney General Mukasey \nmoved on it extremely quickly. Within 48 hours, I had the answers and \nwithdrew the hold immediately as promised. I am sorry it reached that \npoint, but after waiting months, I didn't know another way to turn to \nget answers to important questions. So holds can be used effectively \nand honestly and openly.\n  Then again, there are holds that have been applied that I think are \nalmost impossible to explain or justify. For example, one of the \nSenators on the Republican side has put a hold on a bill which was not \ncontroversial and very bipartisan, which would establish in the United \nStates a national registry of those who are suffering from a disease \nknown as ALS, or Lou Gehrig's disease. It is a terrible, debilitating \ndisease. It was the hope of the sponsor, Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, \nthat we could establish this registry and move even closer to finding \nthe cause of this disease and perhaps lead to a cure. It was certainly \na high-minded and sensible approach to a very serious medical condition \naffecting thousands of families across America.\n  One of the Senators from Oklahoma on the Republican side put a hold \non this bill--in other words, stopped us from calling this bill for a \nvote. That is extremely unfortunate. There is nothing controversial \nabout this bill. He should reconsider that hold. But it is not the only \none.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/15/senate-section/article/S4273-2", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4273-S4274]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         PEPFAR REAUTHORIZATION\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise this evening to speak for a few \nmoments about another hold that has been placed on critically important \nlegislation.\n  Anyone who follows what we do here on the floor of the Senate or in \nthe House of Representatives knows that many of us on the Democratic \nside have disagreed with President Bush as to his policies. Over the \nlast 7 years, there have been ample opportunities to vote against the \nPresident's policies, whether it is on the invasion, the war in Iraq, \nor economic policies that brought us to this sorry stage of the \nAmerican economy, with working families struggling to pay their bills \nand to survive.\n  I have opposed President Bush's economic policies and many other \nthings during the course of his administration. But there was one \nmoment I can still recall when the President gave a State of the Union \nAddress and announced that the United States would try to lead the \nworld in dealing with the global AIDS epidemic. On the Democratic side, \nI joined many of my colleagues, standing and applauding President Bush \nfor that announcement. Though I may disagree with him on many issues, I \nsalute him for his special efforts to deal with the global epidemic of \nAIDS and tuberculosis and malaria.\n  The President established a program known as the President's \nEmergency Plan for AIDS Relief, commonly known as PEPFAR. This \nimportant program is up for reauthorization so that it can continue to \nsave lives across the world.\n  They have renamed it in honor of two men who served in the House of \nRepresentatives--one a Democrat, Tom Lantos; the other a Republican \nfrom Illinois, Henry Hyde. It is known as the Tom Lantos and Henry J. \nHyde United States Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, \nand Malaria Reauthorization Act.\n  The Senate Foreign Relations Committee considered this bill and \npassed it out 18 to 3--an overwhelming bipartisan vote. Our colleagues \nin the House passed a similar measure with an overwhelming vote at the \nend of March of this year.\n  The President has urged Congress to send him the bill before the end \nof the year. President Bush takes great pride in this bill. He believes \nit is one of the hallmarks of his tenure in office and administration. \nI join him. I think it is his most positive achievement as President of \nthe United States.\n  The purpose of this bill is to prevent 12 million new infections; \nsupport\n\n[[Page S4274]]\n\ntreatment for at least 3 million people; provide care for another 12 \nmillion, including 5 million very vulnerable children.\n  That kind of assistance helps to save lives, and it is an important \nstep not only from a humanitarian viewpoint but also to alert the world \nas to our real values in America. We are in a struggle across the world \nnow. Many of our harshest critics paint a picture of the United States \nthat is not close to reality. This kind of legislation, where the \nUnited States puts investment in the health care of people around the \nworld, tells the right story about who we are and what we believe.\n  There is a sad ending, regrettably, as is too often the case in the \nSenate. This bill--despite the President's support, despite broad \nbipartisan support in the House and the Senate--is being blocked by \nseveral Republican Senators. Seven of my colleagues across the aisle, \nwho have publicly identified themselves, have stopped the consideration \nof this bill to deal with the global AIDS epidemic. Those Senators are \nSenators Coburn, DeMint, Sessions, Chambliss, Vitter, Bunning, and \nBurr.\n  Now, former Bush speech writer, Michael Gerson, issued a scathing \ncriticism of this Republican hold in a recent article in the Washington \nPost. I quote him when he says:\n\n       It is the nature of the Senate that the smallest of \n     minorities can impede the work of the majority. But it takes \n     a conscious choice--an act of tremendous will and pride--for \n     members to employ these powers against an AIDS bill with \n     overwhelming bipartisan support.\n\n  Mr. Gerson is right. I appreciate and share his sentiments and the \nfrustration that comes with them.\n  There is broad bipartisan support for this measure. There are \nliterally lives on the line. The President says we need it. Who would \ndisagree? Virtually all of us on both sides of the aisle have applauded \nthe President's efforts and voted for funding the PEPFAR program. Our \nability to save the lives of millions of people around the world \ndepends on a parliamentary maneuver in the Senate, where seven \nRepublican Senators have put a hold on a bill to try to fight the \nglobal AIDS epidemic.\n  Many of my friends on the other side of the aisle support this bill \nenthusiastically. Even those with concerns about it are willing to \nconcede this has been a remarkably successful program.\n  Since 2003, when we were treating only 50,000 people in sub-Saharan \nAfrica, the PEPFAR and Global Fund now reach nearly 2 million people, \nprimarily on the continent of Africa. That is an amazing record of \nprogress in 5 years. That has literally changed the situation in \nAfrica.\n  I went to Africa 7 or 8 years ago and did not go looking for the \nglobal AIDS epidemic. But you could not avoid it. Everywhere you \nturned, in every country I visited, terrible stories were being told \nabout the people who were dying, how it was necessary to hire two \nteachers for every grade in school because one was likely to die before \nthe end of the school year. It was awful. There was no hope. People \nwould not go for tests to see if they were positive because learning \nthat information led them nowhere--just the knowledge of impending \ndoom.\n  Well, Mr. President, that has changed. Because of PEPFAR and the \nGlobal Fund, because of the efforts of the Gates Foundation, because of \nthe efforts of former Presidents Bill Clinton and George H.W. Bush, we \nnow find medications and treatment available in Africa. People are \ngoing forward to be tested so they do not unnecessarily expose someone \nelse to the disease and so they can seek treatment at an early stage \nand live a long life.\n  The world has changed in Africa because of this program. But the \nprogram is about to expire, and these seven Republican Senators are \nstanding in the path of reauthorizing that program.\n  When they were asked why they opposed this program being \nreauthorized, one of the Senators argued that it has gone beyond its \noriginal mission of treating AIDS and now is dealing with other issues. \nThis critic of the program, my Senate colleague, called it ``mission \ncreep.'' I wish that Senator could go to Africa and see it firsthand.\n  To argue that adding nutrition, safe water, and sanitation programs, \ntreatment of tuberculosis and malaria, and protection of vulnerable \npopulations is somehow beyond the scope of the original bill is to \nignore reality.\n  I went to a portion of Nairobi, Kenya, to one of the larger slums, \nwhich has some 600,000 people and a rampant AIDS epidemic. Well, it is \nbeing treated with drugs and testing, and we are making some progress, \nbut they took me to a small area where a group of parents who were \ninfected with HIV were sitting and watching their children play.\n  I looked on as several of the women who were sitting there looked as \nif they were about to die, they were so emaciated. I said to the person \nwith me: It is a shame they didn't have access to the drugs. The person \nsaid: They have access to the drugs. They are taking the drugs. They \njust don't have access to food.\n  These drugs don't work on a hungry person and an empty stomach. So \nwhen the critics of this PEPFAR reauthorization argue against food and \nnutrition as part of the program, they are ignoring the obvious. If you \nwant to treat a woman with a child, and you want the drugs to work, she \nneeds basic nutrition. That has to be part of the program. It does no \ngood to give these drugs to a starving, dying person.\n  Maintaining the status quo, as some of my Republican colleagues who \noppose this bill prefer, would deny the progress we have made under \nPresident Bush. This bill creates a program that is sustainable and \nmaintains our essential leadership role in the fight against AIDS, TB, \nand malaria.\n  Some on the other side may disagree, and let me tell you, it is their \nright to disagree. But I think the honorable thing to do, the right \nthing to do, is to bring their disagreement to the floor and to offer \nan amendment. If they want to change the program, so be it. That is why \nwe are here. We should consider the merits of their amendment and vote \nit up or down. Then, depending on the outcome, they can decide whether \nthey want to vote for or against the bill.\n  But to hold this bill indefinitely, when 12 million lives hang in the \nbalance, I have to agree with Mr. Gerson, it is a conscious decision--\nas he said: ``an act of tremendous will and pride.''\n  I urge my Republican colleagues: Please, please reconsider this hold. \nI find it very difficult to understand how some of these same \ncolleagues can go to our Prayer Breakfast regularly and pray for the \npoor and suffering in the world and come to the floor of the Senate and \nput a hold on a bill that would provide nutrition and drugs to people \nwho will die without it. I do not understand that. I hope they will \nreconsider.\n  Recently, President Bush traveled to Africa. He was greeted with \ngreat warmth and hospitality by a continent grateful for his efforts in \nthe fight against AIDS. The Senate should not turn its back on what the \nPresident and America have achieved. We should move quickly to \nreauthorize the U.S. commitment to global AIDS relief. The efforts of \nthese seven Senators holding this important bill should not stop us \nfrom doing the right thing for the millions of people around the world \nwhose lives literally depend on it. I am going to urge my colleagues, \nas often as I can, to drop this hold on this bill to allow the Senate \nto debate and pass this important legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/15/senate-section/article/S4274-1", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4274-S4276]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO LUCY AND ROSA TREVINO\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this past Sunday--Mother's Day--Barbara \nMahany, a reporter for the Chicago Tribune, wrote a touching front-page \nstory about Rosa Trevino, a mother who never gave up on her daughter, \nLucy.\n  Born with a rare genetic degenerative disease, spinal muscular \natrophy, Lucy Trevino was determined to win a degree in bio-engineering \nfrom the University of Illinois at Chicago.\n  Her quest would have been physically impossible if her mother had not \nbeen by her side for every class, every lab, every study session, and \nthere to turn every page of her daughter's textbooks when Lucy's arms \nwere too weak.\n  On Saturday, Lucy Trevino overcame the greatest obstacles and earned \nher degree. And Rosa, in reporter Barbara Mahany's words, taught us \n``all a lasting lesson of a mother's love.''\n  At Lucy's commencement, the dean of UIC's engineering college stopped \nthe ceremony to tell the members of the Class of 2008 about Lucy's \npersistence and Rosa's devotion. He said he\n\n[[Page S4275]]\n\ncould barely get the words out without bursting into tears. When he \nfinished, the entire audience rose and delivered a thunderous 2-minute \novation.\n  Spinal muscular atrophy is a progressive disease that withers the \nmuscles that control the legs, arms and lungs. It can make breathing a \nstruggle and make turning the page of a heavy book nearly impossible. \nBut it leaves the brain and the mind untouched.\n  Lucy Trevino was 4 years old when she was told she had the disease. \nShe started using a wheelchair when she was 9.\n  It was during countless visits to neurologists and orthopedic \nsurgeons when she was a child that Lucy first became fascinated by \nscience. During medical tests, she says, she used to wonder, ``How do \nthose devices work?''\n  During her senior year in high school, she learned about a summer \ncamp in bioengineering at UIC and immediately signed up. And she was \nhooked.\n  The following fall, Lucy Trevino became the first person in her \nfamily to go to college.\n  For her major, she chose bioengineering--one of the toughest programs \nin the engineering college.\n  Now, the prospect of years of studying such complicated subjects as \nthermodynamics and circuit analysis would be daunting for almost all of \nus. For Lucy, college presented special challenges.\n  You see, Lucy often needs help performing even such simple physical \ntasks as dressing, brushing her teeth, and cutting her food.\n  It takes her twice as long as other students to write up her labs \nbecause just moving a pen across paper can be hard sometimes.\n  At first, Lucy wasn't sure she could even go to college because UIC \ndoesn't have a personal assistants program to help students with \ndisabilities.\n  One day, as the start of Lucy's freshman year grew near, her mother \nRosa asked, ``How would you feel if I went with you?''\n  Rosa had never even attended high school. But she had vowed years \nearlier that she would do whatever she could to see that her first-born \ndaughter was never held back by her disease.\n  So every day, every semester for the last 6 years, Rosa was by Lucy's \nside.\n  Five days a week, mother and daughter took the CTA train from their \nhome in Cicero to the University of Illinois at Chicago.\n  They became a familiar sight on campus: Rosa pushing Lucy's purple \nwheelchair. Rosa ordering for Lucy in the cafeteria line because Lucy's \nvoice is sometimes barely louder than a whisper.\n  And there was Rosa, sitting a few feet behind Lucy in class, copying \nrecipes or cutting coupons--always watching to see if Lucy needed a \ndrink of water, or help turning a page. She sat through more than 2,100 \nhours of lectures in 51 different classes.\n  Pete Nelson, interim dean of UIC's engineering college, told the \nTribune's Barbara Mahany, ``Lucy's story is about the sacrifices our \nmothers make for all of us.''\n  Michael Cho, who teaches mostly graduate engineering courses at UIC, \nhas come to know Lucy and Rosa and is in awe of them.\n  Of Rosa's devotion, he says, ``The first thing that comes to my mind \nis this can't be anything else but a mother's love. It goes beyond \ncommitment. It is sacrificial love. And I am just overwhelmed. It's not \njust 1 month or one semester. It's every day for 4 years.''\n  In fact, it took Lucy Trevino 6 years to earn her degree. Serious \nhealth challenges forced her to take a break from school in her junior \nyear.\n  Last year, a student told Lucy that she had felt like skipping class, \nbut she thought of Lucy and told herself, ``There's Lucy, she's always \nhere. There's nothing wrong with me. I'm just lazy.''\n  Lucy was amazed anyone noticed her.\n  Another of Rosa's four children, Lucy's younger brother Hugo, also \nhas spinal muscular atrophy--SMA--and uses a wheelchair. He is studying \narchitecture at the University of Illinois Champaign-Urbana.\n  As much as Rosa would like to see Lucy and Hugo walk, she says she \nknows that God is good. She explains: One daughter can walk, one can't. \nIt's the same with her two sons. What she can't see in one child, she \nsees in the other. And she sees in each child special talents.\n  In a few weeks, Lucy will go back to school to take one more class so \nshe can complete a math minor. After that, she says, she would like to \nstudy law and become a patent attorney.\n  I hope Rosa is ready for law school. Because I suspect that once Lucy \nmakes up her mind to do something, there's no holding her back.\n  Rosa Trevino is one of our new Americans who came to this country \nfrom Mexico 30 years ago, when she was 17.\n  This past Saturday, the day of Lucy's commencement, was Mother's Day \nin Mexico.\n  When Lucy received her cherished degree, she gave her mother a gift \nshe had ordered months earlier: a formal-looking ``Certificate of \nGratitude.'' It read: ``Thank you for all your love and support. I \nwould not be where I am today if it wasn't for you. I feel so grateful \nto have you in my life. Today is my day, but I dedicate it to you.'' It \nis signed, ``Lucy Trevino.''\n  And on behalf of the Senate, I want to congratulate Lucy Trevino on \nher amazing accomplishment, and thank Rosa Trevino for her inspiring \nexample of a mother's love.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the \nChicago Tribune article about Lucy and Rosa Trevino be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Chicago Tribune, May 11, 2008]\n\n                          Lucy's Mom Was There\n\n                          (By Barbara Mahany)\n\n       Lucy Trevino's mother cuts peanut-butter-on-whole-wheat \n     into bite-size squares, unscrews a strawberry-kiwi juice and \n     holds the bottle to her daughter's lips so Lucy can get \n     through lunch and make it back to class.\n       She riffles through Lucy's lavender backpack to find the \n     lab report for BioE 494, bioengineering-based physiology. \n     When the cell phone rings, she holds it to her daughter's \n     ear. She zips her coat. Dabs a tissue to her nose.\n       And before all this, she has slipped her into jeans, tied \n     her shoes, smeared toothpaste on her toothbrush and combed \n     her thick black hair into a perfect ponytail. Lucy Trevino's \n     mother was right behind her firstborn daughter all through \n     college--sometimes shoving through mounds of snow, or up an \n     icy ramp if her motorized wheelchair balked. When they got \n     stuck, her mother pulled out her cell phone to call \n     maintenance and ask if someone could please come clear the \n     walks. Over the last six years, Rosa Trevino also became \n     fluent in the CTA's Blue Line and Pink Line, as the mother \n     and daughter made their way five days a week from home, a \n     red-brick two-flat in Cicero, to the University of Illinois \n     at Chicago.\n       Lucy Trevino graduated Saturday from UIC with a degree in \n     bioengineering, and the dean stopped the commencement of the \n     Class of 2008 to tell of the Trevinos' triumph. He barely \n     made it, he said, without breaking into tears.\n       For the six years it took to get through one of the most \n     rigorous programs in the College of Engineering, it was \n     Rosa--a tad shy and always thinking two steps ahead--who got \n     her daughter to every class, lab and study session. She knew \n     which text and notebook to lay on Lucy's desk. And she turned \n     the pages when a heavy book tired Lucy's hands.\n       For two or three hours, as Lucy absorbed lectures in \n     calculus or thermodynamics or circuit analysis, Rosa sat not \n     far away, just in case Lucy needed a sip of water or began \n     choking.\n       Lucy, who is 24, was told she had a rare genetic \n     degenerative disease, spinal muscular atrophy, when she was \n     4. SMA is a progressive disease that withers the muscles that \n     control the arms, legs and lungs, and can make breathing a \n     struggle.\n       Lucy's type of SMA usually takes away your ability to walk \n     by the time you're in your teens--she began using a \n     wheelchair at age 9--but unlike some other types, doesn't \n     necessarily affect life span.\n       Lucy, who is the oldest of four, has a younger brother, \n     Hugo, who has the same disease. He, too, uses a wheelchair; \n     he's a freshman at the University of Illinois at Urbana-\n     Champaign, studying architecture.\n\n\n                          Parental dedication\n\n       ``Lucy's story is about the sacrifices our mothers make for \n     all of us,'' said Pete Nelson, interim dean of UIC's \n     engineering college. Trevino's teachers, he said, ``were \n     pounding down my door'' to ask for some recognition for this \n     mother-daughter feat of unconditional devotion.\n       At UIC, where nearly a third of the students are the first \n     in a family to go to college, Nelson said it's not uncommon \n     to hear tales of parents working two or three jobs, sending \n     money from overseas and just plain struggling so their kids \n     can get what parents weren't afforded.\n       ``But this is sort of the pinnacle in terms of the amount \n     of dedication,'' Nelson said. ``This is what makes this \n     business worthwhile.''\n\n[[Page S4276]]\n\n       One of the professors pounding on Nelson's door was Michael \n     Cho, who teaches mostly graduate courses in cell and tissue \n     engineering, but who has gotten to know--and has been amazed \n     by--the ubiquitous mother-daughter duo, so often spotted \n     wending their way up a ramp, on or off an elevator, or tucked \n     away studying in some secluded corner.\n       ``The first thing that comes to my mind is this can't be \n     anything else but a mother's love,'' Cho said. ``It goes \n     beyond commitment. It is sacrificial love. And I am just \n     overwhelmed. It's not just one month or one semester. It's \n     every day for the last four years that I can think of.''\n       In fact, it's six years, because Lucy had to take time off \n     when she got really sick her junior year; she suddenly \n     couldn't lift her arms and was quickly losing memory.\n       It took months before a sleep test showed she stopped \n     breathing 30 times an hour when she was asleep. She now \n     sleeps with a machine that helps her breathe, and, within a \n     week of using it, she said, she regained her memory, if not \n     her arm strength.\n       ``Ever since I was little, I loved science,'' said Lucy, \n     who shares her mother's deep cocoa-colored eyes and rolls \n     around campus in a purple wheelchair with back wheels that \n     sparkle, like fireworks, with tiny neon bits. ``Because I \n     went to doctors a lot and had a lot of medical exams, I would \n     always wonder, ``How do those devices work?' ''\n       In her senior year at Morton West High School in Berwyn, \n     Trevino learned from a counselor about a summer camp in \n     bioengineering at UIC, so she signed up, and found her life's \n     work.\n       She once dreamed of working to find a cure for her own \n     disease, but decided ``it would be too stressful if I \n     couldn't find it.''\n       The first one in her family to ever go to college, Lucy \n     Trevino said she was ``too afraid'' to venture down to the U. \n     of I. in Urbana-Champaign, where there's a whole dorm for \n     students with disabilities, and the nation's oldest college-\n     level disabilities-services program provides trained personal \n     assistants, physical therapy, even wheelchair repairs.\n       ``I didn't know if I should risk going all the way down \n     there,'' she said.\n       Sticking closer to home seemed like a better plan. But \n     because UIC doesn't have a personal-assistants program, she \n     was stuck trying to find someone who could help her in a \n     thousand little ways and be there whenever she needed.\n       ``In college, you have such a crazy schedule. You stay \n     after to study with other students. You need to talk to a \n     professor. I was like, `Oh, my gosh, how am I going to find \n     someone who's going to put up with all of that?'\n       ``My mom was like, `Well, I guess I'll just go with you.'\n       ``And then it was getting closer to the start of the first \n     semester, and I still hadn't found anybody. She said, `How \n     would you feel if I went with you?' I was like, `Oh, my gosh, \n     would you?' ''\n       Because Rosa Trevino, who is 47 and moved from Mexico when \n     she was 17, had two children with special needs, she had long \n     since become a stay-at-home mom, giving up a series of baby-\n     sitting jobs. Rosa's husband, Hugo, retired last year after \n     32 years as a CTA bus driver. Rosa herself had never even \n     been to high school.\n       On the day back in 1987 when doctors said her little girl \n     would ``someday need a wheelchair,'' Rosa recalled, crying at \n     the memory, she promised herself she would do ``everything I \n     can.''\n\n\n                           Mother keeps busy\n\n       Even if that meant sitting through more than 2,100 hours of \n     51 classes, countless study sessions and hour-long train \n     rides, back and forth, each day. Most often, Lucy said with a \n     laugh, her mother spends time cutting recipes and coupons, \n     because she gets bored with all the bioengineering in a \n     language she doesn't fully understand.\n       At first, Lucy admitted, going to college with her mother \n     wasn't exactly without its bumps.\n       ``I had never spent so much time together with my mom. We \n     would sometimes get on each other's nerves,'' she said, \n     chuckling. ``But then we got to know each other really well. \n     We're like best friends. Now I tell her everything. Before I \n     wouldn't tell her everything that happens when you have a \n     disability. People who aren't in a wheelchair can't \n     understand. But now, since we do everything together, she \n     knows.''\n       Semester after semester, year after year, Lucy and her \n     mother found a way. She passed 400-level exams. She wrote up \n     labs that took her twice the time of everyone else, simply \n     because the pushing of a pen on paper is so hard for her.\n       Once, a civil engineering professor noticed that because of \n     Lucy's wheelchair, she couldn't write on her desk. He \n     challenged her to design a lightweight writing table. Then he \n     went and built it. She got an A.\n       Mostly, the Trevinos relied on each other, and on \n     unflagging faith.\n       ``One time, I think in the night, almost for an hour, I \n     cried to on high, `Why me? Why me?' '' Rosa said. ``I heard a \n     voice, `Why not me?' ''\n       For those who watched their unswerving perseverance, the \n     simple fact that the Trevinos never stumbled inscribed a \n     lasting honor on Lucy's college transcript.\n       ``One time last year,'' Lucy said, ``a student told me \n     she'd felt like ditching class, staying home. But then she \n     looks and says, `There's Lucy, she's always here. There's \n     nothing wrong with me. I'm just lazy.'\n       ``Wow, I didn't even think that anyone noticed me.''\n       In the very end, on a Mother's Day weekend in the red-\n     carpeted UIC Pavilion, as Nelson saluted a student and a \n     mother who had taught them all a lasting lesson, a sea of \n     Lucy's blue-gowned classmates rose and nearly drowned out the \n     dean with a thunderous two-minute ovation. Chances are Lucy \n     and Rosa Trevino finally understood how very much a whole \n     college noticed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/15/senate-section/article/S4276-1", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4276-S4277]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                ZIMBABWE\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, with skyrocketing inflation and \nunemployment, riots over land reform and food shortages, and streams of \neconomic and political refugees fleeing into neighboring countries, the \nprimary constant in Zimbabwe over the last 30 years has been the \nincreasingly despotic and disastrous rule of President Robert Mugabe. A \ndecade ago, high interest rates and inflation galvanized public support \nfor the Zimbabwean Congress of Trade Unions led by Morgan Tsvangirai, \nwho was chosen in 1999 to lead a new opposition party--the Movement for \nDemocratic Change, or MDC. In 2002 and 2005, President Mugabe's ruling \nZANU-PF party rigged Presidential and Parliamentary elections to \nmaintain its grip on power, and while he tried to do it again on March \n29 of this year, the MDC and the people of Zimbabwe refused to be \nintimidated or outmaneuvered.\n  Despite the Zimbabwean Government's best efforts to limit the access \nof international monitors and journalists, most observers concur that \nthe general elections conducted this past March were fraught with \nrigging, mainly to favor the ruling ZANU-PF. Even so, these efforts \nfailed to silence the people of Zimbabwe's call for change. After \nsignificant and unexplained delays, the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission \nannounced that the MDC had won a majority in Parliament and that Mr. \nTsvangirai won more votes for the Presidency, but not enough to avoid a \nrunoff.\n  For more than 6 weeks now, Zimbabwe has been in a state of increasing \npolitical uncertainty and violence. With each passing day, there are \nnew reports of state-sponsored intimidation and detention of opposition \nleaders and supporters, human rights activists, trade union leaders, \nlawyers and journalists. The delay in announcing and now in setting a \ndate for the Presidential runoff election has allowed the ruling party \nto mobilize traditional state security services as well as youth \nmilitias and bands of military veterans to weaken the opposition. Mr. \nTsvangirai has agreed to participate in a run-off election, but he is \nreluctant to return to Zimbabwe, much less to campaign, unless the \ngovernment will guarantee his security and cease its assault on his \nsupporters. Facing the prospect of another three months in political \nlimbo and social upheaval, Zimbabwe risks plunging into even greater \nuncertainty and instability.\n  Mr. President, we can not stand by while this disaster unfolds. \nPresident Mugabe has been losing legitimacy, both at home and abroad, \nfor years, isolating himself and his country to the detriment of \nZimbabwe's citizens. The people of Zimbabwe are calling for change, but \nit will take engagement from external actors to help them escape the \ndevastating status quo. The recent decision by dock workers across \nsouthern Africa to refuse to unload a Chinese ship carrying Zimbabwe-\nbound ammunition sent a strong message, one that the international \ncommunity should echo. Public statements condemning the situation in \nZimbabwe by the newly elected President of Botswana followed on the \nheels of these protests and resulted in the denial of a port at which \nthe Chinese ship could dock. Decisions by other leaders in the region \nto welcome Mr. Tsvangirai for a visit have been equally important signs \nof this growing political will but they are not enough.\n  The MDC's runoff conditions are more than reasonable, and should be \nsupported in any way possible by regional and international \ngovernments. Given the tense environment and high potential for \npolitically motivated violence, a commitment to ending impunity for \nhuman rights violations and stopping the attacks must be a top \npriority. Yesterday, the United Nations representative in Zimbabwe \nreported ``indications that the level of violence is escalating . . . \nand could reach crisis\n\n[[Page S4277]]\n\nlevels.'' I urge the U.N. to immediately send a team to investigate \nthese human rights abuses so that the perpetrators will be held \naccountable and future violations might be deterred. Similarly, I \nwelcome the African Union's willingness to send additional monitors for \nthe runoff election, and I encourage the AU or SADC to draw together \nresources for a short-term peacekeeping mission to maintain order and \nprotect civilians in Zimbabwe during this uncertain time.\n  In addition to an immediate cessation of violence, I fully support \ndemands by the United States Government and others that the Zimbabwe \nGovernment permit unfettered access for international media and \nobservers during the campaign and conduct of the run-off polls and \nguarantee Mr. Tsvangirai's safety. South Africa's President Mbeki and \nother leaders of the Southern African Development Community should join \nthis forthright call. President Mugabe and his top brass must respect \nfundamental human and political rights and allow for a fair, \nnonviolent, and independently monitored runoff election that can bring \nto power a legitimate government capable of bringing stability and \ngrowth to this embattled nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/15/senate-section/article/S4277-1", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4277-S4278]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING AMERICA'S FINEST\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, this week, 358 new names were inscribed on \nthe National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial, representing officers \nfrom across the country over the course of many years. We often take \nfor granted the thousands of brave officers who dedicate their lives to \nprotecting our streets and our communities every day across Maryland \nand across America. But this week, during National Police Week, we all \nshould take a moment to thank these brave men and women--America's \nfinest--who risk their lives on our behalf. We especially must honor \nthe fallen law enforcement officers who have made the ultimate \nsacrifice so that the rest of us could enjoy our families and go about \nour daily business with a common sense of peace and security.\n  Nationally, 187 law enforcement officers gave their lives in the line \nof duty during 2007. More than one-third succumbed to gunfire. On \naverage, they were nearly 11-year veterans of their respective \ndepartments. The average age was just 39 years young. Seven of these \nbrave officers were women. Most importantly, these were sons and \ndaughters, husbands and wives, sisters, brothers, and true role models \nfor those who knew them well or saw them on the street proudly wearing \ntheir uniform or badge. So our thoughts, during this special \ncommemoration, also are with their families and the communities they \ntouched by their presence.\n  Four of Maryland's finest gave their lives for our safety in 2007 and \none more recently on New Year's Day, January 1, 2008. I would like to \ntake a moment to tell you about these brave law enforcement officers.\n  Troy Lamont Chesley, Sr., was a detective with the Baltimore City \nPolice Department. At age 34, he was a 13-year veteran. On January 9, \n2007, shortly after Detective Chesley got off duty at a public housing \nunit, a suspect attempted to rob him. Despite being shot and mortally \nwounded, Detective Chesley was able to take police action and return \nfire. The robber was arrested later in the day and charged in \nconnection with Detective Chesley's murder. A widower himself, \nDetective Chesley is survived by his three daughters, two sons, \nparents, and brother.\n  On April 25, 2007, Police Officer Luke Hoffman had been with the \nMontgomery County Police Department just 1 year when he was struck by a \ncar while involved in a foot pursuit of a suspected drunk driver. The \ndriver had fled on foot after a slow-speed pursuit in the Aspen Hill \narea early that morning. Officer Hoffman was struck after chasing the \nsuspect across Old Georgia Avenue in an area with very low lighting \nconditions. Another patrol car struck Officer Hoffman when his patrol \ncar went down an embankment and struck a tree. The officer in the \npatrol car was injured. Officer Hoffman was flown to a local hospital \nwhere he later died.\n  Corporal Scott Wheeler of the Howard County Police Department was \nstruck by a speeding vehicle he was attempting to flag down on Route \n32. He had stepped into the roadway in an attempt to stop the car for \nspeeding while working an enforcement detail. He was flown to Maryland \nShock Trauma Center where he died on June 18, 2007, 2 days after the \naccident. Corporal Wheeler had served with the Howard County Police \nDepartment for 6\\1/2\\ years. He was posthumously promoted to the rank \nof corporal. He is survived by his wife, parents, and brother.\n  Another brave Marylander who lost his life far too early was 25-year-\nold Police Officer Christopher Nicholson of the Smithsburg Police \nDepartment. Officer Nicholson was shot and killed while responding to \nassist members of the Washington County Sheriff's Office at a call \ninvolving reports that a man had just murdered his girlfriend during a \ndomestic disturbance. As he waited in his patrol car a short distance \naway from the home for additional units to arrive, the suspect drove \ntoward Officer Nicholson's patrol car and opened fire as he pulled even \nwith the officer's door. A rifle slug struck him in the chest, \npenetrating his vest. The suspect fled into a nearby cemetery, where he \nengaged members of the Special Response Team in a shootout. The man was \nwounded and taken into custody. Officer Nicholson was flown to a local \nhospital where he succumbed to his wounds. Officer Nicholson had \npreviously served with the Maryland Division of Correction but spent \nonly 1\\1/2\\ years with the Smithsburg Police Department before his \ndeath. He is survived by his mother, father, and girlfriend.\n  Finally, another auto accident claimed the life of Corporal Courtney \nG. Brooks of the Maryland Transportation Authority Police Department. \nHe was struck and killed by a hit-and-run driver on I-95 in Baltimore \nCity at approximately 11:30 pm on New Year's Eve 2007. A 13-year \nveteran of the Maryland Transportation Authority Police Department, \nCorporal Brooks was setting out cones at the interchange of I-95 and I-\n395 to keep commercial vehicles out of downtown Baltimore during New \nYear's celebrations when he was hit. The driver fled in his vehicle but \nwas apprehended early the next morning. Corporal Brooks was transported \nto Maryland Shock Trauma Center where he succumbed to his injuries \nshortly after midnight on New Year's Day, January 1, 2008. Lost at the \nage of 40, Corporal Brooks is survived by three children and a fiance.\n  I mentioned earlier that gunfire accounted for more than a third of \nthe law enforcement deaths nationwide. This was the single-biggest \ncause of death. Perhaps after hearing about Police Officer Hoffman, \nCorporal Wheeler and Corporal Brooks, it is no surprise that automobile \naccidents fall second on that list, claiming the lives of over 25 \npercent of law enforcement officers who died nationwide last year.\n  During this commemoration, let me also offer thanks to The Officer \nDown Memorial Page, a nonprofit organization dedicated to honoring \nAmerica's fallen law enforcement heroes every day of the year by \ntelling the stories and preserving the memories of each of these \nofficers at www.odmp.org. I also offer my tribute and respect to the \nNational Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund, which generates \nincreased public support for law enforcement as a profession, promotes \nlaw enforcement safety, and leads our Nation in remembering the fallen \n365 days a year but especially during National Police Week.\n  I am humbled by the sacrifice these law enforcement officers have \ngiven for their fellow Marylanders. I would hope that they represent \nthe last of our Nation's finest law officers who would sacrifice \nthemselves for the greater good of safety and security.\n  Unfortunately, we know that is not likely. That is why, as a member \nof the Senate Judiciary Committee I am working with my colleagues to \nimprove the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Program to make it easier for \nStates to qualify for grants under this program. While not a guarantee, \nbulletproof vests do save lives and allow more men and women in law \nenforcement to return home to their families at the end of their shift.\n  We held a hearing in the Judiciary Committee earlier this week, \nduring which we heard from Detective David Azur, an ATF agent from \nBaltimore, MD. He testified about how, in 2000,\n\n[[Page S4278]]\n\nwhile working as part of the Regional Auto Theft Task Force, he was \nshot in the line of duty and survived only because of his bulletproof \nvest. He was subsequently awarded the Medal of Valor for his actions \nthat day.\n  I also recognize that strong partnerships between first responders, \nlike police officers, and the cities and States they serve are vital to \npublic safety. I firmly believe that all of our Nation's first \nresponders deserve the right to be treated with respect. But far too \nmany first responders across the country do not have basic workplace \nprotections.\n  As we debate the Public Safety Employer-Employee Cooperation Act, I \npledge to work to ensure all first responders receive the respect they \ndeserve with the same protections enjoyed by so many other workers \nacross the country. I have cosponsored this important bill. In honor of \nthe 187 law enforcement officers who gave their lives last year and the \nmore than 18,000 who have done likewise, I urge the Senate to pass this \nimportant legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/15/senate-section/article/S4278-1", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4278-S4279]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TRIBUTE TO LEO KELLY\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is always sad when a World War II \nveteran leaves us. These men and women served our country with immense \ncourage, skill, and dedication, and came home from war to make immense \ncontributions to our society. They have rightly been called ``the \ngreatest generation,'' and we mourn the loss of each and every one of \nthem.\n  On February 18, another member of the ``greatest generation'' died. \nNavy veteran Leo Kelly was 87 and lived in Burlington Township in New \nJersey with his wife of 58 years, Claire. Leo was the father of six \ndaughters and a son, and I came to know him because his daughter Beth \nis married to my nephew Joe Kennedy, a son of Robert Kennedy and a \nformer Congressman from Massachusetts in the House of Representatives.\n  It is Leo Kelly's extraordinary career in the Navy that I want to \ncall to the attention of my colleagues in Congress. Leo Kelly answered \nthe Nation's call soon after World War II began. He enlisted in the \nNavy in 1942 at the age of 21 and retired in 1964 with the rank of \nlieutenant commander.\n  He became a Navy fighter pilot and earned numerous awards and medals \nfor valor and bravery under fire during the war. He served on the USS \nLangley, which was named for the great American scientist and aviation \npioneer Samuel Pierpont Langley. The ship was on the front lines during \nthe critical final years of the war in the Pacific, and the crew as a \nwhole was cited in glowing terms by Secretary of the Navy James \nForrestal for their outstanding heroism in action that contributed so \nmuch to our Nation's victory.\n  Leo Kelly himself was awarded both the Distinguished Flying Cross and \nthe Air Medal for his special heroism on January 12, 1945 in an attack \non Japanese shipping in Camranh Bay in French Indo-China, which is now \nVietnam. As the citation by President Roosevelt stated.\n\n       Kelly fearlessly dove his plane through a heavy curtain of \n     powerful anti-aircraft fire to score two direct hits with his \n     rockets and contribute to the damaging of an enemy merchant \n     vessel. Then, joining in an attack against a group of hostile \n     seaplanes on the water, he executed a series of strafing runs \n     and, striking furiously at his target, personally destroyed \n     one of the enemy aircraft.\n\n  Courage like that is what made Leo Kelly a true American hero, and \nthe Nation owes him a debt we can never fully repay.\n  After the war, Leo Kelly continued his career in the Navy for nearly \ntwo decades. From 1953 to 1955 he was assigned to a Naval ROTC unit in \nPhiladelphia and earned his bachelor's degree in political science and \nattended the Navy's postgraduate school. He retired from the Navy in \n1964 and went to work for Tenneco Plastics Company in Burlington, where \nhe and Claire raised their wonderful family.\n  He had many interests. He was an excellent golfer, and had played for \nvarious Navy teams early in his career. He loved classical music, \nespecially playing the violin. He had a profound faith in God, was a \nmember of St. Paul's Roman Catholic Church in Burlington, and had been \na member of the Bridge Prison Ministry.\n  He was also a wonderful family man, as so many members of his family \nsaid so movingly at the service held for him in February. His daughter \nBeth said it beautifully in her eulogy at the service:\n\n       Our father was a strong, quiet force in our lives, guiding \n     us, always encouraging, smiling or nodding his approval. . . \n     . He always adjusted to whatever came his way. The very \n     qualities that made him excel at being a pilot prepared him \n     for a life with six daughters and one son.\n\n  America is grateful to Leo Kelly for all he did for our country \nduring his extraordinary life, and I know that future generations of \nhis family will always treasure his memory.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have his daughter Beth's eulogy printed in \nthe Record, along with the full texts of the World War II citations he \nreceived.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 Eulogy by Beth Kennedy for Her Father,\n\n                   World War II Naval Hero Leo Kelly\n\n       [Military Chapel, Wrightstown, New Jersey, Feb. 25, 2008]\n\n       Good afternoon. I'm Beth Kennedy, one of Leo and Claire's \n     many daughters who no one can keep straight. It's as though \n     our names are interchangeable!\n       On behalf of my mother and my brother and sisters, I'd like \n     to thank all of you for coming to celebrate our father's life \n     and mourn his passing.\n       I just wanted to share a few words before we all leave \n     today. My mother always told me, for as long as I can \n     remember, God will never give you more than you can bear. He \n     will give you the strength to accept His will.\n       And for my family, those words were never more true than \n     during the past week as we began a life without our father. \n     We each have our special memories of Dad. Some we remember \n     with lots of laughter, and some we reflect on privately. But \n     all of them are filled with love, and all of them are joined \n     with our mother, who was always by his side, beautiful and \n     smiling. You know, in all the hundreds of photos we sorted \n     through for this occasion, in every single picture our mother \n     was smiling radiantly, as though every moment with her \n     husband--and later, with her children--was a gift. And it was \n     a gift for us, too.\n       Mom, you were Dad's co-pilot. The love of his life. You \n     taught us what love and devotion truly are.\n       Kathy, you spent so much time helping take care of Dad, \n     always with humor and grace. You were a leader for all of us.\n       Michelle, you spoke so beautifully last night about Dad. \n     You took care of so many details of his health care, always \n     with patience and love.\n       Nancy, you embraced our parents' spirituality the most, and \n     shared a strong religious bond with Dad.\n       Leo, you inherited Dad's quiet strength, and to this day \n     you share your time and energy helping your family and your \n     friends in need, most times without even being asked.\n       Teresa, you would always brighten Dad's days with your \n     sparkling optimism and good cheer, along with a little \n     something for his sweet tooth and a visit from Michael.\n       Jackie, you could always make Dad smile, and you could \n     always get away with anything. Dad was so happy and proud to \n     finally become a grandfather.\n       Our parents gave us so many wonderful memories: trips to \n     the seashore; our family outing to the Poconos; grilling \n     steaks in the backyard at Salem Road; Friday night fish fry \n     dinners at Howard Johnson's. And later in our lives, as our \n     father gave each of us girls away on our wedding days, \n     dancing with the happy bride. And always, always, praying \n     with us for God's blessing. Our parents gave us the highest \n     standard for a strong marriage filled with love and faith.\n       Our father was a strong, quiet force in our lives, guiding \n     us, always encouraging--smiling or nodding his approval. I \n     remember the day I moved to Boston after graduating high \n     school. After my teary goodbye to mom, my father drove me to \n     the train station in Trenton. He got me settled in on the \n     train, bags secured, and I took so long saying goodbye to him \n     with tears and prayers--the train took off with both of us on \n     it!! He had to get off at the next stop and wait for a train \n     to take him back to Trenton. I was delighted to have his \n     company for such a nice send-off, but I do recall an \n     inordinate amount of throat-clearing by Dad.\n       He always adjusted to whatever came his way. The very \n     qualities that made him excel at being a pilot prepared him \n     for a life with six daughters and one son. I read through \n     Dad's pilot rating book a few nights ago, and I was struck by \n     the consistent comments and descriptions of him: ``smooth, \n     dependable, eager to learn, retains instruction, good \n     coordination in unfavorable weather conditions, good pilot \n     material.''\n       Well, Dad, we're all here to say a prayer for you as you \n     join Grandpere and Mamie, Aunt Teen, and all your friends up \n     in Heaven. And as you always said to me at the end of every \n     conversation or phone call--``God bless you good.'' Goodbye, \n     Dad; I love you; God bless you good.\n                                  ____\n\n\n    Citation for the Distinguished Flying Cross Awarded to Leo Kelly\n\n       The President of the United States takes pleasure in \n     presenting the Distinguished Flying Cross to Lieutenant \n     Junior Grade Leo\n\n[[Page S4279]]\n\n     Kelly, United States Naval Reserve, for service as set forth \n     in the following citation: For heroism and extraordinary \n     achievement in aerial flight as Pilot of a Fighter Plane in \n     Fighting Squadron Forty-Four, attached to the USS Langley, \n     during operations against enemy Japanese forces in the \n     vicinity of French Indo-China, on January 12, 1945. \n     Participating in a daring strike against enemy shipping and \n     installations, Lieutenant Junior Grade (then Ensign) Kelly \n     fearlessly dove his plane through a heavy curtain of powerful \n     anti-aircraft fire to score two direct hits with his rockets \n     and contribute to the damaging of an enemy merchant vessel. \n     Then, joining in an attack against a group of hostile \n     seaplanes on the water, he executed a series of strafing runs \n     and, striking furiously at his target, personally destroyed \n     one of the enemy aircraft.

This vessel was left beached. A few minutes \n     later he again dived through anti-aircraft fire to destroy an \n     enemy seaplane on the water. His courage and skill were at \n     all times in keeping with the highest traditions of the \n     United States Naval Service.\n                                  ____\n\n\n Citation for the Navy Unit Commendation Award to the Aircraft Carrier \n                            USS ``Langley''\n\n       The Secretary of the Navy takes pleasure in commending the \n     United States Ship Langley for service as set forth in the \n     following citation: For outstanding heroism in action against \n     the enemy Japanese forces in the air, ashore and afloat in \n     the Pacific War Area from January 29, 1944 to May 11, 1945. \n     Operating continuously in the most forward areas, the USS \n     Langley and her air groups struck crushing blows toward \n     annihilating Japanese fighting power; they provided air cover \n     for our amphibious forces; they fiercely countered the \n     enemy's aerial attacks and destroyed his planes; and they \n     inflicted terrific losses on the Japanese in Fleet and \n     merchant marine units sunk or damaged.

Mr. President, I would like to recognize Ms. \nSandra ``Sandi'' J. Esty, one of our most distinguished civil servants \nwho will retire from Federal service on June 7, 2008, after \ncontributing over 35 years of dedicated service to our country. She \nserves as the Chief, Air Operations Division, Office of Legislative \nLiaison, Office of the Secretary of the Air Force, the Pentagon, \nWashington, DC. She is responsible for managing, planning, developing \nand executing all facets of congressional travel matters for the \nDepartment of the Air Force. Ms. Esty also serves as the senior adviser \nand special assistant to the Director, Legislative Liaison and Air \nForce leadership with oversight of the Air Force Congressional Travel \nProgram.\n  Ms. Esty left Syracuse, NY, in 1972 to begin her illustrious civil \nservice career as a clerk-stenographer in the Office of the Air Force \nReserve, the Pentagon. After demonstrating remarkable competence in \nworking congressional constituent inquiries, she was selected to work \nAir Force constituent issues in the Secretary of the Air Force \nLegislative Liaison Inquiry Division, in 1975. She was promoted and \nserved a short tour as the Administrative Assistant for the Secretary \nof the Air Force Space Systems, Budget Office before being asked to \nreturn to the Air Force Legislative Liaison Branch in 1981, this time \nas the Administrative Assistant to the Chief of Air Operations Division \nin Legislative Liaison. She was promoted in 1983 and served as \nAdministrative Assistant to the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Air \nForce for Acquisition, Electronic Warfare. In 1985, she returned to \nLegislative Liaison as the Administrative Assistant to the Director of \nLegislative Liaison and then was assigned as an action officer in the \nWhite House Liaison Branch, Legislative Liaison, where she established \nherself as one of the top leaders of Legislative Liaison. In 1988, she \nwas promoted and selected as the Deputy Chief, Air Operations Division, \nLegislative Liaison, and then, in 1997, she was promoted as a GS-15 and \ncontinued to serve in her current position as Chief, Air Operations \nDivision.\n  During her tenure in the Air Operations Division, Ms. Esty was \nresponsible for all the travel requirements of Members and staff of \nCongress arranged by the Air Force. Ms. Esty's calm, logical, thorough \nmethod of dealing with unique situations involved some of this \ncountry's most important citizens, its legislators. Her true dedication \nto ``doing it right,'' the absolute insistence on honesty and \nintegrity, and the patience under extreme daily pressure are the \nstandards that Ms. Esty leaves for all those who follow. She \ncoordinated and executed over 10,000 congressional trips worldwide, to \ninclude the movement of approximately 70,000 Members and staff of \nCongress to 193 countries and 7 continents. I personally travelled on \nmany of the trips with the Senate Armed Services delegations that Ms. \nEsty arranged, coordinated, and flight followed. Each was a complete \nsuccess.\n  I join my colleagues in expressing our sincere appreciation to Ms. \nEsty who has provided many years of dedicated and professional service \nto the Congress and the U.S. Air Force and wish her well in all her \nfuture endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/15/senate-section/article/S4279-2", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4279-S4280]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO DR. CARL V. PATTON\n\n Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I wish today to honor in the \nRecord of the Senate a great educator in the State of Georgia. On June \n30, 2008, Dr. Carl V. Patton will retire as president of Georgia State \nUniversity after 16 years of outstanding service.\n  Dr. Patton has led Georgia State University in its transition from a \ncommuter school into a vibrant research university that is home to more \nthan 28,000 students representing every county in the State, every \nState in the Nation, and 160 countries.\n  Georgia State has grown into one of this Nation's leading urban \nresearch universities, reflecting Dr. Patton's vision for a partnership \nbetween Atlanta and the university. Instead of designing walls to keep \nthe city and its urban ways separate from the campus, he has insisted \nthat the university fully integrate its research, teaching and service \nmission into the fabric of the urban environment of its downtown \nAtlanta home.\n  As the university has grown physically, it has grown in stature as \nwell. The College of Law, which was in its infancy when Dr. Patton \nbecame president in 1992, is now ranked within the top 100 law schools. \nThe Andrew Young School of Public Policy, founded in 1996, has grown \nfrom an idea to an internationally recognized program that works in \nover 30 countries around the globe as well as at home in the areas of \nhealth care, environment, air quality, taxation, aging, education, \nchild care, and diversity.\n  The J. Mack Robinson College of Business continues to rank among the \nbest in both graduate and undergraduate offerings, with two programs \nranked in the top 10 by US News and World Report.

Mr. President, I wish today to congratulate Holy \nName of Jesus Catholic Church and School in Beech Grove, IN, currently \ncelebrating the centennial year of the founding of the parish. On the \nweekend of June 27-29, 2008, the clergy, students, and parishioners who \nare part of the Holy Name community will honor this signal event. I am \nconfident it will be a time of joy, worship, and fellowship that \nmembers will cherish well into the future.\n  Holy Name was founded in 1908 by the Rt. Rev. Silas Chatard, the \nfirst Bishop of Indianapolis. In its inaugural decade the parish grew \nsteadily, and the years that followed brought about exciting changes \nand expansions to the facilities and ministries provided by the church. \nIn the early 1920s, the Holy Name School was built; its first class \ngraduated in 1923; and to date, the school has graduated over 4,200 \nstudents from prekindergarten to eighth grade.\n  I applaud Holy Name and its many members for the laudable service \nthey provide local communities in the greater Indianapolis area and \nbeyond, and I am hopeful that these festivities will be an opportunity \nfor celebrants to not only honor the past achievements of their parish, \nbut the blessings of another 100 years as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/15/senate-section/article/S4280-2", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4280-S4281]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              OSWEGO ELKS\n\n Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask that the following statement \nbe printed in the Record.\n  The statement follows.\n\n                  [From the Elks Magazine, Apr. 2008]\n\n    All-American Lodge--Oswego Elks Shining Forth in New York State\n\n                           (By Mark Hagland)\n\n       Just because something is old doesn't mean it's tired. In \n     fact, in the case of Elks Lodge No. 271, in Oswego, New York, \n     the opposite is, most vigorously, true. The Oswego Lodge, \n     with over eleven hundred members and a very large contingent \n     of core active members, has been for years a leader lodge in \n     its region, its state, and the nation. Showered with awards \n     for outstanding achievement in such key areas as youth \n     programs, veterans activities, and ritual ceremony, the \n     Oswego Lodge was designated an All-American Lodge in 2006-\n     2007 by the GL Lodge Activities/State Associations Committee.\n       In fact, in the key area of youth programs, the Oswego \n     Lodge has won first or second place in the state of New York \n     every year for more than twenty years, confirms John Rinaldo, \n     Oswego's exalted ruler. ``We're absolutely committed to the \n     youth of this community,'' Rinaldo says, and all the awards \n     are evidence of the lodge's long-term commitment, a \n     commitment that actually goes back nearly to the beginning of \n     the lodge's history, he notes.\n       That history is a long and storied one. The Oswego Lodge \n     was inaugurated on June 24, 1894, at a time when Grover \n     Cleveland was in his second term as president, during the \n     nationwide depression of 1893 to 1896.\n       That the Oswego Lodge should have come into being during a \n     time of community--and nationwide--need should surprise no \n     one who understands and upholds Elks' values. For the 114 \n     years of its existence, the lodge has been deeply involved in \n     supporting its community through a wide range of programs and \n     activities. Because of all the hard work and constant \n     participation of its active members, the Oswego Lodge \n     exemplifies the motto Elks Care--Elks Share.\n       Just ask some of those who have benefited from lodge \n     members' volunteerism.\n       Sheri Valle, Voluntary Service Program Assistant at the \n     nearby Syracuse VA Medical Center, for example, points out \n     that ``local Elks lodges have donated the equivalent of more \n     than $18,000 just this year in activities, items, and cash \n     donations, and this particular lodge has donated more than \n     $5,000 in items, time, and cash donations.''\n       And though the monetary amounts are gratifying, Valle \n     immediately adds that ``the biggest benefit to us is always \n     the time the Elks spend with our veteran patients, especially \n     in our nursing home care unit. Patients live there and really \n     don't have a lot of opportunity to see people outside the \n     medical center.'' The Oswego Lodge members, in addition to \n     volunteering to transport patients and residents to various \n     places, visit the nursing home residents virtually every day. \n     Among numerous other activities, the lodge supports a playing \n     card club in the nursing home; regularly hosts the \n     distribution of T-shirts and golf hats to residents; and \n     makes sure to create special activities for the various \n     holidays. ``They've been wonderful during the holidays,'' \n     Valle enthuses. ``It's wonderful to see the faces of the \n     veteran patients when the Elks are here. They're a lot \n     happier, and they're asking, `When are they coming next?' ''\n       The same kinds of comments come from school officials in \n     Oswego. ``There doesn't appear to be anything that they've \n     been asked to do that they've said no to, if it benefits \n     kids,'' says Bill Foley, public relations director for the \n     Oswego School District. ``And,'' Foley adds immediately, \n     ``practically everyone asks them for help, but they're always \n     more than willing to give.''\n       Foley cites the smaller size of the Oswego community, and \n     the interconnectedness of its residents, when describing the \n     generosity of the Elks' giving and volunteerism there. \n     ``Almost all of them went through our schools,'' he notes. \n     ``So they're giving back to the community in which they've \n     grown up, and that is just tremendous.''\n       Among the recognitions and awards the Oswego Elks bestow in \n     the local school system are Teen of the Month awards and \n     annual scholarships for graduating seniors. In a smaller \n     community like Oswego, which serves about forty-five hundred \n     students, such awards and recognitions are by definition \n     high-profile and resonate strongly. Indeed, Foley can speak \n     of them with personal zeal, since his own son, Michael, was \n     named Teen of the Month during the 1996-1997 school year. \n     ``Michael was very proud,'' Foley recalls. ``He held his head \n     so high when he achieved that; it meant so much to him to be \n     recognized.''\n       From such experiences, Foley says that it's clear that \n     ``students need to receive some recognition. Being named Teen \n     of the Month or receiving a scholarship builds confidence, \n     morale, and self-esteem. There's nothing but positive value \n     in this, and the Elks are having a major impact on our youth \n     through such programs.''\n\n\n                           a special culture\n\n       Because of all the activities that the Oswego Elks Lodge is \n     involved in, there is always a buzz of volunteerism humming \n     around the lodge itself. If there were a single word that \n     would best describe the lodge's atmosphere, it might be \n     ``enthusiastic.''\n       ``It's all about an enthusiastic, community-focused \n     outlook,'' says Rinaldo. ``What you've heard from these \n     folks,'' he explains, referring to community leaders like \n     Bill Foley and Sheri Valle, ``is what this lodge is all \n     about. Everything has been geared toward the kids, toward the \n     vets, toward the community. It all comes back to what the \n     Elks are doing for the community. As far as the All-American \n     Lodge Award goes, I think we've earned it. Everyone here is \n     committed to this community.''\n       ``At the same time,'' says Daniel Capella, a past exalted \n     ruler of the Oswego Lodge and a past president of the New \n     York State Elks Association, ``we have a lot of fun, and \n     that's part of what makes it go nicely. We know how to \n     laugh.''\n       Still, Capella notes, a tremendous amount of work and \n     energy go into all the lodge's activities, including the \n     social activities that take place at the lodge itself: ``From \n     the first Friday in January through April, we serve three \n     hundred or four hundred meals every Friday night here at the \n     lodge. Volunteers show up at four or four-thirty in the \n     afternoon, we start serving dinner at five, and it goes on \n     well into the evening. And yet we're never short of \n     volunteers to support the Friday dinners.''\n\n\n                       good citizenship magnified\n\n       The Oswego Lodge demonstrates its Americanism and good \n     citizenship in various ways,\n\n[[Page S4281]]\n\n     including very strong support for local law enforcement and \n     broad community efforts. Those efforts and that support are \n     clearly recognized and appreciated by law enforcement and \n     municipal officials. In a community of seventeen thousand, \n     such good works are very much noticed.\n       ``In a smaller city such as this, everybody seems to know \n     what everybody else is doing,'' says Edward Geers, Oswego's \n     fire chief. ``And if there's a need in one family, everybody \n     helps out. I visit other places, but love coming back here,'' \n     he adds. ``Everybody here is interested in the city as a \n     whole and the community as a whole. If somebody's in need, \n     whatever it is, the community pulls together; and the Elks \n     have always been a big part of that.''\n       The Elks' appreciation of the people and organizations that \n     hold the town together is shown regularly through public \n     recognition. For the lodge's annual public safety recognition \n     event, called Lincoln Day in Oswego, Geers develops a profile \n     of the personnel who might deserve the lodge's Firefighter of \n     the Year Award, and then he ``lets the firefighters decide \n     who they feel is worthy. And when the Elks recognize that \n     person, it means a lot.'' Geers continues, ``I think everyone \n     realizes that even though an individual wins an award, it's \n     not just that one individual who's being recognized. It \n     reflects on the entire department. We stand as one, and that \n     perception is very important for us.''\n       Geers, an active Elk for twenty-three years, adds: ``I'm \n     proud to say I'm a member of the Oswego Elks, because of the \n     wonderful things they've done in the community. Other \n     organizations do little things, but the Elks are \n     trendsetters, who make sure everything's done right.''\n       Oswego's chief of police, Michael Dehms Jr., agrees that \n     receiving the Oswego Lodge's public safety award is a \n     distinct honor. ``It's good to be recognized, but when you're \n     recognized by an organization like the Oswego Elks, it means \n     a lot.'' Dehms notes that the Elks also have made numerous \n     important contributions directly to public safety. For \n     example, in the 1980s, the Oswego Lodge purchased a working \n     police canine for the department's canine unit. What's more, \n     Dehms points out, every year during the community's biggest \n     social event, called Harborfest, the Elks ``supply meals for \n     our officers and state police, for the officers who have to \n     work through it and can't go home for dinner. Anything we've \n     ever asked for, they've always helped us,'' he adds.\n       According to Dehms, the Elks ``definitely set an example of \n     community involvement.'' One of the Elks' programs, for \n     example, honors the memory of a deceased police officer by \n     maintaining an ongoing memorial fund in his name that \n     provides college scholarships.\n       Mayor Randolph Bateman easily summarizes the Oswego Elks' \n     exceptional volunteerism by saying that ``the Elks' \n     contribution to the community is great. They're involved in \n     various activities, including youth activities. And last \n     year, they hosted the New York Elks' bowling tournament, \n     which brought significant income into the city.''\n       Another example of the Oswego Elks' civic involvement that \n     Mayor Bateman cites is the Youth Community Day that the lodge \n     sponsors every year in May. Youth Community Day includes an \n     Elks-sponsored luncheon for students and local government \n     officials. At the luncheon, the mayor and various city \n     department heads speak to the students, explaining some of \n     the functions of city government, and give the students the \n     opportunity to meet public officials directly. Such events, \n     Bateman says, are extremely important in helping reinforce \n     the natural cohesiveness that already exists in a community \n     like Oswego.\n       As the school district's Bill Foley sees it, a smaller \n     community like Oswego brings out the best in people, and the \n     Elks of Oswego help to encourage that. ``We look like a \n     sleepy little town on the lake,'' he says, ``but what amazes \n     me is the way this town always pulls together, whether during \n     the ice storm of a few years ago, or during Harborfest. This \n     is a caring community,'' he emphasizes. ``It's almost like a \n     community of the past. We joke about Oswego maybe being a few \n     years behind other places, but we care about each other and \n     pull for each other. And to have folks like the Elks be so \n     involved, it's tremendous.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/15/senate-section/article/S4281-1", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4281]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 TRIBUTE TO VESTAVIA HILLS HIGH SCHOOL\n\n Mr. SESSIONS.

A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to require the \nSecretary of Veterans Affairs to prescribe regulations relating to the \nnotice to be provided claimants with the Department of Veteran's \nAffairs regarding the substantiation of claims; to the Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, today I introduce the proposed Veterans' \nNotice Clarification Act of 2008. This bill would require VA to issue \nregulations specifying the content of notices provided to claimants who \nseek VA benefits and services. Following a number of court decisions, \nVA's notification letters to veterans have become increasingly long, \ncomplex, and difficult to understand.\n  These notification letters must be simplified, as veterans, VA, \nveterans' advocates and outside review bodies have all recommended. The \nletters should use simple ordinary language rather than bureaucratic \nlegalese and they should be focused on the specific type of claim that \nthe veteran is bringing.\n  My bill would require different notice contents depending upon \nwhether the claim is an original claim, a claim to reopen, or a claim \nfor an increase in benefits. VA would also have the discretion to \nprovide additional or alternative contents for notice if appropriate to \nthe benefits sought. For example, an original claim for service-\nconnected compensation may require different content than a claim for a \nspecially adapted housing grant.\n  The notice required for original claims by the Veterans Claims \nAssistance Act, Public Law 106-475, should provide useful information \nbased on the documents submitted to VA and the benefit sought. The \ninformation and evidence requested by VA should be relevant to the \nclaim filed. For example, the information and evidence requested by VA \nfor a claim for disability compensation and financial information \nconcerning claims for pension benefits are wholly different. A veteran \nshould not be made to submit information that is unrelated to his or \nher claim.\n  I believe that this bill, if enacted, will assist VA in developing \nappropriate criteria to implement the requirements of the current law. \nIn addition, courts which review appeals from VA decisions should find \nit easier to identify errors in notification by measuring the notice \nagainst clear regulatory criteria.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to support this measure, so that \nveterans, survivors and dependents seeking VA benefits may be provided \nwith clearer and more understandable notices.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3023\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the National and Community Service Act of \n1990 to establish a program to provide college coaches to low- and \nmiddle-income high-achieving high school students; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, in honor of AmeriCorps Week, I am \npleased to introduce legislation that will place more of our Nation's \nlow- and middle-income high school students on the road to higher \neducation. My legislation will address the disparity that exists in \ncollege persistence between lower-income, high-achieving students and \ntheir more affluent peers.\n  According to the National Educational Longitudinal Survey, NELS, more \nthan 1.5 million high school students with annual household incomes of \nless than $85,000 do not earn college degrees despite having ranked in \nthe top half of their high school classes. Further, a recent report \nfrom the Jack Kent Cooke Foundation found that 59 percent of lower-\nincome high-achieving students graduated from college compared to 77 \npercent of their higher income peers. America cannot remain competitive \nin the global economy if we continue to squander our college talent \nevery year. That is why I am sponsoring the Coaching Our Adolescents \nfor College Heights Act, or the COACH Act.\n\n[[Page S4285]]\n\n  The COACH Act creates a pilot AmeriCorps program to recruit, train, \nand place recent college graduates, or coaches, in high schools to help \nprepare low- and middle-income, high-performing high school students \nfor success in college. Under this program, coaches will be responsible \nfor working with school staff to build a strong college-going culture \nwithin their high schools. Coaches will be paired with a cohort of low- \nand middle-income, high-achieving students to ensure student enrollment \nand success in college-prep coursework and to connect participating \nstudents with summer internships, community service activities, and \nother opportunities that will enrich each student's academic \nexperience. Coaches will also help students and their parents in \nunderstanding the college application, admissions, and financial aid \nprocesses as well as work with students to select and enroll in the \ninstitutions of higher education that best meet each student's \neducational and social needs.\n  The role of coaches will not end once students are enrolled in \ncollege, as coaches will be required to monitor their students' \nacademic performance and social adjustment through the end of each \nstudent's first year of college. In this way, coaches will ensure that \nstudents are connected to the support services they need to persist in \nand ultimately graduate from college.\n  A recent study by the Consortium on Chicago School Research found \nthat only 41 percent of students who aspired to go to college took the \nsteps necessary in their senior year to apply to and enroll in a four-\nyear college, despite being well-qualified for even the most selective \ncolleges and universities. It is among these students that the Nation \nsuffers the greatest loss in proven talent. Unfortunately, our high \nschools are struggling to provide these students with necessary \nguidance. In 2002, the National Center of Education Statistics found \nthat the average ratio of high school students to full-time guidance \ncounselors was 315 to 1. Furthermore, only 10 percent of public schools \nhave advisors whose sole responsibility is college counseling. The \nCOACH Act not only addresses the need to prepare our high-achieving, \nlow- and middle-income students for college, but it also engages eager \nAmeriCorps members as a necessary resource for completing this task.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in this effort to help these \nstudents succeed in higher education and compete in the global economy.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID (for Mrs. Clinton):\n  S. 3028. A bill to amend the National and Community Service Act of \n1990 to promote community service among United States youth by \nconnecting secondary school seniors to community service opportunities; \nto the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, in honor of AmeriCorps Week, I am \npleased to introduce a bill that will help keep our Nation's high \nschool seniors engaged in learning and community service. My \nlegislation will connect high school seniors to service opportunities \nwithin their schools or communities while earning money for college.\n  The senior year of high school is a crucial transition time for \nyouth. Despite this fact, many twelfth grade students opt to take less \nchallenging courses, or no classes at all, during their final year of \nhigh school, a phenomenon commonly termed ``senioritis.'' I strongly \nbelieve we should use this opportunity to provide a service-oriented \neducation for young people across the country. That is why I am \nsponsoring the Senior Year Community Service Act.\n  This legislation will create a pilot program to enable six local \neducational agencies to connect high school seniors with service \nopportunities within their communities or schools. The bill calls on \nthe Corporation of National and Community Service to assist local \neducational agencies with the implementation of this pilot program. \nUsing grant funds, the local educational agency will establish a \npartnership with a community based organization to implement this pilot \nprogram, provide a service coordinator to assist participating high \nschools, and provide information to students about this program as \nearly as their junior year.\n  The Senior Year Community Service Act also requires the Department of \nEducation to study the effects of this program on participating \nseniors. The evaluation will measure student academic achievement on \nState academic assessments, graduation rates and student rates of \ncollege enrollment, persistence and graduation. If the evaluation \nproves that this program is successful in increasing student \nachievement, the legislation calls upon the Department of Education to \nmake this program a universal experience for high school seniors.\n  Research has shown that participation in community service activities \ncan lead to increased student achievement. In one study, students \ninvolved in community service and service-learning reported higher \ngrades and better school attendance. In another study, civically-\nengaged high school students tended to make greater academic progress \nand were more likely to graduate from college.\n  The benefits of community service participation can reach beyond the \nschool walls. The National Service-Learning Clearinghouse notes that in \naddition to increased academic achievement, service learning \ncontributes to students' increased self-efficacy, enhanced problem-\nsolving skills, and enhanced civic engagement.\n  We have seen colleges and universities take their own approaches to \nsolving the problem of ``senioritis.'' Earlier this year, the New York \nTimes reported that a handful of universities are taking action against \nslacking high school seniors--ranging from requiring students to meet \nmonthly with the dean of admissions once enrolled, to rescinding \nadmission status completely. Programs that keep seniors engaged in \nschool can prevent college-bound students from squandering their \nprecious opportunities.\n  The Senior Year Community Service Act will prevent many high school \nstudents from wasting their senior year and makes community service a \ncommon expectation for high school seniors. I hope that my Senate \ncolleagues will join me in supporting this bill that will help our \nyouth stay on track for a bright and successful future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/15/senate-section/article/S4285-1", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4285-S4286]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 567--A BILL DESIGNATING JUNE 2008 AS ``NATIONAL \n                        INTERNET SAFETY MONTH''\n\n  Ms. Murkowski (for herself, Mr. Whitehouse, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Bayh, Mr. \nBrown, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Coleman, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Craig, \nMr. Crapo, Mrs. Dole, Mr. Domenici, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Hatch, Mrs. \nHutchison, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Kerry, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Leahy, Mrs. \nLincoln, Mr. Menendez, Mr. Schumer, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Stevens, Mr. Vitter, \nMr. Voinovich, and Mr. Wicker) submitted the following resolution; \nwhich was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, today I introduced a resolution \ndesignating June 2008 as National Internet Safety Month.\n  The Internet has become one of the most significant advances in the \n20th century and, as a result, it affects people's lives in a positive \nmanner each day. However, this technology presents dangers that need to \nbe brought to the attention of all Americans. Consider the \npervasiveness of Internet access by children and the rapid increase in \nInternet crime and predatory behavior. Never before have powerful \neducational solutions--such as Internet safety curricula for grades \nkindergarten through 12--been more critical and readily at hand.\n  I-SAFE is one nonprofit organization that has worked tirelessly to \neducate our youth and our community on these important issues. Formed \nin 1998, \nI-SAFE educates youth in all 50 States, Washington, DC, and Department \nof Defense schools worldwide to ensure that they have a safe experience \nonline.\n  It is imperative that all Americans learn about the Internet safety \nstrategies which will help keep their children safe from victimization. \nConsider the facts: In the United States, about 35 million school-aged \nchildren have Internet access. Eighty-six percent of middle and high \nschool students are online for at least one hour per week.\n  An alarming statistic is that 61 percent of middle and high school \nyouths admit to using the Internet unsafely or inappropriately. \nFurthermore, at least 12 percent of these students have met face-to-\nface with someone they first met online and 42 percent of these \nstudents know of someone who has been bullied online.\n  Now is the time for America to focus its attention on supporting \nInternet safety, especially bearing in mind that children will soon be \non summer vacation and will spend more time online.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/15/senate-section/article/S4286-1", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4286]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 568--COMMEMORATING THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE \n             FOUNDING OF THE NATIONAL GOVERNORS ASSOCIATION\n\n  Mr. CARPER (for himself, Mr. Voinovich, Mr. Alexander, Mr. Bayh, Mr. \nBond, Mr. Gregg, Mr. Nelson of Nebraska, and Mr. Rockefeller) submitted \nthe following resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. 3029 introduced earlier \ntoday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 3029) to provide for an additional temporary \n     extension of programs under the Small Business Act and the \n     Small Business Investment Act of 1958, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, on May 23, 2008, many of the Small Business \nAdministration's programs and authorities will expire.\n  Unfortunately, it has become commonplace for those in the small \nbusiness community to face an expiration of the programs they depend \nupon. Since September 30, 2006, we have had to pass four temporary \nextensions to keep the Small Business Administration authorized. And \nhere we are, yet again, trying to pass a temporary bill to continue \nthese vital small business programs--this time through March 20, 2009.\n  Since Democrats took the majority over a year ago, the Committee on \nSmall Business and Entrepreneurship has worked hard to create a good \nclimate for small businesses in this country. To that end, we have had \n20 hearings, 6 roundtables, and passed 5 major bills out of committee \nto address the needs of the small business community, needs which have \ngone unmet the past 7 years. During that time, we have often \nencountered obstruction from the administration and Republican \ncongressional leadership. Despite the cooperation of the very \nsupportive ranking member I have in Senator Olympia Snowe, who is \ncosponsoring this legislation, some on the other side have blocked our \nlegislation and have blocked the appointment of conferees, which leaves \nus unable to conference with the House and get much-needed legislation \nsigned into law. The Republicans, now in the minority, fear what will \nhappen in a conference. Rather than work through differences and \naccomplish something, it is easier to block legislation. Who suffers \nfrom all this needless obstruction? Small business owners and their \nemployees.\n  Just today, we saw how it is possible to get things done. S. 163, the \nSmall Business Disaster Response and Loan Improvements Act of 2007, was \nincluded in the farm bill conference report. This legislation, which \nwas adopted as an amendment to the farm bill, was then negotiated with \nthe House as part of the farm bill conference, allowing us to enact \nmeaningful reforms in the way the Small Business Administration comes \nto the aid of disaster victims.\n  My hope is that once we have this extender bill in place, the \nadministration and the Republican leadership will realize that five \ntemporary authorizations are five too many and allow our committee to \ndo what it has been attempting to do, which is to do a comprehensive \nreauthorization of the rest of the small business programs. Therefore, \nI urge my colleagues to pass this temporary bill and then give us the \nsupport we need for a comprehensive reauthorization of small business \nprograms.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nread a third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, and that any statements relating to the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
