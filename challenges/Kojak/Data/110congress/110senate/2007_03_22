Mr. President, this amendment is one that I offered \nduring the Budget Committee's deliberations. Unfortunately, the \nmajority did not support this important amendment that reduces our \nNation's debt, the bill that we will pass on to our children and \ngrandchildren.\n  My amendment reduces the debt by instructing the Senate Finance \nCommittee to find approximately $34 billion in savings over the next 5 \nyears, and this is out of almost a $3 trillion budget.\n  Two years ago, Congress made some progress in getting a handle on \nmandatory, or entitlement, spending by passing the Deficit Reduction \nAct, using the reconciliation process, I believe, for the first time \nsince about 1997.\n  The Deficit Reduction Act reduced the rate of growth in spending. I \nwill say that again because it is important. It reduced the rate of \ngrowth of spending--it did not represent an actual cut in the way most \nAmericans would think about a cut--by nearly $100 billion over the next \ndecade. It was a very good first step in getting our fiscal house in \norder but, clearly, more needs to be done.\n  Today, the Federal budget is already heavily weighted toward \nentitlement spending, such as Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security, \nwhich takes up some two-thirds of all Federal spending, which is \nliterally on autopilot because it grows at roughly 8 percent a year. As \npeople live longer--as we hope we will continue to do--and the baby \nboom generation starts to retire, entitlements will continue to eat up \na larger share of our budget and we will consume more of the economy.\n  In the most recent long-term projections prepared by the \nCongressional Budget Office, CBO, outlays for Social Security, \nMedicare, and Medicaid combined are projected to increase to 10.5 \npercent of our GDP by 2015--an increase of about 2 percentage points of \nGDP in less than a decade. By 2030, according to the CBO, outlays for \nthose three programs will reach about 15 percent of GDP.\n  The chairman of the Senate Budget Committee held a number of hearings \non this fiscal timebomb earlier this year. Our Committee has received \ntestimony from the Office of Management and Budget, the Treasury \nSecretary, the General Accounting Office, the Comptroller, Chairman of \nthe Federal Reserve, and a number of think-tank representatives, and \nall, without regard to partisan stripe or affiliation, have highlighted \nthe need for us to get a handle on our mandatory budget or entitlement \nspending.\n  The chairman of the Federal Reserve noted that these rising \nentitlement obligations will put enormous pressure on the Federal \nbudget in the coming years.\n  In fact, if we do nothing over the next 30 years, we would not have a \ndime to pay for anything except for four areas: Social Security, \nMedicare, Medicaid, and part of the interest on the debt.\n  We will not have the resources for other important priorities, \nincluding fighting the global war on terror, securing our borders, \nveterans health care, and education.\n  As we all know, the President's budget includes a number of proposals \nto slow down the rate of growth in entitlement spending. I think this \nis a good place for the Senate Finance Committee to look at reducing \nthe debt.\n  If the majority has ideas that will also help reduce the debt, my \namendment gives them the opportunity to put it in action because it is \nan instruction to the Finance Committee to\n\n[[Page S3549]]\n\ncome up with a way, in their wisdom, that they believe they can \naccomplish this important goal.\n  Last year, I offered a similar amendment on the floor. Some on the \nother side noted how my amendment may be a little unpopular back home. \nThat is what happens when you go on a budget. We have been on a binge, \nwith no limitation on spending, and it is time for the Federal \nGovernment, similar to the American family, to get on a budget. No one \nlikes budgets, but it is the responsible thing for us to do.\n  I don't think it is unreasonable for us to find savings in the amount \nof $34 billion out of the growth of entitlement spending over the next \n5 years given that under the budget during that period of time, the \nFederal Government will spend some $15 trillion. In other words, we are \nlooking for $34 billion in savings over the same period of time the \nFederal Government will spend $15 trillion.\n  As Chairman Bernanke said in his written testimony to our committee:\n\n       Addressing the country's fiscal problems will take \n     persistence and a willingness to make difficult choices.\n\n  The Comptroller General of the United States, in his written \ntestimony to the Budget Committee, said:\n\n       We owe it to our country, children and grandchildren to \n     address our fiscal and other key sustainability challenges.\n\n  As I said, this is not a partisan issue, or certainly should not be. \nOur distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee has been eloquent on \nthis subject. We see on this chart, he said on February 7, 2007:\n\n       I have said I am prepared to get savings out of long-term \n     entitlement programs.\n\n  Unfortunately, the number reflected at the bottom of this chart is \nthe number of savings from entitlement programs in the budget he has \nproposed. It is a big fat goose egg. I think we can do better.\n  I heard time and time again Members on a bipartisan basis say this is \none area where we ought to work together to try to solve this problem \nfor our children and grandchildren so we don't pass our debt to them \nfor what we are spending today in these entitlement programs. But I \nask: If not us, then who? And if not now, then when?\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, first of all, the chart by the Senator is \nfactually wrong. When he puts up a zero, he is not talking about my \nbudget because my budget has $15 billion in savings out of Medicare. So \nthat chart, as colorful as it is, is just factually inaccurate.\n  No. 2, if we look at what the Senator is proposing, the majority of \nthe Medicare savings that are in the President's budget that Senator \nCornyn is picking up in his proposal are generated by either freezing \nor cutting market basket updates for hospitals, for nursing homes, for \nrehabilitation facilities, for hospice, for home health, and ambulance \nservices in every year over the next 10 years.\n  MedPAC, which makes recommendations on market basket updates 1 year \nat a time, does not concur with many of the proposed cuts in 2008, much \nless the cuts over the next 10 years. For example, given the negative \nmargins many hospitals are facing, MedPAC which is bipartisan, \nnonpartisan--has recommended a full market basket update in 2008 for \ninpatient and outpatient hospitals.\n  In many cases, over time, these across-the-board cuts proposed by \nSenator Cornyn will hurt seniors' access to health care.\n  There is no question about us having a serious problem with respect \nto the long-term entitlement challenges and what is the right way to \ndeal with it. Frankly, I don't think any budget resolution is the place \nto deal with the long-term entitlement challenge. The budget resolution \nis only for 5 years. The contribution the budget resolution can make is \nto achieve balance within that period, budget balance within that \nperiod, but I believe the long-term challenges, which are challenges of \n15, 20, 25 years, can only be resolved by a bipartisan working group or \ncommission, equally represented by Democrats and Republicans, to come \nback to Congress with a proposal to deal not only with Medicare but \nMedicaid and Social Security and the other long-term fiscal imbalances \nwe have. Senator Gregg and I have such a proposal. I think that is the \nright way to address these long-term problems.\n  We all acknowledge we are on a course that absolutely is \nunsustainable. As chairman of the Budget Committee, I have organized \nhearing after hearing after hearing to put a focus on precisely that \nproblem. We all know in this country that we are spending far more on \nhealth care than any other country. Mr. President, 16 percent of our \ngross domestic product is going for health care. The next largest \nspender in comparison is at 11 percent of gross domestic product. That \ndifference--the difference between 11 percent of gross domestic product \nand 16 percent--is $800 billion a year--a year.\n  To put the President's Medicare and Medicaid cuts and the cuts \nproposed by this amendment in perspective, consider that his budget \nwould cut those programs by $270 billion over the period from 2008 to \n2017. Those savings would be more than wiped out by the $2 trillion in \ntax cuts proposed by the President over that same period. They talk \nabout helping us get back on some kind of fiscal path, but the math \ndoesn't work. The math doesn't come close to working. They would have \nsavings from Medicare and Medicaid of $270 billion over that 10-year \nperiod, but that is totally dwarfed by the cost of their tax cuts over \nthat same period.\n  I do not believe this amendment merits our support. I do not believe \nthis is the right policy. I do not believe cutting the reimbursement \nfor hospitals, for nursing homes, for rehabilitation facilities, for \nhospice, for home health, and ambulance services is the right way to \nproceed.\n  I do believe we need separately, apart from a budget resolution, to \ndeal with the long-term entitlement challenges, either through the kind \nof working group Senator Gregg and I have proposed or through a \nbipartisan commission. I don't think a budget resolution that will be \nlargely supported just on one side of the aisle is the appropriate \nplace to deal with these long-term challenges.\n  Mr. President, what is the time remaining?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The proponent of the amendment has \n54 minutes remaining. The majority manager has 54 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, here is the problem. The budget before us \ndoes absolutely nothing in the area of addressing entitlement reform \nand savings and does a significant amount of spending money, a \nsignificant amount of tax increases. It raises the tax burden of the \nAmerican people from its historic level 18.2 percent up to 20 percent. \nIt raises taxes by hundreds of billions of dollars. It raises spending \nby tens of billions of dollars but does not address the most \nfundamental issue we face as a nation, which is the pending financial \nmeltdown of this country as a result of the baby boom generation \nretiring, and our children cannot afford the costs.\n  The Senator from Texas is right, there are zero savings on the \nmandatory side of this budget. When the chairman gets up and says there \nis $15 billion of savings, he forgot to finish the sentence. There is \n$30 billion of spending. So actually there is a net loss on the \nentitlement side for the proposed budget. That has been adjusted by the \namendment of Senator Baucus, so it is now basically a wash where we \nhave no savings, $15 billion of savings, $15 billion of new spending in \nentitlement programs. So there is a zero on that account.\n  What is being proposed by the President is entirely reasonable. What \nis being proposed by Senator Cornyn is reasonable. He suggests going \nforward we should accurately reflect the reimbursement rate for \nhospitals and for providers--not doctors in this instance but for \nproviders. It doesn't affect beneficiaries. But to call this a freeze \nor a cut is totally disingenuous because it is neither. Spending is \ngoing to increase dramatically in the entitlement accounts, especially \nin Medicare, by trillions of dollars. Only in the nomenclature of the \nDemocratic side of the aisle is a trillion dollars of increase called a \ncut when it is reduced from trillions to trillions less .2 percent,\n\n[[Page S3550]]\n\ntwo-tenths--two-hundredths of 1 percent.\n  That being said, it is not even a freeze or reduction from the \nconcept of the way it is structured. What is being proposed in the \nCornyn amendment, which is reflective of the President's original \nproposal, which is the reimbursement rate, which is now inflated by 1.5 \npercent because of savings and technological advances, so the \nreimbursement rate is about 1.2 percent more than it should be to \naccurately reflect the fair reimbursement rate because the \nreimbursement rate is inflated by savings and benefits which providers \nget through cost savings and technological advantages--what is being \nproposed by the Cornyn amendment is we take half that inflated \npayment--just half of it--and put it back into making the system more \nsolvent so our kids can afford the system and we will have a solvent \nsystem for our seniors.\n  That is what this is about: taking half of that inflated payment, \nwhich is about a six-tenths of 1 percent adjustment. Yes, it translates \ninto big dollars, but as a practical matter, it is a fair adjustment, \nand we save it so that our kids can benefit from it by having a more \naffordable system and our seniors can benefit from it.\n  The President's program does not affect senior citizens. It affects \nproviders. Only the wealthiest seniors citizens will be impacted by the \nPresident's program, and we will get to that amendment next, which will \nbe the Part D premium and how that should be reimbursed by wealthy \nseniors.\n  This is a reasonable amendment. It is regrettable it wasn't included \nin this budget. The Senator said this budget is only going to be passed \nby the other side. Quite honestly, if the Senator had accepted this \namendment and the Ensign amendment which will be next, which would make \nthe Part D premium properly reimbursed, and had taken the Kyl amendment \nyesterday, he would have a bipartisan budget. He would have a \nbipartisan budget. But he wants to stick to the tax-and-spend, do-\nnothing-on-entitlements budget he brought to the floor. He doesn't have \na bipartisan budget. We are trying to help him out. We are trying to \nmake it bipartisan, more reasonable and, most importantly, helping out \nour kids and people who are going to retire by making the Medicare \nsystem more solvent.\n  This amendment, if it is adopted, and the next one--if those two \namendments are adopted, they will address the outyear insolvency of the \nMedicare trust fund, which is now about $32 billion, and will reduce \nthat insolvency between 25 percent and 35 percent. That is huge and is \ngood news. It would be very good news if we do it. We should do it. If \nwe don't do it, in 10, 15 years, we will have to pay the piper. The \nsystem will melt down, our kids will be stuck with the bills, and their \nlifestyles will be impacted in a very negative way.\n  Why don't we get a time agreement on this amendment so we can go to \nthe next amendment and move on?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I don't think we are quite prepared to do \nthat because we have others who are going to want to speak. But I think \nwe can deal with this pretty expeditiously and come pretty close to the \ntentative schedule to which we agreed.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, much of what the Senator has just said, \nfrankly, I agree with. The truth is, we are on a completely \nunsustainable course. It must be dealt with. The question is how to \nbest deal with it.\n  With respect to the amendment of the Senator from Texas, I got a \nletter from 43 of our colleagues in the Senate, including 11 \nRepublicans, on this very subject. They said: Do not cut hospital \nreimbursement.\n  In my part of the country, hospitals are dealing with negative \nmargins. They are losing money. If this amendment were to go forward, \nunfortunately, it would be devastating to hospitals, to nursing homes, \nto hospice care, to ambulance services, especially in the rural parts \nof our country, and virtually every State has rural parts.\n  The MedPAC statistics are very clear on this question. Yes, there are \nsome hospitals that are enjoying positive margins. They tend to be \nurban hospitals that have much higher rates of reimbursement under \nMedicare than do rural hospitals. Let me give an example.\n  In my State of North Dakota, at Mercy Hospital in Devils Lake, ND, if \nthey are treating somebody who had a heart attack, they get one-half \nthe reimbursement of Our Lady of Mercy Hospital in New York City--one-\nhalf as much. Their costs aren't half as much, but their reimbursement \nis half as much. By the way, those hospitals, many of them in my \nState--I have over 40--are experiencing negative margins. They are \nlosing money.\n\n  The Senator says this doesn't represent a cut. He is right in one \nsense. It will be more money. But in relationship to the expense, it \nwill be less. That is the way in which it represents a cut. He is \nabsolutely correct it will be more dollars the next year than the year \nbefore, but in relationship to the expenses, which are going up more \nrapidly in health care, as we all know, than the underlying rate of \ninflation, guess what. It will be less. That is why I use the term ``a \ncut.''\n  To say the budget before us doesn't do anything about these matters \nis not true.\n  First of all, we have $15 billion of Medicare savings in the \nunderlying budget resolution. That is No. 1.\n  No. 2, we have a reserve fund called the Health Information \nTechnology Reserve Fund. All of us know the expansion of information \ntechnology in health could lead to very significant savings. In 2005, \nonly 15 to 20 percent of physicians' offices and 20 to 25 percent of \nhospitals had electronic medical records systems. According to \nestimates by a RAND study from 2005, our Nation's health care system \ncould save more than $81 billion annually if we had widespread \nimplementation of electronic medical records--$81 billion a year. That \ntotally dwarfs the savings of the amendment of the Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. President, I know the Senator from Ohio is here and wishes to \nrespond. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I thank my friend, the Senator from North \nDakota, for his terrific work on this budget, and I rise to oppose the \nEnsign amendment.\n  Medicare is a social contract. Individuals pay into the program \nduring their working years, and they receive health coverage when they \nretire. One good way to undermine universal support, to undermine \nsupport for the program is to arbitrarily make part of the Medicare \npopulation pay a significantly higher price for the same product. \nUltimately, this will drive higher income individuals out of the \nprogram to purchase their own coverage. When that begins to occur, \nworking individuals will begin to wonder why they are paying Medicare \ntaxes when Medicare coverage may or may not be worth their while on \nretirement.\n  Medicare, I repeat, is a social contract. Efforts to undermine it, \nsuch as this one, will fail.\n  It is interesting that there are Members of this body who want to \nraise taxes on Medicare beneficiaries while at the same time cut taxes \nfor Donald Trump. I repeat: Raise taxes for Medicare beneficiaries but \ncut taxes on some of the wealthiest individuals in our country. If you \nwant to undermine Medicare, create winners and losers among its \nenrollees, then that is the way to do it.\n  There is something else at work here, though. I came to the House of \nRepresentatives 14 years ago, and almost immediately, I saw the \nhostility many Members of this body and that body felt toward Medicare. \nIn 1995, when the Republicans took control of the House of \nRepresentatives, one of the first things they did--it was their first \nopportunity to go after Medicare--they proposed tens of billions of \ndollars in cuts in Medicare in order to pay for their tax cuts for the \nwealthiest people. The same kind of thing here--cut Medicare to pay for \ntax cuts on the wealthiest people in our country. That is the kind of \nhostility they had. Every time they had a chance, once they were in the \nmajority, they tried to do it.\n  The Speaker of the House in those days said that under his plan, \nMedicare would wither on the vine. So they began attempts to privatize \nMedicare, to shift to fee-for-service. Traditional Medicare, which had \nserved this country well--at that point for three decades, now for four \ndecades--they wanted to take traditional Medicare and to\n\n[[Page S3551]]\n\nprivatize it and push some Medicare beneficiaries out of traditional \nMedicare into Medicare managed care. The Government pays more for \nMedicare managed care, and beneficiaries and taxpayers get less for \nthose dollars. But it is all part of their efforts to undermine \nMedicare.\n  Maybe we should go back further than 10 years ago or 14 years ago and \ngo back to 1965 when Medicare was created. In this body, overwhelming \nnumbers of Republicans opposed Medicare, the creation of it. In this \nbody and across the hall, in the House of Representatives, a huge, \noverwhelming majority of Republicans opposed the creation of Medicare \nthen. They were hostile to the concept of universal coverage, of making \nsure every elderly person in this country had the opportunity to enroll \nin Medicare. They are hostile to it today, and they were hostile to it \nin 1995, when Speaker Gingrich said Medicare would wither on the vine. \nThey began the attempts to cut Medicare on the one hand and to do \nfurther damage by privatizing it on the other.\n  We are continuing to see this assault even now. They say they are for \nMedicare. They run television ads saying: We would never cut Medicare; \nwe think it is a great program. But when they come to the floor of this \nbody, of this Senate Chamber, over and over, from every different \ndirection, they attack one of the single greatest programs that this \nGovernment has ever created and that our people have ever had.\n  In 1965, half the elderly in this country had no health insurance. \nToday, after 41\\1/2\\ years of Medicare, almost everybody in our country \nis covered. If they had their way, they would begin to privatize, they \nwould begin to cut, and Medicare would not be the universal program \nwith the universal, overwhelming support of the people in this country.\n  If the Senate wants to reflect what the people in this country think, \nwe should overwhelmingly defeat the Ensign amendment because it \nundercuts what is best about our health care system. It undercuts the \nuniversal nature of Medicare, which works for everybody. If you want to \npreserve Medicare, there are things we can do to fix it, to make some \nsmall adjustments. But this amendment is not the way. We should defeat \nthe Ensign amendment.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I have attempted not to respond to the \nSenator from Ohio because he appears to be stuck in the period of 1960, \nwhen, apparently, our position was defined by somebody who was here in \n1960. I wasn't here in 1960. I probably won't be here in 2025. In fact, \nI am absolutely sure I won't be. But that is going to be when this \nMedicare system goes broke.\n  What I am concerned about is my children, America's children, and \ntheir children being able to afford this system when I retire and the \nrest of my generation retires and makes it basically unaffordable. The \nproposals the President has put forward are an attempt to make the \nsystem solvent, or at least more solvent. It doesn't bring it into \nsolvency, and there are reasons for that.\n  The Senator from North Dakota makes a good point: Rural hospitals are \nnot reimbursed correctly under the formula. But that is not the issue \nwhich is being raised by the Cornyn amendment. That issue, actually, \nwill be addressed by the Grassley amendment, which I understand is \ngoing to be offered to get the reimbursement straight.\n  What is very obvious is that there is an inflated reimbursement rate \noccurring within Medicare of about 1.2 percent due to technology \nadvancements and due to savings through efficiencies, which is inuring \nto the benefit of the system at the expense of the long-term life \nstructure of the system. It is reasonable to take half that benefit--\nhalf that benefit--and apply it to make sure the system has more \nsolvency to it.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 472\n\n  Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on behalf of Senator \nEnsign, and I ask that it be reported.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Obama). Without objection, the pending \namendment is set aside, and the clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. Gregg], for Mr. Ensign, \n     for himself, Mr. Gregg, and Mr. Graham, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 472.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To require wealthy Medicare beneficiaries to pay a greater \n                share of their Medicare Part D premiums)\n\n       On page 4, line 6, decrease the amount by $102,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 7, decrease the amount by $312,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 8, decrease the amount by $633,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 9, decrease the amount by $868,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 10, decrease the amount by $1,113,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 15, decrease the amount by $102,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 16, decrease the amount by $312,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 17, decrease the amount by $633,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 18, decrease the amount by $868,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 19, decrease the amount by $1,113,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 24, decrease the amount by $102,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 25, decrease the amount by $312,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 1, decrease the amount by $633,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 2, decrease the amount by $868,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 3, decrease the amount by $1,113,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 7, decrease the amount by $102,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 8, decrease the amount by $414,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 9, decrease the amount by $1,048,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 10, decrease the amount by $1,916,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 11, decrease the amount by $3,029,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 15, decrease the amount by $102,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 16, decrease the amount by $414,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 17, decrease the amount by $1,048,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 18, decrease the amount by $1,916,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 19, decrease the amount by $3,029,000,000.\n       On page 19, line 12, decrease the amount by $100,000,000.\n       On page 19, line 13, decrease the amount by $100,000,000.\n       On page 19, line 16, decrease the amount by $300,000,000.\n       On page 19, line 17, decrease the amount by $300,000,000.\n       On page 19, line 20, decrease the amount by $600,000,000.\n       On page 19, line 21, decrease the amount by $600,000,000.\n       On page 19, line 24, decrease the amount by $800,000,000.\n       On page 19, line 25, decrease the amount by $800,000,000.\n       On page 20, line 3, decrease the amount by $1,000,000,000.\n       On page 20, line 4, decrease the amount by $1,000,000,000.\n       On page 25, line 12, decrease the amount by $2,000,000.\n       On page 25, line 13, decrease the amount by $2,000,000.\n       On page 25, line 16, decrease the amount by $12,000,000.\n       On page 25, line 17, decrease the amount by $12,000,000.\n       On page 25, line 20, decrease the amount by $33,000,000.\n       On page 25, line 21, decrease the amount by $33,000,000.\n       On page 25, line 24, decrease the amount by $68,000,000.\n       On page 25, line 25, decrease the amount by $68,000,000.\n       On page 26, line 3, decrease the amount by $113,000,000.\n       On page 26, line 4, decrease the amount by $113,000,000.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, the Ensign amendment addresses what the \nSenator from Ohio started speaking on. He anticipated, I guess, this \namendment.\n  To try to explain the way the Medicare system works today, Part A you \npay for, theoretically, with your hospital insurance. Part B, which \ndeals with doctors, you pay for, theoretically, with a premium, but the \npremium is subsidized to the tune of 75 percent of the cost of the \npremium. Part D, you don't pay for anything, for all intents and \npurposes, except for the insurance, to the extent you buy insurance. \nBut the actual coverage that is federally supplied is not paid for. \nPart D is a drug benefit. This amendment says that high-income \nindividuals, people with incomes over $80,000 individually and $160,000 \njointly, should have to pay a fair proportion of the premium of Part D \nthat is now being subsidized by working Americans.\n  Let me try to put it in context. There is a single woman working in a \nrestaurant in downtown Des Moines or\n\n[[Page S3552]]\n\nthere is a mother and father working on an assembly line in \nPoughkeepsie or there is a father working in a garage in New Hampshire. \nThose individuals, working for a living and trying to make ends meet, \ntrying to do all the things you want to do to make your life better, \nare paying the cost of the drug insurance for retired Senators and for \npeople who have extraordinary amounts of money--for example, Bill \nGates' father. I don't mean to pick on Bill Gates' father, I am sure he \nis a nice man, but he has enough money to pay for his drug insurance \nunder the Part D Program, as can retired Senators, in most instances. \nYet those people are being subsidized by working Americans because we \nhave this system which doesn't require people to pay any portion of the \nfair cost of their drug insurance. We do it under Part B, we do require \nhigh-income people to pay, but under Part D, we don't. Now, with Part \nB, we don't require them to pay enough, but we at least require them to \npay something. Part D, we don't.\n  So this amendment simply says that in the Part D Program, high-income \npeople, people with incomes over $80,000 and $160,000, should have to \npay some of their cost. I find it incredible that the Senator from Ohio \nopposes that on the grounds of fairness to working Americans. The \nworking Americans are the ones having to pay that cost. It is just \nincomprehensible to me that the other side of the aisle, which \nconsistently talks in terms of making sure high-income people pay a \nfair share of the burden of the Federal Government's costs, are not \nwilling to ask those same high-income individuals pay the fair share of \nthe cost of Medicare. And we are not even asking for a fair share, \nquite honestly.\n  So that is what the Ensign amendment does. It is a very appropriate \namendment, and it would save a significant amount of money over the \nlong term for the Medicare trust fund. I think it is somewhere around \n$1 trillion. It would actually move the Medicare system toward solvency \nby $1 trillion over the actuarial life, which is 75 years. In the short \nterm, it is obviously nowhere near that number. But it is a significant \neffort to try to put in place a good policy, a correct policy, which is \nthat high-income individuals should pay a fairer cost of their drug \nbenefit and at the same time use those funds to make the Medicare \nsystem more solvent for seniors who are going to be retiring in the \nfuture. It is very reasonable. It only affects 5 percent of seniors, \nwhich means 95 percent of seniors are not impacted at all and, thus, it \nshould be done. It should be done now. We shouldn't wait to do it. We \nshould do it now because now this problem is coming at us pretty fast. \nIf we don't get started on it, it is like that old oil filter ad: You \ncan pay me now or pay me later. If we wait until later, this will be \nextraordinarily expensive. This is one of the things we should do, \nalong with the original Cornyn amendment. We should also do that.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I actually enjoy listening to my \ncolleague, Senator Gregg, because he is thoughtful and passionate on \nthese matters, and in many ways we are in very close agreement. I know \nit may not appear that way to people listening, but there are many \nthings the Senator says that are absolutely true, and so that part of \nhis presentation I want to agree with.\n  It is absolutely the case that we are headed on a course which is \nunsustainable. It is absolutely the case we cannot continue on the \ncurrent path. It is absolutely the case that, in my judgment, a policy \ninitiative along the lines of what the Ensign amendment provides is \ngoing to have to be part of an ultimate solution. In fact, I voted for \nsuch things with respect to Part B in the past. I have supported them \npublicly. I have campaigned on those things. But I must say, the \nreality here is this: We all know the budget resolution does certain \nthings and does not do certain other things. The budget resolution, as \nmuch as we might want it to, does not determine policy outcomes such as \nthose prescribed in the Ensign amendment or, for that matter, the \nCornyn amendment. It simply doesn't have that power.\n\n  The budget resolution will give an assignment to the Finance \nCommittee of how much money to raise, of how much money to spend. It \ndoes not tell them how to do it. Both the Cornyn amendment and the \nEnsign amendment seek to do something the budget resolution cannot do. \nThey seek to prescribe, to require the Finance Committee to come up \nwith certain policy outcomes. The Budget Committee does not have that \npower, it does not have that authority, and it cannot be done through a \nbudget resolution.\n  Let's be square with people who are listening about what we can do \nand what we cannot do. The effect of these amendments, the true effect, \nwill not be to do any of the policy prescriptions we talked about here. \nIt will only be to reduce the amount of money for Medicare the Finance \nCommittee has to meet the needs of the American people. That is what \nthese amendments will do.\n  On the specific policy of the Ensign amendment, I am sympathetic to \nthe basic notion. The problem is the specifics. The devil is in the \ndetails. First, as a member of the Finance Committee as well as the \nBudget Committee--and the Finance Committee will decide this, not the \nBudget Committee--on the policy of this amendment raising Part D \npremiums for certain higher income enrollees, I have many questions. \nHow would CMS go about charging some people higher premiums under Part \nD when the premiums are set by drug plans, by private drug plans, not \nby CMS? How is that going to work? How can CMS require higher premiums \nto be collected from private plans? As we all know, there are more than \n1,500 private drug plans, each with a separate premium they offer. How, \nconceivably, would this policy be implemented?\n  Premiums are important price signals for beneficiaries in the \nMedicare Part D Program. Under this approach, would we be setting \nmultiple premiums for a single Part D plan? Will this not add to the \ncomplexity of the program? This seems to dramatically complicate the \nmarket-based approach of Part D.\n  When the administration came before the Finance Committee on this \nproposal, they had no answers when asked how their premium proposal \nwould actually work and how it would affect the ability of \nbeneficiaries to shop for plans. The administration simply had not \nthought through how this would all work in the real world. This is \nanother reason why the Budget Committee in a budget resolution does not \nmake these judgments. It simply does not because this is a policy \ndetermination that is in the authority of the Finance Committee.\n  While I am very sympathetic to the basic notion of income-related \npremiums and Medicare--I think it is going to have to be part of the \nlong-term solution--the Budget Committee doesn't make these \ndeterminations. The Budget Committee does not make this policy. To \nsuggest it does is simply to mislead our colleagues and mislead those \nwho are listening. The one thing that these two amendments, the Cornyn \namendment and the Ensign amendment, would do is to cut funding, reduce \nfunding that the Finance Committee would have to provide resources \nunder Medicare. All the other things they have talked about here, the \npolicy prescriptions they have outlined, are a nullity. They mean \nnothing because the Budget Committee and the budget resolution do not \nmake those decisions.\n  Let's go to the larger question of how are we going to get out of \nthis very serious long-term entitlement crunch we face? As I have \nindicated, I believe the only way it is going to happen is either a \nworking group or a commission that is bipartisan in nature, evenly \ndivided between Republicans and Democrats, that is given the authority \nto come up with a plan and that they then come back to Congress on a \nfast-track basis for congressional approval. I believe it requires the \ninvolvement of the administration. I believe it requires the \ninvolvement of Democrats and Republicans in the Senate and the House. I \nbelieve it involves health information technology--which we have a \nreserve fund in this budget resolution to address, which the RAND \nCorporation has told us could save $80 billion a year.\n  I believe it involves focusing on the chronically ill; that is the 5 \npercent of Medicare beneficiaries who are using half of the money. We \nalready know if we better coordinated their care, we could have \nsubstantial budget savings and get better health care outcomes. What a \nremarkable thing that would\n\n[[Page S3553]]\n\nbe, to both save money and to get better health care outcomes. How \ncould that be? Very simply: That 5 percent of Medicare beneficiaries \nwho are using half of the budget, no one is managing their cases--or in \nmost cases nobody is managing their cases. So what happens? They are \nseeing multiple specialists who are giving them multiple prescriptions. \nThey are being subjected to multiple tests, none of it very well \ncoordinated. As a result, a lot of money is wasted and in many cases \nthey are made less healthy. How can that be?\n  We did a study with some 20,000 patients. We put a case manager on \nevery one of their cases. It was very interesting. The first thing they \ndid was go into their households and get out all the prescription drugs \nthey were taking. On average they found they were taking 16 \nprescription drugs. After review of the cases, they found they could \ncut that in half, cut it down to eight prescription drugs. The result \nwas, people were healthier.\n  Let me give an example from my own life. I went into my father-in-\nlaw's kitchen and got all the prescription drugs he was taking out on \nthe table. Sure enough, he was taking 16 different prescription drugs. \nI got on the phone to the doctor, started going down the list. When I \ngot to the third drug he said, My God, he should not be taking that. He \nshould not have been taking that for the last 3 years.\n\n  I go further down the list, two drugs he is taking, the doctor says \nto me, He should never be taking those two together, they work against \neach other.\n  I said, Doctor, how does this happen?\n  He said, It is very simple. Your father-in-law has three doctors: a \nheart doctor, a lung doctor, an orthopedic specialist; he has me as his \nfamily practice physician. They are all prescribing different drugs for \nhim. None of them know what the other is doing. He is sick and \nconfused, his wife is sick and confused--we have chaos.\n  He said, I am the one who is supposed to know, but your father-in-law \nis getting prescriptions in the hospital pharmacy, the corner pharmacy, \nthe pharmacy down at the beach, he is getting a mail order. As I say, \nhe was sick and confused, his wife was sick and confused and nobody \nknew what was happening. He had three MRIs in the last 9 months of his \nlife.\n  That is what is happening in this medical system over and over. That \nis where the big money is. These amendments do not do anything about it \nand the fact is, no budget resolution can do anything about it because \nthe budget resolution does not decide these policy matters. It is left \nto the committee of authorization. It is left to the committee that has \njurisdiction, and the committee that has jurisdiction on these health \npolicy issues is not the Budget Committee, as much as I might wish it \nwere so. The committee of jurisdiction is the Finance Committee. They \nare the ones that will make these policy determinations.\n  As well meaning as these amendments are, No. 1, they do not do what \nthey say they are going to do and, No. 2, the thing they do accomplish \nis to cut funding for Medicare. And MedPAC, the nonpartisan-bipartisan \nprofessionals who make recommendations to us on Medicare policy, has \nsaid these cuts, these specific cuts would be counterproductive; that \nthey would cut hospitals, they would cut nursing homes, they would cut \nhospice care, they would cut ambulance services. In rural areas where \nhospitals are already suffering negative margins, what these amendments \nmight accomplish is to put those health care facilities right out of \nbusiness. That is what would happen in my State, according to the \nhospital directors of the more than 40 hospitals in my State. They say: \nYou pass these amendments and some of our hospitals are shutting their \ndoors.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I appreciate the intensity of the Senator \nfrom North Dakota. I wish it would be followed up with legislative \nlanguage. I have heard his talk before on Medicare and on his family \nsituation, but he is going to be giving that same talk 10 years from \nnow at the rate we are going around here. We are not getting anything \ndone. These proposals would get things done.\n  The concept that this is going to close a hospital, a .6 percent \nreduction in the reimbursement rate, which is going up? That is absurd \non its face. No, what is being proposed here is a legitimate effort to \ntry to get at the underlying problem, which is the trust fund has a $32 \ntrillion unfunded liability--trillion. That is almost the net worth of \nthe entire country. That is almost as much in taxes as have been paid \nin since the country started. It is a huge problem. This budget does \nnothing about it, even though there has been significant rhetoric from \nthe other side of the aisle about that. We are suggesting we do \nsomething about it.\n  Sure, the budget doesn't do the nuts and bolts of policy, but the \nbudget has a lot of policy in it. You cannot on one hand say we don't \ndo nuts and bolts of policy and then have a budget which is laden with \npolicy--assumptions and specific language--in SCHIP, in taxes, in war \nfighting. It is inconsistent.\n  This is a reasoned approach, both of these amendments. Why shouldn't \nsomebody making more than $160,000 a year pay some fair percentage of \ntheir drug costs so somebody who does not have that type of money can \nafford the drug costs down the road? Of course, they should. These two \namendments are as close to apple pie as you can get if you are going to \ntry to address the issue of Medicare. They are reasonable. If we can't \ndo this, then we can't fix the Medicare system. That is the problem. If \nwe do not fix the Medicare system on our watch--since we are the \nproblem, the baby boom generation--then we have real issues. That is \nwhy we should proceed with these amendments.\n  I see Senator Smith is here. I suggest we move on to his amendment so \nwe can get on the time.\n  Mr. CONRAD. We can do that after I yield 5 minutes to Senator \nStabenow on these amendments, and then we can.\n  Mr. GREGG. Why don't we agree by unanimous consent that after Senator \nStabenow speaks for 5 minutes we go to Senator Smith?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Fair enough.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I thank the chairman and everyone for \nall the hard work they are doing on this very important budget. I am \nhappy to talk about ways we can save dollars in Medicare without \ncutting access or quality under Medicare. These amendments do not do \nthat. These amendments start from the premise that we are going to cut \nproviders. Let's look at doctors or hospitals or home health or maybe \nhospice, maybe nursing homes. It says what we ought to be doing is \ncutting back on payments in this system, which will cut back on their \nability to service people, the ability for people to get care they \nneed.\n  I find it so interesting on all of these amendments that folks--my \nfriends on the other side of the aisle--go after those who are \nreceiving health care. Medicare is a universal system. Everyone pays \nin. It involves choice. You can go to an HMO or your own doctor, you \ncan sign up for Part B and get more coverage, pay a bigger premium, \nPart B--it is a system that has worked, but everyone has paid in.\n  So this notion that somehow we are going to pick this apart on the \nfloor of the Senate without going through the process of looking at the \nwhole system and how we really achieve savings, really achieve savings \nwithout cutting services, is mind boggling to me.\n  We saw a $400 billion Medicare prescription drug benefit pass the \nSenate, which now costs more--we do not know how much more but costs \nmore--by the way, unpaid for, paid for on a credit card, I guess, that \nwe know could be less than that.\n  If we talk about savings in Medicare, let's negotiate prescription \ndrug prices. That is a way to make sure that we lower the price of \nMedicare. Now, it would involve taking on folks who many of my friends \non the other side of the aisle support, industries that benefitted from \nthis Medicare bill. But rather than saying we are going to cut our \ndoctors trying to service our seniors, or our hospitals trying to hold \nit together and treating people, or home health, rather than saying we \nare going to cut out services in some way, let's go to the real cost. I \nam happy to go to the real costs that we can address while increasing \naccess and quality.\n\n[[Page S3554]]\n\n  One is to negotiate a better deal, negotiate a better deal for \nprescription drugs. I hope we are going to, in fact, do that as a \nCongress to be able to get a better deal.\n  Another thing would be to take the 31 cents on every dollar in health \ncare that is the administrative cost--most of this is generated by the \nFederal Government in some way--and address health information \ntechnology, which many of us have worked on, Senator Snowe and I have \nlegislation on, Senator Kennedy, Senator Enzi. We have bipartisan \ninterest. Let's tackle that, and that would increase quality and access \nand dramatically cut the cost.\n  E-prescribing of prescription drugs alone, according to the Rand \nCorporation, would save $80 billion, just your pharmacy being able to \ntalk to your doctor, talk to the hospital, and so on.\n  I came from a meeting where people were talking about great things: \nthe increase in quality and access, and cutting costs. So let's talk \nabout health IT. Let's talk about generic drugs which, if we have more \ncompetition from generic drugs, we would dramatically bring down the \ncosts of Medicare.\n  So there is a lot we can do that does not involve going to the folks \nproviding care and saying: We are going to cut you one more time. We \nare going to cut you one more time, or going to the universal nature of \na health care system. This is not a low-income system. This is a \nuniversal system where everybody in America pays in, and it is stronger \nbecause of that.\n  So I would say that we should reject the two amendments in front of \nus. But we should certainly get about the business of addressing health \ncare costs in this country through Medicare and through other means. We \nspend almost twice as much of our GDP on health care than any other \ncountry, with 50 million people with no health insurance. That alone \nshows there is something wrong with that picture.\n  We know we have had increases in Medicare, no question about it. But \nlet's look at where they are coming from. Let's look at where they are \ncoming from. Certainly, the area of lacking prescription drug \ncompetition is a big one. Administrative costs is a big one. Let's look \nat where we can save costs. I know it means taking on some pretty big \nspecial interests. There has been an unwillingness to do that because \nthere are folks who make a lot of money off of Medicare, a lot of \nmoney.\n  I would not suggest it is the doctors or the hospital or the hospices \nor home health nurses, but there are folks who make a lot of money. \nThey do not want to see us deal with the real costs. So let's go back \none more time after the providers. Let's go back one more time and try \nto dismantle what is a universal health care system called Medicare. It \nworks.\n  Frankly, I would like to see that kind of a universal system \navailable, that is structurally available to every American, not just \nfind ways to cut the one part of universal health care that we have in \nthis country. I would hope that we would leave it to the Finance \nCommittee to wrestle with all of those issues and let us figure out how \nto do this right.\n  I would hope my colleagues would say no to these two amendments that \ntake us backwards in providing health care for every American.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 510\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I appreciate the efforts of the chairman \nand ranking member in setting forth a budget for the United States.\n  I come to the floor today to speak briefly about two amendments that \nI have at the desk that focus on two issues relating to health care, \nwhich I think are very important. I hear a lot of support in the \nChamber for the reauthorization of SCHIP. I, for one, not only want to \nreauthorize it but expand it.\n  There are all kinds of ideas for how to fund such a thing. I am here \ntoday to speak substantially about how we actually get the real dollars \nto accomplish that.\n  It is hard to do a townhall meeting in my State where the issue of \nhealth care does not come up. It should come up. Usually there is a \nstory about a child with a health condition ranging from a cold to a \nbroken leg, sometimes cancer, children who do not have access to health \ncare. You see it in the papers nearly every day. Frankly, it is \ninexcusable in the United States of America.\n  So I have come today to make a proposal on the budget that is unusual \nfor me because it involves a tax increase. I am very proud of my record \nin the Oregon State Senate and the U.S. Senate of opposing new taxes \nand voting to reduce taxes. But when it is appropriate, I have in the \npast voted to increase taxes on tobacco products in order to provide \nmoney for health care because of the important nexus that exists \nbetween tobacco use and public health care costs.\n  So today with my amendment I am proposing that Congress dedicate an \nincrease in the tobacco products excise tax of up to 61 cents to SCHIP \nreauthorization.\n  In my home State of Oregon, 117,000 children do not have access to \nhealth insurance. We know almost half of these children are currently \neligible for either Medicaid or SCHIP but they simply are not enrolled. \nThe challenge Oregon faces is that even if they allocate adequate State \nfunding to cover these children, they do not have enough Federal money \nunder the current SCHIP allotment to enroll them.\n  Increasing the tobacco excise tax would allow Oregon to reach out, as \nin other States, to find those kids and get them enrolled so they have \nhealth care coverage. Oregon is one of many States that have a looming \nso-called shortfall. Starting in 2009 the State of Oregon will run out \nof money to simply cover the children who are currently enrolled, to \nsay nothing of those who are eligible but unenrolled.\n  Should that happen, the State would potentially cut off new \nenrollments and be forced to reduce eligibility levels. So increasing \nthe tobacco excise tax will stop that from happening. While we do not \nyet have an official score from the Congressional Budget Office, we do \nknow that based on their estimates a 50-cent increase would generate an \nadditional $26.6 billion in new revenue.\n  The tax now stands at 39 cents. I proposed in my amendment to \nincrease that up to 61 cents for a total Federal tobacco tax of $1. \nThat would be dedicated to reauthorize SCHIP. I believe if the Finance \nCommittee chooses to utilize the full 61-cent increase, we would see at \nleast $30 billion for SCHIP, if not the $35 billion.\n  Therefore, I hope my colleagues will find it in their hearts and in \ntheir mouths to vote aye when this very important vote is cast because \nit literally means health care for children. Many groups have supported \nthis amendment. To name a few prominent ones: the March of Dimes, \nFamilies USA, the American Hospital Association, the National Council \nof Community Behavioral Health Centers, America's Health Insurance \nPlans, and First Focus.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 509\n\n  My second amendment relates to the battle against HIV/AIDS. This \nbattle is being hindered because we are not focusing enough effort on \nproviding early treatment to individuals who have been diagnosed with \nthis disease. By targeting treatment earlier, we can help prevent the \nprogression to full-blown AIDS. This is especially true for low-income \nindividuals who may lack stable access to potential lifesaving \npharmaceutical treatments and other health care services.\n  While Medicaid is an important provider of health care to those \nliving with HIV/AIDS, most States require that individuals become \ndisabled before they can qualify for coverage. In a sense, they must \nbecome sicker before they get treatment. That is simply not right. \nFull-blown AIDS is an incredibly costly illness to treat. It has much \nmore of an impact on an individual's quality of life than HIV.\n  From a fiscal and moral standpoint it is essential that we focus more \nof our resources on providing early treatment to individuals with HIV. \nThat is why I am filing an amendment to the budget resolution that \nwould create a $500 million deficit-neutral reserve fund for \ndemonstration projects that provide Medicaid coverage to low-income \nindividuals diagnosed with HIV.\n  It is similar to the bill that I filed last week along with 20 of my \ncolleagues that extends to all States the option of providing Medicaid \ncoverage to these individuals.\n\n[[Page S3555]]\n\n  That initiative, known as the Early Treatment for HIV Act, or ETHA, \nwas modeled after the successful breast and cervical cancer benefit \nadded to the Medicaid Program several years ago. The treatment \nauthorized under my amendment would be provided in the same earlier-is-\nbetter fashion, so that more HIV/AIDS cases are prevented from reaching \nthe point of full-blown AIDS.\n  My amendment would provide Congress and the Centers for Medicare and \nMedicaid Services the opportunity to learn more about the cost-saving \nbenefits of treating HIV in its early stages. It is expected that in \naddition to Medicaid, other Federal programs such as SSI and Medicare \nwill realize significant long-term savings by preventing individuals \nfrom being disabled by AIDS.\n  With more and more States having financial difficulties with their \nAIDS drug assistance programs, it is important that we provide \nalternative methods of delivering treatment to those with HIV/AIDS who \nmay be living in poverty. Most importantly, we will be able to help \nindividuals with HIV lead healthier and longer lives. That way they can \nremain active participants in both the community and the workforce and \nimprove their chances of living to one day see a cure for their \nillness.\n  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to support this amendment. It is a \nreasonable and responsible placeholder to add to the Senate's budget \nblueprint. I look forward to working with all of you in passing this \nlegislation should we enact it in the budget. I think we can greatly \nimprove Medicaid services in this way to those with low incomes who are \nafflicted with HIV.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Senator Ensign will now be recognized for 5 minutes. We \nwill then go to Senator Wyden, Senator Lieberman, and Senator Dorgan.\n  We appreciate very much Senator Ensign limiting his remarks to 5 \nminutes.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 472\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, my amendment would impose an income test \non the wealthiest seniors to ensure that they pay a greater share of \ntheir Medicare prescription drug coverage.\n  A couple of years ago, we had a vote in the Senate that would income-\nrelate--in other words, means test Medicare Part B, which pays for \nmedical services, like doctors' services. Medicare Part D is the part \nthat pays for prescription drugs.\n  Mr. President, we already means test Medicare Part B. In order to put \nthe Medicare program on better financial footing, we should extend the \nexisting Medicare Part B income test to the Medicare prescription drug \nprogram.\n  It makes no sense for Bill Gates's father to have his prescription \ndrugs paid for by a schoolteacher or a firefighter or a police officer \nor any other middle-income American. This amendment says that a single \nsenior, with an annual adjusted gross income over $80,000 and couples \nwith annual adjusted incomes of over $160,000 a year would be \nresponsible for a greater share of their Medicare Part D premium.\n  I have a chart that shows that the vast majority of Medicare \nbeneficiaries would not be impacted by this proposal. Almost 96 percent \nof Medicare beneficiaries would not be affected by my amendment. This \nmeans that only the wealthiest 4.3 percent of seniors enrolled in \nMedicare Part D will pay higher premiums in 2008. Wealthy seniors have \nthe means. We should not be burdening our children and grandchildren \nwith even further debt by subsidizing wealthy seniors. That is what \nthis amendment essentially does. It says that wealthy seniors should \npay more for the Medicare prescription drug benefit.\n  The other side of the aisle says that we should raise taxes on the \nwealthy. This isn't raising taxes. This is getting wealthy seniors to \npay for a benefit they are receiving that they never paid for. In the \npast, AARP and others have said that we should not means test Medicare.\n  In this instance, means testing is fair. Remember, that the Medicare \nprescription drug benefit is a new benefit. Today's seniors did not pay \ninto the Medicare program, through payroll taxes, with the promise of a \nprescription drug benefit. What this amendment says is that if you can \nafford to pay higher prices for the Medicare Part D premium, then you \nshould. That is, in essence, what this amendment is about. It is about \nfairness. Let's treat middle-income taxpayers of today and the future \nin a fair way by saying wealthy seniors--such as Bill Gates' father, \nsuch as my father, such as seniors who are in the upper-income \nbrackets--pay their fair share instead of dumping this liability on \nfuture generations of taxpayers and making them pay higher taxes \nbecause we want to subsidize seniors to the current extent.\n  The Medicare Part B program is already means tested. We should \nfurther means test the Medicare program by requiring Medicare \nbeneficiaries who make over $80,000 a year as a single and $160,000 a \nyear as a couple, responsible for a greater share of their Medicare \nprescription drug premium.\n  To show a little support, the Washington Post, which is not exactly a \nconservative newspaper--and usually isn't in my corner--wrote:\n\n       One worthy proposal, contained in the Bush budget, would \n     have imposed higher Medicare prescription premiums for \n     higher-income beneficiaries . . . Unfortunately an amendment \n     to that effect was defeated in the budget committee.\n\n  That was my amendment.\n\n       If Democrats are serious about dealing with health care \n     entitlement spending, isn't it time for them to demonstrate \n     that?\n\n  I believe it is time to demonstrate that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I begin by commending Senator Conrad and \nSenator Gregg for doing an exceptionally good job bringing \nextraordinary professionalism and thoughtfulness to this debate, \nparticularly because Chairman Conrad and Senator Gregg have focused on \nwhat are the big issues for this country. Relating to the domestic side \nof the budget--we all know the big international issue is Iraq--the big \nissues are taxes and health care. One of the most attractive parts of \nthe Conrad budget is that it lays the foundation for this country to \nlook at big fixes to our tax system and to health care.\n  If we listen to all the technical lingo that comes up over the course \nof this discussion--pay-go, firewalls, reserve funds; perhaps the staff \ndirector, who does such a terrific job, Mary Naylor, may know about \nsome of the intricacies of these terms--it is a complicated world of \n``budgetese.'' What we do understand, however, are taxes and health \ncare. The Bush tax cuts expire at the end of 2010. One of the reasons I \nsupport the Conrad budget is that it lays the foundation for meaningful \ntax reform. The Presiding Officer certainly hears this across the \ncountry: The tax system is broken. We now have three changes in the Tax \nCode for every working day. There have been more than 14,000 changes to \nthe Tax Code since the last comprehensive tax reform. We are all \ngetting ready to do our taxes again. Americans this spring will spend \nmore money filling out tax forms than our Government spends on higher \neducation. Senator Conrad has pointed out the problem of tax havens and \ntax scams. There is an opportunity, as a result of this budget, to come \ntogether in a bipartisan way and fix the tax system. We know what needs \nto be done.\n  First, we to have clear out all the clutter, the thousands and \nthousands of loopholes that have been added since the last tax reform \neffort. Second, we have to simplify the system. I have brought to the \nChamber a one-page 1040 form that is in my fair flat tax legislation \nthat I will be reintroducing, and I have had a number of good \nconversations with our friend from New Hampshire about it. This is a \nchance for Senators to work together in a bipartisan way. The people at \nMoney Magazine, the financial magazine, took my 1040 form and filled \nout their taxes in 15 minutes. It will bring about a dramatic change in \nAmerican taxation. So we clean out the clutter, make the system \nsimpler, and then keep progressivity.\n  There is a model for the Senate to follow. Senator Gregg and I heard \na bit about it in the Budget Committee. Senator Grassley and I heard a \nlot about it in the Finance Committee, when then-Chairman Grassley held \nhearings on tax reform during the last session. That is to take those \nprinciples I outlined--clear out the loopholes, hold\n\n[[Page S3556]]\n\ndown the rates, simplify the system, and keep progressivity--and once \nagain, because of this budget, fix American taxation in a bipartisan \nway.\n  It is worth noting that every witness who came before the Senate \nFinance Committee during the last session to talk about taxation said \nbuilding on the principles of the 1986 Tax Reform Act were the way to \ngo. Witnesses came to the Budget Committee earlier this year. They all \nsaid this was the right direction, to build on the principles of 1986. \nI have indicated to Senator Gregg--and I am interested in working with \nhim; he was part of the discussions that took place in the Budget \nCommittee--it is worth wrapping this subject up by way of saying the \nbudget that is before us now, the Conrad budget. It allows for the \nSenate to come together in a bipartisan way to fix the tax system. This \nis eminently doable.\n  The President had a commission on taxation. My one-page 1040 form is \n30 lines long. The President's is 34 lines long. For purposes of \nGovernment work, the two are equivalent. Democrats and Republicans can \ncome together on this, simplify the tax system, do what was done in \n1986 to clean out the clutter, hold down the rates, and keep \nprogressivity so that everybody has a chance to get ahead.\n\n  We have heard a lot of talk about class warfare. I am sure the \nPresiding Officer hears a great deal about this topic as he travels \naround the country. What Americans want is a system that gives \neverybody the opportunity to get ahead. That is what we ought to be \nworking on. That is what this budget allows.\n  In addition to taxes, this legislation allows for a bipartisan effort \nin this Congress to fix American health care, because of the reserve \nfund that is in the bill and constructive efforts that are going on in \nthe Senate. In all deference to the Presiding Officer, the \ndistinguished Senator from Illinois, and our other colleagues who are \nrunning for President of the United States, there is a feeling that \nthis question of fixing American health care is something that will be \ndealt with in 2009. I am here to tell the Senate, I believe there is a \ngood chance the Senate will come together in 2007. Five Democratic \nSenators and five Republican Senators sent a letter to the President, \nan important letter that involved both sides coming together. The \nRepublicans who signed the letter said: If you are going to fix health \ncare, you have to get everybody covered. If you don't get everybody \ncovered, the costs for those who are uninsured get shifted to those who \nare insured. That is a statement about universal coverage. It is about \n100 percent coverage. Our colleague from South Carolina, Senator \nDeMint, and others, have some good ideas about how to accomplish that. \nRepublicans moved in a way that is going to allow for a comprehensive \nbipartisan effort to fix health care. Democrats did as well because the \nDemocrats who signed the letter said: We need to modernize the \nmarketplace. We have a tax system for health care that made sense for \nthe 1940s; it doesn't make sense for 2007. The Tax Code for health \ncoverage disproportionately rewards the most wealthy and promotes \ninefficiency. That is how the Federal government is spending $250 \nbillion. The Democrats and Republicans came together and said: We want \nto work in a bipartisan way. Republican Senators such as Trent Lott and \nMike Crapo and Bob Bennett and Jim DeMint and John Thune, Democrats \nsuch as Kent Conrad, Ken Salazar, Senator Cantwell, Senator Kohl, and \nmyself said: With all due respect to our good friend from Illinois and \nour colleagues who are seeking the highest office in the land, we are \ngoing to do our best to fix health care in this Congress. We have an \nopportunity with our letter.\n  The Presiding Officer knows I have introduced S. 334, the Healthy \nAmericans Act. When I introduced that bill, the CEO of Safeway stood \nwith me, Steve Burd, with more than 200,000 employees, as did Andy \nStern, the president of the Service Employees International Union, with \nalmost 2 million members. Back in 1993 and 1994, business and labor \nwere fighting each other. Now they are coming together. What a \nremarkable transition. In 1993, the business community said: We can't \nafford health care reform. In 2007, the business community is saying: \nWe can't afford not to fix health care.\n  We have laid a bipartisan foundation in the Conrad budget for \nDemocrats and Republicans to come together in this session to fix \nhealth care.\n  An issue came up as we were going forward on the reserve fund that \nhighlights that while I think a comprehensive fix of American health \ncare can be done, there are going to be challenges along the way. One \nof them is how to deal with the CHIP program, the program that helps \nour youngsters. There is great support on both sides of the aisle for \nthe CHIP program. But there have been some in the Senate who have said: \nWe have to do CHIP and health reform together. We have to do both \ntogether, and that is the way to approach it. The universal coverage \nlegislation isn't quite ready to go. I am hopeful it will be ready \nbefore too long and that it will be bipartisan. The Conrad budget makes \nit possible for Senators to come together through a reserve fund for \nuniversal coverage.\n  I also want to make sure that the millions of youngsters who need \nhealth care now are not forced to wait. We should not deny those \nyoungsters justice right now, when the need, as the distinguished \nSenator from Illinois knows, is so great.\n  What we said in the budget is that after SCHIP is resolved--and I \nhope it will be very shortly--and we meet those urgent needs of \nmillions of youngsters, then we proceed to the question of bipartisan \nefforts to ensure there is comprehensive health reform.\n  Those are the two big issues of our time--tax reform and health \ncare--that relate to the domestic side of the budget. The Conrad budget \nleaves space for Democrats and Republicans to come together and fix our \ntax system and fix American health care.\n  (Mr. BROWN assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. WYDEN. Under the Conrad budget, and the fair flat tax I have \nintroduced, we could have a one-page 1040 form. People in the State of \nOhio--I advise the Presiding Officer, our colleague from Ohio, and we \nare thrilled to have him in the Senate--could be filling out their \ntaxes on a one-page form, ensuring progressivity, getting rid of the \nclutter, and holding down rates for everybody. Money magazine, when \nthey took that form, said they could do it in 15 minutes. So all of the \npeople in the State of Ohio and elsewhere who are pulling together \ntheir shoe boxes and their receipts right now in order to fill out \ntheir taxes, they could have an alternative, something based on a \nsystem we know works because Democrats and Republicans came together in \n1986 in order to have such a tax system.\n  The Conrad budget makes it possible for us to enact tax reform even \nbefore the Bush tax cuts of 2010 expire.\n  On the health care side, the same bipartisan effort could occur: \nDemocrats and Republicans could come together and fix health care. We \nestablish a universal coverage fund, a health care reform fund, in this \nbudget. It would allow, for example, for legislation, like the Healthy \nAmericans Act which I introduced, that has brought together Andy Stern \nof the Service Employees International Union and Steve Burd, the CEO of \nSafeway, to say: This is where we ought to start. It would allow for \nthe Democrats and the Republicans--who signed a letter to the President \nof the United States and said: We want to work with you, Mr. President, \nto fix health care--it would allow for that important effort.\n  A number of my colleagues on the Republican side have been extremely \nconstructive in working with me and others to get that legislation \nbefore the Congress--not in 2009, when the popular wisdom suggests we \nwill talk about health care, but in this session. But before that \nhappens, because of the efforts in the Budget Committee that are \nincluded in the Conrad budget, we will first protect and expand the \nprogram that ensures justice for children in health care--the CHIP \nprogram.\n  The CHIP reauthorization will come first. Passing CHIP legislation, \nhowever, is not going to diminish our efforts to work in a bipartisan \nfashion on overall health reform.\n  Both Senator Gregg and Senator Conrad are on the floor now. I just \nwant to let both of them know, and our very talented staff director, \nMary Naylor, that I believe they have brought extraordinary \nprofessionalism to this effort. They reflect great credit on the Senate \nin terms of how the two\n\n[[Page S3557]]\n\nof them and their staff work on this budget.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the budget that is before us \nparticularly because it lays the foundation for the Senate to tackle \nthe two big domestic issues of our time, taxes and health care. There \nare a lot of issues that come before us. Certainly Iraq is the premier \nissue as it relates to the international front, but the big issues at \nhome are taxes and health care. The Conrad budget allows for Democrats \nand Republicans to come together on taxes, as was done in 1986 for a \nsystem that gave everybody the chance to get ahead.\n  I know the Presiding Officer, my friend from Ohio, has heard a lot \nabout the whole topic of class warfare and the like. I think the \nSenator from Ohio hears the same thing I hear at home; that everybody \nought to have the chance to get ahead. Everybody ought to have the \nchance to do it. We could do that with a tax reform program that is \nfair to all. This budget allows it, and it allows for Democrats and \nRepublicans to come together on health care as well.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the budget. I commend Senator Conrad \nand Senator Gregg.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 525, as Modified\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment, which I understand is the Ensign amendment--is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. GREGG. Be set aside so I can send up a modification that has been \ncleared by the other side relative to the Cornyn amendment, and I ask \nunanimous consent that the Cornyn amendment be modified.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, have we \nseen this modification? Let me just reserve on that until I have \nconfirmation.\n  Is this a Cornyn amendment which is being modified?\n  Mr. GREGG. Cornyn amendment, as modified.\n  Mr. CONRAD. That is fine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 525), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place insert the following:\n       On page 4, line 6, decrease the amount by $2,047,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 7, decrease the amount by $4,291,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 8, decrease the amount by $6,949,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 9, decrease the amount by $9,936,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 10, decrease the amount by $13,270,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 15, decrease the amount by $2,047,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 16, decrease the amount by $4,291,000,000..\n       On page 4, line 17, decrease the amount by $6,949,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 18, decrease the amount by $9,936,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 19, decrease the amount by $13,270,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 24, decrease the amount by $2,047,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 25, decrease the amount by $4,291,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 1, decrease the amount by $6,949,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 2, decrease the amount by $9,936,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 3, decrease the amount by $13,270,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 7, decrease the amount by $2,047,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 8, decrease the amount by $6,339,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 9, decrease the amount by $13,288,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 10, decrease the amount by $23,224,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 11, decrease the amount by $36,494,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 15, decrease the amount by $2,047,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 16, decrease the amount by $6,339,000,000,\n       On page 5, line 17, decrease the amount by $13,288,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 18, decrease the amount by $23,224,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 19, decrease the amount by $36,494,000,000.\n       On page 19, line 12, decrease the amount by $2,000,000,000.\n       On page 19, line 13, decrease the amount by $2,000,000,000.\n       On page 19, line 16, decrease the amount by $4,100,000,000,\n       On page 19, line 17, decrease the amount by $4,100,000,000.\n       On page 19, line 20, decrease the amount by $6,500,000,000.\n       On page 19, line 21, decrease the amount by $6,500,000,000.\n       On page 19, line 24, decrease the amount by $9,100,000,000,\n       On page 19, line 25, decrease the amount by $9,100,000,000.\n       On page 20, line 3, decrease the amount by $11,900,000,000.\n       On page 20, line 4, decrease the amount by $11,900,000,000.\n       On page 25, line 12, decrease the amount by $47,000,000.\n       On page 25, line 13, decrease the amount by $47,000,000.\n       On page 25, line 16, decrease the amount by $191,000,000.\n       On page 25, line 17, decrease the amount by $191,000,000.\n       On page 25, line 20, decrease the amount by $449,000,000.\n       On page 25, line 21, decrease the amount by $449,000,000.\n       On page 25, line 24, decrease the amount by $836,000,000.\n       On page 25, line 25, decrease the amount by $836,000,000.\n       On page 26, line 3, decrease the amount by $1,370,000,000.\n       On page 26, line 4, decrease the amount by $1,370,000,000.\n       At the end of the bill, add the following:\n\n                        TITLE IV--RECONCILIATION\n\n     SEC. 401. SPENDING RECONCILIATION INSTRUCTIONS.\n\n       In the Senate, by June 1, 2007, the Finance Committee shall \n     report to the Senate changes in laws within its jurisdiction \n     sufficient to reduce outlays by $2,000,000,000 in 2008 and \n     $33,800,000,000 for the period of fiscal years 2008 through \n     2012.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, Senator Ensign had talked about his \namendment, and I did not have a chance to, once again, respond. I would \nlike to take that opportunity now, while we are waiting for Senator \nDorgan. Perhaps Senator Gregg would want to respond to what I might \nsay. Before we do that, maybe we should enter into an agreement with \nrespect to the votes that will occur at 11:30.\n  So for that purpose, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at \n11:30 a.m., the Senate proceed to vote with respect to the following \namendments in the order listed; that there be 2 minutes for debate \nbefore each vote, equally divided, and that after the first vote, the \ntime for the votes be limited to 10 minutes; that no amendments be in \norder to any of the amendments covered under this agreement: the DeMint \namendment No. 489, the Allard amendment No. 491, the Baucus amendment \nNo. 504, and the Cornyn amendment No. 511.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 472\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, let me just take a moment now to respond \nto Senator Ensign with respect to the amendment he has offered that \npurports to affect Part D premiums and have higher premiums for those \nPart D Program participants.\n  Let me just say, the basic concept, I am in sympathy with. The \nproblem is, the budget resolution does not make these policy \ndeterminations. This is a determination which is made by the Finance \nCommittee. That is the committee of jurisdiction. They are the ones who \nhave the sole right to make these kinds of policy determinations. The \nBudget Committee, as much as I might want it to, does not have the \nauthority to do that. Beyond that, the devil is in the details.\n  The notion you can charge higher premiums--certainly there is a way \nto do that, but the Senator has given us no indication of how it might \nbe done. When the CMS came before the Finance Committee on this very \nissue--because this is part of the President's budget--they were asked \nhow they would go about charging higher premiums under Part D when the \npremiums are not set by the Government, they are set by private drug \nplans.\n  As we all know, there are something like 1,500 Medicare drug plans. \nThose plans each have a separate premium they establish. So how is it \nthat CMS is going to tell all these private drug plans they are to \ncharge higher premiums to higher income people? Those private drug \nplans do not even know the income levels of the people who subscribe to \ntheir plans. So how is it, in a real-world situation, these plans would \ncharge higher drug premiums?\n  Again, the Government does not set these premiums. The companies that\n\n[[Page S3558]]\n\ndo set them do not have the information upon which to charge higher \npremiums to higher income people because they do not know what the \nincome is of the people who subscribe to their plans.\n  Further, premiums are important price signals for beneficiaries in \nthe Medicare Part D Program. So would we be setting multiple premiums \nfor a single Part D plan? Wouldn't that add to the complexity of the \nprogram? This seems to dramatically complicate the market-based \napproach of Part D.\n  I might add, when the administration came before the Finance \nCommittee--which is the committee of jurisdiction, which is the \ncommittee that has the authority to make these kinds of policy \ndeterminations--they had no answers to any of these questions. They \njust simply had not thought it through. That is one of the reasons why \nwe leave these kinds of determinations to the committee of \njurisdiction, because they have the expertise to make these \ndeterminations and to weigh the issue. The Budget Committee does not \nand does not have the authority to make these determinations.\n  Let me say my own belief is that the notion of income-relating \nMedicare benefits is going to have to be part of a longer term \nsolution. But that is not going to be decided on any budget resolution. \nThat is just a fact. All of the things Senator Ensign talked about will \nhave zero effect on the Finance Committee. What will affect the Finance \nCommittee is the number they are given of the resources that are \navailable for Medicare.\n  The effect of the Cornyn amendment--and the effect of the Ensign \namendment--will be to reduce the resources that are available to the \nFinance Committee for Medicare. What is that likely to mean? Well, it \nis very clear what it is likely to mean: reductions in reimbursement \nfor hospitals, for nursing homes, for hospice care, for ambulance \nservices. That is the real-world effect of the Cornyn amendment and the \nEnsign amendment.\n  I want to repeat that I got a letter from 43 Senators--11 of them \nRepublicans--urging that the budget resolution not cut reimbursement to \nhospitals. I just remind them, if that is something they are serious \nabout, then they are going to want to oppose the Cornyn amendment and \nthe Ensign amendment because the real upshot of those amendments is to \nreduce funding to the Finance Committee for those very purposes.\n\n  Mr. President, Senator Gregg may like to take the remaining minutes \nhere.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Yes, Mr. President. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, if you are going to vote against the Ensign amendment, \nyou are just simply saying millionaires in this country should not have \nto pay for their drug benefit under Medicare if they are retired and \nhave Medicare eligibility; and all millionaires who are retired and \nover a certain age have Medicare eligibility for drug benefits. It is \nthat simple.\n  To say the Budget Committee should not address this issue has the \npractical effect of saying the Budget Committee should not address \npolicy at the Federal level. The Budget Committee, of course, has a \nright to address this issue and should address it. In fact, it is the \nproper place to address it as the initial step. In fact, you could \nargue that if the Budget Committee does not address it, it will never \nget done because the protection that comes from reconciliation, which \nonly the Budget Committee can give an authorizing committee--that is, \nthe Finance Committee, the Armed Services Committee, or any other \ncommittee--derives from the Budget resolution, which is authored by the \nBudget Committee. You probably are not going to pass these types of \nchanges without reconciliation protection. So that is a straw dog \nargument of the first order.\n  This Ensign amendment specifically is an attempt to straighten out \nwhat was clearly an incorrect decision when Part D was put in place. \nThe Medicare trust fund is $32 trillion out of whack. In other words, \nwe know it is going to cost $32 trillion--that is with a ``t.''\n  Try to understand what that means--$1 trillion. Nobody can understand \n$1 trillion, but it is an amount of money that is staggering. All the \ntaxes paid in America since our country became a government, since our \ncountry was created, amount to something like $42 trillion. The entire \nnet worth of America--all your cars, all your stocks, all the houses \nAmericans own--represents something like $50 trillion, or maybe it is \nnot even that high--$47 trillion.\n  So we have a liability, which we have no idea how we are going to pay \nfor, of $32 trillion. The interesting part--that is why I want to point \nthis out again--is the drug benefit, when it was passed, aggravated the \nliability of the trust fund to the tune of $8 trillion. So of that $32 \ntrillion--although this chart could be used to explain this--of that \n$32 trillion, $8 trillion of that unfunded liability was generated by \nthe drug benefit. It shouldn't have been that high. One way it should \nhave been addressed was that we should have had wealthy seniors, \nmillionaire seniors, which is what the Ensign amendment does, paying a \nfair amount of the cost of that drug benefit. The Senator from North \nDakota says: Well, that can't be done. Of course, it can be done. Of \ncourse, it can be done. There are all sorts of reports that are filed \non CMS on the cost of reimbursement and how they are structuring these \ninsurance plans, and there is no question but it can be done. More \nimportantly, it should be done, as a matter of fairness, for working \nAmericans who are carrying the burden of seniors.\n\n  I notice Senator Dorgan is here and he wants to talk, so I will \nreserve on that.\n  The point is pretty important. If you want to vote for working \nAmericans to not have to subsidize millionaire Americans who are \nretired, you are going to want to vote for the Ensign amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. The Senator from North Dakota, Senator Dorgan, is now \nrecognized until 11:30.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, some would believe, and perhaps should \nbelieve, that this budget issue is very complex, very difficult and is \nhard to resolve. I accept all that. But there ought to be some things \nall of us would agree are very easy to deal with. The slam-dunks, as it \nwere; the issues that all of us ought to say: Enough, we are not going \nto put up with this on the revenue side.\n  Let me tell my colleagues the taxes I believe we ought to be getting \nthat we are not getting. Should we increase them? Absolutely. Those are \nthe taxes that would have been paid under normal circumstances but now \nare not being paid because companies have decided they want to run \ntheir income through a tax-haven country. They want to produce in \nChina, sell in America, and run their income through the Cayman \nIslands.\n  What is the purpose of that? To avoid paying U.S. taxes. They want \nall the opportunities of being an American company but none of the \nresponsibilities to pay the taxes to help this country run, to help \nthis country do what it should do.\n  So let me go through some of the examples. First, let me show a \npicture of the Ugland House. An enterprising reporter named ``David \nEvans'' did some research. This picture shows a five-story building on \nChurch Street in the Cayman Islands that is home to 12,748 \ncorporations. Now, we have talked about that. I have spoken about it in \nprevious months on the floor of the Senate. Why do I do that? Everyone \nunderstands that in this little building on a quiet street on the \nCayman Islands, there aren't 12,748 companies. That is a legal fiction \ncreated by some lawyers to allow companies to use this address to avoid \npaying U.S. taxes. That is what is inside this white building: \nfictional addresses so companies can park income here and avoid paying \ntaxes to the United States.\n  Should we shut that down? You bet your life we ought to shut it \ndown--just like that. It ought not be controversial. Do we not believe \nthat everybody ought to pay their fair share of taxes as a part of \nliving in this great country? So that is one issue. That, by the way, \nis a current tax scam that exists and is robust. I could go through the \nnames of companies that have many subsidiaries in tax-haven countries. \nI mentioned Halliburton the other day. They have 17 subsidiaries in the \nCayman Islands, a country that has never imposed a corporate income \ntax. They also have two subsidiaries in\n\n[[Page S3559]]\n\nLiechtenstein, for God's sake. But it is not just that company. I could \ngo through a whole list of companies that have dozens and dozens of \nsubsidiaries they have created in tax-haven countries to avoid paying \ntaxes in this country.\n  Let me give some other examples of what has been going on. This is \nDortmund, Germany. This is a picture of a streetcar in Dortmund, \nGermany. It is interesting. Actually, an American company leased the \nstreetcars in Dortmund, Germany. Why? Because an American company wants \nto run streetcars in Germany? No, not at all. These belong to city \ngovernment in Germany. An American corporation leased them, and \nimmediately leased them back to the German city, and then the company \nis able to claim large tax deductions that lower its tax burden in the \nUnited States. Here is what the city councilman, Manfred Jostes, said:\n\n       It's absolutely unbelievable. I still to this day can't \n     believe that something like this works.\n\n  A German city councilman trying to think through how is it we can \nlease our streetcars to an American company, they lease them back, we \nget a premium and never lose the opportunity to use them. The only \nthing that is valuable to the American company is they don't have to \npay taxes because they can claim large deductions relating to this \nstreetcar system in Germany.\n  It is not just streetcars. How about American companies buying town \nhalls? Here is a picture of a town hall in a German city that I can't \neven pronounce. That is a huge, old town hall owned by an American \ncompany. Why? Because they like town halls in Germany? No. Because they \nwant to be able to claim large deductions in an abusive cross-border \nleasing transaction with a German city for the purpose of reducing \ntheir tax obligations in this country.\n\n  Here is a railroad in Belgium owned by an American company. Because \nthey like to run trains in Belgium? No, no. It is about reducing their \ntaxes in our country.\n  How about an American company buying a German sewer system. This \none--Wachovia Bank has been pretty aggressive. They bought a German \nsewer system, and they reportedly get $175 million in U.S. tax savings \nby owning a foreign sewer system. The city in Germany--Bochum, Germany, \ndoesn't lose the use of its sewer system. The American corporation \ndidn't buy a German sewer system because they wanted to use the sewer; \nthey bought it because they wanted to lease it back to the German city \nso the U.S. company can depreciate it and reduce its tax burden to the \nU.S. Government. Sale and leaseback. Pretty unbelievable.\n  FleetBoston Financial and another investor bought Chicago's 911 \nemergency call system. Think of that. Chicago sets up a 911 emergency \ncall system, then sells it to two corporations. It is a city-owned \nsystem. The companies buy it, and lease it back to Chicago. Chicago \nstill has it. It is a sale and leaseback transaction by which an \nAmerican corporation can now own and lease back the 911 emergency call \nsystem in Chicago and be able to depreciate it to save money on their \ntax bill. It is unbelievable to me.\n  When are we going to put a stop to this? Well, the Finance Committee \ntook a look at these sale and leasebacks and owning foreign sewer \nsystems and they said: We will stop it as of this date, but everything \nelse is OK. It is not OK with me.\n  It is not OK with me that we still have companies that decide they \nwant to move their profits to a controlled offshore foreign subsidiary, \ndespite the fact that the subsidiary doesn't do any real business \nthere.\n  It is not OK with me that we still provide large tax breaks to U.S. \ncompanies that close down a manufacturing plant in this country, fire \nits American workers and move those good-paying jobs to countries like \nChina. When U.S. companies close down a U.S. manufacturing plant such \nas Huffy bicycles or Radio Flyer little red wagons, fires its American \nworkers and moves those good-paying jobs overseas, U.S. tax law \nactually gives companies like these a large tax break. This is a slap \nin the face of domestic companies that do not get this break. It is a \nslap in the face to hardworking Americans whose jobs are cut and moved \noverseas.\n  I have forced the U.S. Senate to vote to repeal this perverse tax \nbreak several times but it still remains in place. I will offer my \nproposal to eliminate this ill-advised tax subsidy again and again \nuntil it is gone.\n  So I have legislation in three areas that will shut these things down \nand shut them down for good. All of that, I understand, is able to be \naccomplished and has a fit in this budget proposal. Senator Conrad, I \nbelieve, has in this budget proposal provided room for the three \nproposals I have offered, the kinds of proposals that will finally and \nirrevocably shut down this nonsense.\n  Now, we are short of money. The fact is we are short of revenue, so \nhow are we going to get it? Are we going to go ask some people who go \nto work all day and take showers at night. You know, they get dirty and \nwork hard at a construction site, come home and have to take a shower \nafter work rather than before work. We are going to go back to those \nfolks and say: You know what. Our Government is short of money. We \nwould like you to pay some more in taxes. Or are we going to go to \nthese companies who have decided they want to own a sewer system in \nGermany? They want to have a ``fictional'' address on Church Street in \nthe Cayman Islands or they want to engage in transfer pricing.\n  Transfer pricing schemes, by the way, where companies have their own \nsubsidiaries and buy and sell from them and charge things such as $50 \nfor a tractor tire or $18 for a toothbrush; dramatic overpricing on the \none hand or underpricing on the other. They use this accounting scam to \ntry to demonstrate they have earned no money in the United States and \ntherefore owe no taxes in the United States when, in fact, they earned \na lot of money and transfer-priced those profits out of our country. \nAnother scheme. It is wholesale tax avoidance.\n  The question for this Senate ought to be now: Are we going to get the \nrevenue that is owed to us from some of the largest enterprises? I have \nnot named a lot of them. I could name a lot of them, and they should \nhave the opportunity to be named so that their shareholders know what \nthey are doing.\n  It wasn't long ago, by the way, when some of us came to the Senate \nfloor and named the companies who decided they wanted to renounce their \nAmerican citizenship. I was a part of that. The late Paul Wellstone was \na part of that. Paul sat right over there at that desk at the end of \nthat row and I remember it as if it were today, the speeches Paul would \ngive about this issue.\n  The companies have decided: You know what. We want all the benefits \nof being an American. We were chartered here. We exist here. We \nappreciate being here, but we don't want the responsibility of paying \ntaxes. That is the origin and the roots of some of this tax avoidance. \nBut then, it went even further. There was a time when companies said: \nYou know what. We appreciate being an American, but we can save a great \ndeal of money if we renounce our American citizenship and move our \ncitizenship to, let's say, the Bahamas. My thought was: You want to \nmove your corporate citizenship to the Bahamas for the purpose of not \npaying American taxes; then when you get in trouble, why don't you call \nin the Bahamian Navy. My understanding is they have a force of 20 \npeople. Perhaps I have understated it. But maybe then you ought to call \nthe Bahamian military when you get in some trouble, when someone tries \nto expropriate your assets somewhere around the world.\n\n  I come to the floor today because I am flat sick and tired of these \nschemes: The hood ornament on excess here is the schemes by which town \nhalls are now for lease or for sale, sewer systems are now for sale. \nYes, action has been taken to shut some of that down prospectively. \nYes, that is good. But we still have circumstances under which American \ncorporations are owning these assets, depreciating the assets that \nclearly are government assets for one single purpose, and that is to \navoid paying the taxes that they would otherwise owe to the United \nStates of America.\n  So then who pays taxes? Well, there is the infamous woman who once \nsaid: Only the little people pay taxes. She\n\n[[Page S3560]]\n\nsort of sniffed: Only the little people pay taxes. Well, we know who \ndoes pay taxes. It is people who work, who get a W-2 form which says: \nHere is your income, here is your withholding, here is the obligation \nyou have to the United States of America. No flexibility. You work, you \nearn an income, you pay taxes.\n  The word ``tax'' is not a dirty word. It is part of the price of a \ncivilized society. We build roads. We operate schools. We provide for \nthe defense of this Nation. We have a Center for Disease Control. We \nhave the National Institutes of Health. We run Bethesda Hospital and \nWalter Reed for the veterans. We do a lot of things that are pretty \nwonderful, and we have built a pretty spectacular country through \nprivate sector and public sector initiatives. But in order to do that, \nwe need a revenue base. Some of the biggest interests in this country \nhave decided: We want to be a part of everything America has to offer, \nbut we don't want to be a part of the revenue base. We want to find \nways to own a foreign sewer system or run our income through a \nfictional address in the Cayman Islands. We want a large tax break for \nshutting down a U.S. manufacturing plant and moving those jobs \noverseas. We want to find a way to transfer price so that we are \npricing safety pins at 100 times their value, or underpricing pianos, \nselling pianos for $40. That sort of transfer pricing is unbelievable. \nThat transfer pricing has allowed some corporations to scam the Federal \nGovernment and avoid paying the taxes they owe this country. So I came \nto the floor today only to say this: Part of the process of a budget is \nto make plans about spending. What is it we need to spend? What do we \nhave to do to invest in our country's future to strengthen our country? \nThen also, what kind of revenue can we expect and who shall contribute \nthat revenue? Who is responsible for paying taxes? It is not, as the \nsocialite sniffed, ``the little people''; it is a responsibility for \nall of us in this country to pay taxes. I think when we see what has \nbeen going on with tax avoidance on a massive scale--and I see those \nwho might criticize Senator Conrad for saying: Let's capture some of \nthis in this budget, and they say: Well, that is not real--you bet your \nlife it is real.\n  You bet your life it is real. This tax avoidance is large, and it is \ngrowing. We have a responsibility to say to those interests: Pay up. Be \na part of this country. Being a part of this country is to make money \nin this great economy of ours, but also the responsibility to pay some \ntaxes to this country as well.\n  As I indicated, I have three provisions that will be provided for as \na result of the way this budget is structured. I intend to offer those \nas legislation in this coming year. I expect that ought to be a \nnoncontroversial portion of the debate in this country. It ought to be \nthe first baby step to do what is right.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 489\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there is 2 minutes \nof debate prior to a vote on amendment No. 489.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, it is seldom in this Chamber that we have \na chance to do something that is truly significant. This amendment \nabout Social Security would allow us to do that. Both sides of the \naisle, Republican and Democrat, for years have been saying we should \nnot be spending Social Security on other things, and we should be \nsaving it. But we have never done anything about it.\n  We have spent nearly $2 trillion in Social Security money on other \nthings and have not saved one penny. My amendment allows for Congress \nto open the door and pave the way to stop spending Social Security \nfunds and to save the money. Senator Conrad and others have talked \nabout the importance of prefunding, or advance funding, our Social \nSecurity system. This amendment will open the door for us to do that. \nIt does not prescribe how we will do it. It does not talk about how the \nfunds will be invested. It says they will be taken off the table and \nsaved.\n  We are not talking about ownership here, private accounts or the \nstock market. This is all open for future discussion. The point of the \namendment is to open the door and do what we have talked about for \nyears: stop spending Social Security on other things and save it for \nthe retirees.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I oppose Social Security privatization--\nunequivocally and without question. The language in the DeMint \namendment, which would encourage the Finance Committee to report \nlegislation that would embrace private investment accounts within \nSocial Security, is something that I cannot support. Therefore, I \noppose the DeMint amendment.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I oppose this amendment. There is no \nquestion that we must reform our entitlement programs and change the \nway our Nation's finances are managed.\n  With this in mind, I support the premise behind this amendment: the \nSocial Security trust fund should not be used to help reduce the \nFederal budget deficit.\n  Hundreds of billions of dollars are being taken from Social Security \neach year just to help pay our bills. Last year, this figure approached \n$200 billion.\n  However, this amendment has a fatal flaw. It leaves the door open for \nprivate Social Security accounts by providing participants with the \noption of ``pre-funding of at least some portion of future benefits.''\n  In my view, this is unacceptable.\n  This body has already closed the door on the President's ill-\nconceived plan for private Social Security accounts.\n  The opposition to privatization is well-known:\n  Privatizing Social Security does nothing to extend the solvency of \nthe program. Transition costs alone, over the first 20 years, would put \nour Nation in greater debt by as much as $4.9 trillion.\n  Creating private accounts would mean benefit cuts for retirees, by as \nmuch as 40 percent.\n  Half of all American workers today have no pension or retirement plan \nfrom their employers. That means Social Security is their only source \nof income.\n  It is critical that we protect this safety net.\n  We must hold the line on spending, but this has to be done in \nconjunction with a more responsible approach to tax policy.\n  The President's tax cuts have already cost more than $1 trillion and \nthose enacted will be more than $3 trillion over the next decade.\n  When you combine the cost of the tax cuts with spending for the \nmilitary operations in Afghanistan, Iraq, and the global war on \nterror--currently totaling $510 billion--the inevitable result is that \nour Federal budget is squeezed, while our crushing debt grows.\n  As we debate this budget resolution, I urge my colleagues to be \nmindful of the long-term impact of our spending decisions.\n  The looming crisis with our entitlement programs is clear. We must \nstop raiding the Social Security trust fund to pay our bills. But I \ncannot support this particular amendment which opens the door to \nprivatizing Social Security.\n  I am firmly committed to opposing any Social Security reform \nproposals which leave the possibility of private accounts on the table. \nAnd this amendment would do just that. So I must voice my opposition, \nand I ask that my colleagues join me in rejecting this proposal.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the amendment sounds good. It is nice, \nbland language to provide participants with the benefits of savings and \ninvestment. But make no mistake about it, this is a stalking-horse for \nSocial Security. That is what this is all about.\n  The Senator offered virtually the same amendment last year, which had \nthe same purpose, and it was defeated 46 to 53, I think. This is \nprivatization of Social Security. The American people rejected that; \nthey rejected private accounts. It would cause a huge increase in the \nFederal deficit, a massive transfer. This amendment is disguised but \nwould do just that.\n  It looks good on the surface, but this is an amendment to privatize \nSocial Security, create private accounts for Social Security. Senators \nshould not be fooled. Again, Senators rejected this\n\n[[Page S3561]]\n\nvery same amendment last year by a large vote of 46 to 53. It should be \nrejected this time as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, there is now 2 \nminutes of debate prior to a vote on the Allard amendment No. 491.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I yield the time to the Senator from \nColorado.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, the budget spends $88 billion over 5 years \non ineffective programs and raises taxes by $900 billion to do so. My \namendment reduces spending by 25 percent on programs rated ineffective \nby OMB's program assessment rating tool. PART has evaluated almost \n1,000 programs accounting for 96 percent of all Federal spending. Only \n26 are rated ineffective in discretionary spending.\n  Chairman Conrad will say the budget resolution cannot tell \nappropriators how to implement the savings. My amendment simply allows \nthe appropriators, with a great deal of flexibility, to find those \nsavings that are proven to exist. It also tells agencies we expect \nresults from programs we fund.\n  If my colleagues vote for this amendment, we will save the taxpayers \n$18 billion over 5 years and pay down the Federal debt by $18 billion. \nI believe if we cannot trim $4 billion out of a $2.9 trillion budget on \nineffective programs, we cannot honestly tell taxpayers we are serious \nabout fiscal responsibility.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment. I ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, first, the budget resolution does not make \nthese individual policy determinations. The effect of this amendment \nwill simply be to cut domestic discretionary spending $18 billion. \nUnderstand the programs that have been identified in the PART program \nare results not proven. If this did apply as the Senator suggests, here \nare programs affected: Border Patrol, Coast Guard search and rescue, \nhigh-intensity drug trafficking areas, LIHEAP, rural education, child \nabuse prevention, and treatment.\n  If there is a problem in those programs, they ought to be fixed. We \nought not to be cutting Border Patrol, Coast Guard search and rescue, \nhigh-intensity drug trafficking areas, LIHEAP, rural education, and the \nrest.\n  I urge a ``no'' vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n491 offered by the Senator from Colorado, Mr. Allard.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this be a 10-\nminute vote, and the following votes be 10-minute votes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That order has been granted.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

In addition, I don't \nthink it is sensible to eliminate only 25 percent of the ineffective \nprograms. In my judgment, Congress should make the assessment as to \nwhich programs are effective or ineffective and then Congress should \nact to eliminate all of the ineffective programs.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 504, as Modified\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there are now 2 \nminutes of debate prior to a vote in relation to the Baucus amendment, \nNo. 504. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, this request has been cleared with the two \nmanagers and the ranking members of the Finance Committee. I ask \nunanimous consent to modify my amendment No. 504 with the text I send \nto the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 48, line 19, before ``The'' insert the following:\n       (a) Priority.--The Senate establishes the following \n     priorities and makes the following findings:\n\n[[Page S3562]]\n\n       (1) The Senate shall make the enactment of legislation to \n     reauthorize the State Children's Health Insurance Program \n     (SCHIP) a top priority for the remainder of fiscal year 2007, \n     during the first session of the 110th Congress.\n       (2) Extending health care coverage to the Nation's \n     vulnerable uninsured children is an urgent priority for the \n     Senate.\n       (3) SCHIP has proven itself a successful program for \n     covering previously uninsured children.\n       (4) More than 6 million children are enrolled in this \n     landmark program, which has enjoyed broad bipartisan support \n     in Congress, among our Nation's governors, and within state \n     and local governments.\n       (5) SCHIP reduces the percentage of children with unmet \n     health care needs.\n       (6) Since SCHIP was created, enormous progress has been \n     made in reducing disparities in children's coverage rates.\n       (7) Uninsured children who gain coverage through SCHIP \n     receive more preventive care and their parents report better \n     access to providers and improved communications with their \n     children's doctors.\n       (8) Congress has a responsibility to reauthorize SCHIP \n     before the expiration of its current authorization.\n       (b) Reserve Fund.--\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, this amendment basically confirms our \ncommitment to reauthorize the Children's Health Insurance Program by \nSeptember 30. We have to get this authorized quickly. It is the \nstatement of the Senate that we will do so; otherwise, we lose a large \nnumber of dollars. We lose about $25 billion from the budget baseline \nif we do not get this done. It will wreak financial havoc on States if \nwe do not get this done.\n  The program has reduced the rate of uninsured children by one-fifth. \nIt is a great opportunity, frankly, for everyone in this body to say \n``yes'' to kids. Yes, we are going to make sure our kids are covered \nwith insurance. We are going to expand the Children's Health Insurance \nProgram. I urge all Senators to vote yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, we support the amendment on our side. We \nwill be happy to do it by a voice vote if the Senator wants to, but I \nsuspect we are going to have a rollcall vote?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, we can voice vote this as far as I am \nconcerned. There was a request on my side. I don't know if there is \nanymore. I don't see anybody waving his hand or her hand, so it is fine \nwith me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment \nas modified.\n  The amendment (No. 504), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the Senate just voted on an amendment \nthat makes a good first step to putting kids first in SCHIP. However, \nit is all well and good to say we are putting kids first. But the \namendment we just voted on is not worth the paper it is printed on if \nthe Senate does not take the next step and back up these words with \npolicy.\n  The Cornyn amendment represents actual kids-first policy. I ask \nSenators to support the needed next step to putting kids first. Support \nthe Cornyn amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 511\n\n  Mr. GREGG. I understand the next amendment will be that of Senator \nCornyn, dealing with the SCHIP issue. Is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct, amendment No. 511. The \nSenator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, my amendment establishes a deficit-neutral \nreserve fund and the finance committee to report a bill that \nreauthorizes SCHIP, a program that covers kids first. It emphasizes \nhelping low-income kids, increases State flexibility, and eliminates \nwaste, fraud, and abuse. This vote is the Senate's opportunity to make \nsure the original intent of the SCHIP program remains intact. This is \nabout helping low-income kids first.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I seek recognition to outline my \nopposition to the Cornyn amendment, Senate amendment No. 511 to the \nfiscal year 2008 budget resolution. While I support reducing the cost \nof health care, I have concerns with reducing health care insurance \ncoverage for children in low-income families.\n  The Cornyn amendment sought to ensure that only children in families \nunder 200 percent of Federal poverty level--$27,380 for a single parent \nor $41,300 for a family of four--should receive State Children's Health \nInsurance Program, SCHIP, health coverage. This would have decreased \nthe recent SCHIP change to Pennsylvania's Cover All Children program. \nThe Pennsylvania Cover All Children program, which was approved by the \nCenters for Medicare and Medicaid Services, allows SCHIP funds to be \nused to provide insurance to children in families below 300 percent of \nthe Federal poverty level--$41,070 for a single parent or $61,950 for a \nfamily of four.\n  The authorization for SCHIP is scheduled to expire this year. I look \nforward to working with my colleagues to reauthorize and improve this \nimportant program.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I wish to speak in support of the \nSCHIP amendment offered by my colleagues, Senators Baucus and \nRockefeller, and to respectfully oppose the amendment of my colleague \nSenator Cornyn. I also want to praise my senior Senator, Jack Reed, and \nthank him for his tireless commitment to providing vital health care \ncoverage to the children of Rhode Island for so many years.\n  Our State of Rhode Island has one of the lowest rates of uninsured \nadults and children in the Nation. This fact is both encouraging and \ntroubling. It is encouraging because insured children are more likely \nto receive medical care for common conditions like asthma and ear \ninfections. It is encouraging because insured children have higher \nschool attendance rates and higher academic achievement. It is \nencouraging because insured individuals are more likely to receive \npreventive care like mammograms and other cancer screenings.\n  But Rhode Island's uninsured rates trouble me because, even as one of \nthe most well-insured States in the Nation, my State is still home to \nnearly 120,000 uninsured Americans. And 20,000 of those are children. \nEven as a leader in insuring children and adults in this Nation, we are \nstill far from where we need to be, and we are going in the wrong \ndirection. Rhode Island witnessed a 4.2-percent increase in the number \nof uninsured from 2000 to 2004, coupled with a 7.3-percent drop in \nthose covered by employer-sponsored plans.\n  Senator Cornyn's amendment proposes to limit the SCHIP program to \nchildren under 200 percent of the Federal poverty line. In Rhode \nIsland, that would have meant that almost 2,700 children would not have \nbeen able to access health insurance using SCHIP funds during fiscal \nyear 2006. And this number does not even include children under the age \nof 8 because Rhode Island has covered those children through its \nMedicaid Program up to 250 percent of poverty.\n  For my colleagues from larger States, 2,700 might not sound like that \nmany children. But the Cornyn amendment would potentially result in a \n7.5-percent increase in the uninsured rate for children in our State. \nThis is unacceptable. And it is particularly unacceptable in light of \nthe fact that 10.1 percent of Rhode Island children under 250 percent \nof poverty are eligible but not enrolled in Medicaid or SCHIP.\n  I also oppose the Cornyn amendment because I do not believe that we \nshould use SCHIP reauthorization as a vehicle to limit coverage of \nparents. First, covering parents is one of the most effective ways to \ncover children. When States cover parents, children participate in the \nMedicaid Program at higher rates, they have more contact with medical \nprofessionals, and receive more preventive care. Second, kicking \nparents off SCHIP only increases the number of uninsured individuals in \nour States, and forces those individuals to seek coverage in more \nexpensive settings like hospital emergency rooms. Lastly, the Bush \nadministration has repeatedly approved waivers to expand insurance to \nparents of children covered under State Medicaid and SCHIP programs. \nCovering parents is a value shared on both sides of the aisle.\n  As we move forward with this budget, and move forward with the \nongoing health care debate, we should not be looking for ways to limit \nthe coverage that States can offer their residents,\n\n[[Page S3563]]\n\nbut ways to expand coverage to new and wider populations. For savings, \nwe should be looking at reforms that improve quality and reduce cost, \nnot throwing kids off health care programs. SCHIP was created in an \neffort to provide health insurance coverage to vulnerable children. In \nthe spirit of this program, reauthorization should provide us with an \nopportunity to expand the tools States can use to cover the uninsured, \nnot as an opportunity to hurt those Americans who need help the most.\n  I want to make a particular point to thank Chairman Conrad and his \nstaff for their superb work throughout this budget process, and for the \nchairman's continued support of children's health insurance programs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, we voted to affirm our commitment to the \nprogram. The amendment offered by the Senator from Texas undermines the \ncurrent program. Many Senators want to expand the Children's Health \nInsurance Program. This undermines it. It reduces the current program \nand wreaks havoc with the States. They will lose their flexibility that \nthey currently have in administering the program. It puts a huge \nfinancial burden also on States that otherwise want to provide \nresources for the kids in their States.\n  I urge strongly we do not adopt the Cornyn amendment because it \nundermines the current program. It is a step backward, not forward.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, as the Budget chairman has said \nrepeatedly, this does not direct the Finance Committee how to do this \nor to consider specific proposals. But I do believe the reforms the \nPresident has put on the table would be a good place to start looking. \nWe know a fiscal tsunami is coming. We all talk about the wall of debt, \nbut now is the time to act by passing this amendment. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, amendment 525 will be the \npending question.\n  The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, this amendment should be opposed very \nsimply because the savings, the $34 billion the Senator from Texas \nprescribes, could not be used as offsets to help accommodate other \nprograms. Let's take SCHIP, for example. Because the way the Senator's \namendment is written, as reconciliation instructions, the $34 billion \ncould not be offset. That would be straight deficit reduction.\n  We are going to need, frankly, some wiggle room in Medicare programs \nto find revenue to pay for CHIP and for other Medicare adjustments. It \nmakes no sense to straight cut $34 billion out of Medicare alone, in \nitself a deep cut, without some way of shoring up some of the needs we \nare going to have, especially SCHIP.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Sanders \namendment be considered from now until 1:30; that then Senator Enzi be \nrecognized for an amendment until 2 o'clock; that Senator Carper be \nrecognized at 2 o'clock; that at 2:15, Senator Coleman be recognized--\n--\n  Mr. GREGG. For an amendment.\n  Mr. CONRAD. For an amendment; that at 2:45, Senator Lincoln be \nrecognized for an amendment; and that at 3:15, Senator Kyl be \nrecognized for an hour equally divided on his amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Further, as part of that unanimous consent, I ask \nunanimous consent that the Kyl amendment be voted on before 11 o'clock \ntomorrow, at a time to be determined by the two leaders; that there be, \nbefore the Kyl amendment, 6 minutes evenly divided; that there be a \nside-by-side amendment reserved on the Democratic side with the Kyl \namendment, and that the same rule pertain that there be 6 minutes \nequally divided.\n  Mr. GREGG. Further, if the Senator will yield?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am happy to yield to my colleague.\n  Mr. GREGG. That there be side-by-sides reserved for all amendments \nthat are offered in this group, and that the initial amendment be the \nfirst amendment voted on.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Let me just understand that final point.\n  Mr. GREGG. So the offered amendment would be the first amendment \nvoted on in the side-by-sides.\n  Mr. CONRAD. That the Sanders amendment would be the first amendment; \nis that what the Senator is saying?\n  Mr. GREGG. No. If there is a side-by-side, it would be the \nunderstanding that the initial amendment, the underlying amendment, \nwould be the first one voted on.\n  Mr. CONRAD. No, that would not be typically the order.\n  Mr. GREGG. It would be an amendment like a second degree.\n  Mr. CONRAD. The second degree would be voted on first. So our \namendment would be, in effect, the second degree, and so in the regular \norder it would be voted on first.\n  Mr. GREGG. OK. But side-by-sides reserved for all the amendments.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Yes, side-by-sides reserved for all the amendments. And \nvotes would be on or in relationship to the subjects that we have \nidentified here.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 502\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I would like to now take up Grassley \namendment No. 502 in regard to the Smithsonian. We have agreement from \nSenator Grassley and others to take that amendment on a voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, the amendment is the pending question.\n  Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 502) was agreed to.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, if the Presiding Officer could read back to me the \nfinal timing for the unanimous consent agreement we have just entered \ninto--the GOP amendment, which is the Kyl amendment, would be offered \nat 3:15 this afternoon, and that would be an hour equally divided, and \nthat would leave us at 4:15?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask my colleague if we could then agree \nfor 10 minutes equally divided on the Bayh amendment.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, we have not seen the Bayh amendment.\n  Mr. CONRAD. We will get a copy, and perhaps we can work that out.\n  Mr. President, I yield to Senator Sanders.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this amendment is being cosponsored by \nSenator Mikulski of Maryland. This amendment is about keeping the \npromises the Federal Government made to the people of our country 32 \nyears ago. It is about keeping our word to the children of this \ncountry, especially those with disabilities. It is about keeping our \nword to the property tax payers of this country, whose property taxes \nin Vermont and throughout this country are going up and up and up.\n  When Congress passed the Individuals with Disabilities Act in 1975, \nunder the leadership of Senator Tom Harkin, that legislation said the \nGovernment would provide up to 40 percent--40 percent--of the national \naverage per-pupil expenditure for special education. Unfortunately, \nhowever, the Federal Government has not kept its word. Today, its \ncontribution stands at barely 17 percent. The promise was 40 percent; \nthe reality is 17 percent.\n  In other words, the Federal Government passed legislation doing the \nright thing with regard to our children in 1975, but it has not \nfollowed through in terms of the kind of funding it promised, and \nschool districts all over this country and children all over this \ncountry are suffering from that lack of action.\n  When Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle talk about \nunfunded mandates, the inadequate funding for special education is the \nposter child of that problem. We told school districts we would fund \nspecial education at 40 percent, and we are funding it at 17 percent. \nThat is wrong. That speaks poorly of Congress.\n  In Vermont, and I suspect all over this country, school districts are \ndemanding we rectify that problem, that we keep the promise made so \nmany years ago.\n  When the Federal Government does not keep its word, school districts \nin my State, school districts in the Presiding Officer's State and \nthroughout this country are forced to do one of two things: either they \ndo not provide the quality of special education care the special needs \nkids require--and that is wrong--or else their limited budgets require \nthem to cut back on other educational programs in order to fund the \nexpensive needs of special eduction\n\n[[Page S3565]]\n\nkids. So what ends up happening is we take money from second languages, \nwe take money from athletics, we take money from arts, and we put it \ninto special education, and all of the children suffer as a result of \nthat.\n  The third option facing school districts--which certainly is taking \nplace in Vermont, and I expect all over this country--is that school \ndistricts are forced to ask for higher and higher property taxes. Those \nproperty taxes are becoming so high in areas of this country that \npeople who have lived in their homes for their entire lives are now \nbeing forced to leave their homes.\n  The property tax is a regressive form of taxation. It hits working \nfamilies very hard and unfairly. It hits senior citizens unfairly. More \nand more communities around this country are forced to raise property \ntaxes, which is putting an increased burden on middle-class families.\n  The amendment I am offering, which is cosponsored by Senator Mikulski \nof Maryland, is a simple and straightforward amendment. At a time when \nthe wealthiest people in this country are becoming wealthier, at a time \nwhen the wealthiest 1 percent have not had it so good since the 1920s, \nat a time when property taxes on the middle class are soaring all over \nthis country, at a time when school districts are being forced to spend \nmore and more on special education, this amendment increases funding \nfor special education by $44.2 billion over the next 5 years.\n  It finally begins to do what this Congress should have done years and \nyears ago. It adequately funds special education. It begins to move \naway from the unfunded mandate that so many communities around our \ncountry are suffering from.\n  This amendment raises the $44.2 billion by rescinding the 2001 income \ntax cuts that were given to millionaires. In other words, it would \nrestore the top income tax rate to 39.6 percent on taxable income \nexceeding $1 million per year.\n  This amendment would only apply to millionaires. Those are the only \npeople who would be asked to pay more because we would be rescinding \nthe 2001 income tax reductions that President Bush and the Congress \ngave to them.\n  While we ask the wealthiest people in this country to pay a little \nbit more, what we would be doing is lowering property taxes for the \nmiddle class all over this country and improving the quality of \neducation that our children receive.\n  By using this revenue for special education, as this amendment does, \nthe Federal Government could begin to live up to its 40 percent \ncommitment in fiscal year 2009. Not only would we be providing a much \nneeded boost for children with disabilities, we would also be providing \nproperty tax relief to so many families throughout this country who are \nin desperate need of that relief.\n  The bottom line of this amendment is pretty simple. It has a lot to \ndo about which side we consider ourselves to be on. We hear a lot of \nrhetoric in the Congress about the importance of education. The \nPresiding Officer understands the importance of education. I understand \nthe importance of education. I suspect every Member of the Senate \nunderstands the need to improve the quality of education in this \ncountry. This is an amendment about improving education for all of our \nchildren.\n  We hear a lot of discussion in the Senate and the Congress about the \ngrowth of special education needs among our kids--whether it is autism, \nADD, or other disorders. This is an amendment which addresses in a very \nserious way the needs of special education.\n\n  We hear a lot about unfunded mandates and the burden of higher and \nhigher property taxes on working families all over this country. This \namendment, if passed, takes a giant step forward in rectifying this \nunfunded mandate and lowering property taxes. Mostly, though, this \namendment is about Congress keeping its word, keeping the promise it \nmade so many years ago. We made a promise to school districts all over \nthis country that if they mainstreamed kids into public schools, \nCongress would provide 40 percent of the cost. We have not kept that \npromise. We have given hundreds of billions of dollars in tax breaks to \nmillionaires and billionaires, but we have not reached out to school \ndistricts to help them with the cost of special education, the result \nbeing higher and higher property taxes. The time is long overdue for \nthe Congress to keep the promises it made with regard to special \neducation, and this amendment does just that.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, what is the time situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire has 12 minutes. \nThe Senator from Vermont has 2 minutes.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, the amendment of the Senator from Vermont, \nthe Senator from across the river, as we say in New Hampshire, a \nSenator from the State where all our bad weather comes from, actually--\nthe sunshine comes from New Hampshire--this amendment raises taxes by \nsomething like $44 billion. The purpose of it is to spend that money on \nspecial education.\n  Special education is an important program. In fact, it is so \nimportant that if you look at the priorities this administration has \nput in place in the education accounts since it came into office, it \nhas increased special education funding by I think a factor that is \nthree times greater--I believe that is the number--than the Clinton \nadministration increased special education funding. This \nadministration, in the first year in office, jumped special education \nby $1 billion. The next year, it jumped special education funding by \nanother $1 billion, and so on and so on. The increase in special \neducation funding under this administration has been the largest \nincrease of any administration, both percentage-wise and in dollars, \nover its term.\n  But to raise taxes $44 billion is a pretty big tax increase. You can \nthrow out the word ``millionaire.'' What we are talking about here are \nsmall businesspeople. Eighty-three percent of the people who would be \nhit by the top rate are small businesspeople. It is all rates.\n  He is talking about repealing the President's tax cuts that have \ngenerated so much economic activity around this country and have \ncreated a revenue stream into this Government which exceeds the \nhistorical norm. In other words, even though it is counterintuitive to \nsome folks, and especially to some of our editorial boards, such as The \nNew York Times, we have actually seen an increase, a very significant \nincrease in revenues by reducing the tax rates in this country so they \nare fair, so that people are willing to go out and take risks with \ntheir dollars, be entrepreneurial and, as a result, create jobs and \neconomic activity, which is translated into income for the Federal \nGovernment.\n  In fact, in the last 3 years, we have received more income, larger \nincreases in income in Federal revenue than at any time in our history, \nhuge jumps in income, and we are now receiving more income as a Federal \nGovernment than is the historic norm--18.5 percent of gross national \nproduct in income to the Federal Government. The norm is usually 18.2 \npercent.\n  In addition, these tax rates which were put in place which are \nrepealed under this proposal have created a more aggressive tax system. \nDuring the Clinton years, the top 20 percent of wage-earners--of income \ntax payers in this country paid about 81 percent of the Federal taxes. \nToday, that same top 20 percent--they are not the same people, because \nthe genius of our society is that people go in and out of that group \ndepending on how capable they are. Some people make money and get in; \nsome people lose money and go out. But that same group, that top 20 \npercent, is paying almost 85 percent of the total income tax burden. So \nit is more progressive at the top end than it was during the Clinton \nyears.\n  Even though the tax rates may be lower, the generation of income \ntax--people who are paying it--is more progressive, and at the lower \nend, the bottom 40 percent of the people who pay income taxes or who \nare subject to income tax in this country--they don't actually pay the \nmoney; they get money back from the earned-income tax credit--that \ngroup of individuals, the 40 percent there, is getting twice as much \nback under the earned-income tax credit as they did in the Clinton \nyears. So at the top, you have people paying more. At the bottom, you \nhave people getting more back. That is\n\n[[Page S3566]]\n\ncalled progressivity. So we are getting more revenue. We are getting \nhistoric highs in revenue. We are beyond the traditional amount we get \nin revenue, and we have a more progressive tax system.\n  What is the Senator from Vermont suggesting? Increase taxes by $44 \nbillion.\n  Well, I have referred to this budget from the other side of the aisle \nas tax-and-spend. Very simply, it is a tax-and-spend budget. It adds \nnew spending. It adds $900 billion in new taxes. It increases the debt \nby $2.2 trillion. It does nothing to control spending, either on the \ndiscretionary side or on the mandatory side.\n  If you pass this amendment, I suppose you just supersized it in the \ntax size. You can go into McDonald's and you can get a regular Coke. \nThis is sort of a ``regular'' Democratic tax-and-spend bill. There are \na lot of new taxes--$900 billion--but that is sort of out of the \nmainstream of the party. But the Senator from Vermont has decided we \nare going to ``supersize'' this tax increase to $44 billion. So, \nobviously, we oppose the amendment.\n\n  This concept of expanding funding to IDEA is a good concept, but it \nshould come within the ordering of priorities. It shouldn't come by a \ndramatic tax increase. In fact, this President has shown he is going to \nreorder priorities to accomplish that during his term in office.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of our time at this point.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I always enjoy dialoguing with my \nneighbor from New Hampshire. Let me make just a few points. I think he \nunderstands, because if my son who lives in Claremont, NH, is accurate, \nwhat he is telling me is what Vermonters are telling me--that property \ntaxes in New Hampshire and in Vermont and all over this country are \nsoaring.\n  My friend from New Hampshire says the President and Congress are \naddressing special education needs, more money is going into it. But \nthe reality is that for the last 3 years, the percentage of Federal \ncontributions for special education has gone down. They were at a high \nof 18 percent. They are moving downward. They are now at 17 percent.\n  My friend can talk about raising taxes, and let me concede that he is \nright. We are raising taxes on the upper three-tenths of 1 percent \nbecause 99.7 percent of the American people would not see any increase \nin Federal taxes as a result of this amendment. Tens of millions of \nAmerican families would see a reduction in their property taxes.\n  I believe that at a time when the wealthiest 1 percent have never had \nit so good, when we are seeing that, according to Forbes magazine, the \ncollective net worth of the wealthiest 400 Americans--400--increased by \n$120 billion last year to $1.25 trillion, it is time for this Congress \nto start worrying about middle-class families that can't afford higher \nand higher property taxes, about kids with disabilities who deserve \nquality education, about all of our children who deserve an education, \nand not worry about the upper three-tenths of 1 percent.\n  If my friend from New Hampshire says I am raising taxes on the upper \nthree-tenths of 1 percent, people who are millionaires and \nbillionaires, I concede that point. I am. That is the right thing to \ndo.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, at this point, I believe Senator Enzi is \nready to go with his amendment. Rather than tie him up and since he was \nalso the chairman of the HELP Committee, he may have some thoughts on \nthis issue of how we are doing on special education. But in any event, \nso he can get started, I yield the remaining time so Senator Enzi can \ngo forward.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, before the Senator departs, I wish to \nagain thank him for his unfailing courtesy as we work through this \nbudget resolution. I appreciate very much all of the constructive help \nhe has provided as we have tried to get this done. I thank him very \nmuch.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 497\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I call up Senate amendment No. 497.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wyoming [Mr. Enzi] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 497.\n\n  Mr. ENZI. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To establish a 60 vote point of order for legislation that \n         creates unfunded mandates on small business concerns)\n\n       At the end of title II, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 2__. RESTRICTIONS ON PRIVATE SECTOR MANDATES.\n\n       (a) Point of Order.--It shall not be in order in the Senate \n     to consider any bill, joint resolution, motion, amendment, or \n     conference report that would increase the direct costs of \n     private sector mandates on small business concerns (as that \n     term is defined in section 3 of the Small Business Act (15 \n     U.S.C. 632)) by an amount that exceeds the threshold provided \n     in section 424(b)(1) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 \n     (2 U.S.C. 658c(b)(1)).\n       (b) Waiver and Appeal.--Subsection (a) may be waived or \n     suspended in the Senate only by an affirmative vote of three-\n     fifths of the Members, duly chosen and sworn. An affirmative \n     vote of three-fifths of the Members of the Senate, duly \n     chosen and sworn, shall be required to sustain an appeal of \n     the ruling of the Chair on a point of order raised under \n     subsection (a).\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, my amendment is very simple. It establishes \na 60-vote threshold for legislation that imposes unfunded mandates on \nsmall businesses as determined by the Small Business Administration, \nwhen it is in excess of $131 million, which is established in the \nUnfunded Mandates Reform Act. As my colleagues may know, small \nbusinesses make up 99\\7/10\\ percent of all U.S. employers and employs \n50 percent of the Nation's nonfarm private sector workers. That is \naccording to the Small Business Administration. Congress has an \nobligation to make sure laws written in Washington don't unfairly \nburden Main Street.\n  The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act already requires the CBO to estimate \nwhether Congress imposes mandates on the private sector. Right now \nthere is a 60-vote point of order against legislation if the Federal \nmandates estimate has not been printed in the committee report or the \nCongressional Record. The fiscal year 2006 budget resolution conference \nagreement included a 60-vote point of order for imposing unfunded \nmandates on State and local governments. That is State and local \ngovernments, but it doesn't say anything about the engine of the \neconomy: small businesses.\n  My colleagues will notice that I have left out big business. Big \nbusiness can usually take care of itself, but small business doesn't \nhave the people or the clout to be able to come here and point out to \nus the gross burdens we are putting on them. So I think the Senate \nshould have a new 60-vote point of order that applies to legislation \nthat creates unfunded, private sector mandates. It is time for Congress \nto remember that our actions here in Washington have very real monetary \nconsequences on the small business owners in Buffalo, WY, or Conway, \nNH, or Main Street, Anywhere.\n  I came to Washington from Wyoming as a firm believer in what I call \nthe 80/20 rule. I have found you can reach agreement on 80 percent of \nall the issues. I also know we are probably never going to reach \nagreement on the other 20 percent. But any unfunded mandates Congress \nimposes on the private sector should fall into--no, not the 80-percent \ncategory; I am just asking for a 60-percent category and receive strong \nsupport on both sides of the aisle that way.\n  This 80/20 rule was the guiding principle for my chairmanship of the \nHELP Committee during the 109th Congress. Senator Kennedy and I abided \nby that. We avoided the highly partisan issues. We worked on the \nnonpartisan or the bipartisan issues. It turned out to be, instead of \nthe most contentious committee, one of the more agreeable committees. \nWe accomplished a tremendous amount of work. In fact, President Bush \nsigned 27 committee bills into law. Most of those went through by \nunanimous consent. That is far above the 60-vote threshold I am asking \nfor with this amendment.\n  We in Washington have to stop thinking our good ideas can be paid for \nby the wave of a wand. To that end, the Senate needs a procedural tool \nto remind ourselves that the policies we pass in Washington often \ntranslate to\n\n[[Page S3567]]\n\nthe direct cost increases on the businesses on Main Street.\n  This is a commonsense proposal. I urge my colleagues to support the \namendment. I am sure there are small business supporters on both sides \nof the aisle who can see the benefit. I will mention that, right now, \nthere is a 60-vote point of order in the Senate on everything. It is a \nfilibuster. With a filibuster, 60 people have to agree before you can \nmove on. That is often a 5-day waste of time. It would be much more \nconvenient if we could get a vote and see that there are 60 people in \nsupport and know that even a filibuster isn't going to work against it. \nThat would allow things to move forward faster.\n  I am not trying to slow the process. I am trying to provide a \nmechanism that protects small business and allows us to get on with the \nbusiness of the Senate. It seems to me to be a win-win situation for \nus. We do protect cities, towns, counties, States, all of their small \ngovernments and even some big governments, but we don't protect the \nsmall businessman. The small businessman is what keeps this economy \nmoving, keeps us going. I am sure there isn't any issue that falls into \nthat 80 percent that we all can agree on, that we cannot get 60 percent \napproval to move forward on. It will encourage more bipartisanship, and \nI think in the last election that was the main message delivered to all \nof us. It wasn't the base of either party that provided the impetus for \nany changes.\n  It was the independents and the folks who said: Come on, guys, get \nalong and get something done in Washington. That is what we are trying \nto do with this particular measure--move things along at a faster rate \nand to assure that small businesses can thrive in this country and that \nwe get agreement from 60 percent of the people in this body to move \nforward. This will provide needed protection to small businesses.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter from the NFIB be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                   March 21, 2007.\n     Hon. Michael Enzi,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Enzi: On behalf of the National Federation of \n     Independent Business (NFIB), the nation's leading small-\n     business advocacy group, I strongly support your amendment to \n     the FY 2008 Budget Resolution that would raise the private \n     sector unfunded mandate point of order from a 50 to a 60 vote \n     threshold.\n       Congress needs a 60 vote threshold to force itself to think \n     twice before adding additional unfunded mandates for several \n     reasons. One, the regulatory burden that small businesses \n     face is already too high. According to recent studies \n     commissioned by the Small Business Administration the \n     regulatory burden in 2004 was estimated to be $7,647 per \n     employee in small businesses with fewer than 20 employees. \n     And small firms spend 45 percent more than their larger \n     counterparts to comply with federal regulations.\n       Second, this Congress has either considered or likely will \n     consider mandates that will add to this burden. Among the \n     proposals under consideration include legislation to increase \n     the minimum wage, require small employers to provide paid \n     sick leave, offer family and medical leave, and provide wage \n     insurance.\n       The critical role that small business plays in our economy \n     is another reason Congress should think before imposing new \n     unfunded mandates. Small business produces roughly half of \n     the private Gross Domestic Product and between 60 and 80 \n     percent of net new jobs. Legislators should be working to \n     strengthen small business's ability to create new jobs and \n     grow their businesses, not working to impede their progress.\n       Thank you for introducing this important amendment and your \n     continued support of small business.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                   Dan Danner,\n\n                                         Executive Vice President,\n                                      Public Policy and Political.\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will support this \namendment. I will be happy to address any concerns. We have looked at a \nnumber of issues, historically, to see what the effect would be. We \nthink the effect would be good legislation for small business and for \nthe economy of this country.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Salazar). Who yields time?\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask \nthat the time be equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nMaryland, Senator Cardin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Conrad for yielding me \nthis time. I take this time to rise in support of the budget resolution \nand the work of Senator Conrad and the Budget Committee. It has been \nsaid frequently it is the most difficult job here to try to put \ntogether a budget, when you are trying to deal with all the different \npriorities. Senator Conrad has done an excellent job in moving the \nagenda of this Nation.\n  This budget resolution changes the fiscal priorities of America. \nFirst, it provides for fiscal discipline. The pay-go rules are real. \nThere are difficult choices our committees will have to make. But we \nhave made it a priority to get our budget back into balance and say \nthat we have to make tough choices.\n  Secondly, there are important priority areas. I compliment the \ncommittee for making health care truly a priority, to change the \ndirection of America. It is a national disgrace that we have 46 million \npeople without health insurance in America. We need to do something \nabout it. We need universal health coverage in this country. This \nbudget moves us in that direction by making SCHIP a priority. It gives \nthe committee the ability to expand a very successful program. SCHIP \nworks. It provides health insurance for our children.\n  Over the last 10 years, we have seen improved health care outcomes as \na result of the SCHIP program. We know that if a person is covered by \nSCHIP, they are much more likely to receive primary care and dental \ncare. They are much less likely to use the emergency rooms and much \nmore likely to be immunized and have preventive health care and access \nto prescription drugs. Those enrolled in the SCHIP program are going to \nbe better off. This budget allows us to move that issue forward. We \noften talk about it.\n  There was a hearing before the Senate Finance Committee and a family \nfrom Maryland was there. I will quote from Mrs. Bedford. She has five \nchildren in the SCHIP program. What she said is:\n\n       Perhaps the greatest impact MCHIP, the Maryland Children's \n     Health Insurance Program, has had on our families medically \n     is that we no longer have to make impossible health choices \n     based on a financial prospective. We no longer have to decide \n     whether a child is ``really sick enough'' to warrant a \n     doctor's visit. We no longer have to decide whether a child \n     ``really needs'' a certain medication prescribed by his \n     pediatrician. The face of CHIP is families such as ours, \n     families who work hard and play by the rules, trying to live \n     the American dream.\n\n  This budget will allow more families to be able to be in the health \nprogram and to live the American dream. Another family in Maryland is \nthe Diver family, where Diamonte Diver died as a result of not getting \naccess to preventive dental care. The toothache became abscessed and \nspread into his brain. He had emergency surgery costing over a quarter \nof a million dollars. If he would have had access to preventive oral \ncare, dental care, for $80 he could have had a tooth extraction and \nthat would have saved money in our health care system.\n  By expanding the SCHIP program, more children will be covered by \ndental care. There are so many reasons why this budget will allow us to \nmove forward regarding our health care priorities. In the 109th \nCongress, we prevented 17 States from running out of money late in the \nsession. This budget versus the President's budget is a clear choice. \nThe President's budget moves in the wrong direction on health care and \nthe SCHIP program. This allows us to make it truly a national priority.\n  There are other parts of the budget in health care that I support, \nsuch as the long-term care reserve fund, so that we can develop a more \ncost-effective way to take care of long-term care needs, so families \ncan get assisted living help or home health care, and they\n\n[[Page S3568]]\n\ndon't have to spend as much money in nursing care. I could go through \nmany priorities, whether it is veterans health care, education, or \nwhether it is transportation. All these are important priorities that \nthis budget allows us to move forward on in a fiscally responsible way.\n  I know we have had budgets that try to pull back from the pay-go \nrequirements. I am glad we have stood up for the pay-go requirements. \nWe have to balance the budget, but we need to change the priorities of \nAmerica and move forward with health care and education, and we need to \nmove forward with veterans and transportation. This budget allows us to \ndo it.\n  I urge my colleagues to be cautious on all these amendments that are \nbeing offered. They may sound well intended, but they could jeopardize \nthe thrust of the budget. I urge my colleagues to support the \nunderlying resolution.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank Senator Cardin, the Senator from \nMaryland, an extremely valuable member of the Budget Committee. He came \nto this Chamber after an extremely well-respected career in the House \nof Representatives, where he served in the most powerful committee in \nthe House of Representatives, the Ways and Means Committee. Senator \nCardin is known as a Congressman's Congressman. He is somebody who does \nhis homework. We have already seen that on the Budget Committee. He is \nalready an extraordinarily valuable member there. I rely on him \nheavily. I cannot tell you how pleased I am to have Senator Cardin on \nthe Budget Committee. He has a wealth of knowledge, which has been put \nto good use as we have crafted this budget resolution. So I commend him \nand thank him publicly for the contribution he has made. This is the \nkind of serious-minded person this Senate needs and the Congress of the \nUnited States needs. We are delighted he is on the Budget Committee.\n  I would like to speak for a minute on the Enzi amendment. Senator \nEnzi, on the other side of the aisle, is somebody I not only like but I \nrespect. Senator Enzi was an accountant in his private life. He brings \nthose skills and that discipline to his job. He is well regarded on \nboth sides of the aisle because he is serious about the job. I wish to \nstart by saying I do like and admire the Senator from Wyoming, Mr. \nEnzi.\n  On his amendment, let me give my reactions. I think it is entirely \nwell intended. What I worry about are the unintended consequences with \nthis amendment. Let me say why. Currently, there is a 60-vote point of \norder against legislation that would impose unfunded mandates against \nState, local, and tribal governments above a certain threshold. That \nthreshold right now is $66 million in any 1 year. In addition to that \npoint of order, there is a 50-vote point of order against legislation \nthat would have an unfunded private sector mandate above a certain \nthreshold. That, currently, as I recall, is $131 million in a year. But \nthat is not a 60-vote point of order; it is not a supermajority. It is \na simple majority. The amendment that Senator Enzi has presented would \nmake the private sector unfunded mandate point of order a 60-vote one, \na supermajority.\n  I think the Senator would acknowledge that. He has altered it \nsomewhat from what he offered in committee. It applies to the extent \nthat the mandate affects small businesses. So this amendment could \nresult in a budget point of order against legislation that has no \nFederal, State, local or tribal budget impact; but it would have an \neffect if a mandate affects small businesses and it has an effect of \nover $131 million in any year.\n  So far, so good. The difficulty I see with the amendment is, first, \nonce again, the Budget Committee does not have the authority to make \nthis kind of policy determination. We don't. I would like to. Many \ntimes as the Budget Committee chairman, I wish we had this kind of \nauthority, but we simply don't.\n  If legislation such as this were adopted--and again, it can't be \nadopted in a budget resolution--but if it were adopted separately, my \nstaff informs me it could affect legislation in the following areas: It \ncould actually create a 60-vote point of order against the mental \nhealth parity legislation of Senator Domenici--legislation, by the way, \nof which Senator Enzi is a cosponsor. It could create a 60-vote point \nof order against the 2007 Defense authorization bill. It could create a \n60-vote point of order, a supermajority hurdle, against minimum wage \nlegislation, bankruptcy reform, pension reform, and a host of other \nbills.\n  That is the concern I have about this amendment in terms of a policy. \nWe have not had a hearing. It requires further exploration before we \nwould go forward with this particular amendment.\n  Again, the desire the Senator has to have unfunded mandates points of \norder on issues that would affect small business is entirely \nreasonable, but I am very concerned about the unintended consequences. \nI am very concerned about creating a 60-vote hurdle, a supermajority \nvote, that could affect issues such as the mental health parity \nlegislation of Senator Domenici, such as the 2007 Defense authorization \nbill, such as the minimum wage bill, such as the bankruptcy reform \nlegislation, such as pension reform.\n  I sense there is danger here, and I urge my colleagues to think about \nit carefully before they vote for the amendment.\n  I understand we are getting to the end of the time. Does Senator Enzi \nhave time remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator Enzi has 8\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Perhaps Senator Enzi wishes to use his time at this \npoint.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of the Senator \nfrom North Dakota. He and I do have a lot in common. My grandparents \nhomesteaded in North Dakota, and he and I both have a degree from the \nsame college. We share a respect for the process of the Senate. I \ncertainly respect him for the way he handles the budget and the \nfairness with which he has done so.\n  I hope he and others on the other side of the aisle will take another \nlook at this amendment and not feel any fear. I hate to have people \nvote on a sense that there might be something sinister. If one looks at \nmy record in the Senate, they will find I do not do things that are \nsinister, but I do things that protect small business.\n  As I have pointed out before, a point of order can be waived. If \nthere are 60 votes, that point of order falls, and the issue moves \nforward. The Senator mentioned mental health parity. Yes, I am a \ncosponsor of mental health parity legislation. I have helped to bring \npeople together, to find a third way of doing it, to get it into the \n80-percent category, and move it forward for the first time. I know \nSenator Domenici has been working on this issue for over 6 years, close \nto 10 years, to get it to the point where it is now. I certainly \nwouldn't do anything that would put that bill in jeopardy. It could be \nin jeopardy because there is already a 60-vote point of order against \nit we will have to waive in order to go forward.\n  On a lot of these small business issues, there would be a 60-vote \npoint of order already available on it. As I mentioned before, there is \nalready another 60-vote possibility because anybody in the Senate can \nfilibuster an issue which can cause it to fall into a category of \nneeding a cloture motion. When you file a cloture motion, if you were \nto file it today, we couldn't vote on it until Saturday, and we would \nbe debating the qualities of that amendment until Saturday. Saturday, \nwhen we had the 60 votes to pass it, then there would be another 30 \nhours of debate before the actual vote on that amendment, if everybody \nwanted to press the time. That would take up 5 days, maybe 6 days.\n  Waiving a point of order takes a few moments, and we can see if there \nis the strength to move the issue forward and discourage filibusters.\n  There is some real merit to having this point of order, both to show \nwe have a concern for small business and recognize they are the engine \nthat drives the economy of this country and that we do need to watch \nout for them, protect them, and keep from putting them out of business.\n  I hope my colleagues will take a careful look at this amendment and \nsee the merit in it instead of sensing that\n\n[[Page S3569]]\n\nthere could be implications. I do not have any ulterior motives, other \nthan my normal concern for small business and the feeling we need to \nwatch out for them. It doesn't hurt to have a searching for answers, \nsometimes a third way, to get done what we want to do to allow small \nbusiness to succeed and for us to do what we wish to do.\n  I hope my colleagues will take a look at this amendment and vote for \nit. I sense there are some who are going to vote for it anyway. I hope \nthey follow through and vote for it.\n  I yield the floor and yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, we are now awaiting the arrival of Senator \nCarper. I ask the staff to call the Senator's office because we are \nready to go to Senator Carper's amendment.\n  Mr. President, could you give us an update on the time situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. At the present time, there is 4 minutes \nremaining to the Senator from Wyoming and 3 minutes remaining to the \nSenator from North Dakota on the Enzi amendment.\n  Mr. CONRAD. We are prepared to yield back all time on both sides of \nthe Enzi amendment.\n  I see Senator Coleman is here. Will Senator Coleman be available to \ngo forward with his amendment? Senator Carper is not in the Chamber.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I am ready to go forward.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask the manager on the other side if \nthat is acceptable with him.\n  Mr. GREGG. Yes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Why don't we do that. We thank Senator Coleman very much. \nWe will go to Senator Carper after Senator Coleman has completed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 577\n\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be laid aside so that I may send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Coleman], for himself, Ms. \n     Snowe, Ms. Collins, and Mr. Roberts, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 577.\n\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, as we all know, budgets are about setting \npriorities for the Nation. As we continue to work on the resolution \ntoday, I offer an amendment to address a key priority for our Nation: \nproviding for our Nation's energy future.\n  We all know America's energy needs are growing rapidly. We need clean \nenergy, and high energy prices threaten our national security. This is \nnow a national security issue. A few years ago, when I was talking \nabout ethanol, I would get some patronizing pats on the back for taking \ncare of some Midwest corn growers. That has changed today.\n  Clearly, this is a national security issue. High energy prices \nthreaten our economic security. It is imperative then that Congress \nwork to promote energy technology that will offer clean energy \nsolutions and, if anything, Congress's budget should provide for new \nopportunities to address these issues.\n  Yet in addition to seeking new legislative opportunities, we must \naddress the oncoming expiration of current energy tax incentives that \npromote renewable energy and energy efficiency.\n  At the end of 2008, tax incentives for wind, biomass, geothermal, \nhydropower, solar, and other clean energy technologies will expire, as \nwell as tax provisions for energy-efficient residential and commercial \nbuildings.\n  In my home State of Minnesota, we take a lot of pride in our \nleadership on renewable energy issues from biomass to wind. It has been \nsaid southwest Minnesota is the Saudi Arabia of wind. Our State has \nmade a massive investment in renewables and it is paying off. Renewable \nenergy allows Minnesota to diversify and expand. It has reduced \nMinnesota's carbon footprint, and has also created jobs and put our \nState on the leading edge of renewable technology. At one point, I \nbelieve Minnesota had half the E85 pumps.\n  We have had success I would like to see continue in my State and \nreplicated across the Nation. The United States should be a leader of \nrenewable energy in this world. But much of the success would not have \nbeen possible without a little assistance. The production tax credit, \nfor example, has enabled the wind industry to explode over the last \nseveral years. I talked with so many folks involved in the wind energy \nbusiness, farmers who farm wind today, small-town mayors who are \ndepending on wind energy to help them. We are at the point now where \nthere is a waiting list for wind turbines. This is a great success \nstory that would not have been possible without the production tax \ncredit which is set to expire at the end of 2008.\n  Another renewable energy incentive that is new but has generated a \nlot of interest is the CREBs, clean renewable energy bonds. These are \nenabling local governments and rural electric co-ops to make a \ncontribution to the need for renewable energy. I know there is a case \nin Minnesota where several school districts actually combined to use \nthese bonds to put up a wind turbine project. There are great renewable \nsuccess stories waiting to happen, but this wind energy tool, set to \nexpire in 2008, will be short lived if not extended.\n  A lot of times, we focus on the production side of the energy issue, \nwhen, in reality, promoting energy efficiency can do more than anything \nto lower energy prices and protect the environment in the short term. \nIn fact, the American Council for Energy-Efficient Economy has found if \na massive energy efficiency effort were undertaken, we could reduce \nnatural gas use by 1 percent and cut prices by well over 30 percent--in \nfact, they said a 37-percent potential cut in prices. Energy efficiency \nis the quickest, cheapest, and cleanest way to bring down energy costs \nfor consumers. Meanwhile, as consumers save money, they also reduce \ngreenhouse gas emissions.\n  Although we should always look for additional policies that promote \nenergy efficiency, Congress has passed tax provisions for energy-\nefficient homes and commercial buildings that have made a real impact. \nOne such provision is a deduction for energy-efficient commercial \nbuildings that reduce annual energy and power consumption by 50 \npercent, while another tax provision provides a credit to eligible \ncontracts for construction of a qualified new energy-efficient home. \nUnfortunately, these, too, will expire in 2008.\n\n[[Page S3570]]\n\n  At a time when Congress should be sending clear signals to the \nmarketplace to move forward with renewable energy and energy \nefficiency, the very tax incentives targeted to these endeavors will \nexpire shortly. Meanwhile, how is business supposed to make long-term, \nresponsible decisions with such little certainty about the existence of \nthese provisions?\n  That is the point. If you talk to farmers, talk to groups of farmers \nwho are coming together, they can't get the investment, they can't pool \ninvestment, work with banks and others unless they know there is a \nlong-term tax incentive in place. That 1 percent per kilowatt is \nabsolutely critical, and it is set to expire in 2008.\n  The tremendous advantage we are making--and the Senator from North \nDakota understands well--is important to our part of the country. There \nis the possibility of cutting the legs out from under them, and we \nsimply should not let that happen.\n  From my State, there is a very clear example. My State of Minnesota \nhas adopted--and is setting the standard--a 30 by 20, 25 requirement. \nIn other words, cut emissions by 30 percent.\n  Yesterday I sat in on a conversation with the head of Xcel Energy, \none of the largest energy providers in the State of Minnesota, and I \nsaid: How are you going to get to 30 percent? His answer was wind \nenergy. Wind energy will play an important part.\n  It used to be a boutique form of energy, just a couple of wind \nfarmers, but today it is an important part of the whole package, the \nwhole piece we need to have in place in order to meet the standards \nthat have been set that will provide for a cleaner environment and that \nwill cut our dependence on foreign oil.\n  Without incorporating these extensions into its fiscal blueprint, I \ndo not believe this budget is setting a responsible course for our \nNation's energy policy. As we look for additional ways to promote \nrenewable energy and energy efficiency, I urge my colleagues to \nrecognize the need to ensure that we do not take a step back. If these \ntax incentives expire, we will be taking a terrible step back. We need \nto extend these energy tax provisions, and I urge support for my budget \namendment.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, the Senator from Minnesota offers an \namendment with which I am entirely sympathetic. In fact, these are many \nthings that I strongly support.\n  I would inquire of the Senator if he would be open to a different \npay-for. Let me express why I am concerned about it. The pay-for the \nSenator has offered is section 920, and section 920 is about, at this \npoint, fully subscribed. We are between $7 billion and $7.5 billion a \nyear on section 920 already, I would say to the Senator. That is about \nas much as we can do realistically. The President, in his package, had \n$7.5 billion. The appropriators, in this last bill for the last year, \ndid $6 billion.\n  So the concern I have is that we wind up with a circumstance that \nwill not accomplish what the Senator and I very much want to have \nhappen. I would offer for his consideration that we will not be voting \non his amendment right now, in any event, so there is some time for us \nto consider an alternative. If I could quickly offer as an alternative \na reserve fund, which would give total flexibility to the committees of \njurisdiction as to how to fund them, would the Senator be open to an \nalternative?\n  Mr. COLEMAN. I would note, Mr. President, that I think the underlying \nbudget provides about $36.4 billion in section 920 funding. I think \nthat is the figure. I know, as the Senator from North Dakota knows, \nthat there have been a number of other proposals. I think Senator \nBingaman's amendment uses section 920. I do think this is a priority \nthat should have been in the underlying budget. I think it is that \nessential. I believe the Senator from North Dakota understands and \nknows the importance of the extension of these tax credits.\n  This will not be voted on now for a couple of hours, but I will \ncertainly go back and explore and look at some of the possibilities. In \nthe end, I believe this needs to be part of this budget. It is \nimportant for our Nation's energy security. It is important, certainly, \nfrom an economic perspective. And it is a win-win for everyone. So let \nme explore other alternatives, but I do hope my colleagues support this \namendment, either with the 920 section we are looking at or we will \nexplore whether there is another potential.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Senator very much.\n  Mr. President, the Senator is exactly right. I think in section 920, \nwe are at about $38 billion. That is over 5 years. The $7 billion I was \nreferencing is for 1 year. The comparison I was making is that the \nPresident had given us similar offsets of about $7.5 billion for 1 \nyear. The appropriators, in the last major bill for last year, did $6 \nbillion for the year. So what I am trying to communicate is that I \nthink we are pretty close to fully subscribed there.\n  There is an alternative that would be a deficit-neutral reserve fund \nthat leaves open to the committees of jurisdiction--it actually gives \nthem more flexibility, I would say to the Senator. I would \nenthusiastically support that, if the Senator would consider a \nmodification.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I will certainly work with the Senator \nfrom North Dakota and see if we can figure out a way to get this done.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, we are now ready to go to Senator Carper.\n  We very much appreciate the patience Senator Carper has shown in \ngetting time on the Senate floor. We thank him for his valuable \ncontributions as we work these many amendments we have already \nconsidered. Senator Carper has been an especially constructive member, \nand we want to recognize him and thank him for that.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I want to convey my gratitude to Senator \nConrad, our chairman, and also Senator Gregg, our former chairman, and \nsay how much I respect and admire the way they have worked together, \nwhether Democrats were in the majority or the Republicans were in the \nmajority. I think they set an example for the rest of us to follow in \nthe way we deal with each other: with mutual respect, always focusing \non the issues, sometimes disagreeing, but doing so in an agreeable way, \nmuch the way the Presiding Officer handles himself in these matters.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 538\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be \nset aside and that it be in order for me to call up one amendment at \nthe desk, and that is amendment No. 538; that once it is reported by \nnumber, it be set aside and that I be recognized to speak with respect \nto this amendment, as already previously provided for.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Delaware [Mr. Carper], for himself and Mr. \n     Coburn, proposes an amendment numbered 538.\n\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To reduce the deficit by recovering improper payments)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. DEFICIT-REDUCTION RESERVE FUND FOR REDUCTION OF \n                   IMPROPER PAYMENTS.\n\n       The Chairman of the Senate Committee on the Budget may \n     revise the aggregates, allocations, functional totals, and \n     other appropriate levels and limits in this resolution upon \n     enactment of legislation that achieves savings by eliminating \n     or reducing improper payments made by agencies reporting \n     improper payments estimates under the Improper Payments \n     Information Act of 2002 and uses such savings to reduce the \n     deficit, provided that the legislation would not increase the \n     deficit over the total of fiscal years 2007 through 2012.\n\n  Mr. CARPER. I have three amendments, Mr. President, that I will be \ntalking about which I offered with Senator Coburn. Before I talk about \nthe amendments, though, let me take a moment to say, as a lot of my \ncolleagues do, I have a great deal of interest in the budget, the \nbudget itself and also the budget process.\n  Part of my interest goes back to my former role as Governor of my \nState, where we drafted, prepared, proposed, and implemented those \nbudgets for 8 years. During those 8 years, we balanced our budget every \nyear. We even put money, I think almost every year, in a rainy day fund \nto deal with challenges that might confront my successors someday down \nthe line. We were\n\n[[Page S3571]]\n\nable to balance the budget during those years in part because we were \nguided by a simple, basic principle, and that is if something is worth \ndoing, it is worth paying for.\n  Balancing the budget doesn't mean sitting on our hands and doing \nnothing. In Delaware, while I was privileged to serve as its chief \nexecutive, we cut taxes in 7 out of 8 years, both individual personal \nincome taxes and business taxes. We also invested in our schools to \nraise student achievement. We sought to improve health coverage for our \nchildren. We put in place a prescription drug assistance program. We \nhelped make welfare pay less than work so that people would be \nincentivized to go to work. We enhanced our transportation \ninfrastructure and paid down some of our debt.\n  It wasn't just the Governor, it was the legislature, with Democrats \nand Republicans working together, sort of our tradition in my little \nState. We set priorities, we saved money where we could, and when \nsomething was worth doing, we paid for it. We paid as we went. We \nbalanced the budget, and we did so year after year.\n  When I was elected to the Senate in 2000, the Federal budget was \nbalanced as well. In fact, our country was enjoying budget surpluses. \nWhen I came to the Senate, we were actually on track to pay off our \nnational debt. We were on track to be debt free, as hard as that is to \nimagine today. I spent most of my first term in the Senate in the \nminority. It was a very different experience from being Governor of my \nState. Over the course of my first term in the Senate, I watched the \nmajority pass budget resolution after budget resolution that ultimately \ndug us further into debt.\n  In 2000, the Federal budget was on course to run, I think, a $5.5 \ntrillion surplus. The size of the national debt had been falling at \nthat point for a couple of years. Over the last 6 years, we have gone, \nunfortunately, in the opposite direction. We have run record budget \ndeficits and added some $1.5 trillion to our Nation's debt.\n  Last year, the American people said enough. This budget resolution \nresponds to the desire of the American people to return to what I call \na commonsense approach. There is an old saying--I think it is from \nDenis Healey, Chancellor of the Exchequer in Great Britain. He had a \ntheory on holes. ``When you find yourself in a hole, stop digging.'' \nWith this budget resolution, we stop digging.\n  This budget resolution does, once again, what budget resolutions are \nsupposed to do. It not only charts the course to a balanced budget, it \nalso includes enforcement mechanisms to keep Congress's feet to the \nfire and, I might also add, the executive branch's feet to the fire. A \nplan on paper to balance the budget is great, but it does no good if we \nthrow that plan out the window as soon as we start passing spending and \ntax cut bills later in the year.\n  This budget resolution requires that new proposals to increase \nspending or decrease revenues be fully offset with counterbalancing \ncuts in spending or increases in revenue. This pay-as-you-go \nrequirement is something that I have been advocating, along with a \nnumber of my colleagues, certainly Senator Conrad and others, for \nyears. I am very pleased it will soon be adopted, I hope, by the \nSenate.\n  This budget resolution takes something called budget reconciliation \nand restores it to its original purpose. Reconciliation is a special \nprocedure that was created to make it easier to pass legislation that \nmade tough choices to reduce budget deficits. However, reconciliation \nhas been abused in some of these recent years. It has been used to \nspeed the passage of legislation that, far from balancing the budget, \nactually turned around and busted the budget. It is a little like \nadding grease to a pig. It makes it exceedingly difficult to get a \nhandle on our out-of-control budget problems.\n  I offered an amendment a couple of years ago to prohibit the use of \nreconciliation to expedite passage of measures that do bust the budget. \nI don't know if that amendment was adopted, but I am glad the Senate \nwill soon take this important step to restore fiscal order.\n  This budget also includes a new long-term budget point of order. This \nis vitally important because our short-term budget challenges pale in \ncomparison to our long-term budget challenges. We ought to be taking \nsteps now to prepare for the retirement of the baby boom generation--\nthat is my generation and maybe the generation of several of us on the \nSenate floor today--preparing for our retirement and preparing for the \nstrain those retirements are going to place on programs such as Social \nSecurity, Medicare, and, I might add, Medicaid. The last thing we ought \nto do is take steps now that will make matters worse in the future.\n\n  The new budget point of order created by this resolution requires 60 \nvotes for legislation that would make our long-term budget challenges \nsubstantially worse. This forces the Congress to look beyond the \npresent, even past the next election--something we don't always do--to \nthe future we are leaving to our children and to our grandchildren.\n  I commend the chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator Conrad. He \nhas inherited a difficult set of circumstances. He has inherited a \nbudget pretty much out of balance. He has inherited a Tax Code that has \nmiddle-class tax increases built in, in the form of a rapidly expanding \nalternative minimum tax. Nonetheless, under his leadership, the Budget \nCommittee has managed to craft what I think is a very sensible \nresolution. They have provided for our troops in the field. They have \nprovided for investments at home in education, health care for our \nchildren, and they have done this in the context of a plan that holds \nthe line on taxes and charts a course to a balanced budget over the \nnext 5 years.\n  I particularly thank Senator Conrad for managing to provide, \nconsistent with a plan to balance the budget, vital support for \npassenger rail service in this country of ours. It is becoming \nincreasingly evident every day that passenger rail is a good \ninvestment, and one I think that is getting better. It is critical to \neconomic growth and mobility. It is necessary to address traffic \ncongestion and to protect air quality, and it is an essential part of \nreducing our dependence upon foreign oil.\n  I will just share what I think is a pretty good ``gee whiz'' factor. \nWe are in Washington, DC, today talking about how rail, passenger rail \nand freight rail, can help in terms of reducing our dependence on \nforeign oil. We can take a ton of freight, move it from Washington, DC, \nto the Northeast corridor, to Boston, MA, with 1 gallon of diesel fuel. \nThink about that. With 1 gallon of diesel fuel you can move a ton of \nfreight by rail from Washington, DC, to Boston, MA.\n  There are real economies to be gained, real progress in terms of \nreducing our dependence on foreign oil. That is about as graphic an \nexample as I can think of.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CARPER. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. CONRAD. The Senator shared that statistic with me the other day, \nand I would like the Senator to repeat it because I think it is very \neasily overlooked. Would the Senator repeat that statistic?\n  Mr. CARPER. With pleasure. It is possible to move 1 ton of freight by \nrail from Washington, DC to Boston, MA, for about a gallon of diesel \nfuel. That is it. There are similar kinds of efficiencies we could \nrealize by moving people, not just tons of freight by rail but people \nby rail, especially in densely populated corridors. I am not one who \nargues--I used to be on the Amtrak board, but I am not one who argues \nwe should run trains in places people don't want to ride them or that \nwe should run them in sparsely populated areas. I don't know that \nalways makes sense. But we have 75 percent of people in this country \nwho live within 50 miles of one of our coastlines. What that does, from \nthe Northeast, the mid-Atlantic, Southeast, gulf coast, west coast, is \ncreate a lot of densely populated corridors. They lend themselves to \npassenger rail, especially for trips of maybe 300 or 400 miles or less.\n  With respect to Amtrak funding, we need to appropriate levels of \ncapital. That is going to be more important as we consider a \ncomprehensive reauthorization bill for Amtrak, which I hope is going to \nhappen later this year.\n  I also thank Senator Conrad and the committee for addressing the tax \ngap in this bill. That is the difference between the amount of tax that \nis legally\n\n[[Page S3572]]\n\nowed and the amount that is actually being paid on a timely basis. The \ntax gap is estimated to be some $345 billion in 2001. The chairman of \nthe Budget Committee has estimated it will amount to as much as $2 \ntrillion over the course of the 5 years covered by this budget \nresolution. If we completely closed this tax gap, we would largely \neliminate the Federal budget deficit. We are never going to completely \nclose it, but we need to do more to narrow it. It is a matter of basic \nfairness to the great majority of Americans who do the right thing and \npay their taxes they owe on a timely basis.\n  Together with Senator Coburn, who is the ranking member of the \nFinancial Management Subcommittee I chair, I am offering three \namendments to the budget resolution that I believe complement the \ninitiatives in the budget resolution to address the tax gap. Our \namendments deal with the spending side of the equation. Based on our \nwork in the subcommittee, our amendments point to ways in which we can \nand should reduce the deficit by promoting better financial management. \nI think actually the administration probably agrees with what we are \ntrying to do here.\n  Our first amendment deals with improper payments. Agencies across the \nFederal Government spend literally tens of billions of dollars every \nyear on avoidable payment errors.\n  The most recent Governmentwide estimates from OMB report that \nagencies made about $41 billion in improper payments in fiscal year \n2006, most of them overpayments. This total is likely only the tip of \nthe iceberg, since many agencies are not in full compliance with the \nlaw that requires them to report on their payment errors--the Improper \nPayments Information Act.\n  OMB has plans in place to improve agencies' compliance with the \nImproper Payments Information Act. In keeping with our oversight role, \nour subcommittee is working with OMB to ensure that agencies comply \nwith these plans and make consistent progress toward OMB's goal of \neliminating up to $20 billion--that's about half the improper \npayments--in reported improper payments between now and 2011.\n  The first amendment Senator Coburn and I have submitted would apply \nsuch savings as we are able to realize through the elimination of \nimproper payments to deficit-reduction.\n  The second amendment Senator Coburn and I have submitted touches on \nrecovery audits, a tool at least some agencies use to recover payment \nerrors they make.\n  Under current law, agencies with at least $500 million in contracts \noutstanding must regularly go through their books to find overpayments, \ndouble payments, and other errors they may have made in paying their \ncontractors.\n  According to data released by OMB in January, just 2 months ago, \nagencies used recovery auditing to identify and collect millions of \ndollars in payment errors made to contractors. Frankly, We would like \nto see more of this kind of auditing work done.\n  I intend to work with Senator Coburn, OMB, and others to increase the \namount of recovery auditing that occurs at the Federal level. The \namendment Senator Coburn and I have submitted today would dedicate the \nsavings we achieve by doing that through these efforts to deficit \nreduction.\n  Our third amendment touches on the management of Federal property. \nSenator Coburn and I have learned through several hearings in our \nsubcommittee that agencies are spending a significant amount of money \neach year maintaining unneeded property--including buildings that are \ncompletely vacant.\n  Part of this problem comes from the fact that agencies still don't \nreally know what property they own, in some cases, despite some \nadmirable efforts undertaken by the administration. Agencies also \naren't given the appropriate incentives under current law to dispose of \nproperty they no longer need.\n  Senator Coburn and I have been working on legislation that would give \nagencies additional tools and incentives that will encourage them to \ndispose of unneeded and vacant property. In so doing, it will enable \nthe Federal Government and the taxpayers of this country to save the \nsubstantial costs that are incurred when we fail to dispose of these \nexcess properties.\n  OMB has said that the legislation Senator Coburn and I hope to bring \nforward this year would help agencies unload some $11 billion in \nproperty by 2011. The amendment Senator Coburn and I have submitted \ntoday would devote this savings to deficit-reduction.\n  Again, I commend the Chairman of the Budget Committee and the Full \nCommittee for a job well done. I urge my colleagues to support this \nbudget resolution. And I urge my colleagues to join Senator Coburn and \nme in our efforts, I hope later today, to reduce the deficit through \nbetter financial management, by supporting these 3 amendments.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I see now that Senator Lincoln has come to \nthe floor. We are running a little bit ahead of schedule, which is very \nhelpful to us. While the Senator prepares, I say this to my colleagues: \nIt is very important for colleagues to get this message because we have \nagreed between the managers of the bill to the following: In addition \nto the outline of amendments we have between now and when we start \nvoting, we are then going to stop voting at 6 o'clock tonight. We will \nthen have a period this evening where Senators will be able to speak. \nThey will not be able to offer amendments. They can speak about \namendments, but they will not be able to offer the amendments. We will \nhave blocks of 30 minutes. From 6 to 6:30, the time will be under the \ncontrol of the minority. From 6:30 to 7, it will be under the control \nof the majority. It will alternate back and forth in that way.\n  So from 6 to 6:30, the minority will control a 30-minute block. From \n6:30 to 7, the majority will control a 30-minute block, and so on. From \n7 to 7:30, back to the minority. From 7:30 to 8, the majority. Senators \nand their staffs need to be aware that time will be available for \nspeaking. You can talk on the amendments. You can talk on the budget \nresolution. You will not be able to offer an amendment, but you can \ntalk about the amendment you will be offering tomorrow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. To clarify further from our side of the aisle, in those \ntime slots we have already had requests for 10 speakers. We are \nbasically allocating 15 minutes per speaker so we are well into 2\\1/2\\ \nhours of our time we will be using on our side of the aisle. If other \npeople wish to speak, it will be after those first 10 who have already \ngotten in touch with us and told us they need time. Please get in touch \nwith us if people want to say something. At that time it will be a \nconvenient time for people who have an amendment to talk about the \namendment so they can get a little more on the record about the \namendment because tomorrow on the vote-arama they will be limited to 1 \nminute to explain their amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Senator. I wish to send the word out to \nSenators on our side that time will be designated on a first come, \nfirst served basis. So Senators need to call the cloakroom or call the \nBudget Committee to get that time allocated.\n  Now we have time reserved for the Senator from Arkansas, Mrs. \nLincoln.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 542\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to call up \namendment 542.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. I also ask unanimous consent to add Senator McCaskill \nas a cosponsor of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kentucky [Mrs. Lincoln], for herself, Ms. \n     Snowe, and Mrs. McCaskill, proposes an amendment numbered \n     542.\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n[[Page S3573]]\n\n    (Purpose: To provide the Veterans Benefits Administration with \n     additional resources and staff to more effectively meet their \n   increasing workload and to address the unacceptably large claims \nbacklog that continues to cause undue hardships for veterans and their \n                      families across the country)\n\n       On page 22, line 12, increase the amount by $70,000,000.\n       On page 22, line 13, increase the amount by $62,000,000.\n       On page 22, line 17, increase the amount by $8,000,000.\n       On page 26, line 12, decrease the amount by $70,000,000.\n       On page 26, line 13, decrease the amount by $62,000,000.\n       On page 26, line 17, decrease the amount by $8,000,000.\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I have a special thanks to our chairman \nand ranking member, who have been enormously diligent on this budget \nissue. Chairman Conrad has done a phenomenal job in bringing together a \nbudget that reflects values for this country and for the American \npeople. We are grateful to him for spending so much time, along with \nthe members of the Budget Committee, in doing that.\n  I rise today to offer this amendment with my friend and colleague \nfrom Maine, Senator Snowe. It is an amendment to the budget resolution \nthat would provide an additional $70 million for the Veterans Benefits \nAdministration. It is not a huge amount, but it is a necessary amount. \nThis very much needed funding would provide the Veterans Benefits \nAdministration with additional resources and staff to more effectively \nmeet its increasing workload and its growing backlog of pending claims.\n  We have seen a tremendous pressure put on our Veterans' \nAdministration over the last several years. The veterans of this \ncountry, who have given so selflessly to this country in their service, \nin return deserve the services they have been promised. It is so \nimportant that the Veterans' Administration is able to process those \nrequests.\n  Chairman Akaka and Senator Murray have certainly shown tremendous \nleadership on behalf of our veterans. I thank them from the bottom of \nmy heart. I thank them for all they have done. I also commend my \ncolleague Chairman Conrad for this budget resolution which does so much \nin reflecting our Nation's commitment to our veterans. We know the \nchairman has put in here much needed resources for the VA. Those of us \nwho believe so strongly in our veterans appreciate that.\n  I am here today to build off of that great work these individuals \nhave done. Delivering timely and accurate benefits to the brave men and \nwomen who have served our Nation in uniform should be a priority for \neach of us. The current backlog of pending disability and compensation \nclaims has been listed as one of the VA's highest management priorities \nover the past several years. Yet the backlog that exists there is \ngrowing each and every day. The number of veterans who are contacting \nour office, our congressional office in Arkansas, who need help in \nnavigating the disability claims arena at the VA, is so huge. \nUnfortunately, the time that begins to lag becomes years--not weeks or \ndays but years--that our veterans are not getting the services they \nneed because of this claims process.\n  With an aging veteran population and more and more service men and \nwomen who are returning from overseas, the numbers of these claims will \ncontinue to increase, and the problem also becomes that our older \nveterans who have claims and have had claims existing for a long time, \nunfortunately, with newer veterans who are returning from Iraq and \nAfghanistan, they get pushed to the front of the line oftentimes. It is \nan unreasonable situation for the VA to be in.\n  The complexity of these claims has also increased as the health of \nour aging veterans has worsened and we are seeing a growing number of \ncomplex new claims that are resulting from complex combat-related \ninjuries, such as PTSD and traumatic brain injuries.\n  Unfortunately, the increase in the growing complexity of these \nclaims, coupled with the lack of resources by the VA, has contributed \nto an unacceptably large claims backlog that continues to cause undue \nhardship for our veterans and their families all across this country.\n  We all agree the claims process should be more timely and more \naccurate. While there are a number of fundamental changes that need to \nbe made, the least we can do is better provide the VA with the \nresources and the staff they so desperately need.\n  Last year the backlog of pending compensation and pension claims was \nnearly 586,000. As of last week, the backlog had grown to over 647,000.\n  The most time-consuming and labor-intensive claims to process are the \ndisability claims which require rating decisions. Last year the backlog \nof disability claims was nearly 372,000. Today it has grown to 405,000. \nThis amendment would address the growing backlog of pending disability \nclaims by providing $65 million to hire an additional 600 disability \nclaims processors.\n  As the VA receives and adjudicates more claims, it results in a \nlarger number of appeals. That backlog of claims also continues to \ngrow, and that is why this amendment would provide $4 million for the \nBoard of Veterans' Appeals to hire 32 additional full-time staff.\n  Additional funds are also necessary to increase training for current \nemployees as well as any new employees to ensure consistency of claims \nprocessing and to lower error rates. That is why this amendment would \nprovide the 1-year cost for increased training resources and quality \nmeasures with $400,000 for training and performance support systems and \n$400,000 for skill certification.\n  I was taught at an early age about the sacrifices our troops and \ntheir families have made to keep our Nation free. My father and \ngrandfathers both served in uniform; my father in Korea as an \ninfantryman, I had both grandfathers who served the Nation in World War \nI. That is why I am here today.\n  These veterans have given so much. They have given so much, as have \ntheir families. But to sit in waiting for years to get an answer from \nthe VA is absolutely unacceptable, simply because we are not willing to \nput the staff there that needs to be there to deal with the volume of \npeople who are coming.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, which would simply \nallow the VA to better process and award the benefits to which they are \nentitled by law. This does not create any new benefits. It simply gives \nthem access to the benefits they already need and deserve.\n  I would ask my colleagues to check with your staff and check with \nyour offices to see the disability claims you are dealing with for \nveterans in your State and see how many of them have such a lengthy \ntime that you would love to be able to erase.\n  The lessons ingrained in me since my childhood have taught me that \nafter a person has served in the military, we should make every effort, \nabsolutely every effort, to care for them and for their families and to \nhonor the benefits they have earned. It is the least we can do for \nthose to whom we owe so much. It is the least we can do to reassure \nfuture generations that a grateful nation will not forget them when \ntheir military service is complete.\n  I urge my colleagues to support us on this amendment. We know that, \nas I said, the Budget Committee has done a good job in putting forth a \nresponsible budget but one that truly recognizes the needs of our \nveterans. This is one small measure where we can assure the resources \nwill be there to hire the staff, to ensure the backlog in these claims \ncan be taken care of.\n  I appreciate, again, the chairman and the ranking member of the \nBudget Committee. I thank them for the incredible job they have done. I \nencourage my colleagues to support this amendment on behalf of the many \nveterans, with whom each and every one of us in our offices works, to \nensure we can get them a timely response on their claims with the VA.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of an \namendment that my friend and colleague from Arkansas, Senator Lincoln, \nand myself have offered to the budget resolution, which will help to \nensure that our Nation's courageous veterans receive the benefits and \ncompensation that they have earned in a timely and efficient manner \nfrom the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).\n  Every year, hundreds of thousands of America's finest look to the \nVeterans\n\n[[Page S3574]]\n\nBenefits Administration (VBA) to process their claims for disability \ncompensation, pensions and other entitlements due them as a result of \ntheir unselfish and steadfast service to our Nation. However, according \nto a VBA Workload Report in 2006, the total number of pending \ncompensation and pension claims increased nearly 17 percent over 2006, \nfrom 517,574 to 604,308 cases--and as of last week, the backlog had \ngrown to 647,405 cases. On top of this, our country's aging veterans' \npopulation and influx of service men and women who will enter the VA \nsystem after returning from Iraq and Afghanistan will inexorably lead \nto an increase in the VBA's workload.\n  The lengthy delay that many veterans endure to receive their benefits \nfrom the VA is simply unacceptable. Therefore, I believe it is vital \nfor the Department of Veterans Affairs to have the resources necessary \nto promptly deliver benefits to veterans by adjudicating and processing \ntheir claims in a timely and accurate fashion. Given the critical \nfinancial importance of disability payments for veterans and their \nfamilies, the VA has an undeniable responsibility to maintain an \neffective delivery system and to take decisive and appropriate action \nto correct deficiencies as soon as they become evident.\n  On March 7, 2007, the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs received \ntestimony from Rick Surratt, the Deputy National Legislative Director \nof the Disabled America Veterans, who highlighted the staffing \nshortages that have hindered the VA's ability to process claims. \nSurratt stated:\n\n       Past Reductions in staffing levels degraded VA's ability to \n     process and decide disability claims in a correct and timely \n     manner. After falling behind, it never fully recovered. With \n     continued growth in the volume and complexity of claims for \n     disability benefits, VA has not requested the resources \n     necessary to overcome the existing backlog and stay abreast \n     of that growth. . . .\n\n  On December 4, 2006, Senator Lincoln and I joined with 33 of our \ncolleagues to send a letter to the President, respectfully requesting \nthat his fiscal year 2008 budget submission to Congress includes \nadequate funding for additional staff and resources necessary to \naddress the growing backlog of pending claims at the VBA. According to \nthe President's fiscal year 2008 budget, the average length of time to \nprocess a veteran's disability claim has dropped to 177 days, and the \nPresident's new budget will lower that processing time to 145 days. \nAlthough Senator Lincoln and I applaud the President's recent efforts \nto improve the veterans' claims process, we still feel that our \nNation's veterans deserve much better.\n  Therefore, our amendment will directly address the staff and resource \nshortages at the VBA by providing $64.5 million in order to hire an \nadditional 600 disability claims processors. Additionally, the Board of \nVeterans Appeals, whose workload has increased by 82.5 percent since \n2001--to an estimated 40,000 cases by the end of 2007--has seen \ndecreases in staff levels during the same period. As a result, a GAO \nreport found that it took an average of 657 days to resolve these \nappeals. Our amendment will provide the Board of Veterans Appeals with \n$4.1 million to hire an additional 32 processors in order to expedite \nthe adjudication process to acceptable levels.\n  I also believe that comprehensive training and skill certification \nprograms must be implemented in order to reduce the claims backlog and \nensure that processing personnel make accurate decisions. The \nprevalence of new and complex disability claims resulting from \nposttraumatic stress disorder, PTSD, and traumatic brain injury, TBI, \nprovide further evidence of the VA's need for a larger and more \nadvanced processing staff. Thus, our amendment will provide a 1-year \ncost for increased training resources and quality measures with \n$400,000 for training and performance support systems and $400,000 for \nskills certification.\n  I have nothing but the utmost respect for those brave Americans who \nserved in uniform with honor, courage, and distinction. The obligation \nour Nation holds for its veterans is enormous, and it is an obligation \nthat must be fulfilled every day. At a time when over 600,000 \ncourageous men and women have returned from combat in both Iraq and \nAfghanistan, and over 24,000 servicemembers have been wounded since the \nonset of Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom, \nCongress must now do everything in its power to answer our veterans' \ncall, to ensure that they receive the benefits that they rightly earned \nand rightly deserve. I strongly urge my colleagues to support this \namendment. Our veterans deserve nothing less.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I wish to thank Senator Lincoln for this amendment. We \nall know there is a claim backlog that is absolutely unacceptable. \nAccording to the General Accounting Office, between fiscal years 2003 \nand 2006, the backlog of veterans waiting on ratings claims grew by \nalmost 50 percent, including those filed by veterans of the Iraq and \nAfghanistan conflicts.\n  Similar problems have been cited at the Department of Defense. That \nis an unacceptable backlog. I wish to thank the Senator for offering \nthis amendment, which I might add is paid for. I especially thank the \nSenator for that.\n  We now have the Senator from Wyoming.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. I would suggest that we settle up the post-6 o'clock \nperiod, if the chairman is agreeable with that at this time, with a \nunanimous consent request along the lines of what the chairman earlier \noutlined.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I ask unanimous consent that we next go to the Senator \nfrom Wyoming, Mr. Thomas, for 10 minutes. Is that acceptable to the \nSenator? We then go back on the previous schedule. At 4 o'clock, we \nrecognize Senator Bayh for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. GREGG. The previous schedule assumed Senator Kyl.\n  Mr. CONRAD. We would stay with the schedule we had, but at 4 o'clock \nwe would go to Senator Bayh for 10 minutes. Then after the votes are \ncompleted, that we have the first half hour dedicated to the minority, \nfor people with the right to speak on amendments for up to 15 minutes \neach. That from 6 to 6:30, the time is under the control of the \nminority; from 6:30 to 7, the time is under the control of the \nmajority; from 7 to 7:30, the time is under the control of the \nminority, back and forth in those half-hour blocks of time. Senators \nwould be permitted to speak. They would be able to speak on amendments \nbut not to offer amendments during that period.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, also I would note, for the edification of \nour side of the aisle, our first group of speakers will be in this \norder: Senators Domenici, Specter--they will go 15 minutes each--\nstarting at 6; Senator Grassley and Senator Hatch, second half hour; \nSenator Voinovich and Senator Brownback, the third half hour; Senator \nChambliss, Senator Thomas, the fourth half hour; Senator Graham, \nSenator Burr, the fifth half hour.\n  If there are Members, additional Republican Members, who wish to get \ntime in this post-6 o'clock period, I wish they would get in touch with \nus.\n  If any of these Members whom I just listed who had gotten in touch \nwith us--we basically listed them in the order they got in touch with \nus--wish to adjust their time, we will try to work with them. But that \nis the game plan at the moment, so everyone is on notice.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I say to the Senator, we may want to think about \ninterspersing Senators because it would be unfortunate if Senators did \nnot appear and there was a large block of time where people were \nwaiting. We are probably going to want to work out some mechanism where \nSenators, if they are here, we allow them to go forward.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 464 Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw my \namendment dealing with payment limitations on farm programs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Senator very much. He has, as always, been \nvery courteous and very helpful in allowing the budget resolution to \nproceed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n\n[[Page S3575]]\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 498\n\n                 (Purpose: To strike the reserve funds)\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I have an amendment numbered 498 at the \ndesk, and I ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wyoming [Mr. Thomas] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 498.\n\n       On page 48, beginning with line 17, strike all through page \n     62, line 7.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. The reason we are here, of course, is to deal with the \nbudget. I think that is a very important part of what we do in this \nCongress. It has to do with funding programs, but it has also to do \nwith determining what our spending is going to be in the year.\n  Frankly, for many of us, having some idea, some control over spending \nis one of the key issues we face. The amendment I am offering would \nbring some transparency, restraint, and I hope discipline to this \nbudgeting process. The budget resolution is supposed to provide the \nblueprint for Government spending and allocate dollars for \nappropriators in the future. That is what it is for. That is why we do \nit in the budget, so that for this year we will have a budget that \nsays: Here are the programs, here are the dollars, this is what we do.\n  To be sure, it is a difficult task. It is always difficult, and there \nare limited resources and always unlimited demands and infinite \nrequests. It is a tough job putting together a budget. However, it \nrequires hard choices. I understand that. It is a time when we make \nchoices among the competing priorities, and that is what budgeting is \nfor. That is, in fact, the purpose of the budget.\n  I am concerned, in this budget, about the reserve funds that are \nplaced there. This budget abdicates responsibility in a number of areas \nand fails to even set a cap on overall spending. The primary mechanism \nby which this happens is because of the so-called reserve funds.\n  This budget contains 22 separate funds, the purpose of which is to \nallow spending beyond the limits specified in the budget decision. In a \nvast majority of cases, the additional spending authority is totally \nunchecked. Not only is spending unchecked, there is actually no money \nin any of these reserve funds.\n  Of course, each of them is specified to be deficit neutral. What does \nthat mean? What it means is that, in a budget that includes not a \nsingle penny of net spending restraint, taxes can be raised to pay for \nany reserve fund spending. This could be an additional $1 trillion in \ntax increases already assumed in the budget.\n  So that is the opportunity that is provided because of this reserve \nprovision. Now, I know we have designated reserve funds in the past for \nvarious things, but the practice is not one we should encourage or \ncontinue or proliferate.\n  The American people sent a message last November. They want fiscal \ndiscipline. I could not agree more. And no more ``business as usual'' \nwhen it comes to spending. So we have a budget but then we have a way \nto say: I want to expand the budget. And we pay for it by increasing \ntaxes. So we really say: We do not have a budget at all until we are \nthrough with the year. I cannot understand that. So I hear the folks \nwho are saying we need to control spending.\n  Perhaps my friends on the other side of the aisle are not quite as \nconscious of that as we are. Even if we do make a miscalculation in the \nbudget resolution, we need to move funds from one area to another, and \nthat should be spending neutral. In other words, we should make hard \nchoices, decrease spending in one area if we have to increase it in \nanother.\n  As it is currently constructed, these reserve funds are the \nequivalent of a blank check signed by the American taxpayer. So these \ntax-and-spend funds need to be eliminated. I urge my colleagues to join \nme in support for this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, it is a quarter to 3. Next up is Senator \nKyl, to be recognized for an hour, equally divided, on an estate tax \namendment. Then we will have Senator Bayh at 4 o'clock. Those are \npending matters.\n  These are the votes which are now in order, I advise my colleagues: \nthe Hutchison sales tax amendment, the Ensign means testing Part D, the \nSanders amendment to provide additional funding for education, the Enzi \namendment that involves small business, the Coleman amendment on \nenergy, the Carper amendment, and the Lincoln amendment on veterans. \nThose are amendments which have already been offered. At 3 o'clock, we \nwill be going to the Kyl amendment for an hour, equally divided.\n  Let me again say to colleagues and staffs who might be listening, we \nwill be going to votes at roughly 4:15. We will then be voting until 6 \no'clock. We would like to get as many of these votes concluded as we \ncan this evening because that will reduce vote-arama tomorrow. Again, \ncolleagues should be aware, starting at 6 o'clock, in half-hour blocks \nof time, there will be opportunities for colleagues to talk about their \namendments they may offer tomorrow or to talk about the budget \nresolution itself. We will go fairly late tonight with Senators having \nan opportunity to speak. When we are done today, all but a half hour \nwill be yielded back. Senator Gregg and I will have that time to wrap \nup. Then we will be going into vote-arama tomorrow. I believe that \nstarts at 9:30 tomorrow morning.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Does the debate start at 9:30 on the half hour that is \nreserved?\n  Mr. CONRAD. We should start at 9 o'clock.\n  Mr. GREGG. That is fine.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I think we would want to start at 9 o'clock with our half \nhour to be equally divided between the two of us and then go right to \nthe voting starting at 9:30. It is our intention to try to conclude by \n4 o'clock. It is very important that Senators give notice to the \nmanagers about amendments they seek to have considered during vote-\narama.\n  Let me break this down. From 9:30 to 4--that is 6\\1/2\\ hours--we can \ndo about three votes an hour. We would be talking about 19 votes. We \ncould probably get in 19, perhaps 20 votes in that time. That is \nrealistic. That is hard, but it can be done.\n  It is going to be incredibly important, for us to finish this budget \nresolution tomorrow, that colleagues show restraint with amendments \nthey insist on considering. We have already considered many amendments. \nSenators have had a full opportunity for debate and discussion. \nGoodness knows, we took dozens of Senators' suggestions in drafting \nthis budget resolution. I am asking--I am speaking to my side of the \naisle--Senators to show real restraint in terms of the amendments they \ninsist on because we must conclude our business by 4 o'clock tomorrow. \nIf we do not, it is going to go on into some other time, either on into \ntomorrow tonight or on into Saturday. Maybe we could stay here all \nFriday night. Wouldn't that be fun? Please, this is the time to show \ndiscipline.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I have agreement with Senator Thomas that \nhis amendment will be voted on on Friday. That is not a part of the \nnext tranche of votes. It will be in order on Friday to be voted on. He \ntherefore no longer wishes to speak this evening. He made his points \njust now.\n  I would advise Senator Graham and Senator Burr that they have both \nmoved up on the list. It looks to me that we will have seven votes, \nmaybe eight or nine potentially in order starting at 4:15.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n\n[[Page S3576]]\n\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Amendments Nos. 538 and 542\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to agree to the \nCarper amendment No. 538 and the Lincoln amendment No. 542.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments (Nos. 538 and 542) were agreed to.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Chair and my colleagues. That helps us make \nprogress. It reduces the number of votes that will have to be \nconsidered when we get to votes in the 4:15 time range.\n  This may be a good time to again alert colleagues that we are looking \nto a series of votes starting at roughly 4:15. Votes will end at 6 \no'clock. There will then be half-hour blocks of time available to the \nminority and the majority in alternating half hours for people to speak \non their amendments or on the budget resolution.\n  We now are awaiting Senator Kyl for his amendment. At the end of that \nhour, which will be evenly divided between the sides, we will have \nSenator Bayh recognized for 10 minutes.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Klobuchar). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, lately we have heard a lot about the \nalternative minimum tax. It is a problem around here we have talked \nabout and not done much about over a long period of time, whether \nRepublicans have controlled this body or Democrats have controlled this \nbody. Most often, we talk about the difficulties of really fixing the \nalternative minimum tax. Obviously, then, it is not a new problem. It \nhas been with us for several decades.\n  The individual minimum tax, the precursor to the alternative minimum \ntax, as we call it now, dates from 1969. Congress then discovered, \nsomehow, 155 taxpayers with incomes greater than $200,000 a year were \nnot paying any taxes because they could legally avoid those taxes. So \nit was calculated that everybody ought to be paying a little minimum \ntax, and that is where the alternative minimum tax comes from. At that \nparticular time, it was affecting about one taxpayer in half a million. \nNow, clearly, the situation has changed in the last 38 years.\n  Although not its only flaw, the alternative minimum tax's most \nsignificant defect is it is not indexed for inflation. This failure to \nindex the exemption and rate brackets--the parameters of the \nalternative minimum tax system--is also a bipartisan problem. Though \n$200,000 was not an incredible amount of money in 1969, the situation \nis different today. I am not saying $200,000 is not a lot of money \ntoday, because it is, but $200,000 today will not buy what it would buy \nin 1969.\n  In 2004--the most recent year for which the Internal Revenue Service \nhas complete tax data--instead of having 155 people paying this tax, \nmore than 3 million families and individuals were hit by the \nalternative minimum tax. This chart I have in the Chamber has the \nnumbers for every State in the Union. I am not going to go down those \nnumbers now because we do not have time. But you can see, State by \nState by State, there are tens of thousands of people paying the \nalternative minimum tax who were never intended to pay it, even though \nwe have taken some action in recent years so yet more people are not \npaying the alternative minimum tax.\n  This does not even begin to hint at what will happen if we do not \ncontinue to protect taxpayers from the alternative minimum tax. Barring \nan extension of the hold harmless contained in the 2006 tax bill, the \nalternative minimum tax exemptions will return to their pre-2001 \nlevels. At the end of 2006, provisions allowing nonrefundable personal \ntax credits to offset AMT tax liability expired. If further action is \nnot taken, it is estimated the alternative minimum tax will claim 35 \nmillion families and individuals by the end of this decade.\n  Now, think of that: A tax originally conceived to counter the actions \nof just 155 taxpayers could hit 35 million filers in just a few years, \nand I am talking about just around the corner. Some analyses show that \nin the next decade, it may be less costly to repeal the regular income \ntax than it would be to repeal the alternative minimum tax.\n  The AMT is a problem that has been developing for almost 40 years. On \nnumerous occasions, Congress has made adjustments to the exemptions and \nthe rates, though not as part of a sustained effort to keep the AMT \nfrom further absorbing our Nation's middle class until 2001. We did \nrepeal it in 1998, but President Clinton vetoed it. We never, then, \nwere able to get it repealed. So I am arguing for repeal.\n  Despite the temporary measures we have taken, the alternative minimum \ntax is still a very real threat to millions of taxpayers who were never \nsupposed to be subject to the minimum tax. That the AMT has grown \ngrossly beyond its original purpose, which was to ensure the wealthy \nwere not exempt from an income tax, is indisputable, and that the AMT \nis inherently flawed would seem to be common sense.\n  Despite widespread agreement that something needs to be done about \nthe AMT, agreement on what exactly to do is not very widespread. A \nmajor factor in the disagreement relates to the massive amount of money \nthe AMT is supposed to be bringing into the Federal Government over the \nnext few years--but remember, supposed to be bringing in from taxpayers \nwho were never supposed to pay it in the first place. In 2004, AMT \nfilers paid more than $12.8 billion into the Treasury.\n  If we do not extend the most recent AMT hold-harmless provisions that \nexpired at the end of 2006, that number is projected to balloon to a \nmuch greater amount, and long-term budget forecasts currently show this \ngreater amount coming into the Treasury.\n  When forecasters put their projections together, they are working \nunder the assumption that the hold harmless which was extended in last \nyear's tax bill will not be extended, that we will not take care of \nthis problem. So they are guessing there is a whole bunch of revenue \ncoming in from people who were never intended to pay it in the first \nplace. Because of this, budget planners make the assumption that \nrevenues will be much higher than everyone who is frustrated with the \nAMT thinks they ought to be. The reason for this is that the AMT \n``balloons'' the revenue base, as it is projected to increase revenues \nas a percentage of gross national product. There is a great deal of \nevidence to support this.\n\n  Now, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has consistently \nforecast the ballooning of AMT revenues year after year. This chart I \nhave in the Chamber shows that with the red line. It takes into \nconsideration that we are going to bring revenue in from people who \nwere never supposed to pay it in the first place.\n  I just want to note that although the Tax Increase Prevention and \nReconciliation Act of 2005 was signed into law after this analysis was \npublished, the 2006 tax bill extended the AMT hold harmless only \nthrough December 31 of last year, and this chart shows Federal revenues \nall the way to the year 2050. It is important to note the long-term \neffects of the AMT on the revenue base because that is what is at \nissue: the basic idea that we are going to receive a lot of revenue \nfrom middle-income taxpayers who were never intended to pay it--which \nis part of that red line we have to get rid of because why tax people \nif they were not supposed to be taxed? The law is corrected from time \nto time to keep it from happening.\n  There may be some doubters who hesitate to attribute this ballooning \nof revenues to the AMT. But this next chart illustrates the drastic \nexpansion of the AMT under current law over the next 43 years.\n  The Congressional Budget Office's report also states:\n\n       [B]y 2050, roughly 15 percent of individual income tax \n     liability would be generated by the AMT, compared with about \n     2 percent today.\n\n  This is what will happen if we do not do anything.\n  The problem with all of the projections showing the AMT ballooning \nrevenues is that these projections are used\n\n[[Page S3577]]\n\nto put together the budget we have before us. Now, this is not a \nSenator Conrad problem. This is not a Democratic problem. This is a \nbipartisan problem. Republican and Democratic budgeteers rely on the \nsame source of revenue--or I should say a source of revenue the \nCongressional Budget Office says is going to come in from people who \nwere never intended to pay it.\n  This means the central problem in dealing with the alternative \nminimum tax is money. There are some people who say we can only solve \nthe AMT if we offset the revenue and it can be found elsewhere to \nreplace the money the AMT is currently forecast to collect. But we \nnever intended to collect it from the people who we suppose are going \nto pay it. Anyone who says this sees the forecasts showing revenues \nbeing pushed up as a percentage of gross domestic product and wants big \ngovernment to keep them up there.\n  These arguments are especially ridiculous when one considers that the \nalternative minimum tax was never meant to collect so much revenue. It \nis a failed policy in many ways.\n  The alternative minimum tax has even failed in its objective to \nensure no citizen, no matter how wealthy, was able to completely avoid \nthe Federal income tax, because in 2004, the Commissioner of IRS, Mr. \nEverson, informed the Finance Committee that the same number of \ntaxpayers, as a percentage of the tax-filing population at large, \ncontinues to pay no Federal income tax. It boils down to the fact that \nthe class of 155 people the law was set up for in the first place, in \n1969, is even finding ways out of getting hit by the alternative \nminimum tax, and doing it legally because we have 2,366 taxpayers with \nincomes of $200,000 or more who do not use the medical and dental \ndeduction had no income tax and no alternative minimum tax. The AMT has \nfailed in every way except the ability to make Government bigger, or at \nleast make it look bigger, and for those who think you ought to have an \noffset, to keep it big. The AMT has failed. While it may be hard for \nsome to turn down taxpayers' money, whether we are supposed to collect \nit or not, no one has trouble spending the money--even the blue smoke \nmoney that is in that red line there.\n\n  It is simply unfair to expect taxpayers to pay a tax they were never \nintended to pay, and it is even more unfair to expect them to continue \nto pay for that tax once we get rid of it. The reform or repeal of the \nAMT should not be offset because it is money we were never supposed to \ncollect in the first place.\n  The way to solve this problem is to look on the other side of the \nledger, to the spending side. Budget planners need to take off their \nrose-colored glasses, because that never materializes, and if it does, \nyou are going to ruin the middle class. So take off your rose-colored \nglasses when looking at long-term revenue projections and read the fine \nprint.\n  In general, it is a good idea to spend money within your means, and \nthis is true in this case for the Government as well. If we start \ntrying to spend revenues we expect to collect in the future because of \nthe alternative minimum tax, we are living beyond our means. We need to \nstop assuming record levels of revenue are available to be spent and \nrecognize the alternative minimum tax is a phony revenue source.\n  As we consider how to deal with the alternative minimum tax, we must \nfirst remember we do not have the option of not dealing with it. The \nproblems will only get worse every year and make any solution even more \ndifficult. We must also be clear the revenue the AMT would not collect \nas a result of repeal or reform should not be offset as a condition of \na repeal or reform. We shouldn't call it lost revenue because it is \nrevenue we never had to begin with.\n  A few weeks ago I presented to this body a joint tax estimate of how \nvarious proposed fixes to the AMT will impact revenues expected to be \ncollected under current law. I noted at that time that full repeal \naside, each of these proposals will still allow the alternative minimum \ntax to bring in hundreds of billions of dollars into the Treasury. If \nyou consider any proposal aside from full repeal, you are saying \nhundreds of thousands, if not millions, of taxpayers out there deserve \nto bear the burden of the AMT. In other words, the middle class that is \nso talked about on this floor of this Senate to protect, the only way \nthey are going to be protected is the extent to which we do away with \nthis tax.\n  Suppose we are able to continue enacting 1- or 2-year temporary \npatches, as we have done. First, this strategy assumes Congress will \nhave the time and the inclination to spend time dealing with the \nalternative minimum tax every year or two. This means whatever the \nissue of the day might be--Iraq, unemployment, natural disasters--\nCongress will have to stop dealing with those other problems and return \nto a problem we should never have had to deal with in the first place. \nIs the alternative minimum tax an issue that we as a legislative body \nwant to revisit every year? Wouldn't it be better to solve it once and \nfor all, particularly since it is phantom revenue, taxing middle-class \nAmericans who were never supposed to pay it in the first place? \nRemember, only 155 taxpayers were targeted with this tax in 1969.\n  Second, every time Congress attempts to enact or extend a temporary \nfix, the same revenue issues are going to come up. Budget projections \ncreate the illusion of forgone revenues given up because of an \nalternative minimum tax hold harmless. Every time a patch is \nconsidered, there is another chance for taxpayers to be subject to this \nstealth tax increase.\n  Clearly, there is only one way to fix the AMT so no taxpayer is \nsubjected to what has become a complete policy failure. We must \ncompletely repeal the individual AMT. There is a bipartisan consensus \nthat only complete repeal is an adequate solution to this problem. \nChairman Baucus, along with this Senator, Senator Crapo, Senator Kyl, \nSenator Roberts, Senator Schumer of New York, and Senator Smith last \nmonth introduced the Individual Alternative Minimum Tax Repeal Act.\n  We must repeal the AMT and we must do it without offsetting any \nrevenue the AMT is expected to collect in the future. I have made this \npoint before, but it is important. The alternative minimum tax was \nnever intended to be a significant source of revenue. It was only meant \nto hit a few people who could legally avoid paying the tax with the \nidea that everybody living in America ought to pay a little bit of \nincome tax for the privilege of benefiting from this great economy we \nhave. Despite this, the alternative minimum tax will balloon revenues \nto historically high levels if something isn't done, as my colleagues \ncan see right there on the chart.\n  If we consider the AMT to be a fundamentally unfair tax, any tax that \nwould replace it would be equally unfair. Anyone who wants equity to be \na fundamental value represented in our Tax Code and who wants fair \ntreatment for this country's middle-class taxpayers must support my \namendment for complete repeal of the individual income tax.\n  I filed an amendment that repeals the AMT. I am going to push this \nbody to speak on this proposal for these reasons: We need to get \nMembers who say they support AMT repeal to show their support for the \nrecord; second, to eliminate the mythical budgeting that results from \nassuming current levels of AMT revenues; third, to show the American \npeople we will walk the walk on the AMT repeal and not just talk the \ntalk.\n  I know some who oppose my amendment will argue two points: that there \nis $180 billion in the budget for tax relief; and secondly, we can't \nafford the repeal of AMT.\n  As to the first point, the purpose of the Baucus amendment, which I \nsupported yesterday, was to deal with less than half of the tax relief \nthat expires in the year 2010. In a sense, Members have indicated where \nthey want that money to go, and that revenue loss is built into the \npost-2010 period.\n  As to the second point, we can afford to repeal the AMT because \nrevenues remain at or above record levels in the outyears with the AMT \ngone. Honest budgeting would recognize it as fictional in any event.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, let me discuss this amendment briefly. It \nis cosponsored by Senator Thune from South Dakota. It is called the \nKyl-Thune death tax reform amendment.\n  Yesterday we had a vote on an amendment that included several items, \nincluding death tax reform, and I believe some people might have voted \nagainst that because items in the bill included a continuation of the \ncurrent rates for the capital gains tax and the tax on dividends. \nBecause of that fact, we decided to make this basically a clean vote.\n  The only thing this bill deals with other than death tax reform is \nthe continuation for teachers of the teacher tax deduction which we \nmake permanent. This is the deduction that allows a teacher, when she \npays or he pays for some items that are then taken to school to help \nthe kids with their lessons, when they pay for those out of their own \npocket--we think there should be a $250 deduction to help defray the \ncost of those items. That is all that is in this amendment now.\n  This Kyl-Thune amendment provides room in the budget resolution to \nenact meaningful tax reform. Obviously, I still believe repeal of the \ndeath tax is the best option. We have been trying to find agreement on \na permanent reform, because planning for death tax now is a nightmare \nfor families, and it is a nightmare right now because of the way this \nlaw is being phased out and then comes back with a vengeance to its \nprevious form. It is a bonanza for the insurance companies, to be sure, \nand they are leading the opposition to the death tax reform. But they \nare wrong.\n  As a matter of fact, when the lobbyists for the insurance industry \ncame to my office to argue this, I said: Before you make your argument, \nlet me ask you to assume for a moment we have found a way to eliminate \ndeath. Now, you represent the undertakers; go ahead and make your case. \nThat is the case with the insurance companies. They are making a lot of \nmoney on the backs of people who have to spend money to plan against \nthe death of the person in their family who runs the farm or has the \nsmall business.\n  There is a far better way to use all of that money that is spent each \nyear on avoiding the tax or preparing to pay for it. As a matter of \nfact, what we have found is there is almost an equal amount of money \nthat is spent complying with the avoidance costs as there is in \ncollection for the Government. Alicia Munnell, who was a member of \nPresident Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers, estimated the costs \nof complying with the estate tax laws are roughly the same as the \nrevenue raised. The estate tax is expected to raise about $28 billion \nin fiscal year 2006. If the estate tax generates a dollar in compliance \ncosts for every dollar in revenue, then obviously the aggregate cost of \nthe tax is about $56 billion. The point is, for every dollar of revenue \nraised by the estate tax, another dollar is simply wasted to comply \nwith or avoid the tax. Maybe I shouldn't say ``wasted.'' It does go to \nthe insurance companies. So let me strike ``wasted.''\n  But the bottom line is we can do better. What this amendment does is \nto allow the budget to accommodate estate tax reform. I didn't pick my \nbill, even though I happen to think it is the best reform bill; I took \na bill that has been provided by the senior Senator from Louisiana and \nhas been supported by people on the other side of the aisle such as the \njunior Senator from Arkansas. What the budget would do is accommodate \nthat particular death tax reform. It could accommodate other death tax \nreform as well, so long as it was within the amount of money we have \nprovided here. The amount of money in this amendment is a total of \nabout $32 billion over 5 years, and that needs to be added to the \namount the Baucus amendment already provides for estate tax reform \nwhich would be a total of about $61.7 billion over a 5-year period.\n  The bill that was provided or written by the senior Senator from \nLouisiana provides a $5 million exemption indexed for inflation, which \nI think is a perfectly appropriate amount, a family business carve-out, \nwhich is very difficult to do legally, and a 35-percent top rate. That \nis where I differ, because 35 percent is still a very high top rate. It \nalso recaptures the benefit of the $5 million exemption for estates \nvalued over $100 million. The revenue provided for the death tax reform \nin the 5-year budget window is about $31.7 billion, as I said. The \nteacher deduction is about another $400 million, for a total of about \n$32 billion.\n  As I said, the amendment is structured so when it is combined with \nthe Baucus amendment approved yesterday, the total amount of revenue \nwould be sufficient to accommodate the Landrieu reform bill. If you \ntake both amendments together, the Baucus amendment and Kyl-Thune, as I \nsaid, the total amount is about $61.7 billion, not offset with \nadditional revenues. As a matter of fact, I don't believe existing law \nextensions--and, indeed, this is precisely what we would be talking \nabout here--should have to be offset, particularly where they are \nactually provisions that enhance economic activity, just as extensions \nof existing mandatory spending need not be offset.\n  The amendment approved yesterday included an estate tax provision \nthat\n\n[[Page S3579]]\n\nfrankly I very strongly disagree with. In fact, some would say it is an \ninsult to every family business or every family farm that is seeking \nrelief. Not surprisingly, it is strongly endorsed by the insurance \nindustry, because it provides for a 45-percent rate. Now, if you have a \n45-percent rate, you are going to want to plan against that. You do not \nwant to have to pay that rate on the estate that is left after your \ndeath. As a result, since the Government has taken about half your \nproperty above the exempt amount, you are going to want to plan against \nthat. That is why I think we can do better than that, and this proposal \ndoes that.\n  Remember, the budget that has been proposed here allows increases on \ntaxes on almost every single taxpayer, a total of about $736 billion \nover 5 years, which is, I believe, about 3 times larger than the \nbiggest tax increase ever enacted in our history. The amount adopted \nyesterday by the chairman of the Finance Committee took the budget out \nof balance. It created a deficit, in other words, of about $6 billion \nin the year 2012. We believe the spending restraint we are capable of, \ncombined with a very strong economy, will enable us to balance the \nbudget by 2012 without increasing taxes.\n  Now, it is true the budget before us makes it impossible, because of \nthe amount of spending in it, to balance the budget without a record \nlevel of tax increase. Unfortunately, that includes a confiscatory tax \non thousands of American families. The budget resolutions don't dictate \npolicy to the Finance Committee, but it would certainly be our \nintention to work with Senator Landrieu, Senator Pryor, and Senator \nLincoln, who has been very much a leader in this area, and others to \ncraft an estate tax reform proposal that would provide an exemption of \nat least $5 million indexed for inflation and provide workable relief \nfor the smallest estates and farms, and a top rate that is no higher \nthan 35 percent--hopefully lower.\n  We believe that this can be accomplished and that, as a result, my \ncolleagues who might have opposed this amendment yesterday because it \nincluded the capital gains and dividend tax rates should be in a \nposition to support the resolution that will be voted on today because \nof the fact that it accommodates a proposal supported by Members of \nboth the majority and minority. It will be voted on tomorrow; I \nmisspoke. I would like to have it voted on today.\n  A couple of other items, and I see my colleague, the Senator from \nSouth Dakota is here. I want him to speak to this. There are a couple \nof misconceptions I wish to address. According to the Joint Tax \nCommittee, the total number of estate tax returns projected for 2011 \nalone is 131,000. By 2015, about 177,000 estates will file tax returns \nin that year alone. These are the numbers for each year. Some people \nhad the idea that these were the numbers over 5 or 10 years; no, this \nis for each year.\n  The first misconception is that it doesn't apply to that many people. \nAn awful lot of people need to file these returns. Secondly, the death \ntax, similar to other taxes, is very sensitive with respect to economic \ngrowth. When businesses can put this money back into their business and \ncreate jobs, rather than pay the estate planning to insurance \ncompanies, it helps our economy as well as helping the business grow. \nAn entrepreneur or an investor will have a very big disincentive to \ngrow their business, regardless of the amount of the exemption, above \nthat exempted amount if the tax rate imposed on new growth over and \nabove the exemption is too high.\n  We can argue about what the tax rate ought to be. But I think almost \neverybody would agree the tax rate of 45 percent is confiscatory. What \nincentive does somebody have to grow his business beyond the exempt \namount if the Government will take nearly half of everything over that \nexempt amount?\n  A couple of other points. We have historical evidence that the estate \ntax reduces capital stock in the U.S. economy. This is part of the \nreason we have grown so well in recent years, because of the downward \nprojection on the estate tax and the hope that it will be eventually \neliminated.\n  In a report by the Joint Economic Committee, they projected the \nestate tax reduced the stock of capital in the economy by approximately \n$847 billion, or 3.8 percent, over the last 60 years. That is a ton of \nmoney. By comparison, it has raised, during that same period, less than \nthat--only $761 billion. So it has taken far more out of the private \nsector and hasn't added that much to the Government sector. This is \nmoney that could have been put to productive use.\n  I mentioned the fact that the avoidance costs are about equal to the \ntake for the Government as well. That is another reason for this \nreform.\n  I will close with this point: Americans understand the rates now are \nconfiscatory, that it is unfair; and even people who understand that \nthey will never be subject to the estate tax appreciate its effect on \nothers and understand it is an unfair tax. In a Gallup Poll from an \nApril 2006, 58 percent of respondents said--and they called it the \n``inheritance tax'' and didn't use the words ``death tax.'' They said \nthe inheritance tax is unfair, and this confirms results of polls taken \nin both previous years. It is always called ``the most unfair tax'' \nwhen you list it among all the other taxes.\n  What is interesting about the Gallup Poll is that even though it was \ntaken in April while Americans were filing their taxes, the death tax \nwas called unfair--or the ``inheritance tax''--by more people than the \ndespised alternative minimum tax that was discussed by the ranking \nmember of the Finance Committee. Only 42 percent of respondents said \nthe AMT was unfair. Yet it is affecting a lot more people than the \nestate tax. One reason people say it is unfair is because of the \nconfiscatory rate, which is 46 percent this year. In the 2005 poll, \nwhen the rate was 47 percent, 81 percent of respondents said the estate \ntax is ``an extreme form of taxation'' and that the rate was unfair.\n  Finally, I note--and this was interesting to me as somebody who has \nstudied politics a little bit--after the last election in the exit \npolls, voters were asked whether they thought the death tax was \nsomewhat unfair or very unfair. They were broken into Kerry voters and \nBush voters. Not unsurprisingly, 89 percent of Bush voters believed the \ndeath tax is somewhat unfair or very unfair. But 71 percent of Kerry \nvoters also found the death tax at least somewhat unfair or very \nunfair.\n  So this is a view shared by most Americans of all political stripes, \nand it is time for us to reform the death tax, if not repeal it.\n  What we have done with this amendment--the Kyl-Thune amendment--is \naccommodate that reform in the budget. I hope my colleagues, when we \nhave an opportunity to vote on it, will support it. I want the Senator \nfrom South Dakota to speak, but I would like a minute at the conclusion \nto talk about the support also coming not just from other small \nbusiness organizations but from minority business organizations and \nothers, to demonstrate the breadth of support around the country for \nreform of this very unfair tax.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Through no fault of the Senator from Arizona, we are \nactually into my time on his amendment. As I said to the Senator from \nArizona, I am prepared to yield some of my time so that some of his \nother speakers have a chance. Also, I don't want to completely give \naway my time because I need to respond. Maybe we can work out an \nagreement so that those people who are here can speak, and I would like \nto have 10 minutes. I was supposed to have a half hour, but I would \nlike to retain at least 10 minutes.\n  Senator Grassley indicated he would like a minute. He is not here at \nthe moment, so perhaps we can go to Senator Thune. We have 22 minutes. \nIf I am to retain 10, that leaves 12 minutes. I don't know how the \nSenator wants to divvy up that time.\n  Mr. KYL. I appreciate the courtesy of the chairman of the committee. \nIf Senator Grassley takes a minute, and we have three other Senators \nwho take 4 minutes, that gives me a minute to say thank you and that \nwould do it. I propose that as a unanimous consent request.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Can we identify the Senators? Senator Grassley for a \nminute, Senator Thune for 4 minutes, Senator DeMint for 4 minutes, and \nSenator Graham for 4 minutes, and a minute to Senator Kyl. That would \nleave me 8 minutes. That is fair enough.\n\n[[Page S3580]]\n\n  Mr. KYL. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from South Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I thank the Senator from North Dakota for \naccommodating us. I thank the Senator from Arizona for his leadership \non this issue. I have supported his efforts for some time to get rid of \nthe death tax. I have supported getting rid of this unfair tax going \nback to my days as a Member of the House of Representatives.\n  Last year, I came down to the Senate floor and gave examples of real-\nlife family farms that are facing the effects of the death tax. I \nwanted to remind Senators of two of those family farms. I think \nsometimes it gets lost. We think we are dealing with these concepts in \nthe abstract, but they affect real people. These stories are real, and \nthe effect of the tax is real as well.\n  The first example is a 3,000-acre family farm operation in central \nSouth Dakota. In my State, that is a medium-sized operation. A death \noccurred in this family and, as a result, $750,000 will likely be paid \nin taxes. This is a huge amount of money for a farm operation in my \nState, where land values can make an operation look a lot more valuable \non paper than they are in reality.\n  In other words, farmers such as this can often be described as ``land \nrich'' but ``cash poor.'' All their value is in the land. When a \nmassive death tax bill comes due, the only option is often to sell the \nland to pay the unfair and unjust tax. Thus, a family legacy comes to \nan end.\n  The second example is a 10,000-acre operation in north central South \nDakota. Similar to so many farms and ranches in my State, the parents \nwho have run the place for decades are getting older. Their kids would \nlike to continue in the business, but the death tax on that farm would \nlikely be $1.5 million. That would make it virtually impossible for the \nkids to stay on the farm and keep that family farm operation going. I \nfind it extremely disturbing that our Federal Tax Code could influence \na family's ability to keep their family farm from being broken up and \nsold off.\n  The budget resolution is more than a list of numbers. It is a \nstatement of our priorities. These priorities are going to impact real \npeople. I believe our budget should show we are prioritizing family \nfarms, family ranches, and small businesses. We can show that these \nfamily small businesses are a priority by making room in the budget for \npermanent, meaningful death tax reform.\n  The death tax is a completely unfair tax because Americans pay their \nfair share of taxes throughout their life on what they earn, what they \nown, what they buy, only to see the IRS take one last bite when they \ndie.\n  It is also unfair because the Donald Trumps and Paris Hiltons of the \nworld have teams of lawyers and accountants to make sure they pay \nlittle or no death tax. But the family-owned operations and small \nbusinesses I talked about are the ones that end up paying.\n  It is for these reasons that Congress acted a few years ago to repeal \nthe death tax, but because of some strange rules that can only be \ndevised in a place such as the Senate, the death tax comes back to life \nin the year 2011.\n  I believe we need to enact permanent, meaningful death tax reform \nthis year. This amendment takes us down that path. I hope my colleagues \non both sides will support it. I credit the Senator from Arizona for \ndrafting this in a way that is consistent with the proposal offered \nlast year by a colleague on the other side. I hope Members on both \nsides can support this, and I hope, once and for all, we will get rid \nof this unfair and unjust tax.\n  I yield back whatever time I have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Madam President, I rise to speak in support of Senator \nKyl's amendment. A few years ago, Congress did something that was very \nhelpful to America. We voted to completely phase out the death tax. I \nthink we have discovered in the debate that this is not about just rich \npeople, it is about people who own small businesses and small farms. I \nhad a number of examples to give, but we are short on time. There is \none family that had a printing business for 97 years; they have already \npaid the death tax once. They are getting ready to pay it again. We \nhave the opportunity to change that.\n  Now that we have voted to phase this out, it is not fair that in \n2010, if a small business owner dies, that person can leave their \nfamily their entire business without any estate taxes; but if that same \nperson died in 2011, they could lose up to half their estate. We don't \nneed for this to happen. I certainly support Senator Kyl's compromise \nidea. But tomorrow I will call up amendment No. 576--I will not call it \nup today--which will completely eliminate the death tax for another 5 \nyears. So that what happens in 2010 will continue to 2015. I hope all \nmy colleagues will consider this and do the right thing for small \nbusinesses and farms.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, we had the same discussion yesterday \nwhen Senator Kyl made a very articulate argument as to why we as a \nCongress need to act, and this budget is a good opportunity to act, to \nget the death tax resolved in a way that will allow people to plan for \ntheir families and their businesses.\n  America is in a terrible spot. If you die New Year's Eve 2010, right \nnow, there is no estate tax liability for those who die on that day. If \nyou live until January 1, 2011, unless we act, the estate tax comes \nback in full force. That is an unconscionable place to put the American \npublic. Total repeal is apparently not possible. I would love to do \nthat.\n  Senator Kyl's proposal would allow us to buy some more time. He has \ntaken a Democratic proposal--about a $5 million exemption and a 35-\npercent top rate--to see if we can get the body to allow it within our \nbudget resolution to accommodate the extension of the death tax on \nthose terms.\n  My good friend from North Dakota, who is a joy to work with, is very \nconcerned about the debt, and he should be concerned about it. But when \nyou talk about the tax cuts and tax relief that we provided in the \ncapital gains area and dividends area, I would argue that the revenue \nbeing generated to this Government is on par with historical averages, \nthat the Government is not being deprived of revenue, that the tax cuts \nsince 2003 have helped keep this economy humming, and that we are \ngetting a lot of revenue because we cut taxes. And if we raise taxes or \nwe take the extenders off the table, which this budget will do unless \nwe change it, then we are going to cripple an economy that has created \na lot of jobs and make ourselves less competitive.\n\n  The death tax side is what kind of society we want. There has been a \nbudget submitted by the President that is balanced, that has an \nextension of the death tax--under OMB, I think it is $50 billion out of \nbalance 5 years from now--but you can accommodate these tax provisions \nand balance the budget.\n  I urge my colleagues, if we don't do this now before the end of this \nyear, sooner rather than later, let's see if we can come together as a \nbody to come up with a compromise on the death tax that will give \nAmericans the certainty they need when it comes to planning their \naffairs and come up with a compromise that will reward those who have \ndone well, who have worked hard, and they can leave their money behind \nto their families and their communities rather than it all be sent to \nWashington or a lot of it be sent to Washington and people they don't \nknow.\n  I think Senator Kyl's amendment is a great opportunity for this body \nto address a real problem, a growing problem, and that is the fact that \nno one in America can with certainty plan for their demise and take \ncare of their family because the Congress is refusing to act in a \nresponsible manner. This amendment will help solve that problem.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, the Senator has accurately described a \nsituation that makes no earthly sense with respect to the estate tax. \nThere is no death tax in America. There is none. There is an estate tax \nthat applies to estates of over a certain value. Right now, less than 1 \npercent of estates are affected. By the time we get to 2009, in\n\n[[Page S3581]]\n\nwhich the exemption level will rise to $3.5 million per person--so a \ncouple with $7 million in an estate, anything below $7 million will pay \nabsolutely nothing--it will be down to three-tenths of 1 percent of \nestates paying any tax.\n  Then we have this truly bizarre situation in which the next year, the \nestate tax is repealed in 2010, and then in 2011 it snaps back and the \nexemption, instead of the $3.5 million we had in 2009, falls to $1 \nmillion.\n  The amendment by Senator Baucus that was adopted yesterday prevents \nthe amount of the estate tax exemption from shrinking to $1 million per \nperson. He at least puts a floor and says it will not drop below the \n$3.5 million, and that $3.5 million will be adjusted for inflation.\n  He also had the extension of the middle-class tax cuts--the marriage \npenalty relief, the 10-percent bracket, the childcare credit. That left \nus with no money left in 2012.\n  The problem with the amendment that is now offered by our colleague \nfrom Arizona, Senator Kyl, is that it is not paid for. That is the \nproblem. It puts us back into deficit in 2012. Here we have spent all \nthis time and all this work digging out of the deficit ditch, and this \namendment puts us right back in, to the tune of about a $16 billion \ndeficit in 2012.\n  We have had speeches all week about how important it was to show some \nfiscal discipline and to stop deficit spending, to balance the books, \nto balance the budget. We are there. We have a budget now that is \nbalanced in 2012. But this amendment offered by Senator Kyl, as \nmeritorious as it may be in the eyes of some colleagues, as high a \npriority as they have said it is, wasn't a sufficiently high priority \nfor them to pay for it. It wasn't of enough importance for them to \noffer the offsets, whether it is spending offsets or revenue offsets, \nto cover the cost. The result is they have put us back into deficit in \n2012.\n  For that reason, I will strenuously oppose the Kyl amendment, and I \ngive notice to colleagues that, I am told, there will be an alternative \nto accomplish much the same purpose, but one that is paid for, and I \nunderstand that will be offered tomorrow when this amendment is voted \non.\n  We have had hours and hours of speeches on the floor about the need \nto address the fiscal condition of the country, about the need to first \nbalance the budget and then deal with the long-term entitlement \nchallenges.\n  Look, this is going the other way. This is going the other way. This \nis additional loss of tax revenue without any offset, without any \nreplacement, either in spending cuts or alternative revenue. So what it \ndoes is balloons the debt by over $30 billion and puts the budget of \n2012 back into deficit. That would be a mistake.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from Michigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I rise also to oppose this amendment. \nThe first point that comes to mind for me is, here they go again. I say \nthat with all due respect to my friend from Arizona. But we are seeing \nmore, as the Budget chairman has said, of the strategy that got us into \nthe hole that this budget is trying to dig us out of.\n  It is important to emphasize again what the Budget chairman has said. \nHere is what has happened in terms of numbers of estates that even \nqualified as taxable estates back in 2000. It was 50,000. It has \ndropped to 13,000, and as of 2009, it will be 7,000 estates in the \nentire country that will even qualify for this tax.\n  How much is that? We are talking about only .2 percent of estates, \n7,000. The Baucus amendment that we adopted yesterday says that for \nthose, it is not going to change. That number is not going to go back \nup. There will be a continuation of the current exemption level. So we \nare talking about .2 percent of the estates being taxed.\n  I think almost without exception--I can't speak for every colleague \non the Senate floor, but I know on this side of the aisle, colleagues \nare very sympathetic and support our family farmers. I have a lot of \nthem in my State, and I know you do, Madam President, in your State as \nwell, small businesses, family-owned businesses. They build up the \nbusiness, and they want to be able to pass that business on. With great \npride, the families are engaged and involved. We are not interested in \nseeing anybody lose their family farm or their family business. That is \nwhy we have supported extending the exemptions so that less than .2 \npercent of estates are taxed or eligible to be taxed.\n  Frankly, there have been some of us on this side of the aisle who \nhave had amendments over the years--I have cosponsored amendments--that \nwould exempt family-owned enterprises. If that is what people want to \ndo, I think there would be a lot of interest in doing something like \nthat.\n  But I think behind all the talk of our family farmers and small \nbusinesses is another picture of a few extremely wealthy families in \nthis country whose children or aunts, uncles, sisters, brothers--\nsomeone may benefit through an inheritance. They may have not \ncontributed at all to building that wealth and may never have to work a \nday in their life or contribute to this country. The question is, \nShould they have to contribute in some way with the only tax, for \ninstance, they might pay is the estate tax?\n  I see my time is coming to a close. I want to share one more chart. \nWhat we are concerned about, what I am concerned about, is the fact \nthat last year, the tax cuts that have already been given have already \ndisproportionately affected the very wealthy, the most blessed people \nin this country. Anyone earning more than $1 million a year last year, \nin 2006, had a tax cut of over $118,000, which is more than what the \naverage person in Michigan or anyone in this country makes in a year.\n  So what we are objecting to is this is not helping family farmers and \nsmall businesses. This is about a tax system and a series of tax cuts \nthat are out of whack that have created the situation where, if you are \nworking hard every day on that family farm, in that small business, or \nif you are working every day building great American automobiles, such \nas a lot of folks in my State, you didn't see any tax cut or not much \nof a tax cut. But if you are somebody who would benefit in that top .2 \npercent who gets the estate tax cut we are talking about, you are \nalready being given some pretty big gifts from the current tax system.\n  I urge a ``no'' vote.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, this budget proposal does not allow \nthe Senate to address the unfair burden of the death tax. By 2011, the \ntax will affect all farms and businesses worth more than $1 million at \na tax rate as high as 55 percent. In the State of Iowa alone, according \nto the USDA, we have more than 20,000 farms worth more then $1 million. \nThose families may be land rich, but they are cash poor, and they have \nto spend too much money today to plan on how to survive the unfair \ndeath tax. These are not big farms. With land prices today, you can \nhave as few as 350 acres in Iowa to have a million dollars in value.\n  If the Senate fails to put money in the budget today and we leave the \ndeath tax in place in its punitive form, our failure to amend this \nbudget will create the economic uncertainty that could dismantle our \nfarms and small businesses in rural America. I will be voting ``yes'' \non the Kyl amendment. It puts money in the budget. It is the \nresponsible thing to do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, if I may take 1 minute to make two quick \npoints. I note that the chart of the Senator from Michigan uses the \nfigures for the last year of the Bush tax cuts to show in the very best \nlight the impact of reductions of a number of estates that pay the \nestate tax. It is a fairly low number, a relatively low number, and it \nwill continue to be low if Republicans have their way.\n  Unfortunately, the next 2 years, years after which the Bush tax cuts \nexpire, in the year 2011, the number goes back up to 131,000 and in the \nyear 2015, according to the Joint Tax Committee, nearly 177,000 estates \nwill file estate tax returns.\n  The second point is that the bottom line is that the 1 year cited by \nthe Senator from Michigan does get down to a fairly low number because \nof the Republican tax cuts. Then they expire, and the number shoots \nback up.\n  The only other point I wish to make is our budget amendment is \ndesigned to accommodate a bill offered by the senior Senator from \nLouisiana which was\n\n[[Page S3582]]\n\nnot offset at all because those of us who support reform of the death \ntax appreciate its significance in the lives of Americans and the \npriority to eliminate or to reduce that tax.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, will my friend yield for a question?\n  Mr. KYL. I suspect I am out of time, but I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. CONRAD. What is the time situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona has 3 minutes 34 \nseconds.\n  Mr. KYL. Off your time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota has no time \nremaining.\n  Mr. CONRAD. No, no, no. Somehow the timekeeping is not correct. I \nthink the Senator had 1 minute remaining, which I think he has used.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I think that is correct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are looking at the time clocks. You both \nseem to agree, so that is fine.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, let me conclude on this matter.\n  First, I thank Senator Kyl. Second, let me make clear, the reason the \nestate tax is going to run out is because of the Bush tax cuts. The \nBush tax cuts, as passed by the Congress, led to this bizarre situation \nwhere it is a $3.5 million exemption in 2009, and then it is fully \nrepealed in 2010. Then it goes to $1 million a person in 2011. That was \nthe action of the Republican Congress in conjunction with the Bush \nadministration. They are the ones who created this problem.\n  We adopted, as part of this resolution, the Baucus amendment \nyesterday that will prevent in 2011 the exemption from falling to $1 \nmillion a person and will instead keep it at $3.5 million per person, \nwhich means $7 million for a couple can be shielded without paying any \ntaxes. That is indexed for inflation. So just in terms of who did what, \nthe fact is, the Republican Congress is the one that constructed this \nbizarre circumstance in which the estate tax is repealed in 2010 and \nthen comes back in 2011 with only $1 million per person shielded.\n\n  Let me conclude by saying this: Look, the problem with this \namendment, they say it is a priority, but they have no money to pay for \nit. The result is that we are faced with a circumstance in which it all \ngets added to the deficit and the debt.\n  We addressed this in the Baucus amendment yesterday, the problem with \nthe estate tax, but this amendment is not paid for. This amendment will \ntake us back into deficit in 2012.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I see that the Senator from Indiana is \non the Senate floor. He has the time at 4 p.m. under his control. I \nwish to thank the Senator from Indiana for his graciousness in \naccepting a change in the time. We had earlier told him he would be up \nfor 3 p.m., and he very graciously accepted this change to 4 p.m., \nwhich I appreciate very much.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAYH. Madam President, first, let me say to my colleague that I \nhave learned over the years that flexibility is an important attribute \naround the Senate. Punctuality is, on the other hand, too rare, so I am \nglad we could combine both today.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 526\n\n  Madam President, I call up amendment No. 526, and I ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Indiana [Mr. Bayh], for himself, and Ms. \n     Snowe, proposes an amendment numbered 526.\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: Makes permanent the tuition tax deduction and is fully offset \n   by closing a portion of the tax gap through enhanced information \n                        reporting requirements)\n\n       On page 3, line 11, decrease the amount by $120,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 12, decrease the amount by $776,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 13, decrease the amount by $178,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 14, increase the amount by $349,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 15, increase the amount by $742,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 20, decrease the amount by $120,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 21, decrease the amount by $776,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 22, decrease the amount by $178,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 23, increase the amount by $349,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 1, increase the amount by $742,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 24, increase the amount by $120,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 25, increase the amount by $776,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 1, increase the amount by $178,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 2, decrease the amount by $349,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 3, decrease the amount by $742,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 7, increase the amount by $120,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 8, increase the amount by $896,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 9, increase the amount by $1,074,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 10, increase the amount by $725,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 11, decrease the amount by $17,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 15, increase the amount by $120,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 16, increase the amount by $896,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 17, increase the amount by $1,074,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 18, increase the amount by $725,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 19, decrease the amount by $17,000,000.\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Madam President, as you and I have discussed just as \nrecently as today, the cost of a college education is an increasingly \nimportant challenge to middle-class families across Minnesota, Indiana, \nand the rest of our country. Unfortunately, it is a challenge that too \nmany families today cannot meet, but it is an important one that we \nequip them to meet.\n  For example, 80 percent of the new jobs that will be created over the \nnext decade are estimated to require some level of higher education. \nThe estimates also show us that a college graduate can expect to make \nfully 75 percent more than someone with only a high school diploma. Yet \nthe escalating cost of a college degree is putting it beyond the \nability of middle-class families to afford.\n  Just as an example, over the past 4 years alone the cost of a private \ncollege education has gone up 28 percent. Over that same period of \ntime, the cost of a 4-year public university has gone up 55 percent. \nRegrettably, this will, the estimates show, lead 4.4 million qualified \nstudents across our country to give up their dream of pursuing a \ncollege education. That is simply not right, and we need to do \nsomething about it. Today, we have that opportunity.\n  If we don't act, the college tuition deduction currently in place \nwill expire at the end of next year, making matters even worse than \nthey are today. We can't let that happen. We must act now. Congress \nacted so late last year to extend the college deduction another year \nthat the IRS was unable to include it on this year's tax forms, meaning \nthat possibly tens of thousands of American families and students who \nqualified for the credit will get out their tax form, not see it there, \nand not get the relief to which they are entitled. We have to do better \nthan that, and under our amendment we will.\n  Our amendment will make permanent the $4,000 deduction for college \ntuition and fees, and it is flexible, applying to both undergraduates, \n4-year institutions, as well as 2-year institutions. It is squarely \ntargeted at the middle class. Individuals making up to $65,000 a year \nand families making up to $130,000 a year will qualify for the full \n$4,000 deduction. Individuals making up to $80,000 a year and families \nmaking up to $160,000 a year will qualify for up to $2,000 in \nassistance.\n  It is also fully paid for. It will cost $5.6 billion over the next 5 \nyears, but it is offset by a variety of provisions to close the tax gap \nincluded in the President's budget. So it meets a pressing national \nneed facing our middle class, but it does so in a way that is fiscally \nresponsible.\n  In conclusion, at a time when too many of our middle class are asking \nwho in Washington speaks for them, at a time when they realize full \nwell that the wealthy can take care of themselves and that we have many \nprograms targeted to the less fortunate but nothing really targeted for \nthe middle class, this effort squarely meets a major challenge \nconfronting middle-\n\n[[Page S3583]]\n\nclass families and says to them that we speak for their concerns as \nwell.\n  At a time when too many of our citizens are saying that Washington is \nirrelevant, that there is too much political fighting and partisanship \nand procedural bickering, and all that kind of stuff, this is something \nthat speaks directly to one of their major concerns, and it is about \ntime we did something about it. Today, we have that opportunity.\n  I thank all those who have helped bring us to this moment. One of our \ncolleagues, Senator Schumer, has been a relentless champion of making \ncollege more affordable for middle-class families for many years now. \nWe wouldn't be here without his leadership. I thank also Senator Snowe, \nwho is the principal cosponsor of this legislation, and I know full \nwell of your personal concern about this as well, Madam President.\n  So Democrats and Republicans alike, this is something we can work on \ntogether, make the government relevant, help the middle class, and do \nit in a fiscally responsible way. I urge its adoption.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, what is the Senator's offset for this? As \nI understand it, it is money selected from the tax gap; is that \ncorrect?\n  Mr. BAYH. That is correct.\n  Mr. GREGG. Well, obviously, I agree with the Senator's initiative \nrelative to the education tax credit. That was in the original Bush tax \ncuts, which have done so much good for this economy and for people who \nhave benefitted from them, and tuition tax credits is a big part of \nthat benefit. People going to college are more readily able to afford \nit as a result of the President putting that in his plan, and I think \nwe should extend it.\n  I regret that the amendment we offered earlier, which did extend it, \nwas voted down, the Kyl amendment. The Senator has now come forward \nwith a rifle shot on this item. The tax gap is an illusory number. It \ndoesn't exist. We have already more than used it. It has sort of gotten \nto be like Customs fees around here, where a few years ago they just \nkept getting used over and over again.\n  As a practical matter, however, we are certainly going to be \nsupportive of this proposal, and if the Senator doesn't need a vote on \nit, we will take a voice vote.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I would inquire of the Senator, would he \nbe willing to take a voice vote?\n  Mr. BAYH. I would.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that we go to a \nvoice vote on the Bayh amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to amendment No. 526.\n  The amendment (No. 526) was agreed to.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. GREGG. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Indiana. I \nthank him for working with us to get this amendment worked out, and I \nwant to also thank my colleague, the ranking member of the committee, \nfor his cooperation once again.\n  We now are prepared to start voting, are we not?\n  Mr. GREGG. I was going to suggest, Madam President, that if the \nchairman was ready, we should start voting now. Why wait?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, let me note that we might need to get an \nagreement on how we proceed. However, I think we should put colleagues \non notice that very shortly we are going to start voting.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 545, as Modified\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Sanders \namendment, No. 545, be modified with the changes at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 3, line 11, increase the amount by $10,300,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 12, increase the amount by $14,600,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 13, increase the amount by $14,800,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 14, increase the amount by $4,500,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 20, increase the amouunt by \n     $10,300,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 21, increase the amount by $14,600,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 22, increase the amount by $14,800,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 23, increase the amount by $4,500,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 6, increase the amount by $10,300,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 7, increase the amount by $14,600,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 8, increase the amount by $14,800,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 9, increase the amount by $4,500,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 15, increase the amount by $10,300,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 16, increase the amount by $14,600,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 17, increase the amount by $14,800,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 18 increase the amount by $4,500,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 8, increase the amount by $14,800,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 9, increase the amount by $4,500,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 15, increase the amount by $10,300,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 16, increase the amount by $14,600,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 17, increase the amount by $14,800,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 18, increase the amount by $4,500,000,000.\n       On page 17, line 12, increase the amount by \n     $10,300,000,000.\n       On page 17, line 13, increase the amount by \n     $10,300,000,000.\n       On page 17, line 16, increase the amount by \n     $14,600,000,000.\n       On page 17, line 17, increase the amount by \n     $14,600,000,000.\n       On page 17, line 20, increase the amount by \n     $14,800,000,000.\n       On page 17, line 21, increase the amount by \n     $14,800,000,000.\n       On page 17, line 24, increase the amount by $4,500,000,000.\n       On page 17, line 25, increase the amount by $4,500,000,000.\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that we proceed \nto vote in relation to the following amendments in the order listed; \nthat there be 2 minutes equally divided prior to each vote; and that \nafter the first vote, time be limited to 10 minutes on each succeeding \nvote, with no second-degree amendments in order to any of the \namendments covered under this agreement, except where we might have a \nside-by-side, as indicated.\n  The first amendment would be the Hutchison amendment No. 517, as \nmodified; the second amendment would be the Ensign amendment No. 472; \nthe third amendment would be the Sanders amendment No. 545, as \nmodified; and the fourth amendment would be the Enzi amendment No. 497.\n  Mr. GREGG. Reserving the right to object, and I don't expect to \nobject, but I want to be sure Senator Hutchison has signed off on the \nmodification.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Chair hears none, and, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, let's do this. The Hutchison amendment \nwe don't have at the desk as modified, so we need to revise the \nunanimous consent to make the Ensign amendment No. 472 the first \namendment in the tranche to be voted on, then going to the Sanders \namendment, and then the Enzi amendment. Hopefully, momentarily, we will \nhave worked out getting the Hutchison amendment, as modified, to the \ndesk.\n  So that would mean we would first proceed to the Ensign amendment, \nand I notice that Senator Ensign is here.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the plan, as modified?\n  The Chair hears none, and it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 517, as Modified\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I have the modification to my \namendment, and I would send it to the desk and ask that it be the \nreplacement for my amendment.\n  Madam President, we can have a vote on my amendment or we can have a \nvoice vote, at the pleasure of the chairman.\n\n[[Page S3584]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. DEFICIT-NEUTRAL RESERVE FUND FOR EXTENSION OF THE \n                   DEDUCTION FOR STATE AND LOCAL SALES TAXES.\n\n       The Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee may revise the \n     aggregates, allocations, and other levels in this resolution \n     for a bill, joint resolution, motion, amendment, or \n     conference report that would provide for extension of the \n     deduction for State and local sales taxes, provided that such \n     legislation would not increase the deficit over the total of \n     fiscal years 2007 through 2012.\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I will modify the unanimous consent \nrequest so that we go immediately to the Hutchison amendment on a voice \nvote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to amendment No. 517.\n  The amendment (No. 517), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I would like to at this moment thank the \ngentlewoman from Texas for working with us to get this amendment \nmodified. It was very helpful to the work of the committee. We \nappreciate very much her cooperation.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I would say to the distinguished \nchairman that I appreciate his willingness to work with us. It is a \nvery important amendment to eight States in this country. Senator \nCantwell was very much a part of the whole negotiation, and I commend \nher and her staff for helping us to do this, and I appreciate the fact \nthat it has passed and is now a part of the budget. I would also like \nto thank the other cosponsors of this amendment, Senator Cornyn, \nSenator Enzi, Senator Murkowski, Senator Corker, Senator Alexander, and \nSenator Ensign.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I, too, thank Senator Cantwell. She was \nvery helpful to us in getting this so that we didn't have to have a \nvote and so the amendment could be adopted. I thank the two Senators.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 472\n\n  We now proceed to the Ensign amendment.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have been ordered. Is there \na sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Madam President, am I correct, there is 1 minute on each \nside?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. There is 1 minute on \neach side.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Madam President, very simply, this amendment is the same \nas the means testing on Part B. Part D of Medicare seniors never paid \nfor during their lifetime. This is a brand new entitlement, something \nthey never paid for. We are asking the younger workers to pay basically \nfor millionaires to be able to get prescription drugs. What my \namendment says is we should means test those so wealthier seniors will \nhave to pay more of their fair share for prescription drugs. That is \nvery simply what this amendment does.\n  I think 59 Senators voted before to make sure Part B was means \ntested--once again, a benefit they never paid for. This amendment does \nthe same thing for Medicare Part D. Let's not ask a schoolteacher or a \nfirefighter to pay for millionaires to have prescription drugs. Let's \ndo something fiscally responsible and call on the Finance Committee to \nenact this very important amendment to the prescription drug program.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, this amendment fails to distinguish \nbetween Part B premium and Part D. This amendment calls for means \ntesting Part D. What does that honestly mean? It will create massive \nconfusion among seniors. Why? The Government sets the Part B premium. \nThe private sector sets the Part D drug premium. There are 1,500 plans \nand each of them is different. Some premiums are a few dollars, some \nare $100.\n  You think seniors were confused with Part D when it first came out? \nThat is a picnic compared to the confusion this amendment is going to \ncreate. Think of all the confusion the seniors are going to have to \nface, trying to figure out is their premium means tested compared to \ntheir friends' premium next door? This is massively complex for \nseniors. There is so much confusion for seniors that the amendment \nshould not be agreed to.\n  I urge Senators to vote against this confusion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n472. The yeas and nays have been ordered and the clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The assistant journal clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Delaware (Mr. Biden) and \nthe Senator from South Dakota (Mr. Johnson) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. LOTT. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma (Mr. Inhofe) and the Senator from Arizona (Mr. McCain).\n  Further, if present and voting, the Senator from Oklahoma (Mr. \nInhofe) would have voted ``yea.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 44, nays 52, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 93 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--44\n\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burr\n     Chambliss\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Corker\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeMint\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Isakson\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Martinez\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Roberts\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Thomas\n     Thune\n     Vitter\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--52\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Brown\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Cardin\n     Carper\n     Casey\n     Clinton\n     Conrad\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Harkin\n     Inouye\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Klobuchar\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     McCaskill\n     Menendez\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Obama\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Salazar\n     Sanders\n     Schumer\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Tester\n     Webb\n     Whitehouse\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--4\n\n     Biden\n     Inhofe\n     Johnson\n     McCain\n  The amendment (No. 472) was rejected.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 545, as Modified\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided on amendment No. 545, as modified.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, in 1975, Congress made a promise to \nprovide 40 percent of the funding for special education. Congress has \nnot kept that promise on that unfunded mandate. Today, we are providing \na little over 17 percent of the costs of special education, and that \npercentage has gone down over the last 3 years. The result is higher \nand higher property taxes for the middle-class and working families of \nour country.\n  This amendment is very simple. It rescinds the 2001 personal income \ntax reduction that was given to people with at least $1 million in \nincome--the wealthiest three-tenths of 1 percent of the population--and \nputs the $44 billion raised over 5 years into special education.\n  Madam President, 99.7 percent of Americans would see no increase in \ntheir Federal taxes from this amendment. But it would lower property \ntaxes for millions of middle-class and working families, improve the \nquality of education and, most importantly, keep the promise made to \nschool districts all over this country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, in a bill which is already a big-\nspending, big-tax bill, this would supersize the tax element of the \nbill. This is sort of like when you go into McDonald's, you\n\n[[Page S3585]]\n\ncan order a regular, a large, or a super size. This is a supersized tax \nincrease, $44 billion of new taxes, and 83 percent of the people who \nare going to pay it are small businesspeople, small businesspeople \nacross this country.\n  We have done a great--not a great job; we have done a strong job in \nthe area of IDEA. This administration has had larger increases in IDEA \nspending than any administration in history, dramatic increases. We \nstill need to go further, but you do not go further by increasing taxes \nby $44 billion on America's workers.\n  I hope we will vote down this amendment.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 545, as modified.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered, and the clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 497\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided on amendment No. 497.\n  The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, my amendment is very simple. It \nestablishes a 60-vote threshold for legislation that imposes an \nunfunded mandate on small businesses which exceeds $131 million, as \ndetermined by the Small Business Administration.\n  We do it for municipalities. We do it for States. We do it for \ntribes. We do not do it for small businesses. Small businesses make up \n99.7 percent of all U.S. employers and employ 50 percent of the \nNation's nonfarm private sector workers. We have an obligation to make \nsure laws written in Washington do not unfairly burden Main Street.\n  Now, checking back, I found that bills that adversely affect small \nbusiness usually get hung up on cloture, which is a form of point of \norder but a very lengthy one. The ones that take care of small business \nfrequently get a huge vote.\n  Now, it is possible to mention there will be things coming up, such \nas mental health parity--I am a cosponsor on that one; I can assure you \nthat is one where small business will not be given a bad deal--the \nDepartment of Defense. We can override any waiver. In this body, it \ntakes 60 votes to do cloture. This will speed up the process.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, this amendment is absolutely well \nintended, but it will create unintended consequences. This will give \nthe Budget Committee authority over nonbudgetary matters. This \namendment, if it were adopted, would create a supermajority point of \norder against Senator Domenici's mental health parity bill. It would \ngive a supermajority point of order against the Defense authorization \nbill. It would give a supermajority point of order against the minimum \nwage bill, against bankruptcy reform, against pension reform.\n  This amendment should not be adopted. I urge my colleagues to vote \nno.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, do I have time remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 497.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant journal clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, the amendment I am offering will bring \nsome transparency--\n  Mr. GREGG. Could we get order, Mr. President?\n\n[[Page S3586]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. May we have order in the Senate, please.\n  The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. The amendment will bring transparency and discipline, but \nnot order, to this budget process. The budget resolution is supposed to \nprovide a blueprint for Government spending and allocate dollars for \nappropriators to spend in particular areas. However, this budget goes \naway from that responsibility in a number of areas and fails to even \nset up a cap for overall spending. It does so by including a number of \nunlimited reserve funds that amount to no more than a blank check \nsigned by the American taxpayer. There is no end to what can be spent.\n  My amendment would strike these reserve funds from the budget. We owe \nit to the American people to give them a budget that means something, \nthat let's them know up front how much we are spending and how we are \ngoing to pay for it. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, there are no blank checks here. Reserve \nfunds simply say that the committee of jurisdiction has to report a \nbill, and they have to pay for it. Nothing happens unless the committee \nreports and unless they pay for it.\n  Now, this amendment would knock out every reserve fund--every one \nthat has been put in by Republican Senators, every one that has been \nput in on this side. It would knock out the reserve fund for SCHIP, \nchildren's health care. It would strike the reserve fund for veterans. \nIt would strike the reserve funds for tax relief, for education, for \nenergy, for the farm bill, for Medicare, for housing, for childcare, \nfor mental health parity. It would knock out Senator Cornyn's reserve \nfund for immigration, and on and on.\n  I urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I would have preferred not to have to \noffer this amendment, but Senator Coleman has an amendment that would \nextend several energy tax incentives, including the clean, renewable \nenergy bond program, and tax incentives for energy-efficient buildings \nand powerplants.\n  I am in entire agreement with the Senator on that matter. The problem \nis, he has paid for it out of section 920, and the 920 pool of money is \nabout evaporated. So the effect of his amendment would be to cut \nveterans, homeland security, and law enforcement; and I can assure \ncolleagues that will be dropped in conference if it is adopted here.\n  Instead, to try to accomplish the goal, I have offered those same \nprovisions, paid for by a deficit-neutral reserve fund. That gives the \ncommittees of jurisdiction the widest latitude to pay for the \ninitiatives that are deserving and important.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 598\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. I send the amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nset aside.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota (Mr. Conrad) proposes an \n     amendment numbered 598.\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To create a deficit-neutral reserve fund for extending \n                     certain energy tax incentives)\n\n       At the end of title III, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. DEFICIT-NEUTRAL RESERVE FUND FOR EXTENSION OF \n                   CERTAIN ENERGY TAX INCENTIVES.\n\n       The Chairman of the Senate Committee on the Budget may \n     revise the aggregates, allocations, and other levels in this \n     resolution for a bill, joint resolution, motion, amendment, \n     or conference report that would extend through 2015 energy \n     tax incentives, including the production tax credit for \n     electricity produced from renewable resources, the Clean \n     Renewable Energy Bond program, and the provisions to \n     encourage energy efficient buildings, products and power \n     plants, provided that such legislation would not increase the \n     deficit over the total of fiscal years 2007 through 2012.\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. The Senator from Minnesota has a minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, we agree on the goals. We need clean \nenergy. We need clean energy. We need renewable energy, wind energy, \nbiomass, and geothermal. The problem is, with the reserve fund there is \nno certainty. You cannot take the reserve fund to the bank. That would \nonly say if we find offsets in the future to make the extension, we can \ndo that. It is as if I give you $15, and if you find $15 for me some \nday, you can pay me. If you want the projects to go forth and you \nbelieve in wind and biomass and other renewables and you want them to \nbe financed, you need certainty. The 920 fund can provide you the \ncertainty.\n  This doesn't move the ball forward. We are still at ground zero. If \nyou believe in renewables and clean energy, I urge you to vote against \nthis and support my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I wish my colleague was right. The 920 \noffset is a fantasy. This will never survive conference because the 920 \npool is gone.\n  I urge colleagues to vote for the first amendment, the Conrad \namendment, that provides a funding mechanism that will survive \nconference.\n  I ask unanimous consent that we go to the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. What was the manager's request?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I was asking that we pay for these very worthwhile \ninitiatives with a deficit-neutral reserve fund instead of using \nsection 920.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I heard all of that, and I know what the Senator from \nMinnesota is trying to do because I encouraged him to do it. Rather \nthan let him lose by making a mistake, I wonder if we could look at the \namendment of the Senator from North Dakota. I looked at it, and I \ndidn't see a reserve fund. Can we take 1 minute and look at it? I would \nlike to encourage Senator Coleman to accept the Senator's proposal.\n\n[[Page S3587]]\n\n  Can the Senator from North Dakota tell me again what he thinks he \ndid?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Yes. What I have done is I have tried to convince my \ncolleague--we absolutely share the same goal.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. What I have done is offered a deficit-neutral reserve \nfund that gives the committees the greatest latitude to actually fund \nit. Mr. President, 920, which is his offset, is oversubscribed, and if \nwe go to conference with it, we will be dropped like a hot rock.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I note that there are 235 reserve funds \nin this budget with over $200 billion over 5 years. The problem is, \nagain, if we believe in getting this done, and we adopt it with the \nreserve fund, there is no way we can go to the bank and say we are \ngoing to have this because it is simply a promise without anything.\n  The reality of the 920 can give certainty if we can get it through \nconference. Let's fight for it in conference. Let's not do anything \nthat has no effect.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, let's be clear. What 920 means is that we \nwill cut veterans, we will cut homeland security, we will cut law \nenforcement. That is a losing proposition for us, I say to my \ncolleague, especially given the fact that we are already at over $7.5 \nbillion a year in section 920. The President, when he identified the \npossibilities, only identified $7.5 billion available. That is the \nmoney that has already been used.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote yes on the Conrad amendment so we can \nfund these important priorities.\n  I urge we go to the vote. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 598. The clerk will call \nthe roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there now be 2 \nminutes equally divided, that we go to the vote, and that the yeas and \nnays be deemed ordered on the Coleman amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  There are 2 minutes of debate equally divided.\n  The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, if you voted for the Conrad amendment \nbefore, if you believe in wind energy and biomass and renewables, then \nyou should vote for my amendment. The argument of the Senator from \nNorth Dakota is this will never make it out of conference committee, \nbut that is not an argument against what we are trying to do. So let's \nput that to the test.\n  If you believe this is the right policy and you want to tell those \nfolks who want to do wind energy and who want to do biomass that you \nare going to support them, you should support my amendment.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I thank Senator Coleman for offering this \namendment because it is critical that the Federal budget prioritizes \nthe energy policy initiatives that are working for our Nation.\n  This amendment would include budget authority for the extension of \nthe tax incentives for energy efficient commercial buildings, which has \nbeen estimated that by 2010 will save 7 trillion cubic feet, Tcf, of \nnatural gas. To put this figure in context, the United States imported \n4.3 Tcf of natural gas in 2005.\n  Furthermore, we must recognize that investments into commercial and \nresidential buildings provides cost savings for decades. The life of an \naverage American vehicle is roughly 12 years, for commercial buildings \nthe estimated lifetime is 75 years and for residential buildings the \nlifetime is 100 years. It is vital that we encourage the investment \ninto energy efficiency for these buildings in order to receive the \naggregate energy savings.\n  Recently, Senator Kerry and I, as chair and ranking member of the \nSenate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, heard small \nbusiness representatives articulate the success of these incentives. \nHowever, it is clear that businesses need sufficient lead time to make \nthese investments, reduce risk, and ensure that businesses adopt the \nmost energy efficient infrastructure. This budget must affirm and \nreflect upon the fact that energy efficiency is the most cost-effective \nsolution to our energy crisis. As the former Assistant Secretary for \nEnergy and Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy and current director \nof Google's Climate Change and Energy Initiatives, Dan Reicher, stated \nto the Finance Committee last month, ``Energy Efficiency is the real \nlow-hanging fruit in the U.S. and global economy.\n  Furthermore, I am encouraged that this amendment would include a 5-\nyear extension for the renewable production tax credit. On December 14, \n2006, I joined Senators Bingaman and Domenici and 39 other Senators, in \nwriting the President to request that he include a 5-year extension of \nthe renewable energy production tax credit, PTC, for 5 years. The \ncurrent PTC is due to expire on December 31, 2008, and this does not \nallow renewable energy businesses to adequately prepare for the long-\nterm. This problem was analyzed in a special report in the Economist, \nwhich stated that ``America's incentives for clean energy'' are \n``relatively modest compared to Europe's.'' Furthermore, the article \nillustrates that ``what one politician can mandate, another can \nterminate--and therein lies one of the biggest risks for clean energy. \nAmerican politicians have periodically allowed a tax break for wind \ngeneration to expire, for example. This caused the industry to falter \nseveral times, before the credit was renewed again.''\n  This country must make a long-term commitment to energy policies that \nare effective. I am pleased to support this amendment.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, all those who voted ``yes'' on the Conrad \namendment should now vote ``no'' on the Coleman amendment, since we \nhave funded it and done it in the right way.\n  The Coleman amendment would fund these priorities by cutting \nveterans, by cutting homeland security, by cutting law enforcement. You \nbetter vote ``no'' on the Coleman amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n577.

The speaking order on our side, and we are \npresuming this is going to start about 6:30, will be a half hour on our \nside, then a half hour to the majority, then a half hour to our side, \nand then the majority, back and forth. The people we expect to speak \nare in this order: Senator Specter, as soon as we start, and Senator \nDomenici after Senator Specter. Then, after the majority response or \nperiod, it will be Senator Hatch, probably around 7:30, and then a \ncombination of Senator Murkowski and Senator Allard around 7:45. Then \nthe majority position. Then it will be Senator Chambliss and a group \naround 8:30; Senator Brownback around 9:30, and Senator Voinovich \naround 9:45. All those times may move up depending on what happens, \nwith Members either coming or going or not showing up, but that is the \npresent lineup.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, because we are now 20 minutes past the \ntime we anticipated being able to start the discussions and the debate, \nobviously everything is moved back 20 minutes. Previously, the GOP time \nwas to run from 6 to 6:30. That will need to now run from about 6:25 to \n6:55. That will be the time in which our side would start. First will \nbe Senator Menendez, then Senator Salazar, and then Senator Durbin, \neach one of them for 10 minutes. Then we will go back to the Republican \nside. Then we will come back to our side at roughly 8 o'clock with \nSenator Lieberman and Senator Casey.\n  I hope it is recognized that if Senators who have time are not here \nand there are other Senators who are here, that will be worked out and \nthe Senators who are available will go ahead and use the time and be \nreasonable with others so we can accommodate as many Senators as \npossible this evening.\n  The other important thing to say is, tomorrow morning we are going to \nstart at 9 o'clock. We will have a half hour equally divided between \nSenator Gregg and myself. Then we will start voting at 9:30. That is \ngoing to be a series of 10-minute votes after the first one. In \naddition to that, we need to indicate to Members, there are 75 votes \npending. We can do about 3 votes an hour. That means 25 hours of \nvoting. If everyone insists on their amendment, we will be here until 9 \no'clock the next morning. That is the reality. Senators can decide \ntheir own fate. If every Senator insists on every amendment they have \nnoticed, that is 75 amendments, we will be voting for 25 straight \nhours. I hope colleagues understand the consequences.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I wish to reinforce the point made by the \nchairman, which is there has to be reason in this process. We have been \nthrough these vote-athons before. We know they tend to be a little \nchaotic. Quite honestly, there are a lot of people who come in late \nwith ideas that are good ideas, but let's be reasonable and make sure \nthere is an orderly process, and let's cut this list down to something \nthat is manageable so we can all get back to our districts or our homes \nand enjoy the weekend with our families.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 506\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to discuss \nbriefly two amendments to the budget resolution. The first amendment, \nwhich I offer on behalf of Senator Harkin and myself, relates to \nfunding for the National Institutes of Health. The NIH has undertaken \nmiraculous research which has led to breakthroughs on many maladies \nconfronting this country and which benefit the world. Dr. Zerhouni \ntestified on Monday of this week and brought forth statistics showing \nthere has actually been a decrease in cancer in the last 2 years, a \ndecrease in heart disease, and a decrease in strokes. We could go \nthrough the long list of ailments where the NIH research has been \noverwhelmingly successful.\n  I ask unanimous consent at the conclusion of my comments that the \nlist of the diseases be printed in the Congressional Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SPECTER. The budget constraints have led to a cut in NIH funding \nin recent years. The proposed budget by the administration would cut \nNIH funding by more than $500 million. In one of the recent budget \ncuts, the National Cancer Institute, illustratively, was cut by some \n$50 million.\n  In 1970, President Nixon declared war on cancer and, had that war \nbeen prosecuted with the same intensity as our other wars, cancer would \nhave been cured.\n  My chief of staff, Carey Lackman, a beautiful young woman of 48, died \nof breast cancer. One of my best friends, a very distinguished Federal \njudge, Edward Becker, of Philadelphia, chief judge emeritus, died \nwithin the year of prostate cancer.\n  As is fairly well known, I suffer from Hodgkin's. I made a good \nrecovery. All the tests are said to be symptom free. But I was for \nincreasing NIH funding long before I had a personal problem. I have \nbeen on the Appropriations Subcommittee of Labor, Health and Human \nServices, and Education since I was elected to the Senate in 1980 and \nhave had the opportunity to chair the subcommittee. With the leadership \nof Senator Harkin and myself, NIH funding has been increased from some \n$12 billion to almost $30 billion.\n  We are offering this amendment simply to restore NIH funding to where \nit would have been had there been an accommodation for biomedical \ninflation. The cuts have been tremendous, but we have restored the 4.5-\npercent biomedical inflation rate for fiscal year 2006, which costs \n$1.3 billion; for fiscal year 2007, which costs $1.1 billion; for \nfiscal year 2008, which costs another $1.1 billion.\n  We also provide increases for the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention and restored health professional training programs for \nnurses and doctors to the 2005 level.\n  This, in the aggregate, when reduced by the assumption for health \ncare programs in the budget resolution, comes to an increase in funding \nof $2.183 billion.\n\n[[Page S3589]]\n\n  I ask unanimous consent this schedule be printed at the conclusion of \nmy remarks, along with the chronology of funding amendments offered on \nthe increase of NIH funding.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. SPECTER. I would say that this is absolutely minimal to not fall \nbackward. Earlier this week, in addition to Dr. Zerhouni's testimony, \nwe heard testimony from research applicants, and they are falling off. \nWe are losing the best and the brightest of the talent. So this is \nminimal, just to tread water.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 505\n\n  I now turn to a second amendment which I propose to offer, and that \nis an amendment which deals with legislation to reform asbestos \nlitigation. There have been efforts made to deal with the avalanche of \nasbestos injury cases, with the attendant bankruptcies and with tens of \nthousands of people left unable to collect for very serious, sometimes \ndeadly, injuries because companies have gone into bankruptcy.\n  On a number of occasions, the Supreme Court of the United States has \nurged Congress to deal with this problem. In the 109th Congress, the \nJudiciary Committee undertook an enormous job, reported out a \ncomprehensive reform bill after many hearings and complicated markups--\nall of that is part of the record, which I will not repeat now.\n  In the intervening period of time, $140 billion that had been \navailable for a trust fund has been reduced very substantially by the \nformation of bankruptcy trusts. So we are now compelled to recast the \nlegislation. We are now looking at a reduced trust fund, and we are \nlooking at dealing only with victims of mesothelioma, which is a deadly \nailment.\n  Last year, notwithstanding the humongous effort of the Committee, \nasbestos legislation was defeated on a technical point of order \nrequiring 60 votes. We got 59. Senator Inouye had stated he was going \nto vote with us, but his wife was ill, and we did not survive the \nchallenge on the budget point of order.\n  The very heavy, crowded calendar precluded our being able to bring it \nup again. This year we have offered an amendment to the budget \nresolution which would establish a reserve fund for asbestos \nlegislation, eliminating a point of order under section 302 of the \nBudget Act. And we have restructured the legislation to make it \nironclad that the Federal Government will not have to pay anything \nbecause we are creating a fund, which we did not do last year, so that \nthe only money contributed will be from the trust fund.\n  That trust fund is established by the manufacturers who are \ninterested in avoiding the crush of litigation and the attendant costs. \nWe have found that the so-called transaction costs, attorneys' fees, \namount to about 58 cents on the dollar, and only 42 cents are going to \npeople who are injured.\n  We have restructured the bill to defer cases where people do not have \ntangible damages, and we are looking at those with mesothelioma. We are \ndealing with an award--without a showing of liability, simply the \ndamages of mesothelioma--of $1,100,000, an amount that was established \nlast year after considerable negotiation, and I think it is fair to say \nit has been accepted as a reasonable figure.\n  So that what will be presented to the body--I am hopeful we can yet \nwork this out. We have gotten consent from staff on one side of the \naisle, we are working with staff on the other side of the aisle, and we \nthink we have answered conclusively the concerns that were raised.\n  Senator Leahy was a cosponsor last year when I was chairman and he \nwas ranking. He is the chairman of Judiciary now and has agreed to be a \ncosponsor as we move this bill forward. So I think we have the votes to \nget this resolved, but doubtless there will be a necessity for a \ncloture vote. We are going to have to get 60 votes to carry this bill \nforward.\n  What I am looking for, what the sponsors are looking for, is not \nhaving so many hurdles that it becomes a practical impossibility to \nhave the Senate consider this issue on the merits. But we are long past \ndue, having been tangling with this issue for some 25 years. \nLegislation was defeated last year on a technicality. I hope we can \neliminate the technicalities this year, and the amendment will address \none. Then we will face the 60-vote threshold on cloture.\n  We will seek to structure a bill that will meet with the approval of \nthe Senate and the House of Representatives.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                Diseases\n\n     Aids\n     Autism\n     Stroke\n     Obesity\n     Alzheimer's\n     Parkinson's\n     Spinal Muscular Atrophy\n     Scleroderma\n     ALS\n     Muscular Dystrophy\n     Diabetes\n     Osteoporosis\n     Cancers:\n       Breast, Cervical and Ovarian\n       Lymphoma\n       Multiple Myeloma\n       Prostate\n       Pancreatic\n       Colon\n       Head and Neck\n       Brain\n       Lung\n       Mesothelioma\n     Pediatric Renal Disorders\n     Multiple Sclerosis\n     Deafness and Other Communication Disorders\n     Glaucoma\n     Macular Degeneration\n     Sickle Cell Anemia\n     Heart Disease\n     Spinal Cord Injury\n     Sudden Infant Death Syndrome\n     Arthritis\n     Schizophrenia and Other Mental Disorders\n     Polycystic Kidney Disease\n     Hepatitis\n     Cooley's Anemia\n     Primary Immune Deficiency Disorders\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n\n                    Budget Amendment Talking Points\n\n       Your amendment: Would add $2.2 billion to Function 550--\n     Health--for increases in NIH, CDC and Health Professions \n     Training Programs. This increase would be offset by an \n     across-the-board cut of 0.23 percent.\n       Budget Resolution: The budget resolution assumes the FY'07 \n     funding level for NIH and provides an unspecified $1.637 \n     billion increase for all health programs.\n       Amendment assumptions:\n       NIH increases required: to restore NIH plus FY'06 \n     biomedical inflation--4.5%, $1.3 billion; to restore NIH plus \n     FY'07 biomedical inflation--3.7%, $1.1 billion; to restore \n     NIH plus FY'08 biomedical inflation--3.7%, $1.1 billion.\n       NIH funding: $28,948,845,000--FY'07 comparable \n     appropriation; $28,948,845,000--Budget resolution assumption \n     for the NIH or the same as the FY'07 amount; \n     $32,448,845,000--FY'08 with your amendment, +$3.5 billion \n     over the FY'07 comparable appropriation.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                    Over previous\n                             Year                                Appropriation       fiscal year      Percentage\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1995.........................................................    $11,299,522,000       $362,000,000\n1996.........................................................     11,927,562,000        628,040,000          5.6\n1997.........................................................     12,740,843,000        813,281,000          6.8\n1998.........................................................     13,674,843,000        934,000,000          7.3\n1999.........................................................     15,629,156,000      1,954,313,000         14.3\n2000.........................................................     17,820,587,000      2,191,431,000         14.0\n2001.........................................................     20,458,130,000      2,637,543,000         14.8\n2002.........................................................     23,296,382,000      2,838,252,000         13.9\n2003.........................................................     27,066,782,000      3,770,400,000         16.2\n2004.........................................................     27,887,512,000        820,730,000          3.0\n2005.........................................................     28,495,157,000        607,645,000          2.2\n2006.........................................................     28,311,848,000       -183,309,000         -0.6\n2007.........................................................     28,948,845,000       -636,997,000          2.2\n2008.........................................................\nRequest......................................................     28,621,241,000       -327,604,000         -1.1\nBudget Res...................................................     28,948,845,000                  0            0\nAmended......................................................     32,448,845,000     +3.500 billion           12\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n                        Sequence on NIH Funding\n\n       In 1981, NIH funding was less than $3.6 billion. For FY04, \n     NIH funding totals $28 billion.\n       A substantial investment in the NIH is crucial to continue \n     the progress we have made over the last several years to turn \n     our investment into cures for diseases over the next decade. \n     We have seen innumerable breakthroughs in the knowledge of \n     and treatment for diseases such as cancer, Alzheimer's \n     disease, Parkinson's disease, severe mental illnesses, \n     diabetes, osteoporosis, heart disease, and many others.\n       In FY'98, you and Sen. Harkin sought to add $1.1 billion to \n     the health function during the Budget Resolution. The \n     amendment was defeated 63-37. Despite this, you were able to \n     provide a $1 billion increase for the NIH in FY98.\n       In FY'99, you and Sen. Harkin again offered an amendment to \n     the Budget Resolution to add $2 billion to the health \n     function. The amendment was again defeated, this time by a \n     vote of 57-41. But, you still provided an additional $2 \n     billion to the NIH for FY99, which at the time was the \n     largest increase in history.\n       In FY'00, you and Sen. Harkin offered an amendment to the \n     Budget Resolution to add $1.4 billion to the health function, \n     over and above the $600 million increase which had already \n     been provided by the Budget Committee. The amendment was \n     defeated by a vote of 47-52.\n       In FY'01, you and Senator Harkin offered an amendment to \n     the Budget Resolution to add $1.6 billion to the health \n     function. This amendment passed by a vote of 55-45. This \n     victory brought the NIH increase to $2.7 billion for FY'01. \n     However, after late night negotiations with the House, the \n     funding for\n\n[[Page S3590]]\n\n     NIH was cut by $200 million below that amount, bringing the \n     total increase to $2.5 billion.\n       In FY'02, you and Senator Harkin, along with nine other \n     Senators offered an amendment to add an additional $700 \n     million to the resolution to achieve your goal of doubling. \n     The vote was 96-4. The Senate Labor-HHS Subcommittee reported \n     a bill recommending $23.7 billion, an increase of $3.4 \n     billion over the previous year's funding. But during \n     conference negotiations with the House, we fell short of that \n     amount by $410 million.\n       The FY'03 omnibus appropriations bill contained an increase \n     of $3.7 billion, which achieved your doubling effort.\n       In FY'04, you and Senator Harkin offered an amendment to \n     the budget resolution to add $2.8 billion in additional \n     funding for Public Health Service programs as follows: $1.8 \n     billion for NIH, $600 million for CDC, and $400 million for \n     the Health Resources and Services Administration. The vote \n     was 97-1.\n       On September 10, 2003, during floor debate on the Labor-HHS \n     bill, you and Senators Harkin and Feinstein offered an \n     amendment to the FY04 Labor-HHS bill to provide a $2.5 \n     billion increase for the NIH. The amendment was defeated by a \n     vote of 52-43--the amendment required 60 votes because the \n     increase was designated as an emergency. The final conference \n     agreement contained $27.9 billion for NIH, an increase of $1 \n     billion over the FY'03 appropriation.\n       In FY'05, you, Senator Harkin, and Senator Collins offered \n     an amendment to the budget resolution to add $2,000,000,000 \n     to discretionary health spending, including NIH--the \n     amendment passed 72-24. The final conference agreement for \n     NIH included $28.6 billion, an increase of $800 million.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I might say to the distinguished Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania, little did I know when I agreed tonight to switch \nplaces and follow him, instead of the reverse order, that I would hear \nabout, once again, this never-ending litigation that is once again \nbrought to the Senate floor by the distinguished Senator from \nPennsylvania. What a distinguished stalwart you are, Senator.\n  Never give up. Never say no. Never say die. Just keep on keeping on. \nSure enough, even the big, giant elk fall. That is what they talk about \nin the forest, as they look out there among the great pines and the \ngreat big, giant elk, that sooner or later the tree will fall and the \nelk will fall.\n  Frankly, I do not know of anybody better than you to say, if you are \nafter them, you will get them, whatever it is. In this case, I listened \nto you, like I have listened and expressed willingness last time, with \nno interest, no big interest in my State to give you a Senator on your \nside, by saying I want to be part of trying to get this solved. I await \nyour presentation to us, to have an opportunity to see if we can sign \nup now.\n  Having said that, Senator Specter, I am going to speak for a very few \nminutes about this budget that is before us. I had kind of sworn I \nwould not get involved very much in budget activities on the floor. I \nthink you probably, as much as anyone, have noticed a real lack of--or \nan absence of--Domenici verbiage on budgets. Because I have done it for \nso many years, I decided others ought to take over and take charge, and \nthey would have plenty without me having to stick myself in the middle \nof it.\n  But I did think, if I were going to look at this year at what \nhappened, what is the difference between the Democrats and Republicans \nbeing in control, which is essentially what everybody ought to know is \nthe big difference. And then you ought to say: Well, what difference is \nthere in the budget because the Democrats took over? And it is their \nbudget, there is no doubt about it.\n  They may claim they did not inherit what is in this budget, but the \ntruth of the matter is, they are going to fix it, if it is going to be \nfixed. They are not going to do nothing, they are going to try to do \nsomething. You are going to look and see what it is they tried to do, \nand from that you are going to have to try to draw some conclusions.\n  So it is a very difficult time to put a budget together. I do not \nstand here tonight as a superpolitical critiquer or criticizer of the \nDemocrats who are trying to put this together. But I do think, from \ntime to time, it is important that somebody like me who has been \nthrough this for about 25 years--I think that is about the minimal that \nI was involved in putting budgets together--and during much of that \ntime I was either ranking or chairman having to put it together and \nlearn about it.\n  I believe we must continue to look at things and expose and express, \nwhich is what I am doing. I am not being critical, I am exposing and \nexpressing what I see vis a vis what the leadership on the other side \nhas claimed they have done.\n  I believe we must continue to protect the middle class. The middle-\nclass working families must have our help and our protection. They are \nthe backbone of our country. It is the middle class that distinguishes \nAmerica from all other democracies, and that is why we are able to \nremain so strong as a living democracy, is because we have such a \nlarge, powerful majority of Americans who belong to the middle class, \nthe middle-class working families.\n  Unfortunately, the budget we are presented this year will do very \nlittle for the hard-working middle class. The budget we are presented \ndoes little for the hard-working middle class. If enacted, the budget \nwould allow tax breaks that we gave to the middle class to expire, \ncausing an enormous tax burden to be placed on these families.\n  You do not have to do much, if you have tax cuts that are running \nalong and the tax cuts are going to expire. Then all you have to do is \nnot extend them and sometime later on the taxpayers are going to find \nout that their taxes are different because, in fact, what had happened \nto them under the tax structure before will not happen to them come the \nend of the tax year.\n  If enacted, the budget would allow the tax breaks we gave to the \nmiddle class to expire, causing an enormous tax burden to be placed on \nthese families. Simply put, the budget increases taxes on the middle \nclass. I realize we made a step in the right direction by adopting the \nBaucus amendment yesterday. That was planned by the majority that it \ntake place in that way.\n  He offered a tax amendment, and I was happy to vote in favor of that, \nwhich permanently extended the tax relief for the 10-percent tax \nbrackets and extended the child tax credit, the adoption credit and \ndependent care credit and the marriage penalty relief.\n  However, there is still a great deal of work left to be accomplished. \nWhile we have provided tax relief for the lowest brackets, we have not \naddressed the middle class, which faces a tax increase and a loss of \nsome substantial deductions such as the education tuition deduction.\n  The budget does not extend the capital gains tax and the dividend tax \nrelief. If we do not extend the capital gains deduction, we will be \ncreating a dangerous situation that may prevent the economy from \nprogressing. This might be a very good test of whether those kinds of \ntaxes, capital gains and dividends tax relief, have anything positive \nto do with the economy.\n  Obviously, so far in this process it is obvious that the other side \nis not going to do anything to extend those taxes, which many think \nwere very important to the continuation of the growth at a steady pace \nfor part of the last 5 years. If we do not extend the capital gains \nreduction, we will be creating a dangerous situation that may prevent \nthe economy from progressing in a normal manner.\n  I am not predicting that. I learned a long time ago not to predict \ntoo much because I predicted how bad things would turn out when certain \ntaxes were changed, and it didn't happen at all.\n  But I do believe there is too big a change in this budget resolution \nthat it will not have any effect upon the taxpayers of the United \nStates and ultimately on the economy and on the growth of the economy.\n  Business owners need certainty so they can focus on long-term \nplanning instead of shooting from the hip on a yearly basis. If we do \nnot extend the capital gains relief, we are putting America's business \nin the position I have described. One can clearly see that on a \nnational level, the middle class stands to lose the most under this \nproposal. In New Mexico, the impact of repealing the current tax relief \nwould be felt widely by the middle class. More than 93,000 New Mexico \ninvestors, including senior citizens, would pay more because of an \nincrease in the tax rates on capital gains and dividends.\n  I am also sorry to say that this budget resolution does not \nthoroughly address the alternative minimum tax. I am sure the proponent \nof the budget knows that. The alternative minimum\n\n[[Page S3591]]\n\nis a devil of a tax. It grew from a little tiny thing with a few people \naffected to a monster that affects millions of people. With each year, \nit gets bigger in number. Instead, this budget provides a 2-year \nalternative minimum patch, not a cure. The 2006 alternative minimum tax \napplied to 3.5 million taxpayers. Absent legislative action, the AMT \nwill affect significantly more middle-income taxpayers. By 2007, up to \n23 million taxpayers could be subject to the AMT.\n  Maybe I am just telling them what they already know and they plan to \nfix it. They better think about it. It is an awful big number, and it \nis rather ominous. There will be plenty of Americans who will note it \ncome tax-paying time, there is no question. Today, they don't know, but \nin about 6 months, they will know. About a year after that, they will \nknow again. Absent legislative action, the AMT will affect \nsignificantly more middle-income taxpayers. By 2007, up to 23 million \ntaxpayers could be subject to the alternative minimum tax.\n  This is another tax which the middle class will bear the brunt of. \nThe reverberations of this inaction will be seen all over the country \nand will especially be evident in a State such as New Mexico. This \nbudget does not provide any permanent type of tax relief for America's \nmiddle-class people. I believe we still have time and a great \nopportunity to address this issue right now in a bipartisan manner. I \nam willing to continue to work to see what we can do to help the middle \nclass in this budget.\n  Added to the nonexistent middle-class tax relief, this budget fails \nto address the 800-pound gorilla in the room--otherwise known as \nentitlement spending. After 2010, spending related to the aging and the \nbaby boom generation will begin to raise the growth rate of total \noutlays. The annual growth rate of Social Security spending is expected \nto increase from about 4.5 percent in 2008 to 6.5 percent by 2017. In \naddition, because the cost of health care is likely to continue rising \nrapidly, spending on Medicare and Medicaid is projected to grow even \nfaster, in the range of 7 or 8 percent annually. Total outlays for \nMedicare and Medicaid are projected to more than double by 2017, \nincreasing by 124 percent, while nominal GDP is expected to grow by \nonly 63 percent. The budget currently under consideration does not \noffer solutions, much less address entitlement spending or reform.\n  In the area of energy policy, this budget is a mixed bag. On the \npositive side, I am pleased that it assumes $1.6 billion for the \nDepartment of Energy's Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Program--\na $440 million increase above the fiscal year 2006 enacted level.\n  This is a critical program within DOE where our Nation's work on \nnext-generation fuels is put to the test. Increasing our fuel diversity \nand fuel efficiency is a top priority for me this year, as it was in \nthe Energy bill of 2005. In that bipartisan bill, we passed the first-\never renewable fuel standard. This has literally brought thousands of \njobs to the American people and billions of gallons of homegrown \nrenewable fuel to the American fuel tank. I will be seeking to further \nthese advancements through legislation with Senator Bingaman and the \nEnergy Committee.\n  I am also relieved and pleased that the budget includes an increase \nfor fossil energy research and development. This is key to many small \nproducers, geologists, and to the overall fiscal strength of my home \nState. It is a mistake to misinterpret this funding as an unnecessary \nincentive for the oil and gas industry. This research and development \nhelps advance technologies to recover more domestic oil and gas, and \nthat is a good thing.\n  I am disappointed, however, that this budget rejects the President's \nproposal to permit oil and gas leasing in the Arctic National Wildlife \nRefuge and does not assume savings from the proposal. We all agree that \nwe should reduce our dependence on foreign oil. Many of us agree that \nwe should do that by conserving energy, increasing fuel efficiency, and \nusing homegrown biofuels. Where we often disagree is that I believe, in \nthe near term, we should also be producing more domestic oil and gas.\n  I have proposed and passed the idea of domestic energy in the form of \nan offshore bill dealing with the Gulf of Mexico. I believe we should \nbe doing more offshore. I believe this budget should include ANWR. The \nchairman of the Budget Committee has indicated he is concerned that our \nNation depends on imports for 60 percent of our oil. It concerns me, \ntoo. But it equally concerns me that we are locking up billions of \nbarrels of American resources while relying on foreign, volatile \nregions for our oil.\n  I cannot support this budget in its current form because it will \nincrease taxes on the middle class and does not offer any meaningful \nsolution for entitlement spending and it offers an incomplete energy \npolicy. I remain willing to work hard to address areas of concern and \nam confident that if others will come to the table and talk and \nnegotiate, we could strengthen this budget.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I have a different view than my \ndistinguished colleague from New Mexico. This week, what we are seeing \nis the proof of new leadership in this Congress. I am proud, as a \nmember of the Budget Committee, that we have a budget resolution before \nus that provides a blueprint for how we can build a stronger nation--a \nnation that will not be drowning in debt but can save for its \nchildren's future, a nation that will not undermine the education of \nits young people but that invests in building global competitiveness \nfrom start to finish, a nation that will not abdicate its \nresponsibility to provide health insurance to those most in need but \nthat is committed to covering every child, and a nation that will not \nneglect the needs of its soldiers and veterans but that will provide \nthe level of care their sacrifices deserve.\n  Our budgets are indicative of the values we hold, individually and \ncollectively. In this budget, one thing is very clear: We see a \ndifferent set of priorities and values for our Nation. From health care \nto education to our veterans to the safety of our communities, \nAmericans will see that this budget charts a new course. Perhaps most \nimportantly, however, this budget reaches all of these priorities in a \nframework that is fiscally responsible. With this budget, we will end \nthe days of spending now and figuring how to pay for it later. Instead \nof making lofty promises we cannot afford, instead of pretending we can \nhave it all while we are sinking deeper and deeper into debt, instead \nof leaving a multibillion-dollar mess for our grandchildren to clean up \nyears from now, with this budget we make a clear declaration: We must \npay for what we spend as we go along, not push it off for another day. \nThis is something Americans do every day. It is how all of us conduct \nour personal daily lives. Yet, until recently, it is something which \nCongress has been incapable of. With this budget, we have a chance to \nchange that.\n  Without question, one of our highest priorities is the health care of \nour Nation's most vulnerable children. I find it embarrassing that some \nin Washington, those who have some of the best health care coverage in \nthe world, have proposed to cut coverage to America's neediest \nchildren. Yesterday, we defeated an amendment that would have \njeopardized the health care of children and parents all over America. I \nknow the battle is not over, but let me assure my colleagues, we will \nwin the fight so children across this country will have the health \ninsurance they deserve. I applaud the Budget Committee chairman for \nworking to make this funding a priority in the resolution.\n  I am proud of the Senate's support for the Baucus amendment to \nincrease funding for SCHIP. I am proud that a majority of this Chamber \nrealized we had a responsibility to fix the shortcomings of the \nPresident's budget that would have had millions of children across the \nNation not insured and that we ensured America's neediest children have \nthe care and health coverage they need.\n  In this budget, we make it clear who our focus is. We will no longer \nfollow blindly down the President's path to provide costly tax breaks \nfor the wealthiest Americans while we rack up trillions in debt for \nfuture generations to pay off. That is why I am proud this\n\n[[Page S3592]]\n\nbudget includes an amendment by Senator Baucus to extend key tax \nprovisions which will benefit millions of students and hard-working \nfamilies but which do not drown us in debt. The message is clear: We \nDemocrats believe we can extend tax credits that help students afford \ncollege. We can ensure families continue to claim the child tax credit. \nWe can provide income tax relief, and we don't have to do it while \nsweeping the cost under the rug for another day.\n  In this budget, we provide a light at the end of the tunnel for so \nmany children, teachers, and administrators who have been strained to \nmeet requirements without resources, who have seen promises broken year \nafter year. With this budget, we start to fix the many holes in our \neducation funding. This budget funds education $9.2 billion above the \nPresident's request. We increase grant aid so that students who rely on \nPerkins loans, work study, and other grants will continue to have the \nextra assistance that will help them earn their degree.\n  For me, this is not a policy debate; it is real life. I would not be \nhere in the Senate today without the help of Pell and Perkins when I \nwas trying to go to college. Having grown up poor, in a tenement, and \nbeing the first of my family to do so, that educational opportunity \ncreated a foundation that helped me achieve what I have today. I want \nto make that a birthright for each and every one of our children who \nhas the ability and is willing to work hard and give something back to \ntheir country.\n  We provide the largest increase in elementary and secondary education \nsince 2002. We will have done more in this budget resolution in 3 \nmonths than has been done by the administration in the past 4 years so \nthat we can start to fill the massive shortfalls that have plagued our \nschools and denied opportunities to students. We restore programs such \nas Safe and Drug-Free Schools, education technology, and other critical \ninvestments that have been on the chopping block year after year.\n  Our budget also marks a turning point for an area which has been \nshamefully neglected--the care of our Nation's veterans. I recently \nvisited veterans at the VA hospital in East Orange, NJ, and soldiers \nwho have returned from Iraq and Afghanistan currently at Fort Dix and \nservice men and women from across the country, not just New Jersey. I \nhave seen how without adequate funding our VA system has become \noverloaded, new veterans hang in limbo, and soldiers who have made \nunimaginable sacrifices are left wondering just how much the Nation \nvalues their services.\n  Too many of our soldiers are trapped in a system that keeps them in \nlimbo. They are too injured to serve, yet they cannot be fully \ndischarged until their paperwork has been processed and their health \ndeterminations have been decided. The time they spend waiting can grow \nfrom weeks to months and, yes, even years. It is appalling. It is \nunacceptable. We have to work to improve this process.\n  This budget allows for that. It would increase veterans funding $3.5 \nbillion above and beyond the President's request. It will ensure \nfunding is dedicated to improving the claims backlog that is plaguing \nour discharge process.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for an additional 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I worked to include language in the markup that ensures \nimproving this backlog is a top priority, and I commend the effort by \nSenator Lincoln to dedicate funding to fixing the flawed claims \nprocess. This budget will do what should have been done long before our \ntroops began coming home from Iraq and Afghanistan--begin to repair a \nbroken system that has failed our veterans.\n  Our budget will also ensure that as we wage a war abroad, we do not \nforget our fight here at home to protect our Nation. This budget not \nonly rejects the President's shortsighted proposal to slash more than \n$1 billion from first responder programs, but it provides much needed \nincreases for homeland security grants, including enough to fund port \nsecurity grants at their authorized level of $400 million, doubling \nrail and transit security, and doubling chemical security funds.\n  We also restore the President's cuts to the COPS Program, which would \nhave left almost no funds to help law enforcement hire additional \nofficers and improve technology. We reject the President's proposal to \nslash firefighter grants in half and eliminate SAFER grants. This \nbudget means the difference between shortchanging our police and fire \ndepartments and providing them the resources to meet the challenges in \nour communities.\n  Finally, the bottom line is our Nation will see a difference when we \npass this budget. They will see a brighter outlook down the road. The \nNation is watching. They have called on us to focus and change the \npriorities and values we have seen in previous resolutions by the \nprevious majority. This budget ultimately encompasses the values of \nAmericans across this country.\n  I commend Chairman Conrad for his work on crafting this budget. It \nwas difficult. It is a careful balance. But at the end of the day, it \naccomplishes the key investments that are most important to the \nNation's future, to its vitality, to the human capital, to our \nchildren--our greatest asset and also our most fragile asset.\n  I urge my colleagues to continue to reject the amendments that \nundermine the ability for this new blueprint and to adopt the \nresolution tomorrow so we can build a stronger Nation.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders). The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the budget resolution \nthat is currently before the Senate today. This is my third year in the \nSenate, and this is the third budget resolution I have had the \nopportunity to consider. But this is the first time I can say I am \nproud of the resolution before us. It is long overdue. We have not had \na budget for 2 years, and we are still operating under the budget \nresolution passed in 2005.\n  The circumstances surrounding the budget are not ideal. Our fiscal \nsituation in this country has deteriorated significantly year after \nyear over the past 6 years. We know we cannot fully fund every good \nprogram, and we are still facing deficits even as we move closer and \ncloser to the demographic tidal wave that will soon overtake the Social \nSecurity and Medicare Programs. But, to their immense credit--to the \nimmense credit of the chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator \nConrad--they have crafted a very good, strong budget resolution. The \nbudget resolution before us provides a blueprint that will enable us to \nfund our most important Federal programs, provide new tax relief and \nextend expiring tax provisions, and bring the budget into balance \nwithin 5 years. It will do all that without raising taxes.\n  Still, one of the most important parts of this budget is not a \nprogram or a tax cut; it is a simple principle: If you want to take \nmoney out of the budget, either by increasing funding for Federal \nprograms or by cutting taxes, you have to pay for it. You have to pay \nfor it--it is a simple principle but a very important principle that \nwill assure we restore fiscal discipline to the Congress. This pay-go \nprovision is one I have long supported and one I am very proud to \nsupport with Senator Conrad and other Members of this body.\n  The budget resolution would create a 60-vote point of order against \nany new spending for tax cuts that are not fully paid for--that are not \nfully paid for. The simple rule is essential if we are to exercise the \nfiscal restraint that will be necessary to restore sanity to the \nbudgetary process and to set our Nation's fiscal circumstances back on \nthe right path.\n  I believe this budget strikes the right balance for America--between \nthe fiscal restraint that is embodied in pay-go and the need to fund \nour Government and between the need to keep taxes on middle-class \nfamilies low and the importance of facing up to our looming budgetary \nchallenges from a position of fiscal strength. This budget accomplishes \nthose important goals.\n  On the spending side, I am particularly pleased the budget resolution \nprovides adequate funding for a wide range of programs that are \nimportant to the people of America and to the people of Colorado. Some \nof those priorities include children's health, education, veterans \nhealth, and law enforcement.\n\n[[Page S3593]]\n\nThese issues have never been more important to America than they are \ntoday.\n  On children's health, an estimated 9 million children in America do \nnot have health insurance today. This is a staggering statistic: 9 \nmillion children in America are without health insurance. They do not \nhave health insurance; therefore, they do not have access to \nquality health care. These children will be denied the opportunities of \nlearning, to grow up in stable family environments, and to become \nproductive members of our communities.\n\n  On education, America is quickly losing ground to other nations in \nthis global economy. The Federal Government must help local schools \nprovide students with the skills they need to compete on a national and \ninternational basis.\n  On veterans health, we are all familiar with the consequences of the \nfailure to provide our veterans with the quality care the Nation owes \nthem. We currently have over 630,000 veterans of both Iraq and \nAfghanistan. We owe it to them as a nation to ensure they receive the \nbest care our Government can provide because that is what we promised \nto each and every one of them and their families.\n  On law enforcement, we all know how important it is for our citizens \nto feel safe and to be secure in the fact their Government is doing \neverything it can to protect them in their homes and in their \ncommunities. That means more effective Federal homeland security \nprograms, and it means more police officers in our neighborhoods.\n  The budget resolution before us gives these and a range of other \ncritical national priorities the full support they deserve.\n  For example, this budget provides $552 million for the COPS Program. \nThe COPS Program itself has helped put 1,300 police officers on the \nstreets in communities of my State of Colorado.\n  This budget provides $43.1 billion for veterans programs, including \nveterans health--with a $3.5 billion increase over the President's \nbudget request.\n  This budget provides $9.2 billion in discretionary education spending \nabove the President's budget request.\n  This budget provides $50 billion for the State Children's Health \nInsurance Program, SCHIP. That is 10 times what the President has \nproposed, and it starts us effectively down the road of making sure all \nthe children of America, in fact, have health insurance.\n  This budget protects our communities and our cities and our counties \nby making sure the community development block grants, which are so \nimportant, are provided $3.8 billion. This represents a very \nsignificant increase over the President's budget request, which slashed \nthe community development block grants.\n  This budget provides $1.6 billion for the Department of Energy \naccount that, among other things, will fund the National Renewable \nEnergy Lab at a level $385 million above what the President requested.\n  The budget also provides a $15 billion increase for agricultural \nfunding between 2008 and 2012 to give our farmers and our ranchers in \nthe forgotten part of America--our rural communities--the assistance \nthey need to remain vibrant.\n  The budget also rejects the President's proposed cuts to the Payment \nIn Lieu of Taxes Program, the PILT Program, restoring PILT funding to \nfiscal year 2006 levels.\n  On the revenue side, this budget sets the stage for meaningful \nmiddle-class tax relief and for aggressive action to close the tax gap. \nAs a new member of the Senate Finance Committee, I will do my part to \nhelp make the chairman's goals a reality. For example, I strongly \nsupport the chairman's decision to include 2 years of AMT relief for \nmiddle-class households. That is 1 more year than was set forth in the \nPresident's budget request. This will ensure that 20 million--20 \nmillion--middle-class taxpayers are not unfairly subjected to the AMT \nfor the next 2 years. I am also especially encouraged that Chairman \nConrad has made a point to emphasize the need to go after corporate tax \nshelters and offshore tax havens as a way of reducing the tax gap. It \nis simply not fair to ask hard-working, middle-class Americans to pay \ntheir fair share in taxes while we allow large corporations to \nconsistently abuse the Tax Code for their own profit. I commend \nChairman Conrad and the members of the Budget Committee for their \nvigilance in this arena.\n  Finally, I believe the budget's deficit-neutral reserve fund for tax \nrelief provides an excellent mechanism for extending several critical \ntax credits and deductions that will expire in coming years in a \nfiscally responsible way. The renewable energy production tax credits \nare an example of that in an amendment we just successfully adopted.\n  At the end of the day, in 2012, this budget will be balanced. A \ndramatic reversal of our fiscal fortunes will occur because of the \nresolution that is before us today. We need a responsible budget \nblueprint for Congress, and we need it now. This resolution provides \nthat blueprint, and I am proud to stand behind it. I will vote for it. \nI urge my colleagues to also support it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it is my understanding that the majority \nhas until 7:25 under a previous order entered into; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to support the budget \nresolution that Senator Conrad has so ably put together. Working with \nhis colleagues on the Budget Committee, Chairman Conrad has brought to \nus a budget that puts America's priorities first, and he has done so in \na responsible way.\n  As I have said many times before, a budget is an expression of \nvalues: you choose what to spend your money on and you choose how much \nof it to spend now instead of later. As families all across America sit \ndown at the kitchen table to create their own family budgets, they \ndecide what they have to pay for now--the house, the car, the \nelectricity, the gas--and then how much they can spend on other things \nwithout going too far into debt.\n  Creating a budget for the Federal Government is really quite similar \nin many ways: this week the Senate will decide what we have to pay for \nnow--the war, our veterans, health care, education--and then how much \nwe can spend on other things without making our record-shattering debt \nsituation any worse.\n  I will take a few moments to describe what I think are these key \ninvestment priorities, and then I will talk for a moment about how I \nthink we are addressing these priorities in a responsible way.\n  This budget includes substantial funding for many of America's top \npriorities, but I will take the time to highlight just three: veterans, \nhealth care, and education.\n  The Senate budget resolution allocates $43.1 billion for veterans in \nfiscal year 2008 alone. That is $3.5 billion more than President Bush \nrecommended in his budget request. With more and more weary soldiers \nreturning from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, with the deplorable \nconditions in Walter Reed waiting for the injured when they return, and \nwith ongoing issues in States like Illinois where veterans benefits are \nlacking, supporting the troops when it really counts--when the checks \nare being cut--is something that we simply must do. This budget gets it \nright.\n  This budget also gets it right when it comes to paying for health \ncare, both here and around the world.\n  For health care around the world, there is no greater funding need \nthan for the fight against global HIV/AIDS. In this area, I commend \nPresident Bush for showing real leadership over the course of his, \nPresidency. But his budget request neglected one of our most cost \neffective tools against this plague--the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, \nTuberculosis and Malaria. The Senate budget resolution includes $940 \nmillion for the Global Fund, an increase of $640 million over the \nPresident's request. Even more is needed, but this is a good start. To \nfight HIV/AIDS or make progress on other critical health and \ndevelopment challenges, we must make these necessary investments.\n  Here at home, the budget resolution provides for up to $50 billion \nfor is the SCHIP program over 5 years. The Bush budget request is $2 \nbillion. It is clear that the Bush administration has not\n\n[[Page S3594]]\n\nmade affordable health care for our Nation's neediest children a real \npriority. The Democrats have.\n  Since the creation of the SCHIP program 10 years ago, more than 6.2 \nmillion children have been covered by this vital program, including \nover 290,000 children in my home State of Illinois.\n  As the first State to provide health insurance to all children, \nIllinois has been a leader in the fight to change the course of health \ncare in this country. Since 1993, SCHIP and other Federal programs have \nhelped make it possible for Illinois to provide health insurance to \nmore than 313,000 children who didn't have it before.\n  How big is the need for better investments in our children's health? \nIn a study of over 20 developed nations released last week by UNICEF, \nthe United States ranked as one of the worst places to be a child. What \ndoes that say about us as a country and our commitment to our \nchildren--our future? What does it say about this Government's \npriorities over the last 6 years?\n  UNICEF looked at six dimensions of child well being. Of the five \ncategories for which the United States was ranked, our country ranked \nin the bottom third in four categories. In fact, we were next to last \nin the ``family and peer relationships'' and ``behaviors and risks'' \ncategories. And we were dead last in ``health and safety.''\n  We must make the commitment and investment in the health and well-\nbeing of our children to ensure their success--not create circumstances \nthat make it more difficult for them to realize their potential. I \nthink that this budget starts to correct our course, providing more \ninvestment in our kids where it is desperately needed.\n  This budget also proves that the Democrats in Congress believe that \nthere are few better investments in the future of this country--in the \nfuture of our children--than education. The budget resolution includes \n$62.3 billion for education in fiscal year 2008. That is $6.1 billion \nmore than the Bush request. We absolutely must make this investment now \nin order to reap the benefits in the future. Our kids deserve nothing \nless.\n  As we have allocated robust funding for our Nation's top priorities, \nwe have done so in a fiscally responsible way. Under Chairman Conrad's \nleadership, this resolution would take us several steps down the road \ntowards fiscal sanity after years of endless deficit spending that \nplaced today's tax cuts for the wealthy on the future credit cards of \nour children.\n  First, the resolution would create an annual budget surplus by 2012. \nSince we currently find ourselves with more debt than the Nation has \never accumulated before--just as the baby boomers are getting ready to \nretire--balancing the budget is fundamentally important.\n  Second, the resolution reduces both spending and the debt as a share \nof GDP over the 5-year life of the resolution. We have a long way to go \ntowards paying off our $9 trillion in debt, but this is a good start.\n  Third, the resolution restores a strong pay-go rule that the \nRepublicans had allowed to expire. Congress will be able to spend money \non critical needs if it chooses to, but we will have to pay for that \nspending at the same time. Likewise, we will be able to cut taxes if we \nwant to, but we will have to pay for that as well.\n  Fourth, the resolution provides 2 years of middle-class tax cuts \nthrough continued relief from the alternative minimum tax. Whereas the \nPresident's budget called for a huge tax increase on the middle class \nin 2009 by refusing to provide AMT relief for more than 1 year--a \ndecision that would lead to a substantial tax increase for 25.7 million \nmiddle-class Americans--this budget extends that relief for another \nyear to ensure that the middle class does not become ensnared in this \ntax that was meant to ensure the wealthy paid their fair share of \ntaxes.\n  In total, this budget provides a valuable blueprint that should help \nguide the Senate in providing funding for our Nation's priorities while \nensuring that we do so responsibly. I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I understand the time until 8 is relegated \nto us. I ask unanimous consent that the distinguished Senator from \nColorado be given up to 7 minutes and then the rest of the time be \nturned over to me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I intend to reserve some time for the \ndistinguished Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Chair. I wanted to make sure I was still \nin the queue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Utah for \nyielding. I appreciate his work and the leadership he brings forward \nhere in the Senate from the great State of Utah.\n  I am going to vote against the budget, and this is the main reason \nwhy: It raises taxes by $900 billion over 5 years and a projected $3.3 \ntrillion over 10 years. That translates into a tax increase of $2,641 \nper household annually over the next decade.\n  It includes 22 reserve funds that could be used to raise taxes by \nhundreds of billions of dollars more. It increases discretionary \nspending by nearly 9 percent in fiscal year 2008, and does not \nterminate one single program. It completely ignores the impending \ntsunami of Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid costs. It encourages \nrules that bias the budget toward tax increases.\n  I had an amendment earlier today that we voted on which looked at \nineffective programs as described by the Office of Management and \nBudget. This was in response to legislation we passed over a decade \nago, and we instructed the agencies to look at setting goals and \nobjectives and then coming forward and seeing how they met these. OMB \nlooked at these and said there were 26 out of over 1,000 programs where \nthey didn't meet those goals. If you took these 26 programs, we were \nlooking at $88 billion over a 5-year period of time.\n  I had an amendment that said: Let's give instructions to the \nappropriators to go into these various areas and see if we can't come \nup with $18 billion of reduced spending and programs that have been \nclassified by OMB. These are civil servants working for the Federal \nGovernment. They don't have a political agenda, just strictly looking \nat the program objectively. I was disappointed the amendment did not \npass.\n  Tomorrow I plan on introducing an amendment that is going to call for \nreconciliation for a 1-percent elimination of fraud, waste, and abuse \nin a number of mandated programs which does not include--does not \ninclude--armed services, veterans, and Social Security. The purpose is \nto improve the economy, efficiency, and effectiveness of Federal \nprograms and to reduce the Federal debt.\n  The other amendment, on the savings we voted on earlier this year, \nwas money that was directed toward reducing the Federal debt. This \namendment tomorrow will instruct the authorizing committees to reduce \nspending by 1 percent by eliminating waste, fraud, and abuse. The \namendment reduces waste, fraud, and abuse in mandatory programs by $13 \nbillion in the first budget year, and $71 billion over 5 years. All of \nthe savings will be used to reduce the debt.\n  This amendment carries across the finish line work that Congress \nstarted in 2003. In the fiscal year 2004 budget resolution, the \nCongress directed the Comptroller General to submit a comprehensive \nreport identifying instances in which the committees of jurisdiction \nmay make legislative changes to improve the economy, the efficiency, \nand effectiveness of Federal programs within their jurisdiction.\n  In compliance with our request, GAO--again staffed by professionals \nwho do not carry a political agenda--submitted a 300-plus page report \nchock full of specific examples of legislative changes with the \npotential to yield budgetary savings. What have we done with that 300-\npage report that we requested? Nothing, absolutely nothing.\n  My amendment picks up where we left off and encourages the \nauthorizing committees to improve the economy and the efficiency and \neffectiveness of programs under their jurisdiction. So in my effort to \neliminate waste and to bring about good stewardship of taxpayer \ndollars, I ask the Members of this body to support it. It is not a \npartisan issue. Oversight is a key function of Congress, and when we \nset up these pieces of legislation to set up reasonable oversight as \nMembers of the Senate, we need to be prepared to carry\n\n[[Page S3595]]\n\nthose recommendations forward when they come to our attention. I hope \nthis amendment will enjoy broad and bipartisan support. Both amendments \nwere supported by Citizens Against Government Waste. I think it is one \nsmall step we can do to at least bring about an effort to reduce fraud, \nwaste, and abuse, and these programs have been clearly identified by \nboth this particular amendment, by GAO, and the previous amendment by \nOMB.\n  I ask my fellow Senators to join me in voting for this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the remaining time to the Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I would like to take a few minutes to talk \nabout an amendment I will offer tomorrow to ensure that as the budget \ndebate continues, Congress works to protect Medicare beneficiaries' \ncoverage choices, especially coverage choices for those beneficiaries \nliving in rural areas and low-income Medicare beneficiaries.\n  My amendment is simple. It would establish a budget-neutral reserve \nfund so that if Congress implements improvements to Medicare, Medicaid, \nor CHIP, it may not do so in a way that leads to fewer coverage choices \nfor Medicare beneficiaries. It also may not reduce the benefits of \nthose beneficiaries who are enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans.\n  Let me give my colleagues a little bit of history on the Medicare \nAdvantage program which was established by the 2003 Medicare law.\n  Under Medicare Advantage, health plans receive a monthly payment to \nprovide beneficiaries all of the benefits covered by traditional \nMedicare.\n  But Medicare Advantage plans provide a lot more to beneficiaries.\n  Medicare Advantage plans provide a range of additional benefits not \navailable in traditional Medicare--benefits such as vision and dental \ncare, physical exams, and hearing aids.\n  Mdicare Advantage plans also have chronic care management programs to \nhelp beneficiaries with chronic illnesses such as diabetes or \ncongestive heart failure better manage their conditions and stay \nhealthy.\n  Now, health plans participating in Medicare is not a new thing.\n  They've served Medicare beneficiaries for many years going all the \nway back to the 1970s through programs authorized by Congress.\n  For the most part though, up through the late 90s, Medicare health \nplans were largely available only in urban areas.\n  Going back now for a decade, back to the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, \nthe fact that beneficiaries in rural areas had few, if any , choices, \nled Congress to take actions to promote plan availability in those \nareas.\n  Yes, these actions included increasing payment rates to address the \nfact that Medicare payments in urban areas were higher--in some cases a \nlot higher--than payments in rural areas.\n  I know my home Sate of Utah had difficulty keeping Medicare+Choice \nplans in the state primarily because payment rates were too low.\n  Ironically, many Utahns wanted to participate in these plans because \nthey were the only ones offering supplement benefits such as vision \ncare, preventive benefits and prescription drugs to Medicare \nbeneficiaries at the time.\n  But due to low payments and adverse selection, both Medicare+Choice \nplans dropped Utah beneficiaries and as a result, my constituents had \nlimited choices for Medicare coverage until the Medicare Modernization \nAct created the Medicare Advantage program.\n  So let me show you what beneficiary choices look like today.\n  The top map shows where plans were available in 2003.\n  The white space means that only traditional Medicare was available.\n  In 2007, beneficiaries--whether they live in an urban area or rural \narea--could chose from different Medicare Advantage plans, and all \nbeneficiaries have more choices.\n  All beneficiaries can now choose a Medicare Advantage plan that \noffers them important additional benefits and lower out-of-pocket \ncosts.\n  Now here is a good example of the benefits of Medicare Advantage--all \nbeneficiaries may choose a plan that has no cost-sharing for breast \ncancer screening.\n  We all know the importance of breast cancer screening.\n  Beneficiaries with diabetes can choose a plan that offers them \ndiabetes self-management services without any cost-sharing.\n  On cost sharing, according to CMS, millions of beneficiaries can \nenroll in a plan that limits their out-of-pocket costs to $1,000 a \nyear.\n  For low-income beneficiaries, protection from high out-of-pocket \ncosts, which they don't have in fee-for-service, is a valuable benefit.\n  We know that many low income beneficiaries rely on their plans for \nthis protection.\n  According to CMS, 57 percent of Medicare Advantage beneficiaries have \nincomes between $10,000 and $30,000 compared to 46 percent of fee-for-\nservice beneficiaries.\n  Another area I want to talk about is quality. Data from the Medicare \nCurrent Beneficiary Survey show that Medicare Advantage beneficiaries \nare more likely to obtain preventive services, including flu and \npneumonia shots and cancer screenings.\n  Surveys also show that beneficiaries are satisfied with their plans.\n  So let me conclude by urging my colleagues to keep in mind the \nfollowing:\n  Beneficiaries across the nation--whether they live in a rural state \nlike Utah or an urban area like New York City--now have more coverage \nchoices.\n  These choices offer beneficiaries more benefits and lower out-of-\npocket costs.\n  Beneficiaries are satisfied.\n  Let's not forget that it was through policy decisions supported by \nMembers on both sides of the aisle that helped achieve those results, \nand those results, in my opinion, are worth protecting for \nbeneficiaries' sake.\n  I urge my colleagues to support my amendment.\n  Mr. President, today we are debating the size and composition of the \nFederal budget for fiscal year 2008.\n  This is a critical debate. And it is one that future generations will \nlook to in order to determine where we went wrong or where we went \nright. Just as adherence to a budget can make or break a family or \nsmall business, so too can Congress's development of and adherence to a \nbudget make or break our economy.\n  Whether it is a family budget, or the congressional budget, it must \nbe based on an honest assessment of the facts. The budget must make \nreasonable projections about what money is coming in and what money is \ngoing out.\n  A budget must face hard facts, not hide from them.\n  When I hear from my constituents in Utah, they talk about the need \nfor tax cuts that benefit families and small businesses.\n  They talk about fixing Social Security and Medicare.\n  The 2006 annual reports for those programs showed their unfunded \nliabilities to be $84 trillion in today's dollars. That was up $7 \ntrillion over the previous year.\n  With 77 million baby boomers about to retire, this is a serious \nproblem.\n  We need a budget that is serious about the challenges we face, the \nrevenues we can anticipate, and the expectations of the American \npeople.\n  We need a budget that swings for the fences, but this budget is \nplaying small ball.\n  It is big spending, without any big ideas, and the result will be big \ntax hikes on the American people.\n  After reviewing the bill before us today, I must candidly admit this \nbudget falls short of realistic spending and revenue projections. You \ncould even go so far as to say it's filled with deception and fantasy.\n  Simply put, this budget is not honest. It spends more than is brought \nin. And a lot of the revenues it projects are not really there.\n  If my constituents in Utah budgeted like this, they would have a \nserious problem making ends meet.\n  The proponents of this budget claim that it is the cure to everything \nthat ails us.\n  But Americans know snake-oil when they see it.\n  This miracle cure will lead to one of two maladies--over time, it \nwill greatly increase the deficit or it will require massive tax \nincreases.\n  Consideration of this budget would not be possible without the good \nfortune of our booming economy. Perversely, however, this budget \nprovides a recipe for destroying the extraordinary growth created by \nthis economy.\n\n[[Page S3596]]\n\n\n  I don't believe it is an exaggeration to say--the economy is booming \nand revenues are up. In fact, revenues are up substantially.\n  They are up because of sound fiscal policy.\n  They are up because of progrowth tax cuts that have increased \nproductivity and wages.\n  It is easy to forget and sometimes our memories are short. But, in \nthe autumn of 2001, our economy was in shambles.\n  We were hit with a one-two punch, and we were down on the mat.\n  The booming economy of the late 1990s went bust. When the dot-com \nbubble burst, billions of dollars in equity were lost, and millions of \npeople began looking for work.\n  And then in the midst of that recession, our Nation was attacked.\n  It was not a foregone conclusion that a nation at war, already \nsuffering a considerable economic downturn, would emerge with its head \nheld high and an economy on the rebound.\n  But we did.\n  And we did so because President Bush and Congress held strong in \npushing through tax cuts and stimulus tax incentive bills that have \nbenefited each and every American.\n  I know that some of my colleagues want to maintain the illusion that \nour economy is two-tiered; they say that it is great for the rich who \nare making out like bandits, and terrible for everyone else. And the \n2001 and 2003 tax cuts have the lead roles in this melodrama.\n  However, the numbers tell a much different story.\n  Americans are paying taxes--a lot of taxes.\n  Between 2004 and 2006, we saw an inflation-adjusted 20 percent tax \nrevenue increase. This was the largest 2-year revenue increase since \n1965.\n  Tax revenues, at 18.4 percent of gross domestic product, are above \nthe 20, 40, and even 60 year historical averages. That is not enough \nfor Democrats, however, who want to soak the rich, but will wind up \ndrenching the middle class.\n  The real devil to them is the tax cut for capital gains and \ndividends.\n  Supposedly, these capital gains and dividends tax cuts were skewed \ntoward the rich.\n  These class warriors need to take a vacation in the reality-based \ncommunity.\n  Here's the real deal.\n  First off, stock ownership is not something just for the wealthy.\n  Sometimes I think that my colleagues are using talking points written \nin 1933.\n  Today, stock ownership is for the middle class.\n  When you turn on college basketball this weekend, you will see \ncommercials enticing people to hire companies to manage their stock \nportfolios.\n  They are not being marketed to monocle-wearing, sports car driving, \nplutocrats.\n  They are not being marketed on ``Masterpiece Theatre.''\n  They are being marketed to average families. You will see people at \nwork, people making burgers on the backyard grill, and people with \nfamilies living in the suburbs buying stocks and bonds, generating \ncapital gains and dividends to save for their children's college \neducations.\n\n  It is not just folks in affluent areas of the country who benefit \nfrom lower capital gains rates.\n  A policeman in Salt Lake City, a lineman at an auto plant in Michigan \nor a schoolteacher in California--all have pensions that are invested \nin the stock market.\n  And they all benefit from capital freed by these tax cuts.\n  In 2003, our capital gains tax rates were set at 20 percent and 10 \npercent.\n  Congress reduced these rates to 15 percent and 5 percent.\n  And what were the revenue estimates?\n  The Congressional Budget Office expected that revenues would expand \nsomewhat--from $50 billion to $68 billion.\n  It turns out CBO was a bit off.\n  Capital gains revenues doubled.\n  Let me repeat that.\n  Capital gains receipts jumped from $50 billion to $103 billion.\n  So here is the final take on these tax cuts: They turbocharged the \neconomy. They created jobs. Good jobs. They have led to increased \nrevenues. And they will continue to do so, as long as we do not choke \nthem off with the tax increases contemplated by this budget.\n  But this budget is a recipe for undoing our economic expansion and \ngrowth.\n  Some people have characterized this budget as smoke and mirrors.\n  That is too generous.\n  Smoke and mirrors suggests that the supporters of this budget are at \nleast embarrassed about its future implications.\n  It suggests that they are trying to pull the wool over the eyes of \nhardworking Americans.\n  But there is no subtext to this budget. It is not an esoteric \ndocument. The tax and spend message is right there on the surface.\n  It is not exactly the same as Democratic presidential candidate \nWalter Mondale going to San Francisco and gleefully promising to raise \nour taxes.\n  But it comes close.\n  It certainly looks like we are going to get another dose of this San \nFrancisco treat from the Democratic majority. I guess some things never \nchange.\n  This is a big spending budget.\n  And it is a big taxing budget.\n  Tax and spend.\n  Where have we heard that before?\n  Make no mistake about it.\n  The fact that the Senate adopted Senate amendment No. 492, sponsored \nby the chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Baucus, does not \nchange the character of this budget.\n  It was an important amendment. But in the end, by omission it \nactually emphasized the high taxing assumptions embedded in this \nbudget.\n  It did nothing to help alleviate the substantial tax hikes that most \nmiddle class Americans will face under this budget.\n  It did nothing to protect the capital gains rates that are so \ncritical for retirement savings and continued economic growth.\n  I know that the criticism of this budget as more tax and spend \npolitics must have bothered some of my colleagues because it prompted \nthem to offer and vote for this amendment.\n  Just a few months ago, many of us were campaigning on a promise of \nfiscal responsibility.\n  Promises, promises.\n  The authors of this budget seemed to have lost their appetite for \nfiscal responsibility the minute they stepped off the campaign bus.\n  And so here they are reverting to instinct.\n  Next year, the Senate appropriators will be able to spend $16 billion \nmore than the President recommended. And over 5 years, that number \ngrows to $146 billion.\n  We are going to see discretionary spending rise to 4.2 percent--\nhigher than the inflation rate. And trust me. They will spend every \npenny.\n  We are about to get some sense of Democratic fiscal discipline, when \nthe House of Representatives takes up the national security \nsupplemental spending bill.\n  Among the national security priorities in that bill will be: $25 \nmillion going to spinach growers. $74 million going to peanut storage.\n  And the list goes on and on.\n  All told, the House supplemental appropriations bill will be larded \nup with $21 billion in spending unrelated to national security.\n  This is certainly an unusual way to go about fiscal responsibility \nand taking care of our troops.\n  And it is just a taste of things to come.\n  The increases in spending contemplated in this budget might all be \ngreat news for civil engineers in West Virginia. But for future \ngenerations who will have to pay the bill associated with this budget, \nit is not great news.\n  Now, concerning the AMT. This budget also gives us a 2-year AMT \npatch.\n  Earlier this year, a number of my Democratic colleagues criticized \nthe President for failing to provide a permanent solution to the AMT. \nYet this budget does nothing to fix the underlying problem.\n  As inadequate as this fix is, there is a more nagging question. How \nare we going to pay for all of this?\n  Do you remember that campaign promise?\n  A Democratic Congress will restore fiscal responsibility by restoring \npay-go. It will require offsets for any new spending or tax cuts.\n\n[[Page S3597]]\n\n  OK. So where are those offsets coming from?\n  Here is where this budget leaves the land of wishful thinking and \nenters the realm of unfortunate delusion.\n  We are going to pay for it with--drumroll please--the tax gap. Yes, \nthe magical, wonderful, tax gap. The difference between the amount of \nmoney collected by the Government and the amount of money owed. The \nsolution to all of life's problems.\n  To balance this budget, there is an assumption of 3 percent more \nrevenue over 5 years than the President assumed. And where is that \nrevenue coming from?\n  The tax gap! Of course! Why didn't we think of that?\n  You see, this budget does not contain even $1 of mandatory savings. \nYet we are going to provide AMT relief, and we are going to increase \nFederal spending.\n  And we will pay for it by closing some tax loopholes and putting an \nIRS agent in every small business in the country to make certain that \nnot one dime of potential revenue goes uncollected.\n  Some people have called the tax gap the pot of gold at the end of the \nrainbow. Well, it is a pot at least.\n  Here is our best estimate--in 2001 the net tax gap was about $290 \nbillion. Over 5 years, the tax gap is $2 trillion. Wouldn't that be \nnice? The tax gap is the deus ex machina that will come in and save \nthis budget mess.\n  But everyone admits those are very unreliable numbers. Could we be \ndoing better when it comes to collecting taxes? Certainly. We should be \ncollecting more revenue.\n  But what is a realistic estimate?\n  Our tax collection system, imperfect as it is, already is the envy of \nthe rest of the world.\n  So what is a reasonable estimate of how much we can expect from the \ntax gap?\n  The President proposed in his budget 16 different options for closing \nthe tax gap. And they would raise $29 billion over 10 years.\n  That's it. And not one person in this body seriously believes that we \ncan collect anything near the amount needed to balance this budget.\n  So we have a $110 billion AMT fix. Fifty billion dollars of this \nfalls in the first year. I cannot even conceive of a tax gap revenue \noffset that would cover $50 billion in 1 year, unless Congress raises \nthe tax rates.\n  We have $146 billion more in spending over 5 years. We have no \nreductions in spending. And the tax gap is not paying for it. So who \nis? Let me be absolutely clear. You will be paying for it. I will be \npaying for it. We all will be paying for it. Each and every American is \ngoing to pay for this budget. We are going to pay for it through higher \ntaxes. We are going to pay for it by working more hours for less \nmoney. And ultimately, we will pay for it as economic growth and \nproductivity sag under increased spending, higher taxes, and declining \neconomic growth.\n\n  There is only one way for this budget to work. It has to assume that \nwe will not extend the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts.\n  Make no mistake about it. This means a tax increase on every middle \nclass American.\n  This plan will not just kill the goose laying the golden eggs. It is \ngoing to wring its neck, stamp on it, and throw its limp lifeless body \nin the river.\n  If we in Congress do eventually get our act together and balance the \nFederal budget over the next few years, it will be despite this budget, \nnot because of this budget. It will be because our economy continues to \ngrow. Because of sound fiscal policy, because of the tax cuts, because \nbusinesses will continue to open, jobs will continue to be created, and \ntax revenue will continue to go up.\n  We have seen this pattern repeated decade after decade in this \ncountry.\n  Unfortunately, this budget relies on assumptions that have proven to \nbe false time after time. It assumes that we will balance the Federal \nbudget through massive tax increase. It sets aside no room to extend \nthe 2001 and 2003 tax cuts.\n  In President Clinton's first term, he raised taxes by $241 billion. \nThat was quite an achievement.\n  For those of you who have forgotten, and I know that my constituents \nin Utah definitely have not, it was the single biggest tax increase in \nAmerican history.\n  And 1 year later the party responsible for this fiscal lunacy was \ntossed unceremoniously out of Congress.\n  Yet this Congress is set to run circles around President Clinton.\n  This budget assumes a $916 billion tax hike over 5 years. That is \nreal money. And I imagine it will be unacceptable to many of my \ncolleagues. This is fiscal irresponsibility of the highest magnitude. \nWe need to be straight with the American people.\n  I know that the majority is in a bit of a jam. In some ways, I feel \nsorry for them. They promised to fix AMT. They made promises to special \ninterest groups to hike spending. They made promises about fiscal \nresponsibility and budget balancing.\n  And what did they say about taxes? You could hear crickets chirping \nwhen that subject came up. And today they are still sitting awkwardly, \navoiding the obvious. Yet it is ordinary Americans who are going to be \nleft holding the bag.\n  This budget is writing checks that the majority cannot cash without \nasking the American people to pay higher taxes. The most offensive part \nof this plan is that they know it, and are just hoping to skate by.\n  Call it what you want--a caper, a swindle, fiddling while Rome is \nburning, Wizard of Oz budget, robbing Peter to pay Paul. The fact is, \nthis budget is a boondoggle. The people of Utah deserve better, future \ngenerations deserve better, and the American people deserve better.\n  While I am here, I would like to express my support for the Sessions \namendment No. 473, which would refocus alternative minimum tax relief \ntoward families.\n  Unlike the situation we had a few years ago when a majority of this \nbody supported the alternative minimum tax, I doubt if we could now \nfind a single member of the Senate who supports the AMT as it currently \nexists. In fact, this insidious tax has so encroached upon our tax \nsystem, and threatens to do so much more damage to the American \ntaxpayer, that I would be surprised if we could find even one Senator \nwho would not support total repeal or major reform of this flawed tax.\n  Despite widespread contempt for the alternative minimum tax, it is \nclear that the AMT already has gotten a vice-like grip on our fiscal \nsystem. Unfortunately, we are already so reliant on the massive revenue \nthe AMT generates and is expected to bring in over the next few years, \nthat making major changes to this tax seems out of reach, absent major \ntax reform.\n  Therefore, recent budgets considered by the Senate have included \nprovision for legislation only to help mitigate the effect of the AMT \non most American taxpayers, and not to repeal it. This lessening effect \nhas been brought about by temporary laws that raised the thresholds of \nthe tax for 1 year in order to limit the reach of the alternative \nminimum tax on middle class taxpayers.\n  For example, the so-called ``AMT patch'' that is in effect for \ncalendar year 2006 raised the threshold for married taxpayers filing \njoint returns to $62,550 from $45,000. The thresholds for taxpayers in \nother filing brackets were also increased accordingly, but again for \nonly 1 year.\n  According to the staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation, the 2006 \nAMT patch has kept the AMT at bay for nearly 20 million taxpayers. \nHowever, this relief ran out at the end of 2006. For the current tax \nyear, we now need to pass legislation to hold off the alternative \nminimum tax for millions of middle-class taxpayers.\n  While the budget resolution before us ostensibly provides for a 2-\nyear AMT patch, the details are fuzzy about how we will pay for this \nrelief. For now, however, I will set aside my concerns about that issue \nand focus on another important one, and that is the issue brought up by \nthe amendment of the Senator from Alabama.\n  The Sessions amendment would change the focus of how we approach \nrelief from the alternative minimum tax. I strongly support this \nchange, for if we cannot repeal the AMT immediately, our relief efforts \nshould be focused first on the most egregious causes of alternative \nminimum tax liability.\n\n  Tax liability under the AMT can arise for a number of different \nreasons. However, one of the most common reasons why taxpayers find \nthemselves\n\n[[Page S3598]]\n\nsubject to AMT is because they have children. As hard as it might be to \nbelieve, dependency exemptions are not allowed against the alternative \nminimum tax.\n  Another leading cause of taxpayers being thrown in to the alternative \nminimum tax is the fact that State and local taxes are not deductible \nunder the AMT. There seems to be a common misconception that the State \nand local tax deduction problem is the biggest factor in determining \nAMT liability.\n  In fact, according to the staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation, \nmore taxpayers face the ravages of the AMT because of their personal \nexemptions being denied than for any other reason. JCT projects that \nfor 2007, absent relief, more than 23 million tax returns will be \nthrown into AMT because of the personal exemption preference, where \nless than 20 million will be hit by AMT because of State and local \ntaxes. In subsequent years, the difference is even more pronounced.\n  The Sessions amendment is a simple one. It essentially says that \nsince we do not have the resources to repeal the AMT all at once, we \nshould prioritize our relief by first fixing the problem that causes \nfamilies with children to face the alternative minimum tax before we \nattack other problems, such as the one caused by the lack of \ndeductibility of State and local taxes.\n  Many families in my home State of Utah find themselves increasingly \nat risk of the alternative minimum tax. In fact, unless we act soon, an \nincreasingly high percentage of married families with children--not \njust in Utah, but all over the Nation--will find themselves in the \nclutches of the AMT.\n  And many of these are not high income families. Seventy-one percent \nof all married taxpayers with children earning between $75,000 and \n$100,000 will be AMT taxpayers this year, in the absence of relief. For \nthose families with children making between $100,000 and $200,000, the \namount is 97 percent. The rate of AMT paying for single taxpayers is \nmuch lower, only 9 percent for those making between $75,000 and \n$100,000, and 36 percent for those making between $100,000 and \n$200,000.\n  Although I am the first to agree that we should repeal the entire \nalternative minimum tax, that is probably not possible this year. Given \nthat we must choose partial relief, it makes sense to me that we should \nfirst give the relief to families with children. Let's first remove the \npersonal exemption as an AMT tax preference item. This amendment is \nprofamily, and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 551\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise tonight to speak about an \namendment that I will be modifying, amendment No. 551, that will \nincrease funding for renewable energy development in this country. This \namendment is offset. It is intended to provide funds for three areas of \nrenewables that have the potential, I believe, to do great benefit for \nthis Nation's electrical power generation, all without generating any \ngreenhouse gases or having any negative environmental consequences.\n  My colleague, Senator Stevens, and I are seeking to raise funding for \ngeothermal power, for ocean energy, and for small hydroelectric \ndevelopment.\n  I first wish to say I understand this budget resolution does raise \nfunding for renewables and energy efficiency, and I applaud that \neffort, even though it falls somewhat short of the levels of funding we \nwere hoping for when we passed the Energy Policy Act of 2005 a couple \nyears ago.\n  But I fear the budget shortchanges three areas of great potential \nenergy, and that is, again, the area of geothermal, ocean energy, and \nsmall hydroelectric development. By this amendment, I wish to make a \nclear statement that this Senator wants to see money not just restored \nbut increased for geothermal energy research and development and \nfunding provided for research and development of all forms of ocean \nenergy--current, tidal, wave projects--and also for the small \nhydroelectric developments, those that do not involve the damming of \nmajor river systems but instead use water from lake taps, creeks, or \nfrom run-of-river projects to generate the power.\n  We know that renewable energy is certainly growing in popularity and \nendorsements, and I very strongly support funneling additional Federal \nfunds for research and development into the areas of wind, solar, \nbiomass, coalbed methane, landfill gas, and all the other types of \nrenewable energy projects we authorized in the Energy Policy Act of \n2005.\n  But we largely have not done as well with geothermal funding and \ncertainly have done far less to promote ocean and small hydroenergy \ndevelopments.\n  On the geothermal issue, funding in recent years has dipped \nprecipitously. This year, the Department of Energy is proposing no \nfunding for geothermal. Last week, they did agree to effectively make a \ntotal of $5 million of new money available to study one possible area \nof geothermal, and this is in the area of heat mining, but this is just \nfor the remainder of this fiscal year. After that, there is no funding.\n  This cut in funding, this zeroing out comes as MIT has released a \nreport on the ``Future for Geothermal Energy.'' That report suggests \nenhanced geothermal system technology could provide 100,000 megawatts \nof baseload power, all without greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 if the \nGovernment increases its research commitment to resource \ncharacterization and assessment.\n  The cut in funding also comes just as the Department of Energy has \nhad a major success in proving the ability to convert low-temperature \ngeothermal resources--this is subsurface water that is far below the \nboiling point, perhaps as low in temperature as 160 degrees--to power \ngeneration. This success in using new types of heat exchanges to drive \npower generation came about and was perfected in Alaska.\n  We have a location, Chena Hot Springs Resort, outside Fairbanks. The \nowner, Bernie Karl, has been dogged in his approach to making this \nhappen, to defy the critics and the odds stacked against him to install \nthe first low-temperature generation working process. This project has \nwon accolades and engineering awards in the past year.\n  Mr. Karl did what everybody said he couldn't do. Some in the Energy \nDepartment seem to feel this project perhaps is not representative of \nanything other than this nice minor energy project in Alaska. But they \ndon't seem to recognize that about 70 percent of the villages in Alaska \nand in many small towns in the American West all lie above potentially \nsimilar low water, shallow ground geothermal resources. They are \nsitting right on top of the resource. So in a State such as Alaska, \nwhere electricity can cost 80 cents per kilowatt hour generated by \ndiesel fuel--this is how most of my villages are getting their fuel \nnow--geothermal power at an operating cost of perhaps one-sixth to one-\neighth of that amount is potentially a godsend. But there is no money \nin the budget to fund anything to support the geothermal energy.\n  There is also nothing to encourage traditional geothermal assessment \nand production, which has proven its worth in States from Nevada and \nCalifornia to the Intermountain West.\n  By specifically adding money to this budget and specifically saying \nthat this addition is intended to provide an additional $50 million to \ngeothermal for this year, it increases greatly the chances that \nappropriators later this year will not only restore but perhaps boost \nfunding for geothermal energy.\n  On the ocean energy front, the Electric Power Research Institute \nestimates that this country has the potential from wave power to \ngenerate 2,100 terawatt hours of power, and if we were to capture 15 \npercent of that power, it would equal all of the hydroelectric \ngeneration in this country today.\n  We know that in a State such as Alaska, where we are surrounded \nliterally on three sides by water, ocean energy is a huge potential \nsource of power. But it is also an enormous source of power along the \neast coast, if we perfected devices to capture it so we have the \neconomies of scale that make this power truly economic. Look at the \nwest coast with California. We have the potential for so much with \nocean energy.\n  Ocean energy is clean. It has no air emissions, minimal visual \nimpacts, and it could provide plentiful power for everything from \nfreshwater desalination to hydrogen production. It could help economic \ndevelopment by providing a\n\n[[Page S3599]]\n\ncheaper, more plentiful supply of power in so many areas across this \ncountry.\n  So my amendment is intended to provide $50 million of funding for \nocean energy research in fiscal year 2008. It would be a powerful \nstatement that Congress supports this form of clean renewable energy.\n  A final component of the amendment seeks to encourage a $25 million \nexpenditure for small hydro development. Again, this is not damming \nrivers to produce electricity but tapping non-fish-bearing lakes or \ndiverting water from creeks to fuel smaller hydro units. These projects \nhave little or no environmental impact on wildlife but can produce \nlarge amounts of greenhouse-gas-free energy. But the minimal grant and \nresearch assistance to continually improve the turbines will be quite \nbeneficial.\n  In Alaska, we have over 100,000 rivers and large creeks. So we are a \nlocation, again, where small hydro can supply a large share of our \nfuture electrical needs, as it has done without environmental \nconsequences for about 100 years, especially if we have this additional \nFederal assistance.\n  I come to the floor tonight to encourage adoption of an amendment \nthat will help to encourage additional funding for renewable energy for \nthose, I believe, neglected areas of the renewable energy portfolio.\n  I mentioned the amendment is fully offset. The $125 million total \ncomes from the function 920 portion of the budget, miscellaneous \nallowances portion of our budget.\n  I will not belabor this further except to encourage my colleagues to \nsupport this amendment as a way of sending a clear signal that we \nsupport additional funding for renewable energy and for a wider \nportfolio of renewable energy projects. We don't want to repeat the \nmistakes of the past, where we limit support to a few technologies so \nthat we in Congress essentially pick the winners and the losers. By \nadding additional research and development assistance for geothermal, \nocean energy, and small hydro, we can increase the possibilities that \nwill allow these renewables to blossom. This comes at a modest impact \non the budget, but I believe it could pay a huge benefit for our energy \nproduction in the future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to discuss two amendments that I \nhave offered. The first would enable our Nation to better support our \nmilitary and our veterans.\n  On September 11, 2001, our Nation was attacked by radical Islamist \nterrorists and the long war began. It is a war different than any we \nhave fought before because of the willingness of our enemies to attack \ninnocent Americans at home by killing themselves. Someone else has said \nthey hate us more than they love their own lives. But it is also a war \nthat is similar to other long wars we have fought throughout American \nhistory in which we were pitted against a great evil, an evil that \nthreatened not just the security of our society but the ideals and \nvalues that form the bedrock of our way of life.\n  In the Civil War, we fought against the evil of slavery. In World War \nII, we fought against the evil of fascism. In the Cold War, we fought \nagainst the evil of communism, and today we are fighting a world war \nagainst the evil of Islamist terrorism.\n  In each of these past struggles, our Nation fully mobilized. We \nrallied as only a free people are capable of doing. Millions and \nmillions of citizens bound together, shoulder to shoulder in defense of \nour freedom, with a shared sense of service, sacrifice, and support of \nour troops. Our sacrifices went far beyond the battlefield, they \nsuffused our society. In each of these past struggles I have mentioned, \nthose Americans who were not asked to put on a uniform nonetheless \nshared in the burdens imposed by war. That is how democracies should go \nto war.\n\n  Today, we find ourselves engaged in another global struggle for \nfreedom, a struggle that stretches from the mountains of Afghanistan to \nthe streets of Baghdad, from the jungles of Southeast Asia to the \ndeserts of Somalia, and from the nightclubs of Bali to the subways of \nLondon. The fact is that though our military is fully engaged in this \nwar, most of the rest of America is not.\n  Five years after September 11, very little has been asked of most of \nthe American people. Instead of mobilizing as a nation, the burden of \nthis war has fallen disproportionately on the few, on our soldiers, our \nbrave men and women in uniform. They are the ones who have put their \nlives on the line so that freedom may prevail. In this Chamber and \nacross our land, there have been great differences of opinion about how \nwe should pursue the war in Iraq, but there has been great unity of \nopinion that our troops there should be honored. We must support them.\n  That has become a common banner under which all of us have rallied \ntime and again. We support our troops. We say it on the floor of this \nChamber almost every day. We support our troops. We say it on \ntelevision and radio. We support our troops. We put it on the bumpers \nof our cars. We support our troops. But I ask my colleagues, can we \nhonestly say we really have done all we can and should to support our \ntroops? I think the answer is clear: No, we can't. We have not.\n  Look at the facts. Our Army and Marine Corps are stretched to the \nbreaking point, short on personnel, training, and equipment. Our Navy \nhas fallen dangerously below 300 ships. Our Air Force is forced to cut \n57,000 people in uniform in the next 5 years. Everybody in this Chamber \nknows--and all Americans know, too--about the terrible conditions of \nWalter Reed's Building 18 and the larger crisis in health care for our \nsoldiers and our veterans lurking just beneath it. No one can possibly \nlook at our troops and our veterans today and feel satisfied that we \nare doing all we should to support them.\n  I know some say these problems are only temporary, that once we leave \nIraq, everything is going to be fine for our troops and our military. \nBut this war is not just about Iraq; it is a global conflict with \nIslamist extremists who have declared war on most of the rest of the \nworld. Even if the war in Iraq ended tomorrow and all our troops could \nmagically be withdrawn, tens of thousands of our soldiers will still be \nneeded in Afghanistan, throughout the Middle East, in the Balkans, in \nthe Horn of Africa, and everywhere else freedom is being challenged. \nEven if the war in Iraq ended tomorrow, our military would still be \ntwice as busy as it was during the Cold War, confronting the inhumane \nand brutal threat of radical Islam and guarding against the rise of a \nhostile superpower elsewhere in the world.\n  Let me put the matter I am discussing in the context of American \nhistory, the history of America at war, and the extent to which our \nGovernment has mobilized and our people have shared the sacrifice.\n  During the Second World War, our Government raised taxes, and we \nspent as much as 30 percent of our gross domestic product to defeat \nfascism and nazism. During the war in Korea, we raised taxes again and \nspent 14 percent of our GDP on our military. During Vietnam, we raised \ntaxes--again because we needed to--and we spent 9 percent of our GDP on \nthe military. Today, in the midst of a war against a brutal and \nunconventional enemy, in a dangerous world, we have cut taxes and are \nspending less than 5 percent of our gross domestic product to support \nour military.\n  We need to confront the reality that the defense of freedom is not \ncheap. Our soldiers know that, their families know that, but we as a \nsociety don't seem to know that. We are failing to pay the full price \nwhich it is our obligation as citizens of this great democracy to pay \nto protect our security and our liberty. In contrast to past wars, we \nare failing as a society to share in shouldering the cost of this war \nagainst Islamist extremists.\n  In his 1942 State of the Union Address, just a few weeks after the \ndeadly surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, President Franklin Roosevelt \nspoke to our Nation about the sacrifice demanded of a democracy that is \nsending its bravest into harm's way to defend our way of life, and I \nquote: ``War costs money,'' President Roosevelt said. ``That means \ntaxes and bonds and bonds and taxes. In a word, it means an all-out war \nby individual effort and family effort in a united country.''\n  We have a responsibility in this Congress in our time to give our \ntroops the support they need in the world war we are engaged in against \nthe terrorists\n\n[[Page S3600]]\n\nwho attacked us on September 11--and attempt to do so again--and that \nmeans, and I quote Roosevelt again, ``an all-out war by individual \neffort and family effort in a united country.''\n  Every American has a responsibility to share in the burden our \nsoldiers are now carrying in defense of our freedom. We simply must pay \nthe cost of this war more adequately and equitably than we are today. \nIt is not an acceptable answer to push the sacrifice of this war \nagainst terrorism onto our children and grandchildren through deficit \nspending, as we have been doing. It is not an acceptable answer to pay \nthe cost of this war by squeezing some important domestic programs, as \nwe have been doing. It is a false choice, I would argue, to suggest we \nmust skimp at home in order to protect our security abroad. We are a \ngreat nation, a great economy, and we are capable of doing both. That \nwas the America of Franklin Roosevelt, the America of Harry Truman, the \nAmerica of John F. Kennedy, and the America of Ronald Reagan, and that \nmust be the America of today.\n  Of course everyone in this Chamber supports our troops. Now it is \ntime to translate that support into national policy. It is time to put \nour money where our mouth is. That is why I filed an amendment to enact \na support-our- troops tax to help pay for the war against radical \nIslam. Because we are each threatened by this inhumane enemy, each of \nus should contribute a little more to guarantee its defeat and our \nsurvival.\n  The support-our-troops tax I have introduced and envision would be a \nprogressive increase for all Americans who pay income taxes. The \nrevenues from this tax would only be able to be spent for our troops \nand the care of our veterans and must be on top of any other funds that \nwould otherwise have been appropriated for them.\n  My amendment today and the tax increase it proposes will not weaken \nour resilient economy, it will not deprive the American people of the \nmany comforts they enjoy, but it will begin to restore a sense of \nshared service and sacrifice to our people and a sense of fiscal \nresponsibility to our Government. It will begin to provide all that is \nrequired by our military to achieve victory in the long war in which we \nare engaged.\n  We all prefer lower taxes, but we live in a time in history that \nrequires more than what we prefer--a moment when we must appreciate \nwhat kind of Nation we are, the blessings of liberty we enjoy, and we \nmust understand what we must do together to preserve the security and \nfreedom we cherish.\n  I have decided not to ask for a vote on this amendment tomorrow. In \nfact, I would say that I filed it as a plea, as an opening argument to \nmy colleagues to join together in doing what is right and necessary to \ngive our troops and veterans the support they deserve. My purpose is to \nbegin a legislative effort that I hope will ultimately succeed in \nsecuring the additional revenues our troops and our veterans need.\n  We will not solve this problem today, but we cannot afford to put it \noff much longer. It is imperative that this Congress address the need \nfor a genuine national mobilization, a sharing of sacrifice in order to \nprevail in the long war we are fighting. Let us truly put meaning in \nthe declaration that we, each and every American, support our troops as \nthey put their lives at risk for us.\n  I also will offer a second amendment I have introduced, and this one \nI have done with Senator Collins, the ranking member of our Homeland \nSecurity Committee. It would strengthen targeted areas of our homeland \nsecurity effort. In this case, I will call up this amendment at the \nappropriate time and hope it is accepted by unanimous consent with the \nsupport of the chairman and ranking member of the Budget Committee. Let \nme take just a moment to explain what it does.\n  The administration's budget proposal for fiscal year 2008 underfunds \ncritical homeland security priorities, and while the committee \nresolution currently before the Senate is a major improvement over the \nPresident's request and returns key homeland security programs to their \nfiscal year 2007 funding levels--understand I am saying returns these \nprograms to the levels they are funded at now, not increases them--I \nbelieve it still must be strengthened in two critical areas.\n  This amendment I have introduced with Senator Collins would add an \nextra $731 million to this budget resolution for two specific grant \nprograms.\n  First, it would direct $400 million for grants to improve the \ncapabilities of first responders to communicate with one another across \njurisdictional and geographic lines. The remaining $331 million would \ngo toward the Emergency Management Performance Grants Program that \nhelps emergency managers throughout our country plan and prepare for \ndisaster. We propose to pay for these investments with an across-the-\nboard budget cut to administrative accounts, thereby adding nothing to \nthe budget deficit.\n  More, not less, must be done to strengthen an all-hazards approach to \nhomeland security to ensure we are prepared to respond to terrorist \nattacks like 9/11 as well as natural disasters like Katrina.\n  Last week, in passing S. 4, the Improving America's Security Act, the \nSenate voted to authorize a $3.3 billion interoperability grant program \nover 5 years, beginning with $400 million in fiscal year 2008, next \nyear. This amendment that Senator Collins and I are introducing would \nkeep that promise by enabling the appropriation of that $400 million \nfor the advancement of a system by which our first responders can \ncommunicate with each other with certainty in a time of disaster.\n  Similarly, the Senate, in S. 4, last week substantially increased \nfunding for the Emergency Management Performance Grants Program to help \nensure that our States and localities are prepared for all hazards. I \nask my colleagues to support this bipartisan amendment so we can \nfulfill the promise we made to our first responders and emergency \nplanners when we passed S. 4 last week.\n  Mr. President, this amendment strengthens targeted areas of our \nhomeland security effort which were neglected by the budget proposal \nfrom the White House. And while the committee resolution currently on \nthe floor is a major improvement over the President's inadequate \nrequest, and returns key programs to their fiscal year 2007 funding \nlevels, I believe that it still must be strengthened in this critical \narea. My amendment would add an extra $731 million to this budget \nresolution for two specific grant programs for first responders and \nemergency managers that will help them plan, train, exercise, prepare \nfor, and respond to catastrophic events. I propose to pay for these new \ninvestments with an across-the-board budget cut to administrative \naccounts, thereby adding nothing to the Federal deficit.\n  Mr. President, September 11, 2001 changed our lives forever. We face \nnew threats and must prepare accordingly. But the administration's \nbudget proposal indicates it has turned its back on the lessons of \nSeptember 11, 2001. And the Federal response to Hurricane Katrina and \nthe subsequent mismanaged recovery proved for all to see that we are \nstill a nation unprepared for catastrophe. More, not less, must be done \nto strengthen an all-hazards approach to ensure that we are prepared to \nrespond to terrorist attacks as well as natural disasters. The \nPresident's budget request does not reflect that imperative, which is \nwhy I proposed to the Budget Committee chairman and ranking member an \nadditional $3.4 billion above the President's proposal.\n  Given the financial limitations before us, however, I have decided to \noffer this scaled-down amendment. Of the $731 million in additional \nspending I am proposing, $400 million would be for grants to improve \nthe capabilities of first responders to communicate with one another \nacross jurisdictional and geographic lines. The remaining $331 million \nwould be directed toward the Emergency Management Performance Grants, \nEMPG, Program that helps emergency managers plan and prepare for \ndisaster.\n  We know our first responders don't have the training, equipment, and \nfrequently the manpower they need to do their jobs properly. Most don't \neven have the basic capability to communicate with one another across \njurisdictional and functional lines, and the response to Hurricane \nKatrina showed us that, sometimes during a major catastrophe, they \ncan't communicate at all. Yet the President's budget continues a 4-year \ntrend in cuts to first responders--a 40-percent reduction since\n\n[[Page S3601]]\n\n2004. And the President proposes nothing at all for fiscal year 2008 to \npromote interoperable communications specifically.\n  Most of my colleagues in the Senate know that a sustained Federal \ncommitment is needed to improve the ability of our first responders to \ncommunicate with one another in the face of disaster. Unfortunately, \ntime and again, disasters occur, and police, firefighters, and \nemergency medical workers are unable to exchange information with each \nother. Lives are lost as a result.\n  That is what happened on 9/11. The story of the communication \nbreakdown among New York City's first responders is well known. And it \nis well known because it cost the lives of some of the bravest \nAmericans who rushed to the aid of their fellow citizens. But it \noccurred at each of the 9/11 disaster sites.\n  Then came Katrina. The storm decimated communications infrastructure \nthroughout Mississippi and Louisiana, and once again, difficulties in \ncommunicating among officials and first responders significantly \nimpeded rescue and relief efforts.\n  Like many of the homeland security challenges we face, achieving \nnationwide operability and interoperability will require significant \nresources. While we don't know the exact price tag, we do know the \ncosts will be significant, which is why we created a dedicated \ninteroperability grant program for first responders in S. 4--the \nSenate-passed 9/11 Commission recommendation implementation bill, also \nknown as the Improving America's Security Act of 2007.\n  That legislation authorizes $3.3 billion over 5 years beginning with \n$400 million in fiscal year 2008. The amendment I am introducing would \nmatch this amount in the budget resolution before us today.\n  Secondly, the EMPG Program is a long-standing and effective program \nwhose cost is shared equally between Federal and State governments. \nEMPG grants are an essential building block in preparing for disasters \nof all types. They support critical functions such as the planning, \ntraining, and exercising that undergird almost all other preparedness \nefforts, whether for natural disasters or acts of terrorism. EMPG \ngrants are therefore a distinct and important complement to those \nhomeland security grants focused primarily on preventing, preparing for \nand responding to terrorism.\n  By enabling States to create better plans, EMPG grants also help \nensure that the other money provided by the Federal Government is spent \nmore effectively.\n  The former head of the National Emergency Management Association, who \nalso is the Director of Emergency Management for the State of Alabama, \ntestified before the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs \nCommittee that having EMPG funds available for planning actually saves \nmoney for States, localities, and the Federal Government. For example, \nin one county in Alabama, where EMPG funds were used to develop a \ndebris removal plan, the county was able to cut the cost in half of \nhaving debris removed after a disaster compared to other counties that \ndid not have similar plans. If you spread those savings over millions \nof cubic feet of debris, the savings--of costs that would have \notherwise been reimbursed by the Federal Government--really add up. In \nother words, the more we plan, the more efficiently we can utilize the \nfunding that is available.\n  Again, like the interoperability grants, the Senate has already \nrecognized the importance of the EMPG Program in S. 4, which \nsubstantially increases the authorized funding for EMPG to help ensure \nthat our States and localities are prepared for all hazards. We should \nbegin to fulfill the promise of S. 4 here.\n  Mr. President, we must learn the dual lessons of September 11, 2001, \nwhen terrorists attacked us on our shores killing 3,000 innocent \ncivilians, and August 29, 2005, when a predicted and catastrophic \nhurricane leveled much of the gulf coast, causing 1,300 deaths, \nbillions of dollars worth of damage, and untold amounts of grief.\n  Our enemies are ruthless and choose their own battlefields, and \nnature will strike in unpredictable ways, year after year. Yet many of \nour Nation's security gaps remain wide open. There is no cheap way to \nbe better prepared.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment so that we can fulfill \nthe promise we made to our first responders and emergency planners when \nwe passed S. 4 last week.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following \nSenator Casey, I be allowed to speak for up to 10 minutes, that I be \nfollowed by Senator Isakson for up to 10 minutes, and Senator Gregg for \nup to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise tonight to speak about an amendment \nthat I believe will pave the way to expand quality preschool education \nfor our Nation's children. I believe, as so many people in this Senate \nbelieve, that we must invest in our children in the dawn of their \nlives, as Hubert Humphrey said many years ago. The reason we must do \nthat is, if we don't invest in them in the dawn of their lives, we \ncan't expect them to be healthy, we can't expect them to learn and to \ngrow and to have all the benefits that we hope any of our children \nwould have as they move into school and begin to move into the future \ntogether.\n  I thank Senator Conrad for the work he has done on this budget \nresolution and allowing us the ability to offer amendments like this. \nIn particular, on this subject matter both Senator Kennedy and Senator \nDodd not only have done great work over many years, but in particular \nthis year, and their staffs have helped on this issue as well. I \nappreciate that.\n  My amendment is simple. It creates a deficit-neutral reserve fund for \nexpanding preschool education to children of low-income families. It is \nmy hope the Congress can come together in a bipartisan way on \nlegislation to expand access to preschool education for children, \nespecially children of low-income families--but it would not be so \nlimited. We could also cover children of lower and middle-income \nfamilies as well.\n  Mr. President, you know well--you have spoken about this--we already \nhave two great programs that help our children among several but two \nthat I will mention tonight. We have Head Start and the Child Care \nDevelopment Block Grant Program. These are programs that we know work. \nThey deliver results for those children and for our country. So I \nbelieve both Head Start and the Child Care Development Block Grant \nProgram are good investments for those children, for their families, \nand for our future. I believe Head Start and the Child Care Development \nBlock Grant Program should receive the funding they need from Congress \nthis year in this budget.\n  At the same time, I also believe a preschool program for early \nlearning that I speak of tonight will complement and add to and enhance \nthe ability of these other programs to help our children. I also \nbelieve that by setting up a deficit-neutral reserve fund, this \namendment will eventually require offsets. But I also think when we do \nthat we are speaking not just of a program that should work but a \nprogram that will be fiscally responsible and maintain fiscal \ndiscipline.\n  I want to make sure that in this amendment, in this budget process we \nare engaged in right now, that we leave flexibility for the Health, \nEducation, Labor and Pensions Committee and the Senate itself to create \na preschool assistance program for the States. I believe this amendment \ndoes that. I hope this flexibility will allow us to work across the \naisle in a bipartisan fashion on the parameters of this program and its \neventual costs.\n  Early childhood education has been a priority of mine for many years \nand had been a priority of mine in State government as the auditor \ngeneral and State treasurer of Pennsylvania. In the Senate it will \ncontinue to be a top priority for me. I have been a strong advocate for \nimproving the quality and safety of childcare in my home State of \nPennsylvania, and I will continue to do that in the Senate.\n  We know this: study after study shows that investments in pre-K are \nnot just good for that child and not just good for that child's family \nbut, of course, for the State in which they live and for our whole \ncountry. We hear a\n\n[[Page S3602]]\n\nlot of talk in this Chamber about growing the economy, making sure \npeople have the ability to be entrepreneurs, to invest and to grow and \nto make money and to build our economy. That is great and we all \nsupport that. But if we really are serious about growing the economy of \nAmerica today and into the future, I believe we must invest in our \nchildren. We know these programs pay dividends for our children and for \nour future.\n  I believe the Bush administration should not only put together the \nright kind of budget--and I have been critical of many aspects of the \nPresident's proposal--but I think the administration should increase \nfunds for Head Start, not cut them. It should increase funds for the \nChild Care Development Block Grant Program, and at the same time we \nmust help our States in their efforts to establish quality \nprekindergarten education programs so that all children, no matter what \ntheir background, can enter school ready to learn.\n  Investments in our children and early childhood education should be a \ntop national priority, something that should have bipartisan support. I \nbelieve it will and it does. By working to make sure that every child \nis ready to learn when they enter school and by nurturing our children \nduring their early years, we make an investment that pays dividends to \nthe child and for the country.\n  I urge all my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I am concerned about the use of the so-\ncalled function 920 account to offset amendments to the budget \nresolution.\n  The budget resolution sets the aggregate level of discretionary \nspending for the coming fiscal year. Within that maximum level of \ndiscretionary spending, the budget resolution displays certain \nnonbinding levels of discretionary spending that are divided between 20 \nmajor functions, including function 050 for defense, function 150 for \ninternational affairs, function 400 for transportation, function 550 \nfor health, and so on. Function 920 is a kind of catch-all account, \nwhich displays the budget effects from initiatives that cannot be \neasily categorized into the other budget functions, such as an across-\nthe-board spending cut.\n  When a Senator offers an amendment to increase spending in one \ndiscretionary account, such as function 400 for transportation or \nfunction 550 for health, and then directs the Appropriations Committee \nto find unspecified savings in the function 920 account, it creates an \nexpectation for increased resources when none are produced. Such \namendments do not increase the maximum level of discretionary spending \nallowed by the budget resolution falsely raise expectations that more \nmoney is available for certain spending programs. In reality, this is a \nshell game amounting to shifting funds around without any actual \nconsequence.\n  Function 920 has a legitimate accounting purpose. That purpose, \nhowever, is not to create the illusion of progress for public \nconsumption and a press release.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, amendment No. 591 would create a \ndeficit neutral reserve fund and would allow for legislative action by \nthe Finance Committee to improve the child support enforcement system \nas long as the costs were offset.\n  The child support program has collected more than $23 billion for 17 \nmillion children participating in the program. The Congressional \nResearch Service found that this program is one of the most important \nsafety net programs reducing poverty rates for working families.\n  Unfortunately the Deficit Reduction Act, DRA, made deep cuts in this \nenforcement funding. A preliminary estimate by the Congressional Budget \nOffice indicates that $11 billion in child support payments will go \nuncollected over the next 10 years, even if States backfill half of the \nlost Federal funds.\n  Child support payments allowed more than 300,000 families to close \ntheir Temporary Assistance to Needy Families cases in 2004. Families go \non welfare less often and leave sooner when they receive reliable \nsupport payments. In addition, Federal costs for Medicaid, food stamps, \nand other means-tested programs decrease when both parents support \ntheir children.\n  The child support program collected $4.58 in private dollars for \nevery $1 spent by Federal, State, and county governments. The Office of \nManagement and Budget rated the child support program as one of the \nmost effective government programs.\n  As States implement the cuts in the DRA, fewer children will receive \nreliable support from their parents. States and counties will collect \nsupport less consistently and it will take longer to establish \npaternity and support orders. Employer outreach initiatives will be \ncurtailed. Domestic violence services and initiatives to help low-\nincome fathers work and stay involved with their children will be \nreduced or eliminated. Interstate enforcement will be less dependable.\n  As program resources are reduced, a State's ability to meet Federal \nperformance measures will deteriorate. A downward spiral in performance \nwill further decrease State program funds and increase penalty risks. \nCounties in particular rely on performance incentive funding to \noperate. The performance gap will widen between States and counties \nable to backfill funds and those that cannot.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to comment on \nveterans funding in this budget resolution. The Democrats have put \nforward a resolution that proposes to increase veterans discretionary \nspending by 18 percent--this is on top of a 12 percent increase that \nwas included in last month's joint funding resolution. I have also \nheard that billions more will be proposed for veterans in the war \nsupplemental.\n  Spending proposals of this magnitude in any area of Government should \nrightfully raise a few eyebrows and be met with a healthy level of \nscrutiny. Veterans programs are no exception. Taxpayers will continue \nto support higher veterans expenditures only to the extent we can \nassure them that those expenditures are absolutely necessary, will not \nbe wastefully spent, and will meet our highest priorities. The Budget \nCommittee chairman stated as much in his opening remarks on Tuesday.\n  Let me be clear. I am absolutely committed to providing the highest \nquality of care to our veterans. I have supported a 70 percent increase \nin VA medical care since President Bush took office. I have spoken \nfrequently about not sparing any expense when it comes to getting the \nhighest quality of care to our Iraq and Afghanistan veterans and \nveterans with disabilities. I have even introduced legislation that \nallows all veterans with service-connected disabilities to seek care \noutside of the VA system if that is what they prefer.\n  But what I see in this resolution is an effort to use the legitimate \nneeds of our war wounded as a pretext to support funding increases that \nare beyond reason and that actually may harm the care provided to the \nveterans who are our No. 1 priority.\n  Let me point out a couple of areas where I think this budget fails \nour highest priority veterans and taxpayers.\n  The Democrats' budget proposes an extra $1.1 billion to allow new \n``Priority 8'' veterans to enroll for VA health care. Now who are these \nPriority 8 veterans? Priority 8 veterans are veterans with no service-\nconnected disabilities and higher incomes. They were granted \ncomprehensive access to VA health care back in 1996 at a time when we \nthought their care could be provided on a budget-neutral basis. We were \nwrong. Priority 8 veterans then enrolled in such large numbers that \nquality and timely health care to VA's service-disabled and indigent \npatients began to be compromised.\n  In January 2003, Secretary Principi used authority granted to him by \nCongress to suspend new enrollment of Priority 8 veterans. His \nrationale was simple:\n  VA is maintaining its focus on the health care needs of its core \ngroup of veterans--those with service-connected disabilities, the \nindigent and those with special health care needs.\n  Taking the action he did on the eve of the war in Iraq was the right \nthing to do. He rightly instituted a policy that focused our limited \nresources on those for whom VA was established--our war injured and \nveterans who need VA the most.\n  All I have been hearing from the Democrats for the last 2 years is \nhow we must not make our OIF/OEF veterans wait in lines for mental \nhealth\n\n[[Page S3603]]\n\ncare, TBI treatment, or other specialty care. I agree! That is why \ntheir proposal puzzles me. At a time of war, when we're trying to get \nquicker access to VA care for our OIF/OEF and service-disabled \nveterans, how does allowing an increase in the patient load help \nmatters? Where is the sense of priority here? It is like we are trying \nto keep a ship afloat by pouring tons of water onto the deck. It \ndoesn't make sense.\n  For those who think that simply providing more money permits VA to \nautomatically increase its capacity to see new patients, think again. \nIt takes time to hire quality medical personnel. It takes time to find \nspace to accommodate additional medical appointments and patients. \nSince 2003 VA has been able to improve the amount of time it takes to \nschedule primary and specialty care appointments so that more than 94 \npercent of such appointments are scheduled within 30 days of the \nveteran's desired date. Why would we risk longer waiting times for our \nOIF/OEF veterans and service-disabled veterans?\n  Furthermore, is this new spending fiscally prudent at a time when VA \nbudgets have been growing at double-digit rates? There are 24 million \nveterans in the United States; only 5.3 million use VA health care now. \nHave the longterm cost implications of opening the system to all \nveterans been considered in this budget? Have we contemplated the \nmultibillion dollar unfunded liability we are creating here if millions \nmore Priority 8 veterans show up for free care?\n  Let me move on to another area that concerns me.\n  The chairman of the Budget Committee made it a point to show how his \nbudget meets or exceeds the recommendations of the independent budget. \nThat is all well and good, but when the IB is used to set budget policy \nfor the Congress, then a fair evaluation of the budget numbers is in \norder. Let's look at one account in particular--general operating \nexpenses. The Budget Committee chairman quite proudly stated that his \nbudget meets the IB recommendation of $2.23 billion for this account.\n  The largest portion of this account funds the administration of VA's \nbenefits programs, to include its backlogged claims processing system. \nThe administration has submitted a proposal that would provide VBA with \nthe highest number of claims processors in its history. In fact, the \nPresident's budget will result in what will have been a 61 percent \nincrease in claims processing staff since 1997. While I support the \nPresident's budget, it is time we tried a new approach to fixing the \nbacklog of disability claims. Simply providing more and more money to \nfix the problem does not solve the problem.\n\n  What do we have with the Democrats' budget? On top of the President's \nrecord increase, the IB recommends an extra $700 million: roughly $100 \nmillion for new information technology spending, and $600 million for \nadditional staff. According to unofficial VA estimates, 600 million \nwould buy over 10,000 VBA employees, almost double the size of the \nexisting bureaucracy? VA cannot accommodate a staffing influx of this \nsize in 1 year. It would have to lease hundreds of thousands of square \nfeet and additional facilities all over the country. More money would \nbe needed for communication services, utilities, personal computers and \nIT support staff.\n  Is this rational? Have the long-term costs been factored in? Was VA's \nability to provide space for these employees factored in? Does the \nincoming workload command a bureaucracy of that enormous size? As \nranking member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, I have not seen any \ndata to substantiate a request of that magnitude. I have even asked the \nauthors of the IB to justify the number, but have yet to receive a \nresponse.\n  We are not talking about chump change here. If an error was made by \nthe IB, and I suspect one was, then we should fix it before it is \nperpetuated.\n  Let me conclude with this final observation. VA has been criticized \nin recent years for its very public budget gaffes. The General \nAccountability Office rightly condemned VA for ``errors in estimation'' \nand ``inaccurate assumptions'' that led to the VA funding shortfall of \n2005. I would caution my colleagues that we, in this budget resolution, \nmay be repeating those same mistakes by providing money that VA could \nnot prudently spend. It may be politically expedient to reflexively \nthrow more money at problems. But let's also not forget about our \nobligations to the American taxpayer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/22/senate-section/article/S3603-1", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3603]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. CASEY.

Mr. President, I rise to speak about S. 888, the Genocide \nAccountability Act. It is a bipartisan bill I have introduced with \nSenator Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont, and \nSenator John Cornyn of Texas.\n  This Genocide Accountability Act is the first legislation produced by \nthe Judiciary Committee's new Subcommittee on Human Rights and the Law, \nwhich I chair and Senator Coburn serves as ranking member.\n  I wish to thank organizations that have endorsed this act, including \nAfrica Action, the American Jewish World Service, Amnesty International \nUSA, the Armenian Assembly of America, the Armenian National Committee \nof America, the Genocide Intervention Network, Human Rights First, \nHuman Rights Watch, Physicians for Human Rights, Refugees \nInternational, and the Save Darfur Coalition.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na letter from the organizations I have just mentioned supporting this \nlegislation.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                   March 15, 2007.\n     Hon. Richard J. Durbin,\n     Hon. Tom Coburn,\n     Subcommittee on Human Rights and the Law, Senate Committee on \n         the Judiciary, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Durbin and Ranking Member Coburn: We write to \n     express our strong support for the Genocide Accountability \n     Act. We believe this legislation, a product of the \n     Subcommittee on Human Rights and the Law's inaugural hearing \n     on genocide, is necessary in order to enable the United \n     States to lead the world in bringing perpetrators of the most \n     serious human rights crimes to justice. We look forward to \n     its swift enactment into law.\n       Winston Churchill once remarked that the extermination of \n     Jews in Europe was ``a crime without a name.'' That inspired \n     Raphael Lemkin to name it, and he then devoted his life to \n     codifying the crime of genocide in international law. \n     Lemkin's work culminated in the United Nations Convention on \n     the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. The \n     most serious human rights crime had a name, but since 1988, \n     when the United States formally ratified the treaty, genocide \n     has been a crime under U.S. law only in the narrowest of \n     circumstances.\n       The Genocide Implementation Act (18 U.S.C. 1091), enacted \n     in 1987 as a prerequisite to the United States becoming a \n     party to the Genocide Convention, provides jurisdiction over \n     the crime of genocide only in circumstances where the \n     perpetrator is a U.S. citizen or the crime took place in the \n     United States. Since the time that law was enacted, the \n     world's pledge that it would ``never again'' tolerate mass \n     slaughter has been mocked again and again--in Bosnia, in \n     Rwanda and now in Darfur. As the violence in Darfur rages \n     into its fifth year, the United States must do all it can to \n     deter those who act with seeming impunity, including by \n     removing any barriers to prosecution in this country of those \n     responsible for genocide.\n       The Genocide Accountability Act would accomplish this by \n     enabling the Department of Justice to prosecute foreign \n     nationals suspected of genocide who are present in the United \n     States. This is not merely a theoretical concern. The Justice \n     Department has already identified individuals who may have \n     participated in the Rwandan and Bosnian genocides and are \n     currently living in the United States under false pretenses, \n     but current law fails to provide jurisdiction to charge them \n     with that crime.\n       Like the pirate and the slave trader, perpetrators of \n     genocide are rightly considered to be the enemies of all \n     mankind. The United States must not remain passive when those\n\n[[Page S3604]]\n\n     suspected of genocide enter or are found in its territory. By \n     eliminating barriers to prosecution, as the United States has \n     done in the cases of hostage-taking, torture, and other \n     serious crimes, the Genocide Accountability Act will ensure \n     that perpetrators of genocide do not evade accountability \n     when they are present in the United States. We welcome its \n     introduction and strongly urge its enactment into law.\n           Sincerely,\n         Africa Action, American Jewish World Service, Amnesty \n           International USA, Arab American Institute, Armenian \n           National Committee of America, Center for American \n           Progress Action Fund, Genocide Intervention Network, \n           Human Rights First, Human Rights Watch, Open Society \n           Policy Center, Physicians for Human Rights, Refugees \n           International, Save Darfur Coalition.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Leahy for allowing the \ncreation of this new subcommittee in Judiciary that is known as Human \nRights and the Law. It is the first time in the 218-year history of the \nSenate such a committee has been designated, and I am honored to serve \nas its chair.\n  After our first hearing on genocide in Darfur, we decided it was time \nto close the legal loopholes that prevent the U.S. Justice Department \nfrom prosecuting people in our country who have committed genocide. \nThis legislation is a result of our first hearing. We heard about these \ngaps in the law and found them hard to believe. Unlike the laws of \ntorture, piracy, material support for terrorism, terrorism financing, \nhostage taking, and many other Federal crimes, laws related to genocide \ndo not allow the arrest and prosecution in the United States of people \nwho are not U.S. citizens, or who have not committed the act of \ngenocide in our Nation. Of course, those are few and far between. There \nis no reason to treat genocide, perhaps the worst crime known to \nhumanity, differently than any of these crimes.\n  During the Human Rights Subcommittee's hearings, we heard from Romeo \nDallaire. He is now a member of the Canadian Senate, and he was the \ngeneral in charge of the U.N. peacekeeping force in Rwanda in 1994. He \ntried desperately to stop that genocide, and many people refused to \neven listen. Two notable exceptions were former colleagues in the \nSenate: my predecessor, Senator Paul Simon of Illinois, and a man whom \nI respect very much and recently retired, Senator Jim Jeffords of \nVermont. They appealed to the Clinton administration to send troops \ninto Rwanda--just a small force to stop the massacre--but sadly, the \nadministration did not respond. President Clinton has said it was the \nworst mistake of his administration. His candor and honesty are \nappreciated, but we should learn from that mistake.\n  Despite all of the world's solemn promises, today in Darfur, in \nwestern Sudan, another genocide rages. In a region of 6 million people, \nhundreds of thousands have been killed, and over 2 million people have \nbeen displaced. For them, the commitment of ``never again'' rings very \nhollow. Earlier this month, Sudan's President Omar Hassan al-Bashir \nsent a letter to the U.N. Secretary General rejecting the core elements \nof the plan to send U.N. peacekeepers to Darfur. Bashir claimed that \nU.N. and African peacekeeping forces have no authority to protect \ncivilians in his country, saying Sudan bears the primary \nresponsibility.\n  Four years into the genocide, the claim that the Khartoum regime will \nprotect civilians in Darfur is not only implausible, it is offensive. \nPresident Bashir has thumbed his nose at the international community. \nThe question is: How will we respond, once having declared a genocide?\n  Last week a U.N. human rights team reporting on Darfur called for \nU.N. Security Council intervention, tougher sanctions, and criminal \nprosecution of guilty parties. They also called for the international \ncommunity's response to the genocide in Darfur immediately.\n  The U.N. human rights team is led by Jody Williams, a genuine \nAmerican hero who won the Nobel Peace Prize for her efforts to ban \nlandmines. Upon completing her investigation of Darfur, Ms. Williams \nhad a message for the international community. She said:\n\n       If you're not prepared to act on what you say, don't say \n     it.\n\n  Jody Williams is right. We have to do more than just talk about \ngenocide in Darfur. Today, joined by Senator Sam Brownback, a \nRepublican of Kansas, and 30 of my colleagues, I sent a letter to the \nPresident urging him to put the question of meaningful multilateral \nsanctions to a vote before the U.N. Security Council. We have been told \nin the past that one of the permanent members of this council may veto \nthe resolution. I say: So be it. Let that nation stand up in front of \nthe world and say they are going to veto this effort to stop this mass \nmurder.\n  We recognize there are political risks to advancing this strategy, \nbut it is time to weigh those risks against the damage that is being \ndone and the verdict of history. It is our moral obligation to do \neverything we can to stop this genocide in Darfur.\n  Another important step is to make clear the commitment of the United \nStates to hold accountable those who are guilty of this ultimate crime. \nIt is hard to imagine that individuals in the Sudanese Government whom \nwe have identified as being involved in genocide have come to the \nUnited States and have been treated as visiting dignitaries, and have \ntraveled with impunity around our Nation. It is hard to imagine we \nwould turn our back on the fact of what they have done in their own \nhome country.\n  I am pleased the International Criminal Court is moving forward with \nthis investigation into the Darfur genocide, but that does not excuse \nthe United States from its obligation to prosecute war criminals who \nseek safe haven or even travel in the United States.\n  It is not just Darfur. The Justice Department has identified \nindividuals who participated in the Rwandan and Bosnian genocides \nliving now in the United States under false pretenses. How can we let \nthe United States be a safe haven for those who are guilty of genocide \naround the world? The fact is the law is on their side. American law \ndoesn't give us the authority to arrest and prosecute these \nindividuals, and that is why I have introduced this legislation, to \nchange the law and let them know they can no longer seek a safe haven \nin the United States.\n  The Genocide Accountability Act says if you commit genocide anywhere \nin the world and come to the United States, America will hold you \naccountable under the law. This is the first legislation produced by \nthe Human Rights Subcommittee. There will be more bills to follow. But \nI doubt the subcommittee or any other committee in Congress will face \nanother issue as compelling as this genocide in Darfur.\n  In 1862, 1 month before he signed the Emancipation Proclamation, \nPresident Abraham Lincoln sent a message to Congress proposing to end \nslavery. His words reach us even today when he said:\n\n       We--even we here--hold the power and bear the \n     responsibility.\n\n  Those words remain true. We here, even now, hold the power and bear \nthe responsibility to do all we can to stop this genocide. Enacting the \nGenocide Accountability Act is an important step to ending impunity for \nperpetrators of genocide.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. I \nask unanimous consent that the letter which was sent to the President \nbe printed in the Record.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 22, 2007.\n     The President,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: We write to you as Members of Congress \n     who are deeply concerned about the ongoing genocide in Darfur \n     and equally frustrated by the inability or unwillingness of \n     the international community to put a halt to it. Last August, \n     the United Nations Security Council passed UNSC Resolution \n     1706, which expanded the mandate of the United Nations \n     Mission in Sudan to include Darfur and stated that over \n     20,000 military and civilian police personnel were to be \n     deployed as peacekeepers in the region. Over six months have \n     passed and fewer than 200 UN personnel have been deployed \n     because of the Sudanese government's refusal to comply with \n     what the Security Council has authorized.\n       History demonstrates that Sudan's leadership does not \n     respond to this type of request. We believe that it is time \n     for the Security Council to enact a new resolution, imposing \n     multilateral economic sanctions on the Sudanese government \n     and targeted sanctions on individuals named by the UN \n     Commission of inquiry as being responsible for crimes against \n     humanity.\n       We recognize that previous U.S.-led efforts to move \n     stronger resolutions at the Security\n\n[[Page S3605]]\n\n     Council have been deterred by the threat of a veto by one or \n     more of the Permanent Members. We frankly urge you to \n     introduce and push for a vote on a resolution imposing \n     multilateral sanctions regardless. Let a country stand before \n     the community of nations and announce that it is vetoing the \n     best effort we can muster to build the leverage necessary to \n     end ongoing mass murder.\n       There are political risks to advancing this strategy, but \n     we urge you to weigh those risks against the verdict of \n     history if we fail to try. If the Security Council does not \n     act, the United States should engage with our allies to \n     create a coalition that will impose economic penalties on the \n     Sudanese government. The United States has already \n     implemented a number of unilateral sanctions, and we \n     understand that you are considering still more, a development \n     that we would applaud. However. the real key to changing \n     Khartoum's behavior most likely lies in multilateral \n     sanctions, especially those aimed at the Sudanese oil \n     industry.\n       We encourage you to put this matter before the United \n     Nations Security Council as soon as possible. A threatened \n     veto should not silence us.\n       We know that you share our commitment to this issue and we \n     commend your courage in recognizing this genocide for what it \n     is. We look forward to continuing our efforts until a timely \n     solution to the crisis in Darfur is found.\n           Sincerely,\n         Dick Durbin, Joe Biden, Carl Levin, Russell D.

A bill to establish an adolescent literacy program; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, today Senator Murray and I are pleased \nto introduce the Striving Readers Act, for the eight million middle and \nhigh school students across this country who are not reading well \nenough to\n\n[[Page S3610]]\n\nsucceed in school. I thank Senator Murray for her longstanding \nleadership on this issue, as well as the Alliance for Excellent \nEducation, the International Reading Association, and the National \nAssociation of Secondary School Principals. I also thank my colleagues, \nRepublican and Democrat, who have agreed to cosponsor the bill Senator \nCochran, Senator Kerry, Senator Lott, Senator Akaka, Senator Burr, \nSenator Dodd, Senator Domenici, Senator Bingaman, and Senator Lincoln. \nI thank them for their support and for demonstrating that improving \nreading and writing in every grade is something we all can get behind.\n  This important bill will help schools in every State ensure our \nadolescents read and write well enough to learn in school, graduate on \ntime, and succeed in college and the workplace. Better literacy is the \ncornerstone to improving student achievement in all subjects, lowering \ndropout rates, and ensuring students do well when they go on to college \nor the workforce. A recent study by the American College Testing \nProgram (ACT) found that students with better literacy skills in high \nschool do better in their math, science, and social studies courses \nboth in high school and in college.\n  The Striving Readers Act marks an important effort to improve reading \nfor the older student. Last year, Congress appropriated $1 billion for \nthe Reading First program available for every State to ensure children \nread by the third grade. That was an important step, and we have seen \n4th grade reading scores rise nationally because of it. However, \nresearch shows that many readers who test well in 4th grade do not \ncarry that knowledge into upper grades. We must not risk squandering \nthe investment Congress has already made for younger students.\n  Seventy percent of our middle and high school students read below \ngrade level. That means we must continue our support for ongoing \nprograms that reflect the needs of the older student for more advanced \nvocabulary and comprehension skills. All students, throughout their K-\n12 educational experience, deserve adequate support to ensure they \ngraduate on time with appropriate skills and knowledge that meet the \ndemands of the 21st century.\n  To be sure, some problems with the Reading First program have \nsurfaced. Let me assure you that the Striving Readers bill addresses \nthose problems to ensure the law and its implementation are fair, \ntransparent, and driven by research, not special interests. \nInterestingly, many in my State have told me that the law is good and \nshowing results; the problems have come with poor implementation.\n  Low literacy skills don't just cost the student; they cost our \neconomy because students don't learn what they should in school. The \nNational Center for Education Statistics found that 53 percent of \nundergraduates require remediation. One-half of these students required \na remedial writing course, and 35 percent took remedial reading. That \nmeans community colleges spend $1.4 billion every year catching kids up \nto where they should have been when they graduated. The Mackinac Center \nfor Public Policy reports an estimated $16.6 billion in remediation \ncosts to the U.S. economy each year. This means that America's \nbusinesses and colleges are spending $16.6 billion teaching high school \ngraduates skills they should have learned in high school.\n  America's declining competitiveness in the global economy is due in \npart to sub-par literacy skills. International comparisons of reading \nperformance placed American 11th graders close to the bottom, behind \nstudents from the Philippines, Indonesia, Brazil, and other developing \nnations. Our high school graduates continue to lag, as employers move \njobs overseas, not for the low-cost labor alone, but also to tap into \nthe highly literate, motivated, and technologically skilled workers \nthat other nations can offer them.\n  The Striving Readers Act will help our Nation raise its literacy \nlevels and compete in a global arena. We can do this. Research shows \nthat adolescents with lagging literacy skills can master college \nmaterial if they receive good literacy instruction in school.\n  Specifically, the Striving Readers bill would do the following:\n  Help States create statewide literacy initiatives, share data on \nstudent progress with parents and the public, and improve teacher \ntraining and professional development in literacy so that all students \nreceive high quality instruction.\n  Help districts and schools create plans to improve literacy, \nincluding targeted interventions for students far below grade level, \ntop notch assessments for all students, training for teachers in every \nsubject to incorporate literacy strategies, and regular data to improve \nteaching and learning.\n  Allow districts and schools to hire and place literacy coaches, train \nparents to support the literacy development of their child, and connect \nlearning inside the classroom with learning that takes place outside \nthe classroom.\n  Ensure States, districts, and schools participate in a rigorous \nevaluation that demonstrates student progress.\n  Require the Federal Government to complete an overall evaluation of \nthe program to determine its impact on the Nation's middle and high \nschools.\n  I am proud to say that my State has been working on this issue for a \nlong time. In 1998 Alabama launched the Alabama Reading Initiative \n(ARI), a statewide program designed to ensure every student in grades K \nto 12 is proficient in reading. We provide ongoing, research-based \ntraining to teachers in all subjects so that every educator can help \nstudents struggling to read. Fortunately, the Alabama Reading \nInitiative is now in every elementary school in the State. \nUnfortunately, fewer middle and high schools have been able to take \npart, due to limited funding. This is true in other States as well.\n  For those schools in the program we have seen great gains. ARI \nschools have made great progress, and those that have had the benefit \nof additional funding from the Federal Reading First program have shown \neven more rapid, dramatic gains. Many of you have heard of the \noutstanding impact of the Alabama Reading Initiative, primarily for \nyounger children. It is time for us to develop new methods to meet the \nneeds of students in the upper grades who are reading and writing below \ngrade level. I applaud Alabama's leadership on this important issue as \nthey work to expand the Alabama Reading Initiative into middle and high \nschools, and I am honored to offer legislation to promote this effort \non the national level. I would like to thank Governor Riley for his \ncommitment to the Alabama Reading Initiative, and Dr. Katherine \nMitchell, whose enthusiasm and hard work has made the success of ARI a \nreality for Alabama's children. Alabama has become a model for the \nNation, and I am so proud of the progress they have made.\n  The Federal Government cannot and should assume the responsibility \nfor education from the States. But we can develop research, supply seed \nmoney, and provide leadership to help States make advancements, without \nunnecessary mandates. We can leverage success in places like Alabama to \nshine a light for others.\n  We know that, given the right instruction and opportunity, children \ncan learn to read and write well and use that knowledge to achieve at \nhigher levels of education. I hope that our colleagues in the Senate \nwill join Senator Murray and me in supporting the Striving Readers Act. \nAnd I hope we will authorize Striving Readers as part of No Child Left \nBehind so that children in every State have the reading skills they \nneed to succeed in school, college, and the workplace.\n  Ms. MURRAY. Mr. President, today Senator SESSIONS and I are pleased \nto introduce the Striving Readers Act. This bipartisan bill will help \nAmerica's middle and high school students gain the literacy skills they \nneed to succeed in school and graduate ready for college and the \nworkplace.\n  I want to thank Senator Sessions for his work on this issue and for \nshining a light on his State's success in raising literacy achievement. \nI also want to thank our original cosponsors Senators Akaka, Bingaman, \nDodd, Kerry, Lincoln, Burr, Cochran, Domenici, and Lott for partnering \nwith us. Finally, I offer thanks to our staff, Kathryn Young and Liz \nStillwell, who have worked on this bill, and the Alliance for Excellent \nEducation, the International Reading Association, and the National \nAssociation of Secondary School Principals for their work.\n  Our bill addresses a serious problem. Today 8 million middle and high \nschool\n\n[[Page S3611]]\n\nstudents across the Nation cannot read well enough to succeed in \nschool. This contributes to their likelihood to disengage and drop out. \nThose that do graduate too often falter when they begin college or work \nand then need remediation.\n  All around the country educators and stakeholders are working to \nimprove literacy, and this bill gives us a way to support their \nefforts. We know that literacy is at the base of every academic \nsubject, and it is crucial to student academic success.\n  Our bill will engage and reinvigorate those students on the brink of \nfailure. The Striving Readers Act constitutes a comprehensive effort to \ngive States, districts, and schools the resources they need to ensure \nevery student reads and writes well enough to succeed. It would provide \ngrants to every State to develop State literacy initiatives that guide \nand support districts and schools to improve reading and writing. It \nwould provide grants to districts and schools to assist students who \nare below grade level and to train teachers in core subjects in \nliteracy strategies for all students. It would also provide new \ninformation on what works for struggling readers by conducting \nevaluations of programs.\n  This bill could not come at a more important time. In Washington \nState, 66 percent of 8th graders read below ``Proficient'' on the \nNational Assessment of Educational Progress. These students, who are at \nthe bottom in terms of achievement, are more likely to drop out than \nthose at the top. Among this group, minority students' scores are of \nparticular concern. Seventy-three percent of Washington State's \nAfrican-American students and 85 percent of Hispanic students read \nbelow the ``Proficient'' level. These students are falling behind, and \nthey need our support.\n  I'm pleased to report that my State has made great efforts to remedy \nthe problem of low literacy levels. My State launched the Washington \nState Reading Initiative in 2003 to provide support to struggling \nreaders in every grade, including middle and high school. Since then, \nour K-12 Reading Model has attracted national attention as a systematic \nreform model. Our program includes statewide training for teachers to \nidentify and provide intervention for students at all grade levels. My \nState trains teachers in all subjects to teach reading strategies to \nstudents. And my State provides guidance to teachers and administrators \nfor applying best practices in classrooms. But they should not have to \ncontinue these efforts alone.\n  The challenges we face in Washington are not unique; every State \nstruggles with adolescent literacy. Nationally 71 percent of 8th \ngraders and 65 percent of 12th graders read below grade level. It \nshould not surprise us, then, that only 34 percent of American \nteenagers graduate with the skills they need to do well in college or \nin the workforce.\n  If we are to remain globally competitive, Congress must authorize and \nfund a significant adolescent literacy investment for every State. The \nStriving Readers Act would fulfill this need. As a country, we \ncurrently only substantially support reading initiatives through the \nthird grade. International comparisons of reading performance placed \nAmerican 11th graders close to the bottom, behind students from the \nPhilippines, Indonesia, Brazil, and other developing nations. The \nStriving Readers Act will help support these middle and high schoolers \nand help our Nation raise its literacy levels to compete in a global \nmarket.\n  Students are not the only ones who pay the price for low literacy \nachievement. With every student who falls behind, our economy suffers. \nThe National Center for Education Statistics found that 53 percent of \nundergraduates require remediation. One-half of these students required \na remedial writing course, and 35 percent took remedial reading. That \nmeans community colleges spend $1.4 billion every year catching kids up \nto where they should have been when they graduated. The Mackinac Center \nfor Public Policy reports that America's businesses and colleges are \nspending $16.6 billion each year to teach graduates what they should \nhave learned in middle and high school. This is a costly consequence of \nfailing to intervene in a timely manner. We must not continue to make \nthis mistake at the expense of students' futures.\n  The good news is that research shows we can help struggling students \nmake progress. For example, research shows that adolescents with \nlagging literacy skills can master college material if they receive \nhigh quality literacy instruction in school. In fact, a recent study by \nACT found that students with better literacy skills in high school do \nbetter in their math, science, and social studies courses--both in high \nschool and in college. Better literacy is the foundation for improving \nstudent achievement in all subjects, lowering dropout rates, and \nensuring students do well when they go on to college or the workforce. \nThe Striving Readers bill provides a path for this.\n  Specifically, the Striving Readers bill would: Help States create \nstatewide literacy initiatives, share data on student progress to \nparents and the public, and improve teacher training and professional \ndevelopment in literacy so that all students receive high quality \ninstruction.\n  Help districts and schools create plans to improve literacy, \nincluding targeted interventions for students way below grade level, \ntop notch assessments for all students, training for teachers in every \nsubject to incorporate literacy strategies, and regular data to improve \nteaching and learning.\n  Allow districts and schools to hire and place literacy coaches, train \nparents to support the literacy development of their child, or connect \nlearning inside the classroom with learning that takes place outside \nthe classroom.\n  Ensure States, districts, and schools participate in a rigorous \nevaluation that demonstrates student progress.\n  Require the Federal Government to complete an overall evaluation of \nthe program to determine its impact on the Nation's middle and high \nschools.\n  The Striving Readers Act comprises a necessary and urgent investment \nin adolescent students. We created the Reading First program to \nstrengthen students' reading skills in the elementary grades. While I \ndo have major concerns with the implementation of this program, the \nintent of the law and the commitment to elementary reading skills is \nundoubtedly positive. But with reading proficiency stagnating after 4th \ngrade, it is clear that we need a significant investment in the higher \ngrades as well. In crafting the Striving Readers bill, we took steps to \ncorrect and guard against implementation concerns, and I believe that \nthis bill will provide the critical resources, training, and evaluation \nto implement high quality adolescent literacy initiatives around the \ncountry.\n  I introduced the PASS Act, first in 2003, and in subsequent \nlegislation, to take a comprehensive approach to improving student \nachievement in our Nation's high schools, including use of literacy and \nmath coaches, as well as research-based support for high schools with \nthe most need. The Striving Readers Act will complement this and allow \nStates and schools to effectively address the literacy needs of \nadolescents in 4th grade and up.\n  Now is the time to invest in literacy for older students and make \ntheir success a reality. This issue cannot wait any longer. I hope that \nmy colleagues in the Senate will join Senator Sessions and me in \nsupporting the Striving Readers Act. And I hope we will authorize \nStriving Readers as part of No Child Left Behind so that children in \nevery State have the reading skills they need to succeed in school, \ncollege, and the workplace.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. CLINTON (for herself, Mr. Reid, Mr. Alexander, Ms. \n        Mikulski, Mr. Menendez, Mr. Dodd, and Mr. Durbin):\n  S. 959. A bill to award grant to enable Teach for America, Inc., to \nimplement and expand its teaching program; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \nincrease the number of high-need school districts and communities \nserved by Teach For America. My legislation will address the need to \nbuild a pipeline of talented teachers to prepare our children to \ncompete in the global economy.\n  As the teaching population ages, more and more schools will face \nsignificant shortages of qualified and motivated teachers. Schools \nacross the country will need to replace at least 1 million teachers \nover the next ten\n\n[[Page S3612]]\n\nyears. Our Nation's inner cities and rural communities will be even \nharder hit as their teachers move to suburban schools or leave the \nteaching profession altogether. That is why I am sponsoring the Teach \nFor America Act.\n  Teach For America is the national corps of exceptional recent college \ngraduates of all academic majors who commit two years to teach in \npublic schools. Teach For America's corps members and alumni become \nlifelong leaders in the effort to ensure that all children in our \nNation have an equal chance to succeed in life. Since its inception in \n1990, more than 12,000 individuals have joined Teach For America, \ndirectly impacting the lives of over 2 million students in under-\nresourced schools across the country.\n  This legislation will help Teach For America grow to over 7,500 corps \nmembers in 32 communities teaching over 600,000 low-income students \nevery day. It will do so by providing funding for Teach For America to \nexpand its program of recruiting, selecting, training, and supporting \nnew teachers.\n  Teach For America's alumni lead the way for fundamental long-term \nchange across the country. After their two years of service, 63 percent \nof Teach For America alumni remain in education as teachers, \nprincipals, school founders and policy advisors. Others, equipped with \ninsight gained through their classroom experience, go on to work in a \nvariety of fields--including law, medicine, and social work--and \ncontinue to increase opportunities for children living in low-income \ncommunities.\n  The Teach For America Act addresses the need to effectively build a \ncorps of dedicated, talented college graduates to teach and make a \nlasting impact in our underserved communities. I am hopeful that my \nSenate colleagues from both sides of the aisle will join me in moving \nthis legislation to the floor without delay.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. CLINTON (for herself, Mr. Specter, Ms. Mikulski, Mrs. \n        Boxer, Mr. Biden, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Kennedy, and Mrs. \n        Hutchison):\n  S. 960. A bill to establish the United States Public Service Academy; \nto the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nthat will create an undergraduate institution designed to cultivate a \ngeneration of young leaders dedicated to public service. The United \nStates Public Service Academy Act, (The PSA Act), will form a national \nacademy to serve as an extraordinary example of effective, national \npublic education.\n  The tragic events of September 11 and the devastation of natural \ndisasters such as Hurricanes Katrina and Rita underscore how much our \nNation depends on strong public institutions and competent civilian \nleadership at all levels of society.\n  We must take a step forward in the 110th Congress with a positive \nagenda to ensure competent civilian leadership and improve our Nation's \nability to respond to future emergencies and to confront daily \nchallenges. That is why Senator Specter and I have come together to \nsponsor the PSA Act.\n  This legislation will create the U.S. Public Service Academy to groom \nfuture public servants and build a corps of capable civilian leaders. \nModeled after the military service academies, this academy will provide \na four-year, federally-subsidized college education for more than 5,000 \nstudents a year in exchange for a five year commitment to public \nservice.\n  The PSA Act will meet critical national needs as the baby-boomer \ngeneration approaches retirement. Already, studies show looming \nshortages in the Federal civil service, public education, law \nenforcement, the non-profit sector and other essential areas. Academy \ngraduates will help to fill the void in public service our Nation will \nsoon face by serving for five years in areas such as public education, \npublic health, and law enforcement.\n  Unfortunately our young people are priced out of public service \ncareers all too often with the average college graduate owing more than \n$20,000 in student loans. A recent study conducted by the Higher \nEducation Research Institute found that more than two-thirds of the \n2005 freshman class expressed a desire to serve others, the highest \nrate in a generation. By providing a service-oriented education at no \ncost to the student, the PSA Act will tap into the strong desire to \nserve that already exists among college students while erasing the \nburden of enormous college debt.\n  The establishment of a United States Public Service Academy is an \ninnovative way to strengthen and protect America by creating a corps of \nwell-trained, highly-qualified civilian leaders. I am hopeful that my \nSenate colleagues from both sides of the aisle will join me today to \nmove this legislation to the floor without delay.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself, Mr. Domenici, Mr. Tester, Mr. \n        Bunning, Mr. Salazar, Mr. Obama, and Mr. Webb):\n  S. 962. A bill to amend the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to reauthorize \nand improve the carbon capture and storage research, development, and \ndemonstration program of the Department of Energy and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be able to introduce the \nDepartment of Energy Carbon Capture and Storage Research, Development, \nand Demonstration Act of 2007, along with my co-sponsors, Senators \nDomenici, Tester, Bunning, Salazar, Obama, and Webb. This bipartisan \nbill reauthorizes and improves the carbon capture and storage program \nat the Department of Energy that was first explicitly authorized in the \nEnergy Policy Act of 2005. With the attention that the topic of global \nwarming has been getting, it is becoming ever clearer that we need \nanswers to the practical questions of what needs to occur so that we \ncan decide on the role that carbon capture and storage will play in our \nfuture energy system. This bill, as well as a bill that has previously \nbeen referred to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, S. 731, \nbegins to lay the foundation for a bipartisan and effective approach to \nthese issues.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 962\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to authorize the Secretary of Education to make grants \nto educational organizations to carry out educational programs about \nthe Holocaust; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Simon \nWiesenthal Holocaust Education Assistance Act. This important \nlegislation would provide competitive grants for educational \norganizations to make Holocaust education more accessible and available \nthroughout this Nation.\n  I would like to thank Senators Lautenberg and Specter for co-\nsponsoring this bill, and I commend my former colleague in the House, \nCongresswoman Maloney, for her leadership on this issue.\n  In January, the United Nations held a ceremony to commemorate the \n62nd anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz and the second annual \nInternational Day of Commemoration in memory of the victims of the \nHolocaust. This event served as a reminder that people of all faiths \nstrongly condemn the systematic, state sponsored genocide conducted by \nthe Nazi regime.\n  We will forever remember the approximately six million Jewish men, \nwomen and children, as well as millions of others who faced persecution \nand death. And we extend our gratitude to all who risked their lives \ntrying to save others. We also honor Simon Wiesenthal, who dedicated \nhis life to making sure that those who perpetrated the horrors of the \nHolocaust were brought to justice.\n  After six decades, many of our youth may view the Holocaust as an \nevent that occurred in the distant past. But the truth is this issue is \npart of our present day society.\n  Just 3 months ago, Iran held a conference in Tehran to debate whether \nor not the Holocaust actually happened, and the Iranian government has \nestablished a fact finding commission to examine the issue further. \nSuch despicable acts are an insult to the millions of people who were \nbrutalized and murdered by the Nazis and to all who stand against \ngenocide around the world. Clearly, false and destructive messages \nregarding the Holocaust are still being perpetuated, and such events \nhighlight the importance of Holocaust education abroad and within our \nown Nation.\n  Unfortunately, we have also seen that anti-Semitism continues to \nthreaten the safety and well-being of Jewish men and women throughout \nthe world. In February, a Polish member of the European Parliament \npublished a booklet espousing anti-Jewish sentiments, and in Croatia, \nan investigation has begun after small sugar packets bearing Hitler's \nimage and containing Holocaust jokes were found in some cafes. These \ntragic events underscore the need to be proactive in combating such \nbigotry and educating our youth.\n\n  Although some States now require the Holocaust to be taught in public \nschools, the Simon Wiesenthal Holocaust Education Assistance Act goes \nfurther and makes grants available to organizations that instruct \nstudents, teachers, and communities about the dangers of hate and the \nimportance of tolerance in our society. This legislation would give \neducators the appropriate resources and training to teach accurate \nhistorical information about the Holocaust and convey the lessons that \nthe Holocaust can teach us today.\n  We must recognize that by remembering the millions who were murdered \nin the Holocaust, we create a sense of responsibility to stop genocide \nwherever it takes place.\n  It is in our common interest to raise our voices against anti-\nSemitism and against all hatred and discrimination. Funding accurate \neducational programs on the Holocaust is a step toward winning this \nbattle.\n  So as America stands with Israel and all followers of the Jewish \nfaith in condemning anti-Semitism, let us do everything in our power to \nend discrimination and educate future generations about the danger of \nhatred and bigotry.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA:\n  S. 967. A bill to amend chapter 41 of title 5, United States Code, to \nprovide for the establishment and authorization of funding for certain \ntraining programs for supervisors of Federal employees; to the \nCommittee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to reintroduce the Federal \nSupervisor Training Act to enhance Federal employee and manager \nperformance, and, in turn, agency performance.\n  Our Nation's public servants administer a vast array of programs \ndesigned to meet the needs of the citizens of this country, and indeed \nthe world. These employees deserve the support and guidance of trained \nmanagers who empower them to perform effectively. Furthermore, \nemployees must have a clear understanding of their roles and \nresponsibilities. Training programs help managers and supervisors \nimprove their communication skills and promote stronger manager-\nemployee relationships.\n  While the Federal Government encourages management and supervisory \ntraining, the development and implementation of training programs is \nleft to the discretion of individual agencies. This leads to \ninconsistent guidance on training and sometimes inadequate training due \nto an agency's other priorities and limited resources. Meaningful \ntraining matters. Training should not be discretionary for agencies.\n  Given the growing number of Federal managers who are eligible to \nretire, and the need to attract a robust, well-skilled workforce, it is \nimportant that employees, who are expected to manage and supervise, \nhave the tools to do so effectively.\n  In January 2007, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) released \nthe 2006 Federal Human Capital Survey,\n\n[[Page S3614]]\n\nwhich showed that the federal government's employees and senior \nmanagers and leaders still face communication problems. For example, \naccording to the survey: only 49 percent of Federal employees have a \nhigh level of respect for senior leaders in their agencies, only 41 \npercent say they are satisfied with their leaders' policies and \npractices, and only 47 percent of Federal employees said they were \nsatisfied with the information they get from management.\n  Upon the release of the survey, OPM Director Linda Springer wrote, \n``As many senior leaders retire, the Federal Government also faces a \nchallenge--and opportunity--to improve the effectiveness of the \nleadership corps across Government. We must develop the kinds of \nleaders who can ensure a talented and committed Federal workforce now \nand in the future. Our leaders will need to adapt the workplaces and \nopportunities they offer to attract the best and the brightest from \ndiverse talent pools.''\n  Good leadership begins with strong management training. It is time to \nensure that Federal managers receive appropriate training to supervise \nfederal employees. I believe the Federal Supervisor Training Act will \nhelp us reach that goal. My bill will bridge the training gap that \nexists now and help ensure that Federal managers have the necessary \nskills to communicate with and manage Federal employees.\n  The Federal Supervisor Training Act has three major training \ncomponents. First, the bill will require that new supervisors receive \ntraining in the initial 12 months on the job, with mandatory retraining \nevery three years on how to work with employees to develop performance \nexpectations and evaluate employees. Current managers will have three \nyears to obtain their initial training. Second, the bill requires \nmentoring for new supervisors and training on how to mentor employees. \nThird, the measure requires training on the laws governing and the \nprocedures for enforcing whistleblower and anti-discrimination rights.\n  In addition, my bill will: set standards that supervisors should meet \nin order to manage employees effectively, assess a manager's ability to \nmeet these standards, and provide training to improve areas identified \nin personnel assessments.\n  I am delighted by the support my bill has received from the \nGovernment Managers Coalition, which represents members of the Senior \nExecutives Association, the Federal Managers Association, the \nProfessional Managers Association, the Federal Aviation Administration \nManagers Association, and the National Council of Social Security \nManagement Associations; the American Federation of Government \nEmployees; the National Treasury Employees Union; the International \nFederation of Professional and Technical Engineers; the AFL-CIO, Metal \nTrades Department, as well as the Partnership for Public Service. I \nbelieve this broad support, from employee unions to management \nassociations to outside good government groups demonstrates the need of \nmandatory training programs and passage of this bill. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this important legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 967\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to provide \nincreased assistance for the prevention, treatment, and control of \ntuberculosis, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today, I rise to introduce the bipartisan \nStop TB Now Act of 2007. I am joined in this effort by Senators Gordon \nSmith, Dick Durbin, and Sherrod Brown.\n  For 8 years, I have worked with Senator Smith to fight the spread of \ninternational tuberculosis. I appreciate his help on this bill. I am \nalso grateful for the support of Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin, as \nwell as Senator Brown, who was the leader on international TB issues \nwhen he was a member of the House of Representatives.\n  The need for this legislation is clear. Tuberculosis kills 1.6 \nmillion people per year--1 person every 15 seconds. One-third of the \nworld is infected with the bacteria that causes TB and an estimated 8.8 \nmillion individuals develop active TB each year. And tuberculosis is a \nleading cause of death among women of reproductive age and of people \nwho are HIV-positive.\n  While developing nations are most heavily impacted by TB, there is \nalso a concern here at home. My State of California has more TB cases \nthan any other State in the country and 10 of the top 20 U.S. metro \nareas with the highest TB rates are in California.\n  The best way to treat TB is through DOTS, which stands for directly \nobserved treatment, short course. This treatment ensures a steady and \nuninterrupted supply of drugs to prevent the spread of multi-drug \nresistant TB. It costs just $20-100 per person to treat regular TB with \nDOTS. But it costs 1,400 times that amount to treat a person with \nmulti-drug resistant TB.\n  Today, we face an even more dangerous problem--the outbreak of \nextremely drug resistant TB. In some cases, this form of TB is \nuntreatable. In one South African town, 53 TB patients were found to \nhave XDR-TB. All but one died. We must fully fund international TB \ncontrol efforts because drug-resistant TB happens when people fail to \ncomplete treatment.\n  To stop the spread of tuberculosis, the international community came \ntogether last year to develop the Global Plan to Stop TB, a \ncomprehensive assessment of the resources and actions needed to cut the \nnumber of TB deaths in half by 2015.\n  My bill will bring U.S. policy in line with this plan by authorizing \n$330 million for fiscal year 2008 and $450 million for fiscal year \n2009. for foreign assistance programs that combat international TB. The \nbill also authorizes $70 million for fiscal year 2008 and $100 million \nfor fiscal year 2009 for the Centers for Disease Control programs to \ncombat international TB.\n  TB kills more people than any other curable disease in the world. We \nhave a moral obligation to take the steps necessary to meet this \nchallenge.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD (for himself, Mr. Durbin, and Mr. Kennedy):\n  S. 969. A bill to amend the National Labor Relations Act to modify \nthe definition of supervisor; to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Re-empowerment \nof Skilled and Professional Employees and Construction Tradeworkers \nAct, or RESPECT Act, a bill to amend the National Labor Relations Act \nto modify the definition of supervisor. I am pleased to be joined by \nSenators Durbin and Kennedy as original cosponsors and would like to \nacknowledge Congressman Andrews for championing this legislation in the \nHouse of Representatives.\n  The RESPECT Act would make vital changes to the definition of \nsupervisor to ensure that no employee is unjustly denied his or her \nright to join a labor union. This is a very simple bill just four lines \nof text making a few definitional changes to the National Labor \nRelations Act (NLRA). Yet the livelihoods of thousands, possibly \nmillions, of workers are at stake in those few lines. Workers \ndesignated as supervisors may not join a union or engage in collective \nbargaining. As a result, some employers have sought to deny many \nworkers their right to organize by unfairly classifying them as \nsupervisors. And unfortunately, President Bush's appointees on the \nNational Labor Relations Board (NLRB) have upheld these unfair \nclassifications.\n  The NLRB has struggled for years with the definition of supervisor. \nTwice in the last ten years, its attempts to define supervisory status \nhave been reviewed and rejected by the Supreme Court. But despite this, \nthe NLRB refused to hear oral arguments for the three decisions it \nhanded down last October--Oakwood Healthcare, Inc., Golden Crest \nHealthcare Center, and Croft Metals, Inc. These decisions are known \ncollectively as the Kentucky River decisions, after the 2001 Supreme \nCourt case of NLRB v. Kentucky River.\n  The NLRB ruled that many charge nurses are supervisors, even though \nthey have no authority to hire, fire, or discipline other employees. In \nthe course of their responsibilities to provide the best care possible \nto their patients, many rank-and-file nurses occasionally rotate \nthrough a limited oversight role, such as assigning other nurses to \npatients based on workload or a nurse's particular specialty. But on a \npretext as slim as that, employers would keep their workers from \nunionizing altogether.\n  In the Oakwood decision, the hospital argued that 127 of its 181 \nnurses were supervisors. Though the NLRB found that only 12 were in \nfact supervisors, its decision left the door open for widespread abuse. \nUnder its ruling, only 10 percent of a worker's time in a supervisory \ncapacity is enough to lock him or her out of a union.\n  Following that precedent, another hospital declared a ludicrous \nnumber of its registered nurses to be supervisors--and an NLRB Regional \nDirector agreed. 17 of 20 registered nurses in the Intensive Care Unit \nwere declared supervisors; 6 of 7 in the Medical Unit; 9 of 11 in \nNeonatal Intensive Care; and in the Inpatient Rehabilitation Unit--all \n7. Fictitious classifications like these show just how far some will go \nto keep workers from bargaining fairly. And, sadly, they demonstrate \njust how far the NLRB will go to facilitate these false and unfair \nclassifications.\n  Though recent NLRB decisions have targeted nurses, the dangerous \nprecedent they set threatens the rights of workers in countless \nindustries. The NLRB has opened a Pandora's box: Laborers who sometimes \nwork with assistants, or skilled craftsmen who take apprentices, can be \nbarred from unions by the same false logic that prevents nurses from \norganizing.\n  These decisions are written on more than paper. They're written on \nreal lives, on workers in the thousands and millions, on the dignity of \ntheir labor, the health of their children, and the security of their \nold age. For them, legal fiction becomes painful fact: Without their \nfair seat at the table, workers will possibly see lower wages, longer \nhours, more dangerous working conditions, and threats to their \nhealthcare and retirement.\n  The services they provide will suffer as well. Take the case of \nnurses: Many fear retribution if they speak out on their own about \nunsafe practices that could endanger patients' lives. Instead, many \nrely on their unions to provide a strong, unified voice for improved \npatient care. It's in our interest to keep that voice strong--just one \nexample of how healthy unions benefit us all.\n  The bill introduced today, the RESPECT Act, offers a commonsense step \nto protect workers' rights. It deletes the terms ``assign'' and \n``responsibly to direct'' from the definition of supervisor--terms that \nthe NLRB drastically expanded to justify its rulings. The bill also \nwould require that, to be classified as a supervisor, an employee must \nactually be one by specifying that an employee must spend the majority \nof his or her worktime in a supervisory capacity.\n  That's hardly a radical innovation--in fact, it returns us to \nCongress's original intent. In 1947, the Senate Committee Report on \namendments to\n\n[[Page S3616]]\n\nthe National Labor Relations Act stated that:\n\n       the committee has not been unmindful of the fact that \n     certain employees with minor supervisory duties have problems \n     which may justify their inclusion in that act. It has \n     therefore distinguished between straw bosses, leadmen, set-up \n     men, and other minor supervisory employees, on the one hand, \n     and the supervisor vested with. . .genuine management \n     prerogatives.\n\n  Clearly, Congress did not intend to deny the right to organize to \nthose workers whose jobs require only occasional and minor supervisory \nduties. The RESPECT Act restores that sensible precedent.\n  It's not by chance that the rise of the labor movement coincided with \nthe rise of the largest and strongest middle class the world has ever \nseen. The achievements of the labor unions have made it possible for \nmany working men and women to send their children to college, to store \nup savings for sickness, injury, and old age--to move from deprivation \nto dignity. The labor movement greatly contributed to the strengthening \nof the American middle class.\n  Organized labor was opposed at every step--sometimes by intimidation, \nsometimes by violence, sometimes by propaganda. Today it is opposed by \nspecious reasoning and twisted definitions of a kind I've rarely seen \nin public life. I hope my colleagues will be moved to support this bill \nout of their respect for honesty alone. But add the fact that the \nsecurity and dignity of so many of their constituents depend on the \nright to organize and bargain, and the case becomes as clear as day. I \nurge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 969\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Re-empowerment of Skilled \n     and Professional Employees and Construction Tradesworkers \n     Act'' or the ``RESPECT Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. AMENDMENT OF THE NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS ACT.\n\n       Section 2(11) of the National Labor Relations Act (29 \n     U.S.C. 152(11)) is amended--\n       (1) by inserting ``and for a majority of the individual's \n     worktime'' after ``interest of the employer'';\n       (2) by striking ``assign,''; and\n       (3) by striking ``or responsibly to direct them,''.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I come to the floor to join Senator Dodd \nand Senator Kennedy in introducing the Re-empowerment of Skilled \nProfessional Employees and Construction Tradesworkers Act, also known \nas the RESPECT Act.\n  This legislation will amend the National Labor Relations Act to \nmodify the definition of ``supervisor.'' It is necessary because of \nrecent rulings by the National Labor Relations Board, which has \ndetermined that millions of workers do not fall within the definition \nof ``supervisor.'' An employee who is deemed a ``supervisor'' under the \nNational Labor Relations Act does not have collective bargaining rights \nor other labor protections.\n  The NLRB rulings in these so-called Kentucky River cases have an \nenormous impact on nurses. According to the amicus brief filed by the \nAmerican Nurses Association and United American Nurses, AFL-CIO, in \nthese cases, ``[o]f the more than 2.1 million people working as \nregistered nurses in the United States in the year 2002, 15.6 per cent \nwere union members. Registered nurses covered by a collective \nbargaining agreement can earn approximately 11 per cent more per week \nthan non-unionized nurses. . . .''\n  There are 800,000 nurses in this country--40,000 nurses in my home \nState of Illinois alone. We owe it to these nurses to find a workable \ndefinition of the term ``supervisor'' so that they and other \nprofessional employees and construction tradesworkers receive the labor \nprotections that Congress intended.\n  The supervisor exclusion was created in 1947 when Congress adopted \nthe Taft-Hartley amendments to the National Labor Relations Act. The \nAct defines ``supervisor'' as:\n\n       [A]ny individual having authority, in the interest of the \n     employer, to hire, transfer, suspend, lay off, recall, \n     promote, discharge, assign, reward, or discipline other \n     employees, or responsibly to direct them, or to adjust their \n     grievances, or effectively to recommend such action, if in \n     connection with the foregoing the exercise of such authority \n     is not of a merely routine or clerical nature, but requires \n     the use of independent judgment.\n\n  The interpretation and application of this definition has resulted in \nyears of litigation before the NLRB and courts of appeals. The United \nStates Supreme Court last spoke on the issue in 2001. In NLRB v. \nKentucky River Community Care, Inc., 532 U.S. 706 (2001), it reviewed \nthe Board's test for determining supervisory status and rejected the \nBoard's interpretation. The Supreme Court's decision left open the \ninterpretation of the term ``supervisor'' and three cases were filed \nbefore the National Labor Relations Board to address this issue: \nOakwood Healthcare, Inc., Case 7-CA-22141, Golden Crest Healthcare \nCenter, Cases 18-RC-16415 and 18-RC-16416, and Croft Metals, Inc., Case \n15-RC-8393.\n  The NLRB refused to hear oral argument in these cases despite the \nfact that its attempt to define supervisory status had been reviewed \nand rejected by the Supreme Court and it has been more than 5 years \nsince the Court's decision in Kentucky River. In July, I joined Senator \nKennedy and other Democrats in a letter to the Chairman of the NLRB to \nurge that the Board reconsider its decision not to allow oral arguments \nin these cases. The NLRB refused.\n  In October 2006, the Board issued its rulings and expanded the \nmeaning of the definition of ``supervisor'' by expanding the meaning of \nthe terms ``assign'' and ``responsibly to direct.'' The NLRB rulings \noverride the intent of Congress not to exclude minor supervisory \nofficials, professionals, skilled craftpersons, and nurses from labor \nprotections.\n  Last December, I noted that several States are suffering from nursing \nshortages. This legislation is necessary to alleviate the nursing \ncrisis. More than 72 percent of hospitals experience nursing shortages, \nand 1.2 million nursing positions need to be filled within the next \ndecade. By denying nurses the right to collectively bargain, pay will \nsurely decrease and the working environment of these nurses will \ndeteriorate, thereby driving even more nurses out of the profession and \ndiscouraging individuals from entering the field.\n  I urge my colleagues to join Senators Dodd, Kennedy, and I in \nsupporting the RESPECT Act--an important effort to help American \nnurses, other skilled professional employees, and construction \ntradesworkers.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SMITH (for himself, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. \n        Coleman, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Bayh, Mr. Kyl, Mr. \n        Thune, Ms. Mikulski, and Mr. Menendez):\n  S. 970. A bill to impose sanctions on Iran and on other countries for \nassisting Iran in developing a nuclear program, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to address a serious concern \nmore than 20 years in the making. In large part because of the secrecy \nover its nuclear program, America's National Security Strategy for 2006 \nidentifies Iran as one of the greatest challenges to the United States. \nThe Senate recognized this threat in January 2006 by unanimously \ncondemning Iran's refusal to comply with its nuclear nonproliferation \nobligations. Last September, this body unanimously passed mandatory \nsanctions on persons who knowingly helped Iran acquire or develop \nweapons of mass destruction. And all the while, Tehran continued its \npursuit of a nuclear program that, unchecked, will lead to a nuclear-\narmed Iran.\n  I cannot overestimate the threat that this poses to the security of \nthe United States and our allies. Since the revolution that brought it \nto power, the theocracy that rules over Iran has demonstrated its \ncontempt for the democratic ideals on which our country is based. It \nhas held its own people hostage in an effort to maintain absolute \ncontrol over their destiny. And it has spewed forth hate-filled \nrhetoric at regular intervals about the very existence of the state of \nIsrael--a valued American ally in the Middle East.\n  After years of vigorous diplomacy by Britain, France, and Germany \nfailed to\n\n[[Page S3617]]\n\npersuade the Iranians to give up their nuclear program, the United \nNations Security Council passed a resolution in December 2006 calling \nfor the suspension of all enrichment-related activities. Iran ignored \nthat demand, and instead, responded by stepping up their nuclear \nprogram. Inaction in the face of such an egregious challenge is a \nmockery of the international institutions where diplomatic solutions \nare tried and tested. Now is the time to use every tool in our arsenal \nshort of military force to stop the Iranian regime from developing \nnuclear weapons, and to send the message that the international \ncommunity will not tolerate flagrant violations of our combined will.\n  I have heard the calls of my colleagues that all efforts should be \nmade to avoid military intervention in Iran. I agree with them \nentirely. But Mr. President, I will not stand idle while up to 3,000 \ncentrifuges in Natanz enrich uranium that one day soon could tip a \nwarhead aimed at the U.S. or our allies around the world.\n  Today I am introducing legislation designed to persuade Tehran to \ngive up its nuclear ambitions. The Iran Counter-Proliferation Act of \n2007 will significantly strengthen our economic sanctions against Iran \nand any entities that choose to support the regime. I am pleased that \nSenator Durbin has joined me in this effort, as well as Senators \nColeman, Lautenberg, Brownback, Lieberman, Kyl, Bayh, and Thune.\n  This legislation urges the Administration to pursue measures in the \ninternational financial sector to restrict financing in Iran and \nencourages foreign state-owned entities to cease investment in Iran's \nenergy sector. It prohibits all imports from and exports to Iran. It \nforbids any action that would extend preferential trade treatment to \nIran or that would lead to Iranian accession to the WTO. And it freezes \nassets of senior Iranian officials and their families. By cutting off \nIran's access to the hard currency it needs, we can increase the cost \nof their decision to pursue its nuclear program.\n  The legislation also singles out Russia--a country that has \ncontributed significantly to the development of Iran's nuclear program \nand has significant financial ties with Tehran. Among other \nrestrictions, the bill prevents the United States from moving forward \nwith a multi-billion dollar nuclear cooperation agreement with Moscow \nuntil the President certifies that Russia has suspended its nuclear \nassistance and the transfers of any conventional weapons and missiles \nto Iran. The Russians may feel this is unfair, particularly in light of \ntheir recent announcement they would suspend the delivery of nuclear \nfuel to Iran's Bushehr reactor. I am pleased with this decision and \nhope that it is the beginning of a new view in Moscow of Iran's nuclear \nprogram. But we must remember that over the past decade, Russia has \nperiodically suspended its nuclear assistance to Iran only to resume \nthis assistance at a later date.\n  The Iran Counter-Proliferation Act also seeks to bring to light the \nnames of companies that continue to feel it is appropriate to do \nbusiness with the mullahs in Tehran. It requires the Administration to \nsubmit an annual report to Congress listing any foreign investments in \nIran's energy sector since January 1 of this year and a determination \non whether such investment is sanctionable under the Iran Sanctions \nAct. And it requires a report listing companies with American \noperations, whether or not they are incorporated in the United States, \nwhich invest in Iran.\n  In a further effort to highlight the cost to Iran of ignoring the \ndemands of the international community, this legislation will reduce \nour contributions to the World Bank by the percentage of total money \nthe World Bank loans to entities in Iran. The United States does not \nsupport these loans, and I urge those countries contributing the most \nto the World Bank to oppose such loans in the future.\n  Finally, Mr. President, the Iran Counter-Proliferation Act calls on \nthe Administration to designate the Iranian Revolutionary Guard as a \nForeign Terrorist Organization and to add it to the Treasury's list of \nSpecially Designated Global Terrorists. Funding is increased for the \nOffice of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence to strengthen the \nTreasury's efforts to combat unlawful or terrorist financing.\n  It is critical for us to realize that our problems with Iran are not \nwith the Iranian people, whose legitimate aspirations to live freely in \na normal, prosperous country should be recognized. As such, this \nlegislation designates $10 million in funding to enhance our friendship \nwith the people of Iran by identifying young Iranians to visit the \nUnited States under U.S. exchange programs.\n  The time for action is now. I hope my colleagues agree with me that \nwe must use every available tool short of military force to compel the \nIranian regime to abandon completely, verifiably, and irreversibly \ntheir pursuit of a nuclear weapons capability. I recognize that \nsanctions are not always popular, but we need to give them a chance to \nwork. By doing nothing, we limit our future options in addressing this \nsignificant threat to the United States.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the legislation be \nprinted in the Record.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Iran Counter-Proliferation Act of \n2007.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 970\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Iran Counter-Proliferation \n     Act of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) For more than 20 years, Iran has pursued a secret \n     nuclear program that is intended to produce a nuclear weapons \n     capability for Iran.\n       (2) The Government of Iran has consistently misled the \n     United Nations, the International Atomic Energy Agency, and \n     the United States as to the objectives and scope of its \n     nuclear activities.\n       (3) Iran has refused to comply with United Nations Security \n     Council Resolution 1737, adopted on December 23, 2006, which \n     called for the suspension of all enrichment-related and \n     reprocessing activities and is advancing work at its largest \n     nuclear facility.\n       (4) The International Atomic Energy Agency is unable to \n     verify the absence of undeclared nuclear material and \n     activities in Iran and its Director-General has stated that \n     Iran could be 6 months to a year away from acquiring the \n     material necessary to make a nuclear weapon.\n       (5) An Iranian nuclear weapons capability poses a grave \n     threat to the security of the United States and its allies \n     around the world.\n       (6) It is in the national security interests of the United \n     States to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapons \n     capability.\n       (7) The United States should use all political, economic, \n     and diplomatic tools at its disposal to prevent Iran from \n     acquiring a nuclear weapons capability.\n       (8) Nothing in this Act should be construed as giving the \n     President the authority to use military force against Iran.\n\n     SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       The following is the sense of Congress:\n       (1) The United States should pursue vigorously all measures \n     in the international financial sector to restrict Iran's \n     ability to conduct international financial transactions, \n     including prohibiting banks in the United States from \n     handling indirect transactions with Iran's state-owned banks \n     and prohibiting financial institutions that operate in United \n     States currency from engaging in dollar transactions with \n     Iranian institutions.\n       (2) The United States Trade Representative or any other \n     Federal official should not take any action that would extend \n     preferential trade treatment to, or lead to the accession to \n     the World Trade Organization of, any country that is \n     determined by the Secretary of State to offer government-\n     backed export credit guarantees to companies that invest in \n     Iran or any country in which the government owns or partially \n     owns an entity that invests in Iran.\n       (3) Iran should comply fully with its obligations under \n     United Nations Security Council Resolution 1737, and any \n     subsequent United Nations resolutions related to Iran's \n     nuclear program, and in particular the requirement to suspend \n     without delay all enrichment-related and reprocessing \n     activities, including research and development, and all work \n     on all heavy water-related nuclear activities, including \n     research and development.\n       (4) The United Nations Security Council should take further \n     measures beyond Resolution 1737 to tighten sanctions on Iran, \n     including preventing new investment in Iran's energy sector, \n     as long as Iran fails to comply with the international \n     community's demand to halt its nuclear enrichment campaign.\n       (5) The United States should encourage foreign governments \n     to direct state-owned entities to cease all investment in \n     Iran's energy sector and all imports to and exports from Iran \n     of refined petroleum products and to persuade, and, where \n     possible, require private entities based in their territories \n     to cease all investment in Iran's energy sector and all \n     imports to and exports from Iran of refined petroleum \n     products.\n\n[[Page S3618]]\n\n       (6) Administrators of Federal and State pension plans \n     should divest all assets or holdings from foreign companies \n     and entities that have invested or invest in the future in \n     Iran's energy sector.\n       (7) Iranian state-owned banks should not be permitted to \n     use the banking system of the United States.\n       (8) The Secretary of State should designate the Iranian \n     Revolutionary Guards as a Foreign Terrorist Organization \n     under section 219 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 \n     U.S.C. 1189) and the Secretary of the Treasury should place \n     the Iranian Revolutionary Guards on the list of Specially \n     Designated Global Terrorists under Executive Order 13224 (66 \n     Fed. Reg. 186; relating to blocking property and prohibiting \n     transactions with persons who commit, threaten to commit, or \n     support terrorism).\n\n     SEC. 4.

Mr. President, today, my colleagues, Senator Gordon \nSmith, Senator Frank Lautenberg, and I join together to introduce \nbipartisan legislation to use economic and diplomatic measures to help \nconvince the Iranian Government to turn away from its path toward the \ndevelopment of nuclear weapons.\n  The Iran Counter-Proliferation Act of 2007 would strengthen our \neconomic sanctions regime against Iran until Iran completely, \nverifiably, and irreversibly dismantles all nuclear enrichment and \nreprocessing programs.\n  The bill, for example, would penalize foreign oil companies with U.S. \nsubsidiaries doing business in Iran and would forbid the awarding of \nU.S. Government contracts to those who have violated our existing \nsanctions against Iran.\n  The bill reiterates the requirement to produce a National \nIntelligence Estimate on Iran mandated in last year's Defense \nAuthorization bill.\n  In addition to these measures, the bill addresses Russia's role in \nexporting nuclear and military technology to Iran.\n  Nuclear cooperation agreements with Russia would be prohibited if \nthat country continues to assist Iran in developing nuclear weapons. \nThe United States could not enter into such an agreement with Moscow, \nabsent a Presidential certification that Russia's assistance to Iran \nhas ceased.\n  This week has brought some promising news. Undersecretary of State \nfor Political Affairs Nicholas Burns testified before the Senate \nBanking Committee that Russia has begun applying pressure on Iran to \nabandon its nuclear ambitions. That is most welcome, and if the \nPresident provides the verification that Russia's nuclear assistance to \nIran has ceased--and that this is a sea change and not merely a \ncontract dispute--then our other negotiations with Russia can proceed \nunimpeded.\n  I firmly believe that we should offer positive incentives if Iran \ndoes change course and abandon its programs to develop nuclear weapons. \nIran has energy needs, and we hope that they will join us and the \ncommunity of nations in the peaceful acquisition of those resources.\n  This legislation authorizes $50 million to the International Atomic \nEnergy Agency to support the establishment of an international nuclear \nfuel bank, a concept originally proposed by Congressman Tom Lantos. \nThis bank would maintain a reserve of low-enriched uranium for reactor \nfuel and make it available to countries in full compliance with IAEA \nsafeguards which do not operate uranium enrichment or spent-fuel \nreprocessing facilities. It is our hope that Iran will become one of \nthese nations.\n  Because members of the American public are our best ambassadors and \nAmerica itself is the strongest evidence of the benefits of freedom and \nprosperity, this bill increases the authorization for funding for young \nIranians to come to the United States as part of exchange programs.\n  I support efforts to engage with Tehran's leaders regarding Iraq. \nThey should recognize that they, too, have a vested interest in \nregional peace and security. This bill is aimed at an issue which we \ncannot compromise: the Iranian acquisition of nuclear weapons.\n  Iran's leaders face a choice of whether to pursue a legitimate goal \nof peaceful nuclear power for their citizens or a dangerous strategy to \ndevelop nuclear weapons. We must provide the economic and political \npressure as well as incentives to help Iran choose the path to \nlegitimacy and nuclear nonproliferation. This legislation will help \nachieve that goal.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BOND (for himself and Mr. Harkin):\n  S. 971. A bill to establish the National Institute of Food and \nAgriculture, to provide funding for the support of fundamental \nagricultural research of the highest quality, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation with \nSen. Harkin to establish the National Institute of Food and Agriculture \nto support fundamental agricultural research of the highest quality. I \npresent this to begin a critical discussion about how we are going to \nensure the United States capitalizes on new technology to maximize the \nbenefits and minimize the costs of our agricultural production.\n  We remain the world leader in food and fiber production. We do it \nsafely and through technology and the hard work of the American farmer. \nIn the past half century, the number of people fed by a single U.S. \nfarm has grown from 19 to 129. Our farmers and farm leaders are on the \ncutting edge of developing new technology. And we have seen the \ninnovations continue to come down the pike. This has made it possible \nfor one farmer to feed 129 people.\n  In addition, we export $60 billion worth of agricultural products, \nand we do so at less cost and at less harm to the environment than any \nof our competitors around the world, again, because of new practices, \ndiligence on the part of farmers, and new technology.\n  In a world that has a decreasing amount of soil available for \ncultivation, we have a growing population and we still have 800 million \nchildren who are hungry or malnourished throughout the world. Unless we \nmaximize technology and new practices, production will continue to \novertax the world's natural resources.\n  Many people legitimately have raised concerns regarding new diseases \nand pests and related food safety issues. And they are growing. The \nability of U.S. agriculture producers to maintain our world leadership \nin this environment is only as solid as our willingness to commit to \nforward-looking investments.\n  Now, we also know from past experience that with new technology the \ndoors are being opened to novel new uses of renewable agricultural \nproducts in the fields of energy, medicine, and industrial products. In \nthe future, we can make our farm fields and farm animals factories for \neveryday products, fuels, and medicines in a way that is efficient and \nbetter preserves our natural resources. Advances in the life sciences \nhave come about, such as genetics, proteomics, and cell and molecular \nbiology. They are providing the base for new and continuing \nagricultural innovations.\n  It was only about a dozen years ago that farmers in Missouri came to \nme to tell me about the potential that genetic engineering and plant \nbiotechnology had for improving the production of food, and doing so \nwith less impact on the environment, providing more nutritious food. \nSince that time, I have had a wonderful, continuing education, not in \nhow it works but what it can do.\n  We know now, for example, that in hungry areas of the world as many \nas half a million children go blind from Vitamin A deficiency, and \nmaybe a\n\n[[Page S3621]]\n\nmillion die from this deficiency. Through plant biotechnology, the \nInternational Rice Research Institute in the Philippines and others \nhave developed Golden Rice, taking a gene from the sunflower, a beta-\ncarotene gene, and they enrich the rice. The Golden Rice now has that \nVitamin A, and that is going to make a significant difference in \ndealing with malnutrition.\n  We also know that in many areas of the world, where agricultural \nproduction has overtaxed the land, where drought has cut the \nproduction, where virus has plagued production, the way we can make \nfarmers self-sufficient and restore the farm economy in many of these \ncountries, is through plant biotechnology. But this is just the \nbeginning. This legislation I am introducing today seeks to lay the \nfoundation for tremendous advances in the future.\n  This legislation stems from findings and recommendations produced by \na distinguished group of scientists working on the Agricultural \nResearch, Economics and Education Task Force, which I was honored to be \nable to include in the 2002 farm bill. The distinguished task force was \nled by Dr. William H. Danforth, of St. Louis, the brother of our former \ndistinguished colleague, Senator Jack Danforth. Dr. Bill Danforth has a \ntremendous reputation in science and in education, with a commitment to \nhuman welfare and is known worldwide. He was joined by Dr. Nancy Betts, \nthe University of Nebraska; Mr. Michael Bryan, president of BBI \nInternational; Dr. Richard Coombe, the Watershed Agricultural Council; \nDr. Victor Lechtenbert, Purdue University; Dr. Luis Sequeira, the \nUniversity of Wisconsin; Dr. Robert Wideman, the University of \nArkansas; and Dr. H. Alan Wood, Mississippi State University.\n  I extend my congratulations and my sincere gratitude to Dr. Danforth \nand his team for providing the basis and the roadmap to ensure we have \nthe mechanisms in place to solve the problems and capitalize on the \nopportunities in agricultural research. The full report of the task \nforce can be found at www.ars.usda.gov/research.htm.\n  In summary, that study concludes that it is absolutely necessary we \nreinvigorate and forward focus our technology to meet the \nresponsibilities of our time. New investment is critical for the \nworld's consumers, the protection of our natural resources, the \nstandard of living for Americans who labor in rural America, and for \nthe well-being of the hungry people and the needy people throughout the \nworld.\n  This legislation is supported by the some 22 Member and Associate \nMember Societies of the Federation of American Societies for \nExperimental Biology, as well as the Institute of Food Technologists, \nAmerican Society of Agronomy, Crop Science Society of America, Soil \nScience Society of America, the Council for Agricultural Research, the \nNational Coalition for Food and Agricultural Research, the American \nSoybean Association, National Cattlemen's Beef Association, National \nChicken Council, National Corn Growers Association, National Farmers \nUnion, National Milk Producers Federation, National Pork Producers \nCouncil, National Turkey Federation, Association of American Veterinary \nMedical Colleges and the United Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Association.\n  I look forward to pursuing this vision in the 110th Congress. I \ninvite my colleagues who are interested in science and research to \nreview this report, to look at this measure, to join with me and \nSenator Harkin to talk about moving forward on what I think will be a \ntremendous opportunity to improve agriculture and its benefits to all \nour populations.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 971\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``National Institute of Food \n     and Agriculture Act of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the task force established under section 7404 of the \n     Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 (7 U.S.C. 3101 \n     note; 116 Stat. 457)--\n       (A) conducted an exhaustive review of agricultural research \n     in the United States; and\n       (B) evaluated the merits of establishing 1 or more national \n     institutes focused on disciplines important to the progress \n     of food and agricultural science;\n       (2) according to findings and recommendations provided to \n     Congress by the task force--\n       (A) agriculture in the United States faces critical \n     challenges, including impending crises in the food, \n     agricultural, and natural resource systems of the United \n     States;\n       (B) exotic diseases and pests threaten crops and livestock;\n       (C) the United States faces a public health epidemic due to \n     the increasing number of overweight and obese Americans;\n       (D) agriculturally-related environmental degradation is a \n     serious problem for the United States and other parts of the \n     world;\n       (E) certain animal diseases threaten human health; and\n       (F) agricultural producers in the United States of several \n     primary crops are no longer the world's lowest-cost \n     producers;\n       (3) to meet those critical challenges, it is essential that \n     the United States ensure that the agricultural innovation \n     that has been so successful in the past continues in the \n     future;\n       (4) agricultural innovation has resulted in hybrid and \n     higher-yielding varieties of basic crops and enhanced the \n     global food supply by increasing yields on existing acres;\n       (5) since 1960, the global population has tripled, but \n     there has been no net increase in the quantity of land in the \n     United States under cultivation;\n       (6) as of the date of enactment of this Act, only 1.5 \n     percent of the population of the United States provides food \n     and fiber to partially supply the needs of the United States;\n       (7)(A) agriculture, fundamental agricultural research, and \n     fundamental sciences play a major role in maintaining the \n     health and welfare of all people of the United States and \n     maintaining the land and water of the United States; and\n       (B) that role must be expanded;\n       (8) research that leads to understandings of the ways in \n     which cells and organisms function is critical to continued \n     innovation in agriculture in the United States;\n       (9) future innovations developed as a result of those \n     understandings are dependent on fundamental scientific \n     research and would be enhanced by ideas and technologies from \n     other fields of science and research;\n       (10) opportunities to advance fundamental knowledge of \n     benefit to agriculture in the United States have never been \n     greater;\n       (11) many of those new opportunities are the result of \n     amazing progress in the life sciences during recent decades, \n     attributable in large part to the provision made by the \n     Federal Government through the National Institutes of Health \n     and the National Science Foundation;\n       (12) new technologies and new concepts have expedited \n     advances in the fields of genetics, cell and molecular \n     biology, and proteomics;\n       (13) much of that scientific knowledge is ready to be used \n     in agriculture and food sciences through a sustained, \n     disciplined research effort at an institute dedicated to \n     conducting that research;\n       (14) publicly-sponsored research is essential to continued \n     agricultural innovation--\n       (A) to mitigate or harmonize the long-term effects of \n     agriculture on the environment;\n       (B) to enhance the long-term sustainability of agriculture; \n     and\n       (C) to improve the public health and welfare;\n       (15) competitive, peer-reviewed fundamental agricultural \n     research is best suited to promoting the research from which \n     breakthrough innovations that agriculture and society require \n     will come;\n       (16) it is in the national interest to dedicate additional \n     funds on a long-term, ongoing basis to an institute dedicated \n     to funding competitive, peer-reviewed grant programs that \n     support and promote the highest caliber of fundamental \n     agricultural research;\n       (17) the capability of the United States to be \n     internationally competitive in agriculture is threatened by \n     inadequate investment in research;\n       (18) to be successful over the long term, grant-receiving \n     institutions must be adequately reimbursed for costs of \n     conducting agricultural research if the institutions are to \n     pursue that kind of research; and\n       (19) to meet those challenges, address those needs, and to \n     provide for vitally needed agricultural innovation, it is in \n     the national interest to provide sufficient Federal funds \n     over the long term to fund a significant program of \n     fundamental agricultural research through an independent \n     national institute.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to establish a \n     national institute--\n       (1) to ensure that the technological superiority of \n     agriculture in the United States effectively serves the \n     people of the United States in the coming decades; and\n       (2) to support and promote fundamental agricultural \n     research of the highest caliber to achieve the goals of--\n       (A) increasing the international competitiveness of \n     agriculture in the United States;\n       (B) developing foods and expanding knowledge to improve \n     diet, nutrition, and health, and to combat obesity;\n       (C) decreasing the dependence of the United States on \n     foreign sources of petroleum by--\n       (i) developing biobased fuels and products;\n\n[[Page S3622]]\n\n       (ii) enhancing methods of production at biobased fuels \n     refineries;\n       (iii) reducing energy consumption at biobased fuel \n     refineries;

Mr. President, today, Senator Bond and I are introducing \nthe National Institute of Food and Agriculture Act of 2007. The 2002 \nfarm bill created a Research, Education and Economics Task Force within \nthe Department of Agriculture (USDA)to evaluate agricultural research. \nA key recommendation of this task force was to create a National \nInstitute for Food and Agriculture (NIFA) within USDA in order to \nsupport fundamental food and agricultural research to ensure that \nAmerican agriculture remains competitive now and in the future. This \nbill does exactly that. The NIFA would be a grant-making agency that \nfunds food and agricultural research through a competitive, peer-\nreviewed process. These funds would be in addition to, not as a \nsubstitute for, current research programs at USDA's Agricultural \nResearch Service (ARS) and Cooperative State Research, Education, and \nExtension Service (CSREES).\n  American agriculture must ensure that our Nation continues to produce \nsafe and nutritious food for an increasing population.\n  Other challenges include renewable energy production, rural \ndevelopment, food safety, nutrition and quality, and conserving the \nenvironment. The Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \nForestry held a hearing on agricultural research on March 7 of this \nyear, and it became clear to me that what we need in agricultural \nresearch is not only more resources, but also more competitive funding \nwhile at the same time, preserving the capacity funding necessary for \nintramural research, extension and education at USDA and at our land-\ngrant institutions. The NIFA Act of 2007 contains $3.4 billion of \nmandatory funding for the next 5 years to provide the food and \nagriculture sector with the innovation needed to confront these and \nother challenges facing American farmers and consumers of food and \nagriculture products now and in the future. Over a 10-year period, this \nlegislation would provide for research a little over 1 percent of total \nmandatory funding at the Department of Agriculture. One percent is \ncertainly a relatively modest investment given the public benefits of \nagricultural research, the results of which we reap every day as we \nconsume a safe and affordable food supply, and as we look to increase \nfarm-based renewable energy and biobased products. If we do not invest \nin research\n\n[[Page S3625]]\n\nnow, increased globalization and competition from foreign markets will \nbecome real threats to U.S. agriculture. I encourage my colleagues to \njoin me in supporting the National Institute of Food and Agriculture \nAct of 2007.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LAUTENBERG (for himself, Mr. Kennedy, Mrs. Murray, Mr. \n        Schumer, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Harkin, and Mr. Brown):\n  S. 972. A bill to provide for the reduction of adolescent pregnancy, \nHIV rates, and other sexually transmitted diseases, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Responsible \nEducation About Life or ``REAL'' Act along with my cosponsors Senators \nKennedy, Murray, Schumer, Boxer, and Harkin.\n  The REAL Act aims to reduce adolescent pregnancy, HIV rates, and \nother sexually transmitted diseases, by providing Federal funds for \ncomprehensive sex education in schools.\n  Comprehensive sex education is medically accurate, age appropriate \neducation that includes information about both contraception and \nabstinence. It is an approach that tells our kids the truth.\n  The REAL act will help young people make smart choices and give them \nall the information--not just the ``abstinence only'' side of the \nstory.\n  For years, taxpayer dollars have been flooded into unproven \n``abstinence-only'' programs--while no federal program is dedicated to \ncomprehensive sex education.\n  Under the Bush administration, Federal support for ``abstinence-\nonly'' education has expanded rapidly.\n  The proof is in the numbers. In the last 4 years, the Federal \ngovernment has spent over $680 million dollars on ``abstinence only'' \nprograms. This year President Bush is asking for another $204 million \ndollars for ``abstinence only'' education despite little evidence that \nthese programs actually work.\n  Would you like to know how much money the government has devoted to \ncomprehensive sex education programs over this same time? Zero dollars.\n  Much of the taxpayer funds going to ``abstinence-only'' programs are \nessentially being wasted.\n  After years of ``abstinence only'' programs, the United States still \nhas the highest rates of teen pregnancy in the industrialized world and \napproximately 50 young Americans a day, an average of two an hour, are \ninfected with HIV.\n  We have tried denying young people information about contraception \nand STD prevention and now it is time to provide them with medically \naccurate comprehensive sex education.\n  Comprehensive sex education simply works better.\n  It is a fact that teenagers who receive sex education that includes \ndiscussion of contraception are more likely to delay sexual activity \nthan those who receive abstinence-only education.\n  The American public knows what works. Parents do not want sexual \neducation programs limited to abstinence in schools. More than eight in \n10 Americans favor comprehensive sexuality education programs that \ninclude information about contraception over those that only promote \nabstinence.\n  The stakes are high: of the 19 million cases of sexually transmitted \ndiseases every year in the United States, almost half of them strike \nyoung people between the ages of 15 and 24.\n  These aren't just numbers. These are our sons and daughters whose \nhealth and well-being are jeopardized when ideology comes before sound \npublic policy.\n  That is why we are introducing this legislation today. It's time for \na more balanced approach; it's time to protect out kids, and it's time \nto get REAL.\n  The REAL Act is step in a more effective direction. It brings sex \neducation up-to-date in a way that will reflect the serious issues and \nreal life situations millions of young people find themselves in every \nyear.\n  Young people have a right to accurate and complete information that \ncould protect their health and even save their lives. I urge my \ncolleagues to support the REAL Act and make it possible to give young \npeople the tools to make safe and responsible decisions.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 972\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Responsible Education About \n     Life Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds as follows:\n       (1) The American Medical Association (``AMA''), the \n     American Nurses Association (``ANA''), the American Academy \n     of Pediatrics (``AAP''), the American College of \n     Obstetricians and Gynecologists (``ACOG''), the American \n     Public Health Association (``APHA''), and the Society of \n     Adolescent Medicine (``SAM'') support responsible sexuality \n     education that includes information about both abstinence and \n     contraception.\n       (2) Recent scientific reports by the Institute of Medicine, \n     the American Medical Association, and the Office on National \n     AIDS Policy stress the need for sexuality education that \n     includes messages about abstinence and provides young people \n     with information about contraception for the prevention of \n     teen pregnancy, HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted \n     diseases (``STDs'').\n       (3) Government-funded abstinence-only-until-marriage \n     programs are precluded from discussing contraception except \n     to talk about failure rates. An October 2006 report from the \n     Government Accountability Office concluded that the current \n     administration of abstinence-only-until-marriage programs by \n     the Department of Health and Human Services (``HHS'') fails \n     to require medical accuracy of the vast majority of funded \n     programs and that no regular monitoring of medical accuracy \n     is being carried out by HHS. The Government Accountability \n     Office also reported on the Department's total lack of \n     appropriate and customary measurements to determine if funded \n     programs are effective. In addition, a separate letter from \n     the Government Accountability Office in October 2006 to the \n     Secretary of Health and Human Services Michael Leavitt \n     contained a legal finding that the Department was in \n     violation of Federal law, in particular section 317P(c)(2) of \n     the Public Health Services Act (42 U.S.C. 247b-17(c)(2)), for \n     not requiring abstinence-only-until-marriage programs to \n     provide full and medically accurate information about the \n     effectiveness of condoms. The Department has argued that the \n     abstinence-only-until-marriage programs are exempt from the \n     law; however, the Government Accountability Office disagrees.\n       (4) A 2006 statement from the American Public Health \n     Association (``APHA'') ``recognizes the importance of \n     abstinence education, but only as part of a comprehensive \n     sexuality education program . . . APHA calls for repealing \n     current federal funding for abstinence-only programs and \n     replacing it with funding for a new Federal program to \n     promote comprehensive sexuality education, combining \n     information about abstinence with age-appropriate sexuality \n     education.''.\n       (5) The Society for Adolescent Medicine (``SAM'') in a 2006 \n     position paper found the following: ``Efforts to promote \n     abstinence should be provided within health education \n     programs that provide adolescents with complete and accurate \n     information about sexual health, including information about \n     concepts of healthy sexuality, sexual orientation and \n     tolerance, personal responsibility, risks of HIV and other \n     STIs and unwanted pregnancy, access to reproductive health \n     care, and benefits and risks of condoms and other \n     contraceptive methods... Current funding for abstinence-only \n     programs should be replaced with funding for programs that \n     offer comprehensive, medically accurate sexuality \n     education''.\n       (6) Research shows that teenagers who receive sexuality \n     education that includes discussion of contraception are more \n     likely than those who receive abstinence-only messages to \n     delay sexual activity and to use contraceptives when they do \n     become sexually active.\n       (7) Comprehensive sexuality education programs respect the \n     diversity of values and beliefs represented in the community \n     and will complement and augment the sexuality education \n     children receive from their families.\n       (8) The median age of puberty is 13 years and the average \n     age of marriage is over 26 years old. American teens need \n     access to full, complete, and medically and factually \n     accurate information regarding sexuality, including \n     contraception, STD/HIV prevention, and abstinence.\n       (9) Although teen pregnancy rates are decreasing, the \n     United States has the highest teen pregnancy rate in the \n     industrialized world with between 750,000 and 850,000 teen \n     pregnancies each year. Between 75 and 90 percent of teen \n     pregnancies among 15- to 19-year olds are unintended.\n       (10) A November 2006 study of declining pregnancy rates \n     among teens concluded that the reduction in teen pregnancy \n     between 1995 and 2002 is primarily the result of increased \n     use of contraceptives. As such, it is critically important \n     that teens receive accurate, unbiased information about \n     contraception.\n       (11) More than eight out of ten Americans believe that \n     young people should have information about abstinence and \n     protecting themselves from unplanned pregnancies and sexually \n     transmitted diseases.\n       (12) The United States has the highest rate of infection \n     with sexually transmitted diseases of any industrialized \n     country. In 2005, there were approximately 19,000,000 new\n\n[[Page S3626]]\n\n     cases of sexually transmitted diseases, almost half of them \n     occurring in young people ages 15 to 24. According to the \n     Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, these sexually \n     transmitted diseases impose a tremendous economic burden with \n     direct medical costs as high as $14,100,000,000 per year.\n       (13) Each year, teens in the United States contract an \n     estimated 9.1 million sexually transmitted infections. Each \n     year, one in four sexually active teens contracts a sexually \n     transmitted disease.\n       (14) Nearly half of the 40,000 annual new cases of HIV \n     infections in the United States occur in youth ages 13 \n     through 24.

A bill to amend the Mandatory Victims' Restitution Act to \nimprove restitution for victims of crime, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I am pleased today to be joined by \nSenators Grassley, Durbin and Collins in re-introducing the Restitution \nfor Victims of Crime Act. This legislation will give Justice Department \nofficials the tools they say are needed to help them do a better job of \ncollecting court-ordered Federal restitution and fines. It is virtually \nidentical to the bill we introduced in June of last year.\n  Recent information from the Justice Department suggests the many \nvictims of crime and their families continue to face a significant \nchallenge in trying to recover a sense of emotional and financial \nsecurity after a crime has been perpetrated against them.\n  By law, victims of Federal crimes are generally entitled to ``full \nand timely restitution'' for losses from a convicted offender. \nUnfortunately new Justice Department data show that the amount of \nuncollected Federal criminal debt is still spiraling upward--jumping \nfrom some $41 billion in fiscal year 2005 to nearly $46 billion at the \nend of fiscal year 2006. This is a hike of some $5 billion in \nuncollected Federal\n\n[[Page S3627]]\n\ncriminal debt int he past fiscal year alone. Criminal debt ordered by \nFederal courts in North Dakota that remained uncollected at the end of \nfiscal year 2006 totaled $18.7 million, up almost $4 million from the \npreceding year.\n  Crime victims should not have to worry if those in charge of \ncollecting court-ordered restitution on their behalf are making every \npossible effort to do so. We believe that passing the Restitution for \nVictimis of Crime Act would greatly help Federal criminal justice \nofficials in this task.\n  Our bill includes provisions that will remove many existing \nimpediments to increased collections. It will also provide new tools to \nhelp Federal criminal justice officials prevent criminal defendants \nfrom spending or hiding their ill-gotten gains and other financial \nassets by setting up pre-conviction procedures for preserving assets \nfor victims' restitution.\n  I hope that my Senate colleagues will help us get the legislation \nenacted at the first available opportunity. This will send a clear and \nmuch-needed message to white collar and other criminals: if you commit \na crime you will be held accountable and will not be allowed to benefit \nin any way from your criminal activity and ill-gotten gains. I also \nbelieve this bill will reassure many innocent victims of Federal crime \nthat the justice system is working hard to recover court-ordered \nrestitution that is owed to such victims.\n  I understand that criminal debt collection can be a tough job. It may \nbe impossible to collect the full amount of restitution owed to victims \nin some cases. Clearly criminal debt collections may be more difficult \nin cases where convicted criminals are in prison, ill-gotten gains are \nalready gone or these criminals are without any other financial means \nto pay their full restitution.\n  However, victims of crime in this country should expect Federal law \nenforcement officials tasked with collecting outstanding restitution to \ndo a better job. At the very least, crime victims should not be \nconcerned that their prospects for financial restitution are being \ndiminished because criminal offenders are frittering away their ill-\ngotten gains on lavish lifestyles and the like. But, as I have \nmentioned before, past Government Accountability Office (GAO) \ninvestigations rightly give many crime victims real reason to worry. \nGAO's work made clear that more financial assets could be recovered but \nfor a failure of some criminal justice officials to make criminal debt \ncollection a top priority.\n\n  At my request, the GAO reviewed five white-collar financial fraud \ncases and concluded that the Justice Department's prospects were ``not \ngood for collecting additional restitution from offenders'' owed to the \nvictims--even though one or more of the criminal offenders involved had \nreported earning millions of dollars in income, having millions in net \nworth and/or were spending thousands of dollars monthly on \nentertainment and clothing prior to the judgments entered against them. \nIn addition, the GAO found that certain offenders had taken expensive \ntrips overseas, had fraudulently obtained millions of dollars in assets \nand converted those assets for personal use, had established businesses \nfor their children, or held homes worth millions of dollars that were \nlocated in upscale neighborhoods. Despite all of this reported wealth, \nGAO found that only a small fraction of court-ordered restitution owed \nto victims had been collected.\n  The legislation that Senator Grassley and I are re-introducing today \nis based on a comprehensive package of recommendations by the Justice \nDepartment that stem in large part from the work of the Task Force on \nImproving the Collection of Criminal Debt. Justice Department officials \nbelieve these changes will remove many of the current impediments to \nbetter debt collection.\n  For example, Justice Department officials described a circumstance \nwhere they were prevented by a court from accessing $400,000 held in a \ncriminal offender's 401(k) plan to pay a $4 million restitution debt to \na victim because that court said the defendant was complying with a \n$250 minimum monthly payment plan and that payment schedule precluded \nany other enforcement actions. Our bill would remove impediments like \nthis in the future.\n  This legislation will address another major problem identified by the \nGAO for officials in charge of criminal debt collection; that is, many \nyears can pass between the date a crime occurs and the date a court \norders restitution. This gives criminal defendants ample opportunity to \nspend or hide their ill-gotten gains. Our bill sets up pre-conviction \nprocedures for preserving assets for victims' restitution. These tools \nwill help ensure that financial assets traceable to a crime are \navailable when a court imposes a final restitution order on behalf of a \nvictim. These tools are similar to those already used successfully in \nsome States and by Federal officials in certain asset forfeiture cases.\n  Key provisions of the bill would do the following:\n  Clarify that court-ordered Federal criminal restitution is due \nimmediately in full upon imposition, just like in civil cases and that \nany payment schedule ordered by a court is only a minimum obligation of \na convicted offender.\n  Allow Federal prosecutors to access financial information about a \ndefendant in the possession of the U.S. Probation Office--without the \nneed for a court order.\n  Clarify that final restitution orders can be enforced by criminal \njustice officials through the Bureau of Prisons' Inmate Financial \nResponsibility Program.\n  Ensure that if a court restricts the ability of criminal justice \nofficials to enforce a financial judgment, the court must do so \nexpressly for good cause on the record. Absent exceptional \ncircumstances, the court must require a deposit, the posting of a bond \nor impose additional restraints upon the defendant from transferring or \ndissipating assets.\n  Help ensure better recovery of restitution by requiring a court to \nenter a pre-conviction restraining order or injunction, require a \nsatisfactory performance bond, or take other action necessary to \npreserve property that is traceable to the commission of a charged \noffense or to preserve other nonexempt assets if the court determines \nthat it is in the interest of justice to do so.\n  Under the bill, a criminal defendant is allowed to challenge a \ncourt's pre-judgment asset preservation order. For example, a defendant \nmay challenge a post-indictment restraining order if he or she can show \nthat there is no probable cause to justify the restraint or the order \ndoes not provide the accused with adequate resources for attorney fees \nor reasonable living expenses.\n  Permit the Attorney General to commence a civil action under the \nAnti-Fraud Injunction Statute to enjoin a person who is committing or \nabout to commit a Federal offense that may result in a restitution \norder; and permit a court to restrain the dissipation of assets in any \ncase where it has power to enjoin the commission of a crime, not just \nbanking or health care fraud as permitted under current law.\n  Allow the United States under the Federal Debt Collections Procedure \nAct to use prejudgment remedies to preserve assets in criminal cases \nthat are similar to those used in civil cases when it is needed to \npreserve a defendant's assets for restitution. Such remedies, including \nattachment, garnishment, and receivership, are not currently available \nin criminal cases because there is no enforceable debt prior to an \noffender's conviction and judgment.\n  Clarify that a victim's attorney fees may be included in restitution \norders, including cases where such fees are a foreseeable result from \nthe commission of the crime, are incurred to help recover lost property \nor expended by a victim to defend against third-party lawsuits \nresulting from the defendant's crime.\n  Allow courts at their discretion to order immediate restitution to \nthose that have suffered economic losses or serious bodily injury or \ndeath as the result of environmental felonies. Under current law, \ncourts can impose restitution in such cases as a condition of probation \nor supervised release but this means that many victims of environment \ncrimes must wait for years to be compensated for their losses, if at \nall.\n  The Restitution for Victims of Crime Act has previously been endorsed \nby a number of organizations concerned about the well-being of crime \nvictims, including: The National Center for Victims of Crime, Mothers \nAgainst Drunk\n\n[[Page S3628]]\n\nDriving, the National Organization for Victims Assistance (NOVA), the \nNational Alliance to End Sexual Violence, Parents of Murdered Children, \nInc., Justice Solutions, the National Network to End Domestic Violence, \nthe National Coalition Against Domestic Violence, and the National \nAssociation of VOCA Assistance Administrators (NAVAA). Most recently, \nthe National Crime Victim Law Institute shared its support for our \nbill.\n  Last year, United States Attorney Drew Wrigley in Fargo, North Dakota \nsaid this legislation ``represents important progress toward ensuring \nthat victims of crime are one step closer to being made whole.''\n  Senator Grassley and I look forward to working with these groups and \nothers to move this bill forward in the legislative process. With the \nJustice Department's help, we can make criminal debt collection a top \npriority for all Federal criminal justice officials once again.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. COLLINS (for herself, Mr. Bayh, Mr. Levin, Mr. Graham, Mr. \n        Cochran, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Harkin, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Durbin, and \n        Mr. Schumer):\n  S. 974.

Res. 118\n\n       Whereas on November 15, 2006, the Government of Canada \n     opened a commercial hunt for seals in the waters off the east \n     coast of Canada;\n       Whereas an international outcry regarding the plight of the \n     seals hunted in Canada resulted in the 1983 ban by the \n     European Union of whitecoat and blueback seal skins and the \n     subsequent collapse of the commercial seal hunt in Canada;\n       Whereas the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 (16 U.S.C. \n     1361 et seq.) bars the import into the United States of any \n     seal products;\n       Whereas in February 2003, the Ministry of Fisheries and \n     Oceans in Canada authorized the highest quota for harp seals \n     in Canadian history, allowing nearly 1,000,000 seals to be \n     killed over a 3-year period;\n       Whereas more than 1,000,000 seals have been killed over the \n     past 3 years;\n       Whereas harp seal pups can legally be hunted in Canada as \n     soon as they have begun to molt their white coats at \n     approximately 12 days of age;\n       Whereas 95 percent of the seals killed over the past 5 \n     years were pups between just 12 days and 12 weeks of age, \n     many of which had not yet eaten their first solid meal or \n     taken their first swim;\n       Whereas a report by an independent team of veterinarians \n     invited to observe the hunt by the International Fund for \n     Animal Welfare concluded that the seal hunt failed to comply \n     with basic animal welfare regulations in Canada and that \n     governmental regulations regarding humane killing were not \n     being respected or enforced;\n       Whereas the veterinary report concluded that as many as 42 \n     percent of the seals studied were likely skinned while alive \n     and conscious;\n       Whereas the commercial slaughter of seals in the Northwest \n     Atlantic is inherently cruel, whether the killing is \n     conducted by clubbing or by shooting;\n       Whereas many seals are shot in the course of the hunt, but \n     escape beneath the ice where they die slowly and are never \n     recovered, and these seals are not counted in official kill \n     statistics, making the actual kill level far higher than the \n     level that is reported;\n       Whereas the commercial hunt for harp and hooded seals is a \n     commercial slaughter carried out almost entirely by non-\n     Native people from the East Coast of Canada for seal fur, \n     oil, and penises (used as aphrodisiacs in some Asian \n     markets);\n       Whereas the fishing and sealing industries in Canada \n     continue to justify the expanded seal hunt on the grounds \n     that the seals in\n\n[[Page S3630]]\n\n     the Northwest Atlantic are preventing the recovery of cod \n     stocks, despite the lack of any credible scientific evidence \n     to support this claim;\n       Whereas two Canadian government marine scientists reported \n     in 1994 that the true cause of cod depletion in the North \n     Atlantic was over-fishing, and the consensus among the \n     international scientific community is that seals are not \n     responsible for the collapse of cod stocks;\n       Whereas harp and hooded seals are a vital part of the \n     complex ecosystem of the Northwest Atlantic, and because the \n     seals consume predators of commercial cod stocks, removing \n     the seals might actually inhibit recovery of cod stocks;\n       Whereas certain ministries of the Government of Canada have \n     stated clearly that there is no evidence that killing seals \n     will help groundfish stocks to recover; and\n       Whereas the persistence of this cruel and needless \n     commercial hunt is inconsistent with the well-earned \n     international reputation of Canada: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate urges the Government of Canada to \n     end the commercial hunt on seals that opened in the waters \n     off the east coast of Canada on November 15, 2006.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, Canada's commercial seal hunt is the \nlargest slaughter of marine mammals in the world. According to the \nHumane Society of the United States (HSUS), over one million seals have \nbeen killed for their fur in the past three years. In 2006 alone, more \nthan 350,000 seals were slaughtered, most of them between 12 days and \n12 weeks old.\n  Canada officially opened another seal hunt on November 15, 2006, \npaving the way for hundreds of thousands of baby seals to be killed for \ntheir fur during the spring of 2007. Today, I am joined by Senator \nCollins and Senator Biden in submitting a resolution that urges the \nGovernment of Canada to end this senseless and inhumane slaughter.\n  A study by an independent team of veterinarians in 2001, found that \nthe seal hunt failed to comply with basic animal welfare standards and \nthat Canadian regulations with regard to humane killing were not being \nenforced. The study concluded that up to 42 percent of the seals \nstudied were likely skinned while alive and conscious. The United \nStates has long banned the import of seal products because of \nwidespread outrage over the magnitude and cruelty of the hunt.\n  It makes little sense to continue this inhumane industry that employs \nonly a few hundred people on a seasonal, part-time basis and only \noperates for a few weeks a year, in which the concentrated killings \ntakes place. In Newfoundland, where over 90 percent of the hunters \nlive, the economic contribution of the seal hunt is marginal. In fact, \nexports of seal products from Newfoundland account for less than one-\ntenth of one percent of the province's total exports.\n  Canada is fortunate to have vast and diverse wildlife populations, \nbut these animals deserve protection, not senseless slaughter. \nAmericans have a long history of defending marine mammals, best \nevidenced by the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972. Polls show that \nclose to 80 percent of Americans and the vast majority of Europeans \noppose Canada's seal hunt. In fact, close to 70 percent of Canadians \nsurveyed oppose the hunt completely, with even higher numbers opposing \nspecific aspects of the hunt, such as killing baby seals.\n  The U.S. Government has opposed this senseless slaughter, as noted in \nthe attached, January 19, 2005, letter from the U.S. Department of \nState, in response to a letter Senator Collins and I wrote to President \nBush, urging him to raise this issue during his November 30, 2004, \nvisit with Canadian Prime Minister Paul Martin.\n  The clubbing of baby seals can not be defended or justified. Canada \nshould end it, just as we ended the Alaska seal hunt more than 20 years \nago.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the January 19, 2005, letter from the \nU.S. State Department and the text of the resolution be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                          Department of State,\n\n                                 Washington, DC. January 19, 2005.\n     Hon. Carl Levin,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, D. C.\n       Dear Senator Levin: This is in response to your letter to \n     the President of November 24, 2004, regarding Canadian \n     commercial seal hunting. The White House has requested that \n     the Department of State respond. We regret the delay in \n     responding. Unfortunately, this letter was not received in \n     the Department of State until mid-December, well after the \n     referenced meeting between President Bush and Prime Minister \n     Paul Martin of Canada.\n       We are aware of Canada's seal hunting activities and of the \n     opposition to it expressed by many Americans. Furthermore, we \n     can assure you that the United States has a longstanding \n     policy opposing the hunting of seals and other marine mammals \n     absent sufficient safeguards and information to ensure that \n     the hunting will not adversely impact the affected marine \n     mammal population or the ecosystem of which it is a part. The \n     United States policy is reflected in the Marine Mammal \n     Protection Act of 1972 (MMPA) which generally prohibits, with \n     narrow and specific exceptions, the taking of marine mammals \n     in waters or lands subject to the jurisdiction of the United \n     States and the importation of marine mammals and marine \n     mammal products into the United States.\n       The United States has made known to the Government of \n     Canada its objections and the objections of concerned \n     American legislators and citizens to the Canadian commercial \n     seal hunt on numerous occasions over recent years. The United \n     States has also opposed Canada's efforts within the Arctic \n     Council to promote trade in sealskins and other marine mammal \n     products.\n       We hope this information is helpful to you. Please do not \n     hesitate to contact us if we can be of assistance in this or \n     any other matter.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                 Nancy Powell,\n\n                                         (For Paul V.

SOCIAL SECURITY RESTRUCTURING.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) Social Security is the foundation of retirement income \n     for most Americans;\n       (2) preserving and strengthening the long term viability of \n     Social Security is a vital national priority and is essential \n     for the retirement security of today's working Americans, \n     current and future retirees, and their families;\n       (3) Social Security faces significant fiscal and \n     demographic pressures;\n       (4) the nonpartisan Office of the Chief Actuary at the \n     Social Security Administration reports that--\n       (A) the number of workers paying taxes to support each \n     Social Security beneficiary has dropped from 16.5 in 1950 to \n     3.3 in 2006;\n       (B) within a generation there will be only 2 workers to \n     support each retiree, which will substantially increase the \n     financial burden on American workers;\n       (C) without structural reform, the Social Security system, \n     beginning in 2017, will pay out more in benefits than the \n     system will collect in taxes;\n       (D) without structural reform, the Social Security trust \n     fund will be exhausted in 2040, and Social Security tax \n     revenue in 2040 will only cover 74 percent of promised \n     benefits, and will decrease to 70 percent by 2080;\n       (E) without structural reform, future Congresses may have \n     to raise payroll taxes 50 percent over the next 75 years to \n     pay full benefits on time, resulting in payroll tax rates of \n     as much as 17.6 percent by 2050 and 18.7 percent by 2080;\n       (F) without structural reform, Social Security's total cash \n     shortfall over the next 75 years is estimated to be \n     $4,600,000,000,000 measured in present value terms; and\n       (G) absent structural reforms, spending on Social Security \n     will increase from 4.3 percent of gross domestic product in \n     2006 to 6.3 percent in 2080; and\n       (5) the Congressional Budget Office, the General Accounting \n     Office, the Congressional Research Service, the Chairman of \n     the Federal Reserve Board, and the President's Commission to \n     Strengthen Social Security have all warned that failure to \n     enact fiscally responsible Social Security reform quickly \n     will result in 1 or more of the following:\n       (A) Higher tax rates.\n       (B) Lower Social Security benefit levels.\n       (C) Increased Federal debt or less spending on other \n     Federal programs.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the President, Congress, and the American people \n     including seniors, workers, women, minorities, and disabled \n     persons should work together at the earliest opportunity to \n     enact legislation to achieve a solvent and sustainable Social \n     Security system; and\n       (2) Social Security reform--\n       (A) must protect current and near retirees from any changes \n     to Social Security benefits;\n       (B) must reduce the pressure on future taxpayers and on \n     other budgetary priorities;\n       (C) must provide benefit levels that adequately reflect \n     individual contributions to the Social Security system; and\n       (D) must preserve and strengthen the safety net for \n     vulnerable populations including the disabled and survivors.\n       (3) The Senate should honor section 13301 of the Budget \n     Enforcement Act of 1990.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 610.

Mr. President, I rise tonight to discuss for a few \nminutes amendment No. 536, which has been filed by my colleague from \nGeorgia, Senator Isakson, and myself. In offering this amendment to the \nbudget resolution, we truly believe it is a fair amendment and puts \nchildren first, in the way the State Children's Health Insurance \nProgram was intended.\n  When SCHIP was created in 1997, it was instituted to do exactly what \nthe name states: provide health care coverage to uninsured children. I \ndo not believe you will find anyone here who disagrees with that \npurpose because it provides health insurance to hard-working families \nwho earn too much to qualify for Medicaid but not enough to buy private \ninsurance.\n  There has been a lot of discussion about the long-term aspects of \nthat program lately, and rightfully so. However, some States are using \ntheir SCHIP funding to cover adults, and that is not the intention of \nthis program. In fact, three States have more adults as enrollees than \nchildren. There are 12 States that will spend almost $807 million of \ntheir SCHIP money on more than 671,000 adults this year.\n  When we talk about children's health care, two of the components that \nare critical include dental care and mental health care. That is the \nspecific focus of our amendment. Our proposal would eliminate States in \nreceiving an enhanced SCHIP matching rate for adults who are covered \nunder the SCHIP program. If States continue to choose to insure adults \nwith SCHIP funds, they will receive a lower Federal match instead of \nthe normal SCHIP match. We think this approach makes the most sense \nbecause SCHIP was created to cover children.\n  The increased Federal match was created as an incentive for States to \ncover these kids, not adults. This new lower match rate for adults will \nfree up funding to create a budget-neutral reserve fund to provide for \ndental and mental health benefits for children. So, again, our \namendment simply says this: If States want to use their SCHIP funds to \ncover adults, which is a decision States may choose to make, they will \nreceive the Medicaid matching rate.\n  We are not saying the States should not provide health insurance \ncoverage for adults who need it. At the same time it is important to \nemphasize that SCHIP funding is for kids. Our amendment uses this \nfunding intended for children for two very important components of \nchildren's health care, that being dental care and mental health.\n  I believe we must craft policies to ensure the greatest number of \nchildren are provided quality health care and quality dental care. I \nwas extremely saddened to hear recently of a 12-year-old boy in Prince \nGeorge's County, MD, who died from a toothache and an inability to find \nproper care. I do not know whether this child was on an SCHIP program \nor was on Medicaid. But this is only one example of the need for \nincreased access to dental care for children. It is heartbreaking and \ninexcusable that something as tragic as this could happen, when a \nroutine tooth extraction may have saved this young boy's life.\n  Parents know and understand that things as routine as dental care are \ncritically important to a child's overall health. Tooth decay remains a \nprevalent, chronic disease, and is the single most common childhood \ndisease nationwide. It is five times as common as asthma, and, \nunfortunately, minority, low-income, and geographically isolated \nchildren suffer disproportionately from this disease. Eighty percent of \nall tooth decay is found in only 25 percent of children. These are the \nchildren the SCHIP program was created to help. We can and we must do \nbetter for these kids. This amendment does exactly what we ought to be \ndoing with SCHIP, namely providing health insurance coverage for \nchildren, not adults.\n  I urge my colleagues to do what is right and support this amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 619\n\n  Mr. President, let me very quickly talk about one other amendment I \nhave filed. It is amendment No. 619. This particular amendment deals \nwith the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Grant Program, which is commonly \nreferred to as the Byrne/JG Program. It is an amendment which Senator \nFeinstein, Senator Isakson, Senator Graham, and I have filed. The \nByrne/JG Program is the primary provider of Federal criminal justice \nfunding to State and local jurisdictions. The funding supports all \ncomponents of the criminal justice system from multijurisdictional drug \nand gang task forces to community crime prevention programs, to \nsubstance abuse programs, prosecution initiatives, domestic violence \nprograms, and information-sharing initiatives.\n  I will tell you that our law enforcement officials, our sheriffs, our \nprosecutors, our drug court professionals, and many of our public \nservants in the law enforcement arena rely on this funding to make our \ncommunities safer. The results they get with this funding are tangible \nand real.\n  In February of last year, the Iowa Governor's Office of Drug Control \nPolicy conducted a survey to obtain a clearer, quantifiable, and more \ncomplete national picture of the Byrne/JG program's impact on drug and \ncriminal efforts in America. This survey focused on the 2004 grant year \nand found that drug enforcement task forces funded by the Byrne/JG \nprogram in 45 States made more than 221,000 drug arrests. The \nachievements of those multijurisdictional drug enforcement task forces \nare impressive.\n  For example, 45 States reported seizing almost 18,000 kilograms of \ncocaine, with an estimated consumer street value of over $1.6 billion. \nForty States reported seizing just shy of 5,500 kilograms of \nmethamphetamine, with an estimated street value of $518 million.\n  The States participating in this survey reported the total value of \ndrugs seized at over $12 billion. This figure represents more than $63 \ndollars in seized drugs for every dollar spent on drug task forces. \nThis is indeed an amendment which will reinstate the level of funding \nfor the Byrne/JG Program to last year's level. We are not asking it to \nbe any higher than that. By doing that, we will allow our law \nenforcement community to continue to provide the type of safety and \nprotection citizens all across America want.\n  Before I yield the floor, I wish to note several well-respected \norganizations, including the National Narcotics Officers Association \nCoalition, the National Sheriffs' Association, the National District \nAttorneys' Association, the National Association of Drug Court \nProfessionals, the National Criminal Justice Association, and the \nInternational Association of Chiefs of Police support this robust \nfunding for the program.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support amendment No. 619.\n  Mr. President, I ask that my entire statement be inserted into the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S3649]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I am delighted to come to the floor and \njoin in support of the amendment offered by Senator Chambliss and \nmyself with regard to the State Children's Health Insurance Program.\n  The State Children's Health Insurance Program was begun in 1997. At \nthat particular time I was chairman of the board of education in the \nState of Georgia. I applauded the Federal Government for providing this \nasset and this benefit to our States.\n  For the benefit of those who aren't familiar, the SCHIP program is a \nMedicaid Program, but unlike Medicaid today, it is a block grant, it is \nnot an entitlement. Specific funds are block-granted to the States for \nthe purpose of providing affordable health insurance to children in \npoverty.\n  That is the way the program began. As years have gone by, States have \nchosen to elect to ask for waivers from Washington to expand the \ncoverage beyond children. Meritoriously, some States have asked to \ncover pregnant mothers in poverty under the SCHIP program. I would be \nthe first person to tell you that is an appropriate appropriation of \nfunds and the intent of the bill.\n  However, other States have chosen to add adults who do not have \nchildren to coverage under SCHIP, the result of which has compromised \nthe program and taken money that was intended to go to children and \nsent it to adults.\n  By way of example, my State of Georgia runs out of SCHIP money this \nmonth. We do not provide any SCHIP benefits to anybody who is not a \nchild. Our eligibility threshold is 235 percent of poverty. So it is \nexactly as prescribed originally. But because we are a growth State and \nin addition took on the children from Katrina, we have run out of money \nearly, because we had an increase in the number of people in our State \nusing and taking advantage of SCHIP.\n  There are other States that have used their money up by adults \nconsuming it under this program. What Senator Chambliss and I have done \nis simply said this: If you are going to include adults in the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program, which is a Medicaid program, then \nthe reimbursement to those States by the Federal Government for the \ncost for children ought to be the enhanced amount which Congress passed \nin 1997, which is about 70 percent of the cost. But if you are going to \ninclude adults, that match ought to be the 63-percent Medicaid match, \nnot the enhanced match that was put in to attract people in the first \nplace to provide children's health insurance. Then you take that \ndifferential and you put it into a reserve fund, and offer States the \nopportunity to enhance their children's health insurance by including \ndental and/or mental health benefits.\n  We know from our experience with young children in poverty that early \nprevention of dental disease and good dental health provides a lifetime \nfor those children of healthy teeth, a lifetime of absence of dental \ndisease, and a saving of untold millions of dollars in this country.\n  So what Senator Chambliss and I have brought to the floor is very \nsimply this premise: If you pass a State Children's Health Insurance \nProgram, shouldn't it go to the benefit of children's health? If you \ndecide to include adults, why should the Medicaid match be any greater \nthan it is for adults anyway? And if you create additional funds by \nmaking this differentiation, should not those funds go to the two areas \nwhich are most important in terms of children's health, dental and \nmental health?\n  I submit this is a thoughtful amendment. It is affordable because it \nis budget neutral. It takes the SCHIP program back to where it was \nintended, for children. It does not punish a State that includes adults \nunder the Medicaid program, but it requires them to go back to the \nregular Medicaid match, not the enhanced match that was created for \nchildren's health insurance.\n  If we adopt this amendment, more children will have healthier lives \nand children in poverty will continue to get the benefit of a wise and \nbeneficial program this Congress passed in 1997.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I thank the Presiding Officer for \nstaying here late this evening. I hope anyone who is not watching this \nis watching the KU-Southern Illinois game on right now, which is quite \na barn burner going on.\n  I have an amendment I want to talk about, because we are going to go \ninto the long voting session tomorrow and will not have a great deal of \ntime to talk about it then. But it is an important amendment. It is an \nimportant amendment for the budget. It is an important amendment for \nthe long-term process.\n  A lot of my colleagues will be very familiar with the BRAC process, \nthe Base Realignment and Closure Commission process. It was enacted at \nleast a dozen years ago, probably a little more than that. It is a \nprocess by which we have a commission look at military bases. They \nconsider the military bases, consider whether they are useful where \nthey are currently located, if it would be better for them to be \nrealigned, if it is better for a base to be closed and that money put \nsomewhere else.\n  It has been a very effective process for us to be able to take \nspending and put it in higher priority areas, whereas historically if \nyou tried to eliminate a military base, it was virtually impossible to \ndo, because you would go at the military base in a particular State, \nand it would not matter how old the base had been or whether it was out \nof position, the Members of that State would defend it.\n  We were rarely able to close a military base. So we enacted the BRAC \nprocess. That process created a commission, and they looked at all the \nmilitary establishments. It then said that these 65, 125, 233 bases \nshould be closed. We have higher priorities for this money. The process \nis chopped off on by the President, and then it comes to Congress, one \nvote up or down, agree, disagree, deal or no deal. By that means, we \nhave realigned over $40 billion in annual appropriations, total \nappropriations on military bases. It has been a very good process to \neliminate wasteful Federal spending in places where it is not needed. \nWe need that process for the rest of Government. We spend about $2.9 \ntrillion on an annual basis. We have not found effective ways to \neliminate wasteful Federal spending.\n  I have yet to find somebody running for public office at the Federal \nlevel--or any level, for that matter--who says they are for wasteful \ngovernment spending or they are for duplicative government spending. If \neverybody is saying they are against it and they are against waste, \nfraud, and abuse and they keep looking for that line in the budget to \nwipe it out, here is a realistic way we can deal with that, take that \nBRAC process and apply to it the rest of Government.\n  What could it yield? Let me give some examples using this quick \nreport card. Regularly, the Government puts out a report card on the \neffectiveness of our own Government spending programs, whether they are \nhitting their targets or not. They score them. You can look here at a \nfew of agencies. For the State Department, they reviewed 40 programs \nfor this OMB report card. They score them for effectiveness in what the \nprogram was targeted for. They were at a median score of 77.93 percent. \nI gave them the letter grade of a C-plus, based on the regular report \ncard system. Here you can see the Department of Education, HUD, EPA. \nFor the Department of Education, 74 programs were scored. They had a \nmedian score of 44.5, which I gave a letter score of an F. That is what \nmy kids would get. That is what I would give if I were teaching, \nsaying: This is not an effective Government program. Why is it we can't \ngo in and find some of these education programs that are not being \neffective and eliminate them? It is because the system is built to \nspend.\n  There is an old maxim that Ronald Reagan used that there is nothing \nso\n\n[[Page S3650]]\n\npermanent as a temporary Government program. Once in place, they seem \nto sustain themselves. They get a support group around them, and then \nthe specific controls over the general. If it is a program that \nsomebody in Vermont wants to maintain or Kansas wants to maintain, even \nthough maybe its effectiveness is very low, we defend it because it is \nfor our States. That is the specific. If the general interest would say \nthis should be eliminated, let's change the system so they can save \nmoney. We can do so using the military base-closing process and use \nthat money for higher priority needs.\n  I want to eliminate deaths by cancer in 10 years. This is going to \ntake a real research effort and focus. To do so, we spend $2.9 trillion \nin the budget now. We have enough money, but it is not in the right \nplaces. Let's use this system to reduce and eliminate wasteful spending \nand then be able to target higher priority areas.\n  This is a program which both Republicans and Democrats, in whatever \nphilosophical position you may put yourself, would say is a good idea. \nThis is something which is bipartisan, nonpartisan, and it is for good \ngovernance and good government. It changes the system because the \nsystem is built to spend. It is built to spend almost perennially. It \nneeds to be adjusted.\n  I want to quote from former President Clinton's adviser Paul \nWeinstein, of the Progressive Policy Institute, who testified before \nthe Senate about this approach:\n\n       Our organization has believed that the best way to achieve \n     comprehensive reform in the executive branch is to combine \n     the commission function with a mechanism to require Congress \n     to vote on its recommendations. Senator Brownback's CARFA \n     [Commission on Accountability and Review of Federal Agencies] \n     legislation would provide this type of commission.\n\n  Here again, we have to realize the difficulties of this system. The \nstrength of the system is spending money. The strength of the system is \nnot saving money. Change it to combine both a commission and a \nrequirement for legislative action.\n  Under the CARFA proposal, once every 4 years an agency would be \nreviewed for recommendations being made on whether eliminations should \nbe made in that agency. It would then be put together in a package and \nsent to the President to either agree or disagree. It would then go to \nthe Congress for the Congress to look at, as we do the BRAC process \nnow. It would then be required to be voted upon with a limited time \nperiod for debate without amendment. You look at it, and then you get a \nchance to look at the overall practices and the package, and then you \ncan say I agree, vote yes, I disagree, vote no, deal or no deal. This \nis a process which has worked.\n  I submit to my colleagues, both sides of the aisle, all persuasions, \nwe have a lot of high-priority needs. We don't have the money focused \nin the high-priority areas. Too often, it is focused on things that we \nare maintaining from the past that maybe have less saliency today but \nstill have a protection group around them, and we haven't found a way \nto eliminate them or get in and do it. Here is a way to do it, and it \ndoesn't favor one side's program or the other's. It says: We are going \nto have this in a bipartisan commission, and we are going to change the \nprocess so we can save the money. Then that money will be used for \nhigher needs.\n  This is an effective way for us to move forward. I urge my \ncolleagues, when we get a chance to vote on my amendment, to look at \nthis and say: That is something which I want to endorse, something I \nwant to support, because it is going to allow us to more effectively \nspend the Federal money. One of the things people tell me that drives \nthem the most crazy about Federal spending is wasteful Federal \nspending. Here is a way. We redesign the system to get at it. I urge my \ncolleagues to support it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). The senior Senator from Ohio is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise to share with the Senate my \nconcerns and frustrations with S. Con. Res. 21, the fiscal year 2008 \nbudget resolution, and to discuss two amendments I will offer tomorrow \nto try to improve the resolution.\n  Frankly, the resolution before this body ignores the dire state of \nour financial future and uses smoke and mirrors to mask our long-term \nfiscal challenges. I have come to the Senate floor numerous times over \nthe past 8 years to express my concern that the Federal Government \ncontinues to spend more money than it brings in and that this Congress \nis running a credit card for today's needs and shamelessly leaving the \nbill for future generations. We all know this recklessness threatens \nour economic stability, our competitiveness in the global marketplace, \nand our future way of life.\n  Since I arrived in the Senate, the national debt has increased from \n$5.6 trillion to $8.6 trillion. That is an increase of more than 50 \npercent in 8 years. This amounts to $29,000 of debt for every American. \nCan my colleagues believe that? What is of even more concern, however, \nis that 55 percent of the privately owned national debt is held by \nforeign creditors, including the Chinese Government. That is up from 35 \npercent only 6 years ago. Yet these numbers, which represent our past \nbehavior, pale in comparison with the budget problems looming in our \nfuture as the baby boom generation begins to retire over 9 months from \nnow.\n  Forty years ago, Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid accounted \nfor 3 percent of our GDP. Today, they are up to 9 percent. In another \n40 years, they will be up to 18 percent, equal to total Federal \nrevenues and crowding out all other spending. In other words, all of \nthe money the Federal Government spends currently will be used up for \nMedicare, Medicaid and Social Security. There won't be any money for \nanything else.\n  Looking forward, we face a long-term fiscal imbalance of $55 \ntrillion. That is hard to even grasp, but it translates into $440,000 \nof future Government debt for every American household, up from a mere \n$175,000 only 6 years ago. This is all documented. If we listen to \nDavid Walker, who is the Comptroller General, he is going all over the \ncountry--he was in my State in Cincinnati for a fiscal wake-up--working \nwith the Concord Coalition to let Americans know. He is like the Paul \nRevere out there telling Americans we better be concerned about this. I \nremember Ross Perot, who ran for the President of the United States, \nand all of his charts. His charts looked like nothing compared to the \ncharts we would use to show how bad things are.\n  Imposing a crushing debt burden such as this on future generations at \nthe same time they are going to have to compete with rising powers such \nas China and India is unacceptable. All of us have a responsibility to \ntry to guarantee that they enjoy the same standard of living and \nquality of life we have enjoyed, if not better. This young page here in \nfront of me--I am worried about him. What kind of a life is he going to \nhave? What kind of an opportunity is he going to have in terms of his \nstandard of living and quality of life? We are concerned about him. \nWhat kind of a legacy are we going to leave him? What about my seven \ngrandchildren? What kind of a world are they going to live in? That is \nwhy the chairman of the Budget Committee and I have spoken over the \npast few years about the growing debt and the impact it will have on \nfuture generations.\n  Yet we are here today with the majority's budget resolution that \nincreases the national debt by $2.4 trillion over the next 5 years. \nThat is assuming Congress doesn't take advantage of all of the \nloopholes that are in the budget. We are back at square one. Neither \nRepublicans nor Democrats have offered a budget that even comes close \nto reestablishing our fiscal sanity. The administration's budget is \nunrealistic, and the Democratic budget is even worse.\n  I am going to vote against the Democratic budget. If this were the \nRepublican budget, I would vote against that budget, too. Both of them. \nOnce again, we have pulled the wool over our own eyes. That is what is \ngoing on.\n  Some of my colleagues, especially my new colleagues, may wonder why I \ntake such offense at the budget. Unfortunately I am a product of my \nexperiences. The Bible says the Lord never gives you a challenge you \ncannot overcome. Well, he has tested me before, and he is testing all \nof us right now.\n  As mayor of Cleveland, I inherited the first city in the country to \ngo bankrupt since the Great Depression. We made cuts, we raised taxes, \nand we\n\n[[Page S3651]]\n\nrighted the ship. When I took the helm as Governor of Ohio, I inherited \na $1.5 billion budget shortfall that can only be described as a \nfinancial crisis. During the first biennial budget, we had to make four \nrounds of cuts. These were dire economic times which required honesty, \nleadership, and management. I was forced to make a lot of hard choices. \nWe had to reform our tax policy, scale back spending, and target our \nresources to the people who needed them the most. We worked harder and \nsmarter, and we succeeded at doing more with less. In fact, my years as \nGovernor represent the lowest rate of growth in State spending in 30 \nyears.\n  Here in Washington, it seems as if no one is willing to make the \ntough choices. I cannot understand it. Too many Members won't do \nanything if it doesn't bolster their side politically or fit into a 10-\nsecond sound bite. Instead, both parties are using gimmicks to cover up \nthe state of our Nation's long-term fiscal health.\n  Let me offer some examples. The administration released its fiscal \n2008 budget request in early February and projected a deficit of $239 \nbillion. This number is the deficit left over after spending every \ndollar of Social Security surplus. But the Social Security surplus must \nbe reserved for future retirees. As far as I know, you can't spend the \nmoney twice, but Congress keeps pretending that it can. If you remove \nthe Social Security surplus from the equation, that $239 billion \ndeficit they are talking about almost doubles to $451 billion. If you \nuse the accrual way of figuring it, it is about $640 billion.\n  The administration goes further to achieve its surplus by assuming \nnonsecurity discretionary spending will peak in 2007 and go down every \nyear after that. So we are reducing our deficit by eating our seed \ncorn. That is a real problem today.\n  What we have to understand is that only one-sixth of the budget is \nnondefense discretionary. All of the hits are being made against that \none-sixth to try to balance the budget. We are ignoring so many things \nthis country ought to be doing.\n  Furthermore, the administration calculates the security-related \ndiscretionary spending will peak in 2008, and that supplemental \nspending for military operations will end after 2009. Give me a break. \nWe are going to end that in 2009? We are going to be over in Iraq and \nAfghanistan for a long period of time. But the President just increased \nthe number of troops going to Iraq by more than 21,000. These estimates \nare not based on reality. Why don't we tell the American people the \ntruth? Let's tell them the truth.\n  Meanwhile, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are using \ntricks that even are more egregious. The majority's budget allows for a \ndramatic increase in entitlement spending through the use of more than \n20 reserve funds. They are not included in the overall budget totals. \nThey simply conceal what they intend to spend and it gives the \nappearance of a more responsible budget.\n  The majority's budget hides increases in discretionary spending \nthrough the use of seven cap adjustments. Appropriations for seven \nfavored programs and agencies will not count toward the budget limit. \nJust like that, poof, and they are gone.\n  Furthermore, the majority's budget allows for unlimited emergency \nspending. I think we all understand that on occasion we have natural \ndisasters or unanticipated crises, such as Hurricane Katrina, that \nrequire emergency resources. For this reason, we cannot estimate all of \nour emergency spending in the budget. But a great deal of the spending \nthat is currently designated as ``emergency'' is actually quite regular \nand predictable.\n  For example, every year we spend emergency funds on drought relief. \nThis is difficult for me to understand: If we spend it every year, why \ncan't we account for it in our budget? This is why we ought to have a \nrainy day fund such as I had when I was Governor that set aside \ndesignated funds for legitimate natural disasters so the ``emergency'' \nlabel is not abused for otherwise anticipated events.\n  My friend from New Hampshire, Senator Gregg, created a rainy day fund \nwith a fixed dollar limit in last year's budget resolution, and I \nthought: That is a great idea. But the new majority has already \neliminated that fund from the budget and has created an open-ended \nsource of emergency spending that is not subject to any financial \nlimitations.\n  There is one trick after another in this budget resolution. We are \nalready raiding the Social Security trust fund and a bunch of smaller \ntrust funds to make our bottom line look rosier than it is. This budget \nexacerbates a problem the Budget Committee chairman himself and I have \nspoken out against for a great many years.\n  I have a great deal of respect for the Democratic chairman of the \nBudget Committee. I think he is one of the most responsible guys, but \nhe has also got to do his thing in terms of the politics of this \nSenate. In fact, in the last Congress, the Budget Committee chairman \nand I introduced legislation that would invest the Social Security \nsurplus in non-Federal bonds to prevent the surplus from being used to \nfund other Government spending. We plan to reintroduce this bill again.\n  In other words, what we are saying is we are going to take the money \nthat is now being used to fund the budget and instead of borrowing it \nfrom trust funds--Social Security--we are going to take the Social \nSecurity funds and put them in a non-U.S. account--municipal bonds--so \nthey will accrue interest; and when the time comes that we will need to \nuse that money, there will be something there besides an IOU from the \nFederal Government that says: We are going to take care of it.\n  The bill would require the Government issue more Treasuries to the \npublic in order to pay for other spending instead of borrowing from \nSocial Security. What we basically are going to say to the American \npublic is: We are borrowing all these funds from Social Security, all \nthe other trust funds, and we are going to put that aside, and we are \ngoing to borrow that money from the public so you know how much \nborrowing is going on. We are not going to mask this thing, as we have \ndone for so many years.\n  We thought, finally our children and grandchildren will have a clear \npicture of how fiscally irresponsible we are. But today the Budget \nCommittee chairman is relying on the very same gimmick--borrowing from \nthe Social Security trust fund--to claim a balance in 2012.\n  What about taxes? The majority's budget claims that $400 billion in \nrevenue will be collected from ``closing the `tax gap' ''--in other \nwords, collecting more of the taxes that are currently owed but not \npaid. Yet the President's proposal to collect just 2 percent of this \n$400 billion caused small businesses to howl in protest that the new \nadministrative and compliance burdens would overwhelm them.\n  In other words, it is easy to talk about closing the tax gap, but \nfrom a political point of view, it is not going to be very easy. We \nshould do that. There is no question about it. I talked to Charles \nRossotti, who was the former head of the Internal Revenue Service. He \nsaid with more filings and more people in the Internal Revenue Service, \nwe should be able to pick up another $50 billion. That is a realistic \nway of looking at it. But just to say: $400 billion; we are going to \ncome up with it somehow; close the tax gap, and it is all going to be \nthere--voila.\n\n  In fact, the Greater Cleveland Partnership and the Council of Smaller \nEnterprises, which represent small business in northeast Ohio, describe \nthe administration's tax gap proposals--by the way, this is not a \nDemocratic proposal; this is the administration's tax gap proposals--as \n``an unreasonable tracking and reporting burden for small business.'' \nAnd that is just for 2 percent of the revenue the majority claims it \ncan raise by going after small businesses. We should try to collect \nmoney that is owed, but if it were that easy--as my friend from Iowa \nSenator Grassley suggests--we would have found the money to fix the AMT \nyears ago.\n  But, sadly, these gimmicks are not the worst part of the budget. What \nis more disturbing about this resolution is what is not included. The \nmajority did not designate one dime in Social Security, Medicare, or \nMedicaid savings to help slow the impending entitlement tidal wave \nheading our way--not one dime. Entitlement spending threatens to flood \nour budget and soak up every Federal dollar, as I mentioned\n\n[[Page S3652]]\n\nearlier, leaving no revenue for education, the environment, \ninfrastructure, or scientific research. The majority's budget ignores \nthis problem.\n  In fact, this budget does worse than ignore the problem. It will pile \nbillions of dollars in new entitlement spending on top of the existing \nproblem. It is so obvious that this budget resolution simply satisfies \na political agenda. It is a public relations campaign that the majority \nis using to avoid telling the American people the truth. I am accusing \nthem of that, and I have to say the same thing for my side of the \naisle. We are both guilty. All of our hands are dirty.\n  To add to insult, since Republicans switched to 5-year budgets a few \nyears ago, Democrats have repeatedly called for 10-year budgets because \n5-year budgets hide our long-term problems. In other words, the other \nside of the aisle kept complaining: You are using 5-year budgets \nbecause if you use 10, the American people are going to find out how \nmuch money you are spending. So we went to the 5-year budget. We want \nto hide that figure about the next 5 years. If the Democrats wanted to \ndo it this time, I would have said: Do the 10-year budget. Let the \nAmerican people know what the truth is about how much money this budget \nis going to cost.\n  For example, the CBO currently projects that total outlays for \nMedicare and Medicaid will more than double--more than double--by 2017, \nincreasing by 124 percent. This is roughly two times as much as the \neconomy is expected to grow during the same period. A 5-year forecast \nhides this explosion in entitlement liabilities. Tell the truth--\ntransparency. Let the American people know what the score is.\n  Yet, here we are, with Democrats in control of both Chambers, and \nthey are trying to pass a 5-year budget that continues to cover up the \ngathering fiscal storm looming on our horizon. Shame on us. Shame on \nthem. They are playing the game we played starting in 2004, after \npromising to do better.\n  I take our Nation's fiscal health very seriously. I am concerned \nthere is a lack of transparency in this budget. There are gaping \nloopholes the majority can exploit to cause spending and deficits to \nrise much higher than the budget resolution claims. In an attempt to \nclose some of these loopholes, tomorrow I am going to offer two \namendments.\n  First, we need to reform our Nation's entitlement programs. I have \nbeen begging on my knees trying to get the White House to take on the \nresponsibility of reforming our Tax Code--we need it; it is overdue--to \ntake on entitlements, to reach out to Republicans and Democrats and \nsay: The time has come. Let's put everything on the table. Let's reform \nour Tax Code. Let's do something about entitlements. The fact is, \nsilence--silence. I have to tell you, if we do not do this, then our \nchildren and grandchildren are going to drown--they are going to \ndrown--in a sea of debt.\n  I am concerned, however, that if we reform entitlements and save \nbillions of dollars, Congress might grab those savings and spend some \nof them on other programs instead of paying down the debt. So what I am \nsaying is, I am hoping--and I know the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee, the Senator from North Dakota, has said he wants entitlement \nspending reform--I am hoping we get it. All this amendment says is: If \nwe do get entitlement spending reform, it is going to be used to pay \ndown the debt and not fund other entitlements.\n  I previously introduced legislation called the SAFE Commission Act \nthat would guarantee a fast-track, comprehensive approach to reforming \nour Nation's tax, entitlement, and budget systems. If the 110th \nCongress enacts entitlement reform, either by way of legislation or as \na result of another bipartisan effort, we must use those savings to \nreduce the deficit and, as I say, pay down the debt and not on \nentitlement spending.\n\n  Specifically, my first amendment would require any savings from \nlegislation that slows the growth of entitlement spending by $5 billion \nor more be dedicated to deficit reduction. Some of my colleagues are \nasking: George, why are you worrying about this? Well, I hope we have \nthis problem where we have to decide what to do with these entitlement \nsavings we have enacted. Because, as I said earlier, the majority has \nnot included even one dime's worth of savings in this budget \nresolution. We do nothing--not one thing--in this budget about \nentitlement spending.\n  Second, every time we enact new entitlement spending or tax cuts, \nwhich are financed through additional borrowing, we increase the level \nof interest payments the Government has to make on its debt. I have \ntalked about this debt and the interest costs. These new interest costs \nrepresent additional Government spending. Yet, CBO cost estimates \nignore the effect of these interest payments on spending and the \nnational debt.\n  In other words, we are spending money on reducing taxes--and we are \npaying for it by borrowing--or we are spending money on new programs--\nand we are borrowing the money--because we keep ratcheting up the debt \nand we do not calculate the interest costs that are involved in either \ntax reductions or the spending for these new programs.\n  These ballooning interest costs add up to $370 billion in 2008. Think \nabout this: That interest cost will be 13 percent of the budget. The \npublic needs to know that in addition to spending additional money on \nnew programs, we are paying interest on that money. I am concerned \nabout these growing interest costs because they are part of our \nmounting national debt.\n  Frankly, our interest rates are low right now, but they could \nskyrocket. The first couple years I was mayor of Cleveland, interest \nrates at the time were 13 percent. Some Americans remember savings \npassbooks that were paying 14 and 16 percent. I will never forget it \nbecause I had the money for my children's college education in mutual \nfunds. I sold the mutual funds and put them in the passbook savings \nbecause we were getting--can you imagine--we were getting 16 percent--\n16 percent--on a passbook investment.\n  I think we need to wake up to the fact that if we get a change in the \ninternational marketplace--as I mentioned earlier, 55 percent of our \nbudget is with foreign investors--if those central banks get a little \nbit nervous about the United States of America--and I have talked to \nAlan Greenspan about this; we could see interest rates skyrocket to 12 \npercent, 13 percent--that would suck up an enormous amount of money.\n  So the fact is, we ought to pay attention to letting people know when \nwe either reduce taxes, and borrow the money, or we spend money above \nthe budget, somebody has to pay some interest on that cost. We must \nstop this charade once and for all. Both sides of the aisle have a \nclear, moral obligation to improve the fiscal health of our Nation. It \nstarts with formulating a fair and honest budget. Yet we are being \ndishonest and masking the long-term challenges that confront our \nNation.\n  We must deal with these problems head on and work on a bipartisan \nbasis to reform our tax system, control the growth of entitlement \nspending, and slow this freight train that is threatening to crush our \nchildren and grandchildren's futures.\n  Experts say the most important step you can take is to first admit \nyou have a problem. I will never forget when I was mayor of Cleveland \nand came in, the easiest thing sometimes in life was just to keep the \nproblems in a drawer and not look at them and hope they would go away. \nI found a long time ago that if you take those problems and pull them \nout and deal with them, you are so much better off than if you just let \nthem lay around and get worse.\n\n  The question today is, Do we have the moral courage to fix it? Do we \nhave the moral courage? Can we do that? It is a moral issue.\n  I will never forget Frank Wolf. I gave a speech last year and Frank \ncalled me and he said: I am going to put a bill in, and we are going to \nset up a commission that is going to do something about tax reform and \nentitlement.\n  He said: I have--I think he said 11 or 12 grandchildren. He said: I \nthought about it. I am a fiscal conservative. He said: But you know \nsomething. We have a moral obligation to our children. We just can't \nlet this thing keep going. The fact is, do we have that moral \nconviction to fix it or are we too darn interested in protecting our \npolitical hides--our political hides--to do anything? Do we have the \ncourage to do it? Do we have the courage?\n  I am 70 years old. I have seven grandchildren. I care and worry about \nthem.\n\n[[Page S3653]]\n\nMy concern is what legacy am I going to leave my children and my \ngrandchildren. I was fortunate. We were fortunate. We had others before \nus who were responsible--others, for example, who were willing to pay \nfor the wars that we were in. Today, in this country, let's see, it is \nup to $510 billion for Iraq and Afghanistan, and if we pass the \nsupplemental, it is going to be $610 billion. The only sacrifice that \nis being made today in this country is by the families that have the \nbody bags returned to them. Twenty-six thousand of our men and women \nwho have been injured, half of them disabled for the rest of their \nlife, and we are not doing anything. We are not doing anything.\n  Last year, I said if we can't get tax reform to raise the money that \nwe need to take care of things, then we ought to have a temporary tax \nincrease to pay for our war. We should. It is the right thing to do. \nBut, no, we will let it go and let somebody else worry about it the \nnext time around--the new President.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would note as I begin how much I \nappreciate Senator Voinovich and his passion for America in trying to \nintroduce responsibility in spending and taxes. We don't always agree \non everything, but he is a man of principle and dedication to his \ncountry.\n  Mr. President, the amendment I will be asking my colleagues to \nconsider tomorrow deals with a growing problem that we have in America. \nIt has to be confronted completely before long. It is the alternative \nminimum tax. This is a tax that after you figure what you owe on your \nincome tax return and you have taken all your deductions, you have to \ncalculate your taxes again and you may have to file under the \nalternative minimum tax and pay more taxes. That was an idea conjured \nup before I came to the Senate to capture rich people who weren't \npaying enough taxes. Maybe it had some resonance to it, but it has \nfallen very hard now on the middle class, and it is very dramatic.\n  We in this Congress have become addicted to the money the alternative \nminimum tax brings in. We have decided, though, that we can't allow \nmillions of middle-class people to be burdened with a new and higher \ntax, so we have tried to fix it. We did what was called the AMT patch--\na patch. It wasn't a complete fix, it was a Band-Aid, and it would do a \nlot. Actually, it has done considerable. Without a patch next year, \nabout 23 million people will be subjected to the tax, but with the \npatch, 17 million of those will not. They will be dropped out of AMT. \nSeventeen million people will be saved from that.\n  I just want to say, first of all, the real solution, as everyone \nknows, is tax simplification. We need to do that, but we have no real \nmomentum at this moment in the Congress in either House or in either \nparty or by the President. Those of us not on the Finance Committee \nsometimes wonder why we don't have more proposals for tax \nsimplification, but we don't. It is going to happen sometime, sooner \nrather than later.\n  So the patch helps. It raises the AMT exemption level, the amount of \nmoney, the floor to which you get caught with, and that has helped \nsome. But the real truth that I must share with my colleagues is that \nthe result has not been fair. It is not a principled way to deal with \nthe people being caught by the alternative minimum tax.\n  In 2006, for example, 7.4 percent of married people with children \npaid higher taxes under the AMT, while 1 percent of singles paid the \nAMT. Think of that. This tax, the way it is calculated and the way it \nis put together, it has fallen incredibly hard, over seven times as \nhard, on married people with children as it does on single taxpayers. \nWhy is that so? Well, when you calculate your alternative minimum tax, \nyou can't use your personal exemptions. You can't use that personal \nexemption of $3,400, and you can't claim your children as exemptions.\n  So I would first say one of the most valuable things this country has \nare the parents out there, some single moms, working their hearts out \nevery day to raise and educate the next generation of young people who \nare going to lead this country.\n  So the alternative minimum tax I have believed for some time has \npenalized people with children. We have had a marriage penalty and now \nwe see with the AMT, we are actually taxing children, making it even \nmore expensive for young families to have children.\n  So I think my amendment does the right thing. It achieves a very \nsimilar result as the patch but is more principled, more cued to what \nis in the national interests, and more fair.\n  First, it treats children and personal exemptions correctly. You \nstill get your personal exemption under the AMT and exemptions for your \ndependents in your household. Under this plan as I have offered it, 87 \npercent as many people will not have to file an AMT return as would \nunder the patch--almost the same, 13 percent less, but very close to \nthe same number. But astoundingly and importantly, it costs a lot less. \nIt would save in terms of tax revenue lost $82 billion over 5 years. It \nwould be a lot less expensive in terms of tax cost.\n  This $82 billion could help us contain the deficit. It could help us \nfund the expiring tax cuts that have allowed us to have a low-tax \neconomy that has led to such terrific growth in our economy, would \nprovide some of the money we could use for that, and it would be good \nfor the economy in a way that I am afraid this unprincipled approach to \npatching the AMT does not. There would be less focus on high income, \nhigh tax States. I come from a lower tax State, a poorer State, a \npoorer State with a lower average income than the average in the United \nStates. We are doing a lot better, and I am proud of that, but we still \nare below the national average in a number of different ways. Our State \nwould not benefit much at all under the patch.\n\n  Let me show my colleagues this chart. This is a rather astounding \nchart. These are the percentage of taxpayers who paid the AMT by State \nin 2005. In my home State of Alabama, it was 0.8, eight-tenths of 1 \npercent. Less than 1 percent paid any AMT. But in New York, with a good \nbit higher average income, 6 percent paid--6 percent of the people paid \nit. The numbers are high in other States. Mississippi is low at .9, and \nthe Dakotas are .8 and .6. Indiana is 1.0; West Virginia, .9. The lower \nincome States are not going to benefit as much under the kind of patch \nwe are talking about. Most of the benefits of the patch will be \ntransferred to only a few States for a lot of different reasons. One is \nbecause they have higher taxes which cannot be deducted under the AMT.\n  So I would say what we need to do is to do better. By having the \nexemptions allowable under the AMT calculation, we would benefit people \nmore fairly around the country, although not a complete fairness. It is \nstill going to be a tax that dramatically shifts benefits to higher \nincome, higher tax States. There is no doubt about that. But this is at \nleast a step in the right direction, and it helps real people. My \nexcellent staff person, Dr. Andrew Barrett, talks about a professor he \nknows, Christopher Wolfe, who has 10 children. He is getting whacked by \nthe AMT.\n  I think a person who is pouring his heart and soul into raising a \nlarge family and trying to do the right thing by them should not lose \ntheir tax exemptions and have to pay a higher tax than somebody who \ndidn't have that.\n  I hope we can have a good vote on this tomorrow. I think it is the \nright thing. As we go forward, we are going to have to talk about this \nmore. The more I study it, the more convinced I am that this is not a \ngood way to handle tax policy in America, this AMT.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Orrin Hatch be listed as a \ncosponsor on that legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I will sum up. I am a member of the \nBudget Committee. One of the things you see as you watch these budgets \ngo through here and we discuss them and debate them and it sounds like \na lot of politics and hot air and partisanship. But the real truth is \nthat a budget is a defining instrument for a party. A budget tells what \nyour priorities are, what direction you want to take the country in. I \nam not sure we have ever had a budget since I have been here--well, \nmaybe a few in the beginning but certainly not in the last several \nyears of my tenure--that was passed on anything other\n\n[[Page S3654]]\n\nthan a party-line vote, at least in the Budget Committee.\n  Once again, the budget that came out of this Budget Committee, now \nthat we have a Democratic majority, passed with all Democratic votes \nand no Republican votes. Last year, the budget that passed out was \npassed by all Republican votes and opposed by all Democrats. But they \nwere in the minority at that time. I used to think, well, why can't we \njust get together and work these things out. Perhaps we can at some \npoint. Perhaps we will have a break in this cycle. But right now, it \nseems that the budget defines us and our differences. What is it we \nagree on? What is it we disagree on? Where do we want to take the \ncountry? And where does somebody else not want to go?\n  Let me mention a few things about this budget. It is a spending \nbudget. The President proposed a rather substantial increase in \ndiscretionary spending; but our Democratic colleagues passed a budget \nthat adds $18 billion more in nondefense discretionary spending than \nthe President asked for. It brought it up to a total increase in \nnondefense discretionary spending of over 6 percent--I think it is 6.1-\npercent growth in spending.\n  Well, what is the cost of living? What is the CPI, the inflation \nrate? It is about 2.3 percent. So this budget increase, in a time of \nwar, in a time when entitlements are raging out of control, is not a \nfrugal budget; it is a spending budget. You should not be spending \nalmost three times the inflation rate if you want to have any kind of \nresponsibility in spending. We don't have to spend three times the rate \nof inflation to keep the country from collapsing. The country is not \ngoing to collapse if we had a flat budget or if we cut 3, 4, 5 percent, \nif you want to know the truth. The Republic will still be standing.\n  But, no, we have to fund these programs, these ideas, and these \nvisions that utilize money and runs up the total. So they have shoved \nthrough a budget that increases it substantially. Last year, we passed, \non a party-line vote, a proposal that would have contained, by about 1 \nor 2 percent over 5 years, the growth in entitlement spending. Senator \nJudd Gregg worked this in. He believed in it passionately. He believed \nwe could now, early on, before we reach a fiscal disaster in the \nfuture, control some of these spending programs. He had a modest cut in \nthe growth--growth only--of Medicare. I think it was like 45 percent \ngrowth to 46 percent growth. How about that? Do you think we can \nsustain that? It got to the floor and all of the Democrats opposed it \nand several Republicans opposed it, and it failed. We could not even \ncontain the growth by 1 percent.\n  So all last year, in this last election, my Democratic friends, were \nout railing at President Bush for spending wildly. They claimed that \nRepublicans were irresponsible on spending, and here they go coming \nback with this budget. Did it have any effort or did it display any \nmovement whatsoever to contain the growth of entitlement spending? \nZero. It didn't attempt to confront that issue. I think that is a \nmistake. We have had a lot of complaints that we have to do something, \nbut when it came down to the time to produce a budget, over the \nobjection of Senator Gregg and others, they had no interest in that.\n  Well, what about taxes? We didn't have any savings on the spending \nside. We had an increase on spending. What about taxes? They say this \nis not a raising-taxes budget, that it doesn't raise taxes, don't worry \nabout that. We have not voted to raise taxes. Let me tell you what they \ndid do. They created a system and a mechanism--or at least the majority \ndid when they passed this budget--that is going to put us in a position \nwhere we are going to raise taxes, and I am going to explain it to you \nas simply as I possibly can. The budget adds four points of order. A \npoint of order calls for a supermajority vote to carry out some act. \nThey said you cannot have tax cuts unless several things occur, and the \nonly way you can have those tax cuts, if those things don't occur, is \noverride a budget point of order, and that takes 60 votes, not 50. So \nwhat about the existing tax cuts--the capital gains reductions, the \nmarriage penalty elimination, the dividends reduction? What about \nreducing the tax rate for the lowest income workers who pay Federal \ntaxes by 33 percent, from 15 to 10 percent?\n  Well, they came up with a proposal that says you cannot even extend \nthose tax cuts that have been in place for a number of years and begin \nto expire in the next couple of years. Those cannot be extended without \nbeing able to overcome the budget points of order. To do so, the most \nlogical thing is to cut spending. So if you cut spending enough to pay \nfor a tax reduction, a tax reduction that is already in place--and some \nhave been in place for over 5 years--if you don't cut spending \nsufficient to ``pay for the lost revenue,'' according to these \nestimates, then you cannot undo it without 60 votes.\n\n  When we passed those tax reductions, it was virtually party line, \nalthough several Democrats, including Ben Nelson, voted with us, but \none time it was a tie vote. Another time it was one or two votes. These \nwere razor thin, the low fifties. By putting in a 60-vote point of \norder, it is not going to be possible to extend the existing tax cuts, \nthe reduction of the rates, capital gains. They estimated, for example, \nthat capital gains reductions would cost the Treasury $5 billion. As it \nturned out, capital gains, after being reduced, have resulted in \nincreases to the Treasury of $133 billion. If you sell a piece of \nproperty and you have to pay 20 percent on the profit, you might not do \nit. If you are thinking about selling stock and you say, wait a minute, \nit has grown in value and you are going to have to pay a 20 percent tax \non that, you may say I will just hold it. At 15 percent, people say, \nOK, I will pay that.\n  We have had an interesting time of more sales of property and assets \nsubject to capital gains, and we increased revenue after the tax rate \nwas reduced. I wish to say to you that this budget has put us in a \nposition that I don't see how it is possible that we can extend even \nthe existing tax reduction. Those tax reductions have spurred this \neconomy. They were enacted during a time when we had difficulties. It \nis important to note that when President Bush took office, the Nasdaq, \nthe high-tech stock market, had fallen 50 percent. The first quarter he \ntook office was negative growth. In fact, the last month of President \nClinton's term was negative growth. President Bush inherited an economy \nin serious trouble. Then 9/11 hit and we were in a recession. It could \nhave been a long one, but it turned out not to be. It bounced back \nquickly, and a big reason is he reduced taxes; the economy grew and \npicked up the slack and began to grow.\n  Two years ago, the revenue coming into the U.S. Treasury increased 15 \npercent over the previous year. Last year, the revenue coming in--this \nis money actually in the Federal till--went up 12 percent over the 15 \npercent. This year, they are predicting that revenue to the Federal \nTreasury will be up almost 10 percent over last year's 12 percent. That \nis fabulous growth. What should we do? We ought to contain Federal \nspending. We ought to keep those tax cuts in place, not to make \nsomebody rich, not just to let them keep more money--money that they \nearned--but because it is good for our economy, because we are a free \nmarket economy, and we are a group of people who believe in individual \nresponsibility--not like the Europeans, who are semi-Socialist, if not \nSocialist, who deeply believe in higher taxes, more regulation, bigger \ngovernment, and more social welfare.\n  That is not our heritage. We have a heritage of free, responsible, \nindividual Americans, whose goal and ideal is to take care of \nourselves, but we will help those who need it when they need it.\n  I wish to say this budget defines a lot of who we are. I think it \ndefines a different vision for what is best for America. It has been \nthat way for most of the time I have been in the Senate, and it looks \nlike we are at it again this year.\n  I feel strongly we ought not to go and slide and move toward the big \ngovernment, high taxes, and social welfare system of the Europeans. \nThey say: Well, it has not made the taxes go up; we have a budget and \nthe Finance Committee can fix this and they can do whatever they want \nto do. They have a lot of freedom.\n  But with the points of order in the budget, I submit to you that we \nhave a problem. I submit to you this Democratic budget that came out of \nthe\n\n[[Page S3655]]\n\ncommittee is similar to this torpedo on this chart.\n  Democrats can say they have not raised taxes yet, but they have \nlaunched that torpedo right at this thriving, vibrant American economy. \nThe torpedo is named ``tax increases'' and they are on the way. That is \na fact. I don't see anything that is going to intercept that torpedo \nbecause the vote tomorrow will put us on a road we cannot get out of. \nIt is going to put us in a situation where the votes will not exist to \ncut taxes, and we are going to allow even existing tax reductions to \nphase out, and taxes will jump, and it will amount to the largest tax \nincrease in American history, from what the experts tell us.\n  It is late. This is an important point and an important time for our \ncountry. When we pass a budget, it doesn't do a whole lot. A budget \nbasically has a couple of things it does. It sets the total level of \nspending. That level has been raised over what the President has asked \nfor. It creates a mechanism that could allow us to extend tax cuts for \nless than 60 votes, or do other revenue changes for less than 60 votes. \nBut the budget we are passing is going to put us into a situation where \nwe will increase spending and we will be put on a road to increase \ntaxes.\n  I think that is a wrong direction for our Nation, and I doth protest.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/22/senate-section/article/S3655-1", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3655]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9 A.M.
