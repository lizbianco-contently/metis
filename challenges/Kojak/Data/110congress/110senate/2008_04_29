Mr. President, the bill we hope to start legislating on \nafter the caucuses today is an important piece of legislation, FAA \nreauthorization.\n  Last Thursday, I met in my office with representatives of various \nunions that deal with the airline industry--flight attendants, \nmechanics, and air traffic controllers. They had some opinions as to \nwhat was going on. An hour or two later, I met with the chief executive \nofficers of the major airlines in our country today. They were terribly \nconcerned about what goes on. The fuel costs for these airlines is now \napproaching 50 percent of their overall cost. I may be a few cents \nwrong in my illustration, but they said: We can't compete. We pay $1.20 \nfor a gallon of aviation fuel. In Europe they pay 70 cents. You cannot \ncompete because the dollar has become so low in value around the world.\n  This is an extremely important bill. If there were ever a time we had \nto work in a bipartisan basis in order to approve legislation necessary \nto give the airline industry a chance to survive, then we must do it on \nthis piece of legislation.\n\n  I will work with my Republican counterpart to see if we can see a way \nof each side offering amendments. I do not want to have to fill the so-\ncalled legislative tree. We have to be very careful. This is a tax \nbill. So I will have a conversation with my colleague this morning \nbefore our caucus to see if we can come up with a way to proceed on \nthis legislation. It is very important legislation.\n  We have so many other things to do. We have the farm bill that is \ncompleted, basically, I understand. We are going to have to go to that \nsoon because it expires the end of this week. We have the Consumer \nProducts Safety Conference. That should be completed hopefully by the \nend of next week. We have the budget, our budget that we have to \ncomplete. Fortunately, on\n\n[[Page S3460]]\n\nthat, we have a statutory time to work toward its conclusion.\n  Whether we want it, there is going to have to be a discussion about \nfuel prices, what is going on. That is the No. 1 issue facing America \ntoday. It is more important now than the housing market, which is so in \na state of distress.\n  So we have much to do in the next few weeks, not the least of which--\nthe House is going to pass, next week, the supplemental appropriations \nbill dealing with the funding of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. It \nis no easy venture to complete that because, as you know, there are \ncertain things the President wants to have on that bill that he has \ntold us, in addition to the funding for the wars.\n  We have had a lot of opportunity in recent months to point fingers at \neach other. Hopefully, the next 4 weeks, until the Memorial Day recess, \nwe can start pointing fingers to a way to complete some of this \nlegislation because it is extremely important we do that. For example, \nwe had to file cloture on this bill. I told my leadership team I met \nwith this morning, we cannot blame that one on the Republicans because \nthe fact is the substitute coming from the Finance Committee and the \nCommerce Committee had not been completed until 10 o'clock last night. \nSo realistically we couldn't expect Republicans to start legislating on \nthat before they had the piece of legislation themselves. But they have \nhad it now since last night. I hope, after we have had our caucuses, we \ncan proceed toward completing this legislation in some reasonable \nmanner.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/29/senate-section/article/S3460-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3460]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               MEASURE PLACED ON THE CALENDAR--H.R. 5715\n\n  Mr. REID.

The Republican leader is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                               GAS PRICES\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, as we all know, the Senate voted \nunanimously last night to proceed to the FAA bill, despite the fact, as \nthe majority leader indicated, at the time we voted, we had not yet \nreceived the Senate substitute. We did have a chance to receive it \novernight and will now review it before proceeding. We can talk again \nafter the respective policy lunches, at midday today, about that. It is \nmy expectation when we do get on the bill that we, indeed, allow \namendments. The majority leader has indicated that is his intention. \nMany on our side would like to offer amendments and there will be \ndebate on this bill.\n  I would also like to point out that while the FAA is an important \nagency, the No. 1 issue for Americans right now, and their greater \nconcern, is the price of gas at the pump. The price of gasoline has \njumped by more than $1.25 a gallon since the beginning of the current \nCongress. The cost of oil has nearly tripled to $120 a barrel now. \nAccording to the AAA, the average price of a gallon of gas in Kentucky \nis $3.58, the highest ever. I was happy to read the majority has tasked \ntheir chairman to come up with ideas to work on this issue, but I fear \nthe answer that comes back will be the same two-word prescription that \nhas been offered in the past--higher taxes.\n  But higher taxes will only raise the price at the pump, not lower it. \nSo while we move forward on the FAA bill, the Senate should not forget \nwhat Americans are most concerned about, the dramatic increase in pain \nat the pump over the last year. We should be able to stipulate at the \noutset that raising taxes as a way of addressing the problem is not \neven worth serious consideration.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/29/senate-section/article/S3460-3", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3460]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, it is interesting, the issues that touch \nthe lives of people to the point where they bring them up to a Senator \nor Congressman. There is an issue now which, whether you live in \nPennsylvania or Illinois, you are going to hear about--whether you are \ngoing to shop in a grocery store in Springfield, as I did over the \nweekend, or back home in church--and it is gas prices. It is \nunderstandable because this is an economic issue which hits you right \nbetween the eyes every time you drive down the street and hits you \nright in the pocketbook when you go to pay for gasoline. You know what \nis happening with the price of that commodity. You also know when \nsomething is obviously very wrong.\n  In my State, the average consumer is paying a record $3.71 a gallon \nfor gasoline. There are many States paying more. Diesel fuels are even \nworse. The Illinois average now is $4.30 a gallon, but in some parts of \nAmerica, diesel fuel costs as much as $5 a gallon.\n  Think about the trucker. Many of them have to live on a very slight \nmargin, filling up the tank of that truck they are taking down the \nhighway and putting out over $900, sometimes $1,000, to do it. For many \nof them, it means work extra hours, extra days, an extra week, to try \nto make enough to get by.\n  Fuel costs are approximately 2\\1/2\\ times what they were when \nPresident Bush took office in 2001. What a legacy this President will \nleave, when you take a look at energy in America today. We elect \nPresidents to look to the future to plan and guide America. In this \nsituation, this administration, which was born in the oil patch, with \nboth President Bush and Vice President Cheney having their early roots \nin the business of oil companies--this administration has stood by on \nthe sidelines and watched the cost of energy rise to record levels in \nAmerica, creating hardship not just for families and individuals but \nsmall businesses as well as trucking firms--not to mention airlines, \nwhich I will mention in more detail in a moment.\n  When you take a look at the opportunity for economic growth in \nAmerica, it is tied tightly to the cost of energy. This President has \nfailed, in 7 years, to have an energy policy that had any vision. It \nwas predictable that demand would increase for petroleum and crude oil \nin countries such as China and India; that limited resources around the \nworld would be taxed as these economies grew, as their demand for oil \ngrew, and as we had to compete for that oil with those other countries \nsuch as China and India. The law of supply and demand suggests that \ncompetition is going to raise the price of crude, and it has risen \ndramatically.\n  Many people say: Well, I suppose, because it has now reached $120 a \nbarrel--as it did last week--that explains the gasoline prices I am \npaying, the diesel prices, and jet fuel prices. In fact, it does not. \nIt is an oversimplification to say that is the reason. Because between \nthe crude oil and the product you buy is a refinery, an oil company \nthat takes the crude and converts it into the product we purchase. The \ndifference in cost between the original\n\n[[Page S3461]]\n\nbarrel of crude oil and the ultimate product is called the crack \nspread--the cracking process at the refinery--and that has changed \ndramatically.\n  Not that long ago, the difference in cost was $1 or $2 a gallon, in \nterms of the refining process. Now it is up over $40 a gallon. So the \nrefining process--between the crude oil and what you bought at the gas \nstation--has risen dramatically in cost. Crude oil, of course, costs \nmore. But that has risen dramatically.\n\n  That explains something else, a phenomenon which cannot be ignored. \nThis is the week when America learns who is making money off the high \ngasoline costs we find at the pump. I think the answer is obvious: \nConocoPhillips reported 2008 profits for its first quarter were up 17 \npercent, $4 billion in profits for ConocoPhillips in the first 3 months \nof the year.\n  This morning, British Petroleum, BP, announced they made $7.6 billion \nin profits in the first quarter of 2008. Royal Dutch Shell announced \n$9.08 billion in the first quarter. We are still waiting for \nExxonMobil.\n  Understand, these are not the biggest profits in the history of the \noil industry, these are the largest profits in the history of American \nbusiness, some say in the history of all business throughout mankind; \nthe largest profit taking ever. At whose expense? At the expense of \nconsumers and families, small businesses, truckers, airlines, and our \neconomy.\n  That is the reality. Would you not expect the President of the United \nStates to call in the major leaders of these oil companies and say to \nthem: You are destroying the economy we are counting on for America by \nyour profit taking; you are making it impossible for this economy to \ngrow. We are facing a recession over the housing crisis and now you are \ncompounding this misery with your greediness and selfishness and profit \ntaking from this economy.\n  That is fact. The oil companies say: Well, the problem is we do not \nhave enough refineries. If we had more, then we would have more product \nand we might have a smaller spread and we would not be. Let me tell you \nwhat: Today, the refineries in America are operating at 85 percent of \ncapacity. Do not buy this argument that it is about refineries. They \nhave more capacity. They are holding back so they can keep their \nproduct dear and limited and short, and so the consumers will \nultimately pay more.\n  The oil companies have been making money hand over fist as those oil \nprices have gone up. In 2007, the private oil industry pocketed $155 \nbillion in profits, out of revenues of $1.9 trillion. And the largest \nintegrated oil company, ExxonMobil, reported a profit in 2007 of $40.6 \nbillion, record-breaking numbers.\n  Profits for the five largest integrated oil companies have more than \nquadrupled in 5 years. This deluge of profits has been so great that \ncompanies hardly know what to do with the flood of money filling their \nheadquarters.\n  Do you think these profits are being reinvested in infrastructure and \nincreasing production to ease rising prices? Are the profits being used \nto make it easier for us to use alternative fuel in cars and trucks? \nThe answer is no. A good portion of their profits is being accumulated \nas uninvested cash. Cash holdings for the five supermajor oil companies \nin 2007 exceeded $52 billion; money right off your credit card into the \noil company coffers that sits there earning interest. That is 279 \npercent greater than it was in the year 2002. Capital expenditures by \nthe same industry for infrastructure and capacity increased by only 81 \npercent.\n  Now, some people have suggested a gas tax holiday; stop collecting \nthe Federal gas tax. I will tell you in the first instance if American \nconsumers are bought off with that alone, they ought to take a second \nlook. If there is a 3-month gas tax holiday, as has been proposed, it \nwill mean savings to consumers on average of about $25 to $30; $25 to \n$30 for the entire summer. Think about what you are paying for a tank \nof gas. If you take off the Federal gas tax, then the money is not \ngoing into the Federal trust fund to build the highways, to reduce the \ncongestion so you do not sit in traffic burning gasoline and get to \nyour destination. That is not a very good tradeoff. So the obvious \nquestion is, if the national gas tax is to come off and give me any \nsavings, what am I ultimately going to pay? Who is going to pay for the \nmoney that is lost in the investment in the Federal highway trust fund? \nThat, I think, is critical.\n  Last week I called on the Chairman of the Federal Trade Commission to \nlaunch an investigation into this matter. I should not have had to \nwrite that letter. The fact that a Member of Congress has to knock on \nthe door and get a little stir inside the Federal Trade Commission and \nsay: Anybody home? Have you noticed what is going on at gas stations \nacross America? Why would a Member of Congress have to ask the Federal \nTrade Commission to do their job? But they should do their job. They \nshould be taking a close look at the increase in gasoline prices and \ndiesel prices and jet fuel prices.\n  This last week, the two biggest airlines in America, American \nAirlines and United Airlines, reported record losses for the first \nquarter because of the cost of jet fuel. In the instance of American \nAirlines, it was around $300 million; United Airlines, around $500 \nmillion. These are serious problems. United is going to lay off 1,000 \npeople. That is going to hit my home State of Illinois and the City of \nChicago. It is going to hurt us in terms of employment. Other airlines \nare facing the same squeeze because of jet fuel costs. It is the same \nissue as diesel fuel, the same issue as gasoline.\n  If America's economy is going to pull out of this recession and move \nforward, we need real leadership. We need the Federal Trade Commission \ninvestigating those oil companies and their profit taking. We need \nCongress to stand up on its hind legs and finally say ``enough.'' And \nwould it not be a joy to have a President who would wake up in the \nmorning and look outside the window of the White House and see \nsomething other than Baghdad? If he looked outside the window and \ninstead saw Chicago or Boston, or Miami, or Philadelphia, he would \nunderstand this American economy needs his attention.\n  As the President comes and asks us for $108 billion more for this war \nin Iraq with no end in sight, he is proud that he is going to leave \noffice never changing this failed policy he instituted in Iraq, and he \nignores the American economy.\n  A strong America begins at home. And most Americans will tell you, it \nbegins at the gas pump. Give them affordable gasoline so this economy \ncan grow and they can afford to meet the costs of living which continue \nto increase dramatically under this administration.\n  Unfortunately, this President has ignored it. Born in the oil patch, \nhe has been raised to ignore the obvious. When the oil companies are \ntaking obscene profits out of the wallets of American consumers, it not \nonly hurts our economy, it hurts our security in this world.\n  I am glad 51 Senators have joined in asking President Bush to stop \nputting oil in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve for the remainder of \nthis year. I wish he would listen, but he has not.\n  I hope we are going to move toward more research and development so \nwe have cars and trucks that are more fuel efficient. This \nadministration is devoid of ideas and devoid of leadership when it \ncomes to this energy crisis. If this President would get out of the \nWhite House and visit any town in America and ask the average person \nwhat is on their mind, they would tell him: Mr. President, roll up your \nsleeves, focus on this country, bring down the cost of gasoline. Get \nenergy prices under control so this economy can prosper.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/29/senate-section/article/S3461-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3461-S3462]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                AUTHORIZING LEGAL COUNSEL REPRESENTATION\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Douglas Rawlings, \n     Jonathan Kreps, James Freeman, Henry Braun, Robert Shetterly, \n     and Dudley Hendrick.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this resolution concerns a request for \ntestimony\n\n[[Page S3462]]\n\nand representation in criminal trespass actions in Penobscot County \nCourt in Bangor, ME. In these actions, protesters have been charged \nwith trespassing for refusing requests by the police on March 7, 2007, \nto leave the Margaret Chase Smith Federal Building, which houses a \nnumber of Federal offices, including Senator Susan Collins' Bangor, ME \noffice. Trials on charges of trespass are scheduled to commence on \nApril 29, 2008. On April 28, 2008, a defendant subpoenaed a member of \nthe Senator's staff who had conversations with the defendant protesters \nduring the charged events. Senator Collins would like to cooperate by \nproviding testimony from that staff member. This resolution would \nauthorize that employee to testify in connection with these actions, \nwith representation by the Senate legal counsel of that employee and \nany other employee of the Senator from whom evidence may be sought.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motions to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, with no intervening action or \ndebate, and any statements be printed in the Record.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 539) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 539\n\n       Whereas, in the cases of State of Maine v.

Mr. President, this week is the sixth annual Cover the \nUninsured Week. Community organizations and foundations around the \ncountry will be hosting events to highlight the need for health reform. \nAcross the Nation, we all know this: 47 million people lack health \ninsurance. In my State of Ohio, 1.2 million people, 11 percent of the \npopulation, are uninsured.\n  It is no different in the Presiding Officer's State of Pennsylvania. \nBut that even one American lacks health coverage is a national \nembarrassment. We are the wealthiest Nation in the world. We spend \n$2.38 trillion a year, $2.3 trillion a year in health care, but we \ncannot make sure that every American has health care coverage? Of \ncourse we can.\n  Every other industrialized nation on this Earth ensures access to \ncoverage. We in this body have chosen not to. Last year Congress tried \nto provide health coverage to millions more low-income children. The \nHouse and Senate both passed bills twice to provide $35 billion over 5 \nyears in additional funding for the State Children's Health Insurance \nPlan. It was the biggest bipartisan initiative to expand health care \ncoverage in years. Twice--not once but twice--the President vetoed that \nlegislation. We spend more than $3 billion every week in the war in \nIraq. The President vetoed legislation spending $7 billion a year to \ninsure 4 million children; $3 billion a week every week in Iraq; the \nPresident vetoed $7 billion a year to insure 4 million children. These \nare the sons and daughters of working parents; sons and daughters of \nparents in Toledo, in Mansfield, in Zanesville, who are working hard \nand playing by the rules.\n  Think about this: Since I have begun to speak a few moments ago, we \nhave, in Iraq, spent $650,000. Yesterday in Iraq we spent $400 million. \nLast week in Iraq we spent $3 billion. Again, the President vetoed \nlegislation $7 billion a year for 4 million children. It was \ndisappointing to us as advocates for children's health insurance. But \nmostly it was disappointing to the parents of children around my State, \nin Cincinnati, from Ashtabula, from Marietta to Springfield, to Lima, \nparents around Ohio and around the country who need health insurance \nfor their children.\n  Not only do many low-income children live without health insurance, \nbut families whose breadwinners are self-employed or who work for small \nbusinesses struggle to get health insurance too, families such as the \nColtmans of Conneaut, OH, a community in the northeast corner right \nacross the line from Pennsylvania. The Coltmans are a large family with \nfive children and two hard-working parents. Last year their 7-year-old \nson Caleb was diagnosed with leukemia. The doctors are optimistic, but \ntreatment is wildly expensive. Last year, Kenna Coltman, Caleb's \nmother, left her job to work for her family business, a neighborhood \ngrocery store. Unfortunately, this meant she had to search for new \nhealth insurance. After a long search for private insurance, the \nColtmans found an affordable plan, but it was not scheduled to go into \neffect until August. By that time, Caleb had been diagnosed with \nleukemia, which was a deal breaker for the private insurer. Uninsured, \nfacing a catastrophic illness, a parent's worst nightmare, the Coltmans \nhad run out of options.\n  Kenna, the mother, a college-educated daughter herself of two \nConneaut natives, recounted the experience this way.\n  She said: If there was absolutely any other way to get our son the \ncare and medication he needs without totally impoverishing our family, \nwe would do it.\n  In a country like ours, families should not have to worry about being \nthrown into abject poverty to pay for health insurance. Families want \nto do the right thing. They want to insure their children. They work \nhard, they play by the rules. But insurance is too often out of reach.\n  That is why today I am introducing a bill to make health insurance \nmore viable for workers employed by small businesses. The Small \nBusiness Empowerment Act would create an insurance program for small \nbusinesses and self-employed Americans. This program is modeled after \nthe excellent coverage that is provided to Federal workers and to \nMembers of the House and Senate.\n  To keep premiums affordable, the Department of Health and Human \nServices would create a reinsurance mechanism to help cover high-cost \nenrollees. The legislation would establish a Federal commission to \ntackle the toughest health policy issues: how to rein in health care \nspending without compromising health care quality and access; how to \ncraft an insurance package that treats all enrollees equally, \nregardless of what type of health care they need, which is essential; \nhow to combat price gouging by the drug industry, the medical device \nindustry, and the insurance industry. In other words, how to ensure our \nhealth care system is sustainable and equitable, efficient and \neffective. The bill was introduced to help families such as the \nColtmans.\n  Thankfully, Caleb's current prognosis is good, and the family \nbusiness seems to be turning the corner. His treatment was covered by \nOhio's Medicaid I Program, another program that is crucial to providing \ncoverage to families who are struggling; another program that is under \nattack by this administration as it tries to change the rules and as it \ncuts billions of dollars from the program.\n\n[[Page S3463]]\n\n  This week and every week we need to work to keep Medicaid strong, to \nrealize the expansion of CHIP for which we fought so hard, and to pass \nlegislation for the self-employed and workers in small businesses. The \nsmall employer health insurance bill provides more options so that the \nrest of the Coltman family, including Caleb's parents, can access \nhealth insurance too. I don't want Caleb's parents in Conneaut, OH, to \nlive in fear when their children fall down or get in an accident or \ncatch the flu or have an allergic reaction to something they ate. They \nhave enough on their plate already.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to protect Medicaid and \nthe Children's Health Insurance Program and to pass this bill.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, the National Aeronautics and \nSpace Administration is an incredible little Federal agency that has \npulled off extraordinary feats and continues to do so--defying the laws \nof gravity, utilizing the principles of physics to do wondrous things--\nas we begin to continue our exploration of the heavens. But NASA is \ngoing through a very difficult time. First, NASA has been starved of \nfunds. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration, in its human \nspace program, has not been allocated enough money by this \nadministration and a series of Congresses over the last several years \nin order to do everything they want to do. This was particularly acute \nearlier in this decade when we lost the second space shuttle, the \nShuttle Columbia, in its breakup in the atmosphere upon reentry over \nTexas.\n  NASA spent $2.8 billion just in the recovery of that disaster and in \nthe recovery of flight. Unlike the loss 20 years earlier of Challenger \nand the cost of recovery from Challenger, which was provided outside of \nthe NASA budget, this time NASA had to eat the cost of recovery out of \nits operational budget, therefore leaving almost $3 billion less for \nNASA to operate on to do all it wants to do.\n  What are the things it wants to do? What do we want it to do? To \nfulfill the vision as enunciated several years ago by the President, \nthat we would build a new vehicle after the space shuttle, the capsule \ncalled the Orion, the rocket called Aries, a program called \nConstellation that would have a new vehicle, like a capsule, like the \nold Apollo capsule that only carried three astronauts, that would carry \nsix. It would be a new human vehicle to get to and from the space \nstation, much safer than the space shuttle, more economical, but then \nthat the program would then expand on for us to go back to the Moon by \n2020 and establish a habitation on the Moon to learn from dealing in \nthat environment, as ultimately humankind is going to go to Mars. That \nis the program called Constellation.\n  But NASA was never provided with enough money. Over the past couple \nof years, this Congress, this Senate has tried to provide NASA with the \nmoney. Indeed, last year we were successful in the NASA appropriations \nbill in getting an additional billion dollars just to partially pay \nback NASA for the money it had eaten out of its operating budget on the \ncost of recovery of the space shuttle disaster, the Space Shuttle \nColumbia. But when we got to the House, in the negotiations, the White \nHouse--specifically the White House budget director--would not support \nthe additional billion dollars. The chairman of the House \nAppropriations Committee then insisted that it be taken out of the \nbudget.\n  NASA is right back in the place where it found itself, with not \nenough money to do everything it is trying to do. It is like saying you \nwant to take 10 pounds of potatoes and stuff them into a 5-pound potato \nsack. It doesn't fit.\n  Hopefully, the new President will understand this. Does America want \na successful space program and does America want a successful human \nspace program complementary to those robotic spacecraft that do so many \nsuccessful things? I think the answer is clearly yes. We have always \nhad the high ground. This country's technological achievements have \nalways kept us at the cutting edge as the leader in the world.\n  Remember when the Soviets surprised us by putting up the first \nsatellite sputnik, and we were scrambling to catch up. Remember when \nthey surprised us and put the first human, Yuri Gagarin, into orbit and \nthat surprised us. And we hadn't even gotten Alan Shepard up in \nsuborbit, and it was 10 months later before we could get the first \nAmerican in orbit, former Senator John Glenn, one of the great heroes \nof this country.\n  After that, then our resolve, the Nation's focus, a Presidential \ndeclaration by a young President who said: We are going to the Moon and \nreturn. With all of that combined, along with a space race with the \nSoviet Union, we clearly became the leader. The spinoffs from that \nprogram into everyday life, the technological achievements--Velcro, \nmicrominiaturization, new products, a lot of the modern miracles of \nmedicine--are direct spinoffs from the research and development of the \nspace program. When going to the Moon, we had to have highly reliable \nsystems that were small in volume and light in weight. That led to a \nmicrominiaturization revolution of which we are all beneficiaries \ntoday.\n  The question is, Are we going to retain that leadership in space? Yet \nif we keep bleeding NASA of resources, we are not going to be able to. \nWe are already facing a situation where we will not have human access \nto space for 5 or 6 years, when the space shuttle is shut down in 2010, \nand the Administrator of NASA tells us that we are not going to be able \nto fly the new vehicle Orion with humans until the year 2015, if that. \nWhat does that mean to us? It means we have a $100 billion investment \nin orbit right now called the International Space Station that is \nsupposed to be used for scientific research, and we are not even going \nto have an American vehicle to get there for 5 or 6 years. That is \nunacceptable.\n  How are we going to get there? We are going to pay the Russians to \nget a ride for our American astronauts on their Soyuz vehicle which had \na problem last week on reentry with a too steep reentry, a ballistic \nreentry, 8 Gs experienced by the cosmonaut and astronaut on board. So \nwe are going to have to negotiate with Vladimir Putin during this 5-\nyear period, which we are going to have to buy. We are going to be \nlaying off American space workers at the Kennedy Space Center, and we \nare going to be funding jobs in Moscow at who knows what price Vladimir \nPutin will charge us because he knows it is the only way we have to get \nto the International Space Station. And, by the way, if that is not \nenough to cause heartburn, we can't pay Russia for space flights, of \nwhich we have to go about and contract right now if they are going to \nbuild a spacecraft for 2011, when we would need it. We can't pay them \nfor it because we are prohibited by a law that says, since they are \nhelping Iran, a nation that we are concerned about proliferating \nnuclear weapons, we have to get a waiver of that law.\n  All of this is to say that we have a mess. If this Nation wants to be \na leader in space, which I believe every American believes we should, \nwe have to start helping NASA. We have to get the next President \nattuned to this issue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise this morning to talk about what \neveryone is talking about, which is the price of energy today. I was \nhome in Alaska over the weekend. Everywhere I went, the price of \ngasoline was the main topic. Everyone wanted to talk about it. Here in \nthe lower 48, as we are looking at high crude prices hitting the $120-\nper-barrel mark yesterday, or nearing that mark, recognizing that we \nare seeing a nationwide average of gas prices at $3.60 for a gallon of \nregular--\n\n[[Page S3464]]\n\nthis is up just 4 cents over the weekend--we all agree that prices are \nhigh, far too high. But in a State such as mine, we consider the prices \nto be in the stratosphere. In Bethel over the weekend, the price of \ngasoline was at $4.98 a gallon. I just met with a constituent coming \nover here. We were talking about prices in Fairbanks, about the \nnational average. But up in Allakaket, which is a pretty remote little \nvillage, the prices they are looking at for their gasoline are over $7 \na gallon for regular gasoline.\n  In Valdez, which is the site of the Trans-Alaska oil pipeline, the \nterminus of our gas line, they are finding regular selling there for \nmore than $4 a gallon. I think we would all agree these prices are not \njust high, but for many they are absolutely unbearable.\n  We can talk about why the prices are high. It is important to \nunderstand that. But Americans are tired of hearing, when we talk about \nthe world demand, the world using 85 million barrels a day, that there \nis very little surplus oil production capacity left.\n  They are tired of hearing of the weakness of the dollar that is \ndriving investors into buying oil as a safe haven against inflation. \nThe truckers who were gathered around The Mall yesterday in protest of \nthe high prices--I have to wonder if they care that we, in Congress, in \n2005 and again in 2007, passed legislation to promote energy \nconservation that requires an increase in the vehicle fuel efficiency \nstandards. That is going to begin to improve their mileage in about 7 \nyears. They do not necessarily care we have funded the research and the \ndemonstration of alternative energy technologies, whether it is for \ngeothermal or for ocean energy. They do not care about the loan \nguarantees we intend to make for nuclear and solar and wind and biomass \nas we try to make our biofuels go even further.\n  What people care about--what they want to know--is: What are you \ndoing, Congress? What are you going to do to make the price I pay at \nthe pump go down?\n  I suppose we can halt filling up the Strategic Petroleum Reserve--\nsomething we certainly are looking at. I think at this time of very \nhigh prices it makes some sense. But we need to recognize that is only \ngoing to add 70,000 barrels a day to the nearly 21 million we are \nusing.\n  We could also reduce the Federal gas tax, which is currently 18.4 \ncents, and dedicate the nearly $5 billion we gained in OCS lease sales \nthis winter from sales up in the Chukchi Sea in Alaska and from the \nGulf of Mexico to help offset the losses to the highway trust fund. \nBut, again, that would only offset the revenue losses to transportation \nprojects for probably a few weeks.\n  So the question the consumer is asking is: What can you do that could \nmake a difference in this country? I believe one of those things we \nneed to do in America is to produce more of our domestic oil and gas \nsupplies to help increase global oil supplies and, thus, drive down the \nprices. We would do this at the same time we are working toward \nrenewable fuels. We would do this at the same time we are focusing on a \nlevel of conservation. It has to be this kind of three-legged stool \napproach. But we cannot stick our head in the sand and say increased \ndomestic production should not be part of that comprehensive strategy.\n  Now, some have suggested we do not have enough oil in this country to \nmake a difference. But look at what we in the Federal Government have \ndone through regulation and through moratoria. We have prevented \nexploration in many of the places where oil and gas are most likely to \nbe found in this country.\n  If you take the areas that are covered by the OCS moratoria--the \nAtlantic coast, parts of the Gulf of Mexico closest to Florida and the \nPacific coast and you throw in the Arctic Coastal Plain and parts of \nthe National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska--you have nearly 40 billion of \nthe Nation's 112 billion barrels of remaining undiscovered oil which \nhas been put off the table for consideration. That is nearly enough to \npower over 20 million cars for 60 years and heat nearly 10 million \nhomes for the same period.\n  Last year, I came to this floor--actually, I come to this floor quite \noften--to urge my colleagues to consider greater oil development in my \nhome State of Alaska. Earlier this year, I came and I urged that we \nsimply allow--just allow--us winter-only exploration in northern Alaska \nto confirm that the oil we believe is there is truly there. Last year, \nwhen I spoke, the price of oil was at the $60 mark. At the same time, I \nwarned that if we continued to do nothing, the prices would only \ncontinue to climb.\n  I have never been one of those people who relishes the ``I told you \nso'' approach, but I am here to say it is time for this country to snap \nout--snap out--of its lethargy and actually explore for and produce \nmore of our Nation's fuel needs.\n  It was about a month ago, Senator Stevens and I introduced new \nlegislation to open a tiny part of the Coastal Plain of the Arctic \nNational Wildlife Refuge to oil and gas development. Opening a few \nthousand acres--we are talking about 2,000 acres--of Alaska's Arctic \ncoast to oil and gas production could produce up to 16 billion barrels \nof economic oil by current Government estimates. To some, that might \nnot seem like much. But without opening ANWR, we are going to have to \nimport between 780,000 and 1 million barrels of additional oil each \nday. That is only going to continue to help drive up the world price of \noil.\n  Without ANWR, American domestic oil supplies fall sharply. The EIA \npredicts Alaska will be producing about 270,000 barrels a day, next \ndecade, from our existing oil fields up in Prudhoe Bay. This is \ncompared to the nearly 800,000 barrels a day the State is currently \nproducing.\n  The bill we introduced will automatically open the coastal plain of \nANWR in the northern part of the State if the world price of oil tops \n$125 a barrel for 5 days. In return, what it does is allocates all the \nFederal revenues that would come from that oil to both alternative \nenergy development and to programs to help improve energy efficiencies \nand to those in need. What we anticipate, in terms of revenues, would \nbe an estimated $297 billion--$297 billion--to help fund the wind \ntechnology, the solar, the biomass, the geothermal, the ocean energy, \nthe landfill gas--everything that was covered in those Energy bills \nthat were passed in 2005 and 2007, plus it would provide funding for \nLIHEAP, for weatherization, and for the WIC Program. The bill \nincorporates protections so that while we do the exploration and the \nproduction, we are also protecting the environment.\n  We mandate that the exploration occur only in the winter, when no \nanimals are on the Coastal Plain to be disturbed. It requires the use \nof ice roads that disappear in the summer to protect the wildlife. It \nallows for special areas to be designated to protect the key habitat. \nThere are dozens of stipulations to guard against noise and flight \ndisturbances, spills or land use problems.\n  Opening ANWR does so many things. It makes us, first and foremost--\nand most important--less dependent on foreign sources of oil. It cuts \nour balance of payments deficit. It improves our economy. It keeps our \njobs at home, not exporting them to foreign oil producers such as \nVenezuela. But, more importantly, I think it signals that we are \nfinally serious about helping ourselves, that we will do it here first, \nthat we can produce oil from ANWR, and we recognize this will help to \ndrive down the psychology and the speculation that is currently acting \nto drive up world oil prices.\n  I will be the first one to admit to you that opening ANWR tomorrow \nwill not produce more oil tomorrow. We recognize that. But we do \nbelieve it will dampen the price speculation that is helping to fuel \nhigher prices.\n  We have to talk about true and meaningful solutions: not only \nincreasing alternative energy--which is a must--not only doing more to \nimprove our energy efficiency and our conservation--absolutely \nimportant--but we need to get on now with also increasing our domestic \nenergy supplies. ANWR is one way to demonstrate we are serious about \ndoing that.\n  I do hope we will seriously look at the current merits of opening \nANWR to exploration and development.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank Senator Murkowski for her \ncomments and agree with them very\n\n[[Page S3465]]\n\nstrongly. This is not a matter that she just raised. Her distinguished \nfather, who chaired the Senate Energy Committee, was a champion of ANWR \nproduction when he was in the Senate.\n  When I came here almost 12 years ago, I believed that was the right \nthing then. I understood then that it did have the capability of \nmaintaining wealth in our country and helping to ease the surging price \nof oil and gas. I believe, as history has proven, she is correct.\n  That is the way it is. We steadfastly--vote after vote after vote, \nfor the last 12 years I have been in the Senate and before that--tried \nto produce the tremendous reserves of oil and gas that are contained in \na small part of ANWR. We have been blocked.\n  It is odd that those who blocked it, and seem unphased by the fact \nthat we are importing huge amounts of oil and gas from nations around \nthe world that are often hostile to us, such as out of that great lake \nin Venezuela. Nobody is worrying about the environment in Venezuela--it \nis all right to bring it from Venezuela or other places but not from \nthe United States.\n  After many years since I have been in the Senate, we finally were \nable to open up more lands in the Gulf of Mexico, where huge reserves \nexist. It is not an academic matter only. We are talking about gasoline \nthat has risen to the price of $3.61 a gallon as of this morning. One \nyear ago, it was $2.84 a gallon; and 2 years ago, it was $2.74 a \ngallon. As a result, the American family, with two cars, is paying \nabout $75 a month more for the same amount of gasoline they were buying \npreviously.\n  This impacts our economy adversely. It is a transfer of wealth. T. \nBoone Pickens--himself an oil producer and one of America's most \nsuccessful entrepreneurs--recently talked about the fact we are buying \nover 60 percent of our oil from foreign countries at the cost, he \nestimates, of $600 billion a year. We are sending $600 billion a year \nto foreign countries to import the oil we utilize. T. Boone Pickens \nreferred to that, in an American Spectator article recently, as: the \ngreatest wealth transfer in the history of the world.\n  Do we have the ability to do something about it? Are we just totally \nhopeless? Do we have an ability to do something about that? Absolutely, \nwe can do some things. I supported ethanol, although we clearly are \npushing the limits on that. But if we could do more cellulosic ethanol, \nwe could do better. I supported the increase in the gas mileage, which \nwe did pass, which will have a significant reduction in our demands.\n  But as the population of our country is growing, even if we reduce \nour own individual use, we are going to have high demand in our country \nfor years to come. It is a question of: Where are we going to get it? I \nsupport hybrid automobiles. I support diesel automobiles. In fact, \ndiesel is as clean or cleaner, in terms of CO2, and gets 30 \npercent better gas mileage than gasoline automobiles. Europeans utilize \ndiesel automobiles. Fifty percent of their cars are now diesel. They \nactually get the same gas mileage and emit the same or less \nCO2 than hybrids. Did you know that?\n  So somehow we have fiddled around here and ended up not promoting \ndiesel in an effective way and have seen the price of diesel fuel, \nwhich should be cheaper, be 60 cents more per gallon at the pump. I \nwould like to know more about why that is happening. I think it has to \nbe a combination of things, but I think Congress needs to look into \nthat. I hope, in the Energy Committee, we will have some hearings on \nthat particular question.\n  But let me talk about some of the reserves we have in our country.\n  In 2005, this Congress directed the Department of the Interior to \nstudy our reserves on the Outer Continental Shelf. I am from Alabama. \nWe are a gulf coast area. They found that 8.5 billion barrels of oil \nare currently known to exist off the Nation's shores. In addition, the \nstudy estimated that approximately 86 billion barrels of oil also exist \nin those areas that have not been charted yet. The U.S. Geological \nSurvey and private industry also estimate that approximately 25 billion \nbarrels of oil exist onshore in the lower 48 States and in Alaska.\n  This amounts to approximately 119 billion barrels of oil available to \nthe United States in our country or off our shores alone, for which we \ndo not have to pay any foreign nation. Any production we get, as \nSenator Murkowski of Alaska stated, can create profits that come to the \nUnited States and not to foreign countries, and we can use it to \naccelerate nuclear power, plug in hybrids, ethanol, cellulosic ethanol, \nwind and solar, and those other kinds of energy forms. But apparently \nwe have those who just steadfastly block this and prefer to send our \nmoney to Hugo Chavez in Venezuela.\n\n  Now, there are some additional sources of oil in our country of \nimmense proportions, and at these world prices, it has proven to be \nalready economically feasible to develop them. One is oil shale. The \nCongressional Research Service, our own independent research service, \nestimates this country's oil shale reserve to be equivalent to \napproximately 1.8 trillion barrels of oil, or 1,800 billion barrels of \noil in oil shale. The largest oil producer in the world, Saudi Arabia, \nis estimated to have only 267 billion barrels. We are talking about 1.8 \ntrillion in the United States, and it can be produced for less than \n$100 a barrel--some say $60 a barrel--and the people who produce it \nwould be Americans paid salaries by the American Government, who would \npay taxes to the U.S. Treasury, keeping our wealth at home and not \ntransferring $600 billion to a foreign country.\n  In 2005, Congress recognized the potential--I want my colleagues to \nunderstand this--we recognized the potential of oil shale in the Energy \nPolicy Act we passed, which was a good bill. It made a number of good \nsteps forward. We identified it as strategically important and called \nfor its further development. Yet the new Congress, under the new \nleadership, has acted to block the development of this abundant \nresource despite the record price of oil. They undermined the 2005 \nEnergy Policy Act. In the recently passed Energy Independence and \nSecurity Act, the majority inserted language into the bill prohibiting \nany Federal agency from contracting to procure any alternative or \nsynthetic fuel that produces greater life-cycle greenhouse gas \nemissions than those produced from the ground, those produced from \nSaudi Arabia. This language prohibits the Federal Government from \ncontracting to produce oil shale. They knew exactly what they were \ndoing, and that was exactly the purpose of that language. It really \nshould be repealed. It is misguided. It is wrong.\n  The Energy Act of 2005 directed the Bureau of Land Management to \nlease Federal lands for oil shale research and development projects. \nYet the Congress, in this same bill, acted to block the development of \nthis provision. So we passed it in 2005, and they came along and \nblocked it. Language was inserted, actually, this time in the \nConsolidated Appropriations Act--that is, the Omnibus appropriations \nbill at the end of last session--that prohibited funds from being used \nto implement the leasing program which Congress directed BLM to \nimplement in 2005. It should be repealed. That is not the right thing \nfor us to do.\n  So there is much more we can say. We need technology. We need \nadvancement in our ability to conserve energy, and at the same time, \nwhile we are making that progress, we do not need to be devastating our \neconomy by transferring $600 billion a year to foreign countries when \nwe can produce so much more here at home.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, may I inquire how much more time of \nmorning business is allotted to this side?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Eight minutes.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to 10 minutes in \nmorning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I thank the Chair.\n  I don't blame the American people for being upset at the price of \ngasoline they have to pay at the pump. Frankly, the biggest cause of \nthose high prices is the Congress.\n  It has been 2 years since Speaker Pelosi said that her party, the \nDemocratic Party, had a commonsense plan\n\n[[Page S3466]]\n\nto bring down prices at the pump. I am left to wonder how long we will \nhave to wait to hear what that commonsense plan is. So far, all we have \nheard is an escalation of the blame game, which, of course, here in \nWashington, DC, inside the beltway, is a world-class sport. The problem \nwith the blame game is it doesn't actually solve any problems. I think \nwhat the American people are frustrated about, among other things, is \nCongress's intransigence, its unresponsiveness, and its unwillingness \nto listen to their concerns--legitimate concerns--about how they are \ngoing to balance their family budget, particularly when it comes to the \nrising cost of gasoline and the rising cost of health care.\n  As my colleagues can see, in the 2 years that have gone by--in almost \n2 years--we have gone from $2.33 for an average price for a gallon of \ngas to $3.61. That translates for an average family to about a $1,400 \nincrease in expenses a year associated with their gasoline costs--\n$1,400 a year. So the Federal Government has essentially imposed an \nadditional tax by its inaction on the average working family in this \ncountry. Frankly, we have the tools available to us to remove that tax \nand remove that burden if we will simply exercise our ability to use \nthose tools in order to begin to bring down that price at the pump.\n  History has shown that raising taxes on oil companies is no solution \nbecause ultimately we know who ends up paying for tax increases. \nUltimately, they are passed on down to the consumer. So it may be \nfashionable to beat up on big oil and say: Let's tax the oil companies \nbecause they are making too much money, but do you know what. If we \nraise taxes on the oil companies, we all end up paying an increased \nprice for gasoline at the pump. It also has the effect as we saw from \n1980 to 1988; the so-called windfall profits tax actually caused a \ndecline in American oil production, reducing domestic production by as \nmuch as 8 percent. So for those who are worried, as I am, about our \ndependence on imported oil, a windfall profits tax is simply no answer \nat all. In fact, it is counterproductive.\n  Of course, the problem then was the same as the problem is today, and \nthat is a shortage of oil around the world. I have said it before and I \nwill say it again: Congress can pass a lot of laws, we can repeal some \nlaws, but we cannot repeal the law of supply and demand. Other \ncountries around the world have or want more of what we have in this \ncountry, which is unheralded prosperity, primarily because of our use \nof a disproportionate amount of energy. India and China and growing \ncountries such as those with a billion people each are using more \nenergy, and we are not seeing the supply go up, particularly here at \nhome. So we know that Congress has been one of the biggest obstructions \nto increasing oil supply and lowering prices at the pump.\n  My staff helped me research these figures to make sure we had \njustification for them. As we see oil now approaching--maybe it has \ngone over--$120 a barrel today, if we were to develop the known \nresources we have available in Alaska that the Senator from Alaska just \ntalked about, it would be the equivalent of $55-a-barrel oil--$120-a-\nbarrel foreign oil versus $55-a-barrel American oil. If we were to \ndevelop more of the Outer Continental Shelf in places such as the Gulf \nof Mexico, even beyond the horizon where you can't even see it from \nshore, we could produce that oil from American reserves at the price of \nroughly $63 a barrel--$63-a-barrel American oil versus $120-a-barrel \nforeign oil.\n  It seems to me we are missing a great opportunity, not only to help \nbring down the major price driver of gasoline costs--70 percent of the \ncost of gasoline is the cost of oil--but also to make ourselves more \nsecure and less dependent on foreign sources of oil, enhancing our \nnational security and helping to bolster our economy at the same time. \nBut, as we have heard, Congress has consistently thrown up a roadblock \nat accessing these sources of American oil.\n  Now, some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have \nproposed another so-called solution to low supplies. They said: You \nknow what. We are going to take OPEC to court. Let's sue somebody. \nUnfortunately, that is an all-too-common proposed solution where we are \ngoing to litigate, regulate, and increase taxes. But, frankly, it is a \nlittle bit--well, more than a little bit--impractical, and it would \nmake us even more hopelessly tied to foreign nations and their \nproduction whims. So if your solution is, let's sue OPEC and force them \nto sell us more oil, does that make us less dependent on foreign \nsources or more dependent? I would suggest that even if it were \npractical, which it is not, it would make us more dependent on foreign \noil and is not a solution.\n\n  We need to remember just how much of an impact high energy prices \nhave on the everyday lives of working Americans. High prices drive up \nthe cost of all methods of travel. We are here this week talking about \nour airlines, and we know what economic pressure has been put on the \nairline industry and on the prices of tickets that continue to go up \nbecause, frankly, the price of oil is coming close to bankrupting the \nairline industry and driving those costs. But, of course, whether it is \nthe cost of driving the kids to school or driving to work, these high \ngasoline prices impact everyday Americans all across our great country.\n  As the Senator from Alabama noted, sometimes Congress's best \nintentions backfire in things such as ethanol subsidies, using corn, \nusing food for fuel, and leading to skyrocketing--helping to lead to \nskyrocketing food costs, not to mention livestock feed and other \nunintended consequences. We need to recognize that while developing \nrenewable fuels certainly has its place as a part of the answer, no \nsingle solution is a panacea. All of these have to add to our energy \ndiversity and our energy mix in order to provide the relief the \nAmerican people want and need.\n  Increasing the supply, which will help bring down the cost of oil and \nthe cost of gasoline, as I said earlier, must begin here at home using \nAmerica's natural resources. Why Congress would mandate, in effect, \nthat we can't buy American, we have to buy foreign when it comes to \noil, is beyond me, and it just doesn't make any sense. We can develop \nenvironmentally responsible oil production right here at home if \nCongress would simply act.\n  The only real commonsense near-term solution to bringing down prices \nat the pump is to take advantage of the enormous natural resources we \nhave right here at home. It is estimated that if Congress stopped \npenalizing and handcuffing American energy production right here at \nhome, we could produce an additional 2.7 million to 3 million barrels \nof oil a day. That would be 3 million fewer barrels of oil a day that \nwe would have to buy from Canada, from Venezuela, and from nations in \nthe Middle East.\n  Allowing American production would send a strong message to the \nAmerican people and to the financial markets that we are working as \nquickly as possible to drive down gas prices for American families. It \nwould reduce speculation on the commodities markets that is helping to \ndrive up the price of oil because when the financial markets see the \nCongress doing nothing and see the supply of oil remain static and see \nthe demand increase, it is going to continue to drive prices higher and \nhigher.\n  Unfortunately, we have seen too many Members of Congress block sound \nenergy policies that would give American companies access to our \nvaluable natural resources, such as we have heard about oil deposits in \nAlaska, offshore deposits, and shale oil sites that the Senator from \nAlabama mentioned a moment ago.\n  I think most Americans take an instinctive pride in the ``Made in \nAmerica'' label, and wouldn't it be nice when it came to the gas pump \nif we saw a ``Made in America'' label on that gas pump.\n  I appreciate the opportunity to talk about what I think is probably \nthe No. 1 issue on the minds of most of my constituents in Texas and \nmost people in America today. It is the reason we had a bunch of \ntruckers here yesterday complaining about the inaction by Congress when \nit comes to the price of fuel they need to earn a living and move \nAmerica's goods and services around this country and to our homes.\n  I hope the majority leader and Members of Congress will work together \non a bipartisan basis to try to bring some of these policies to the \nfloor as soon as possible and without a moment of unnecessary delay.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Carper).

Mr. President, imagine this: gridlock in the skies; \npassengers delayed for hours and hours on a runway; an aging, \nantiquated air traffic control system just struggling to keep up with \nthe growth of air traffic; a fight over how to pay for the billions of \ndollars needed to address airport infrastructure, infrastructure in all \nof its manifestations. I could be talking about the present, but I am \nnot. I am talking about the years 2000 and 2001, prior to 9/11.\n  Then 9/11 did happen. It changed our country forever, and it changed \nit in countless ways. It forced us to understand how important aviation \nis to our Nation, our economy, and, in fact, very much our way of life. \nIt also showed how fragile our system is and, I will argue, how fragile \nour system remains as it further deteriorates.\n  This Congress has worked diligently to address the security \nweaknesses. That was the TSA that took place a long time ago. That is \nworking. It is not perfect, but it is working. I think people feel safe \nwith it, but we have not adequately addressed any of the other \nweaknesses.\n  We have completely inadequately funded the Federal Aviation \nAdministration. We have a chronically unprofitable commercial aviation \nindustry, which is the backbone of our Nation's commerce. We have an \ninadequate investment in aerospace research. Because of this, we face \nthe same problems we did in 2000 except they are worse. I want to spend \na couple of minutes discussing why we have made so little progress in \naddressing this significant aviation system, and this is really my \nintroduction to the bill. It is just not done in sequence.\n  Perversely, the attacks of September 11, which brought the commercial \nairlines system to its knees, flat to its knees, properly to its knees, \nsolved the crisis of gridlock in the skies, to say the very least. The \nenormous dropoff of air travel in 2002 and 2003 reduced the stress on \nour Nation's 1950s air traffic control system. We are the only ones in \nthe industrial world--and I have another comparison to make which is \neven more stunning later on. So delays and congestion were not issues \nfor travelers. We felt pretty good about it. Passengers were not daring \nto fly yet. They didn't want to fly that much yet, so there was not a \nlot of congestion. Not so good for the airlines but good for people who \nwanted to get to places on time.\n  As is often the case, the urgency surrounding the need to modernize \nthe air traffic control system and turn it from basically an x-ray and \nground radio system into a digitalized, highly modern system, as every \nother industrial country has, the interest in that system becoming \ncurrent, safer, more efficient, able to handle more passengers on time \nand more delivery of cargo, waned because the air traffic control \nsystem is not easily understood. It is assumed. It is taken for \ngranted. People assume it is the most modern because it is America; \ntherefore, it has to be. In fact, it is the least modern of all systems \nin industrial countries.\n  So interest waned, and in the 2003 FAA reauthorization, which I \nhelped author with then-Senator Lott, we laid a foundation to build a \nmodern, digital satellite-based air traffic control system. We \nauthorized a significant increase in the FAA's capital budget to meet \nthe ATC modernization needs, an increase based upon the \nadministration's own request, in fact. But instead of investing in the \nsystem in 2004 and 2005; that is, speed of landing, parallel landing, \nall of those items, even taking into account wind shear, which every \nother country has except us, instead of that, in 2006, the Bush \nadministration proposed dramatic cuts in the FAA's facility and \nequipment account, which is precisely the account which funds the \nmodernization of our air traffic control system.\n\n  I have to say, Congress complied. I am not proud of that fact. I am \nnot quite sure the reason for that, but facts must be stated.\n  Over this period, Congress therefore appropriated $600 million less \nthan the 2003 FAA bill authorized for the FAA's capital accounts. It is \na sad story on the part of the administration, and it is a sad story on \nthe part of us. Neither of us were living up to our obligations. \nObviously, people didn't see the future.\n  Under the leadership, however, of Senator Murray, the Senate has \nbegun fully funding the FAA's modernization needs, but the damage of \nunderfunding the FAA is not easily repaired. It is a large battleship. \nWe just cannot turn it around in a couple of years.\n  The budget surpluses that we once had are gone, but by the FAA's own \nestimates the development of the next generation of air traffic control \nsystem, NextGen--when I say that, I mean the digitalized GPS system--is \ngoing to cost between $20 billion to $40 billion through the year 2025.\n  I might add, we are going to have to not only maintain our analog \nsystem because that is what we are using, inefficient as it might be, \nbut build a new system at the same time.\n  Despite the popular misconception that we are building a new system \nthat the FAA will turn on one day in 2025, NextGen is a program that \nwill then employ multiple technologies over time. I will discuss \nNextGen in detail later. I will discuss a lot of items in a lot of \nspeeches later. But we cannot just shut off the ground-based radar \nsystem. That is all we have, crummy as it is, pathetic as it is. The \nFAA will need to operate that system for years to come, probably 10 to \n12 years to come.\n  By late 2006, it was clear that air travel was returning to pre-9/11 \nlevels. That took some time, but in 2006 there we were. The ATC's \nsystem ability was again overtaxed to meet the demands being placed \nupon it. Gridlock in the skies returned, and it is only going to get \nworse.\n  I said yesterday the FAA is forecasting that 1 billion passengers \nwill pass through our Nation's aviation system by the year 2025. That \nis a 300 million person increase from this year. We cannot ignore this \nissue anymore and, hence, this bill.\n  The United States is losing its position as the global leader in \naviation. As the Economist magazine noted--this is so horrible I cannot \neven say it, but I am going to because it is true--the United States is \nbehind Mongolia in the adoption of new air traffic control \ntechnologies. That is a national disgrace, and there is also a reason \nfor it. Mongolia did not have an air traffic control system of any \nsort. So when they decided to do it, they did it digitally, GPS. So \nthey are ahead of us.\n  I think it is a national embarrassment that a major carrier has to \ninconvenience 200,000 passengers--that is what we have been reading \nabout for the last several weeks--because the FAA was not properly \noverseeing the airlines' maintenance.\n  Our Nation's aviation system is, to be quite blunt, on the brink--it \nis on the brink. It is at the cliff. We must move boldly into the \nfuture or we risk losing a lot of safety and a lot of lives.\n  I cannot emphasize the importance of a vibrant and strong aviation \nsystem. I want people to hear this point. They take it for granted. You \nget on an airplane, and you go do something. No, you get on an \nairplane, you go do something, but it is also the bellwether of the \nNation's economic underpinning. It is not the U.S. highway system. \nPeople don't drive to States to look at industrial sites or to make \ndecisions; they fly. What you cannot do over the Internet, the next \nclosest step is aviation, and it bears our attention. It has never \ngotten it in the 24 years I have been in this body.\n  It is fundamental to our Nation's long-term growth. It is also vital \nto the economic future of countless small and local communities, \nsomething the distinguished Presiding Officer from his very roots \nunderstands very well.\n  For example, in West Virginia, people who work in the automotive \nindustry need easy access to Asia to facilitate their business. Yes, \nthat is West Virginia, but that is very important to me. West Virginia \nis like every other State. There is no State in this country that does \nnot have rural areas. All\n\n[[Page S3468]]\n\nof our future is tied to a modern aviation system, if we would only \nhave the will to build it. In this bill, we begin to.\n  We have all witnessed the fragility of our Nation's aviation system \nfirsthand. It has been all over the news. People are furious. The \nwaiting lines, the stories about planes bumping into each other or \nalmost bumping into each other on the runways as they move around--it \nis just too much, too many people. Go into any airport. As I said \nyesterday, I came back into Washington National Airport from some city \nin the North, and you couldn't move. You could barely move. The whole \nairport was just packed with people--not just around the counters, not \njust around the gateways, but the whole place was packed. I was saying \nto myself: This is Washington National, the Nation's Capital, highly \nprosperous, definitely growing. What is it going to be like 10 years \nfrom now?\n  If we do everything we want, we will not have this system in place by \n10 years. It was scary.\n  Our constituents are very frustrated about flying and they have every \nright to blame us, the administration and the Congress. It is easy to \nblame the airlines. That is always everybody's choice of blame--blame \nthe airlines. There is no question that the airlines have a lot to do \nto improve their customer service, and the bill addresses that issue. \nAll kinds of things have to happen in the airline industry. But I am \ngoing to give a speech this afternoon which talks about the airline \nindustry and how absolutely desperately close it is to collapsing. I \nexaggerate not.\n  We must address the core problem facing the system and the lack of \ncapacity to allow more aircraft to use the skies. When the weather is \nclear and our Nation's aviation infrastructure operates perfectly, most \ntravelers get to their destinations on time. It just seems the weather \nis not clear very often these days, and people are frequently shuttled \nto other places to get to where they are going, the original place, or \nthey have to sit on the tarmac for a long time and they get in a very \nbad place--and indeed they should.\n  It is a conundrum. I heard this morning a couple of airlines are \nthinking about raising their prices. They have the price of oil and \ntheir fuel. The prices of oil and their fuel are, in fact, two very \ndifferent numbers. What are they going to do? How are they going to get \nout of this? If the equipment fails to work properly because the \nweather is bad, or even for a few minutes, the system often grinds to a \nhalt, and delays in key airports such as JFK and O'Hare Airport are \nfelt through our entire system.\n  You can take eight runways--Senator Durbin and I tried to do this a \nnumber of years ago. You can fix the eight runways at O'Hare Airport, \nwhich was built back in 1962 with very few people traveling and the \nrunways were not built in the modern sense, with modern flow in mind. \nIt would take about $10 billion to $12 billion to do that. But if you \ndid it, air congestion in the United States would probably clear up by \nabout 25 to 30 percent instantly. So it is not a large, complicated \nthing. Sometimes it is an air traffic control system you need, \nsometimes it is a reconfiguration of runways, sometimes it is how do \nyou handle the New York-New Jersey area. But these are not problems \nbeyond our reach. Aviation gridlock is not just an inconvenience, it is \nbecoming a threat to our economic well-being.\n  Aviation experts predict that these delays are going to go from bad \nto worse--soon. By the year 2015, delays will become so bad--I hope my \ncolleagues will listen to this part--that none of the 1 billion people \nwho will be traveling on airlines that year will get to their \ndestinations on time--not one. That is what is being predicted. That is \nnot very far from now. That is what is being predicted. More planes \nwill be needed and they will lead to greater congestion in the skies. \nThe meltdown of the air traffic control system will put passenger \nsafety at unnecessary risk. S. 1300, our bill, authorizes approximately \n$65 billion for all FAA operations and programs. Most important, our \nbill lays the necessary foundation for developing NextGen air traffic--\nthat is the new air traffic control system--by providing it $12 billion \nover the life of this bill for FAA's capital investment accounts.\n  Importantly, Senator Baucus and Senator Murray and I have agreed on \nthe creation of a new subaccount--this is not manipulation, it is a \nperfectly proper thing to do--a new subaccount with the aviation trust \nfund that will provide $400 million for the next length of this bill, \nand then for bills after that because we will have to do it again, so \nwe can get our air traffic control system rebuilt.\n  I appreciate the hard work of our colleague. Senator Murray is \nunbelievable on these things, as she is on virtually everything. A new \nsatellite-based radar system will allow airplanes to move more \nefficiently, improve safety, improve the flow of commerce, reduce the \nconsumption of fuel which in turn creates environmental benefits.\n  The bill provides approximately $16 billion for airport \ninfrastructure--it is a boring word with large consequences. Since \n2000, I am pleased we have been able to double the amount of funding \nannually for airport infrastructure grants--that means lengthening \nrunways, that means improving conditions, that means upgrading what is \nneeded to handle air traffic in a rapidly growing traveling world. Our \ninvestment in runway capacity has made dramatic improvements in safety.\n  I believe everyone in aviation recognizes the need to modernize our \nnational air transportation system in order to meet the growing surge \nof passengers and to accommodate the enormous increase in general \naviation. I am going to have a speech to make about general aviation, \nbut I will not do it today--particularly high-end general aviation. \nThat is called jets. I am not talking about crop dusters. General \naviation is made up of lots of things--we only include 10 percent of \nthat 100 as our target, where we can rightfully and legitimately go. \nThose people are getting a free ride. I will have a speech about that, \nI guarantee you.\n\n  It is a very unhappy situation when people hear about it. It is \nprobably best explained on Jay Leno or David Letterman. That would \nprobably drive it home to people. Until then, it is sort of an abstract \nquality. Until then, look at those big, fancy jets. We don't like those \nbig, fancy jets. What they are not doing is helping pay for all this. \nThey are paying for 3 percent of our air traffic control system even \nthough they are the majority of airplanes in the skies at any given \nmoment over the United States of America.\n  All this has been a long and very bitter dialog. In early 2007, \nSenator Lott and I asked the stakeholders to come to an agreement on \nFAA funding issues. It was a fascinating experiment, which we see very \noften. No one wanted to compromise. So we said we will give you a \nchoice. You sit down in a room. We will provide the sandwiches and the \nCoke or whatever. Then you come out with an agreement or we will write \na bill for you. They chose not to yield a single point, not a single \npoint. They all had to have exactly what they had. They didn't want to \npay anything more. Air traffic control--push that aside, you are not \ngoing to tax me. It is the other guy.\n  So Senator Lott and I imposed a compromise on everyone. The \ncompromise sparked an absolutely fascinating but not pleasant \nmultiyear, multimillion dollar campaign against our lovely bill, S. \n1300. Later on I will discuss, as I indicated, much more about that.\n  We have compromised. I have compromised--not happily but \nnecessarily--in order to reach a bipartisan bill that could actually be \nsigned into law and begin the work of modernization in earnest, along \nwith making such needed safety improvements.\n  Air traffic control modernization is but one of the many challenges \nthe FAA faces. Over the last several weeks, the FAA's ability to \noversee the airlines it regulates has undermined the public confidence \nin the safety of our Nation's air traffic system, and nobody can \ndispute that. People are in shock at what they have seen over the last \nseveral weeks. Statistically, the United States has the safest aviation \nsystem in the world. That is what they always throw at us. But \nstatistics do not always tell the whole story, nor do they say anything \nabout the future.\n  I am particularly concerned about the number of runway incursions. \nThat is when airplanes are on the tarmac\n\n[[Page S3469]]\n\nand they are moving around, positioning themselves under the guidance \nof the air traffic control system. They are constantly almost running \ninto each other--or in the air--or just missing. It is unacceptable. It \nis horrible. It is heading in a much worse direction. It is not \nsomething we talk about much, but once in a while stories of near \nmisses at our Nation's airports in fact do make the news.\n  Let's be honest. If it had not been for the quick thinking and action \nof a few air traffic control people and our pilots, our Nation would \nhave had one if not several major accidents claiming the lives of \nhundreds of people over the last several years.\n  This legislation and the managers' amendment I have offered contain \nprovisions to improve the safety of the Nation's aviation system and \nthe FAA's oversight of that system. The AMAC, as we call it, includes a \nnumber of provisions to improve safety, providing the FAA with the \nresources to conduct thorough oversight of air carriers and foreign \nrepair stations--this is a very controversial subject so expect to hear \nmore about that--and upgrade the existing safety infrastructure at our \nairports.\n  Later in our debate--not today, not this morning--I will outline the \nimportant facts of the safety provision in the bill.\n  The bill addresses the other core challenge which will be facing our \naviation system, and that is keeping America's small communities \nconnected. The Presiding Officer and I understand that. So does every \nSenator in this body; if they choose to focus on it, they should be \nable to understand it. The continuing economic crisis facing the U.S. \nairline industry absolutely imperils, in stark and terminal terms, the \nfuture of hundreds of small rural communities across our country as \narea carriers drastically reduce service to small rural communities--\nwhich is exactly what is going on. That acceleration is going to pick \nup.\n  Then you have to say years ago we did this e-rate thing to make the \nInternet available to everybody in every classroom; no different rural \nand urban, everybody had it. We went from 15 percent connection to 97 \npercent.\n  Not so on aviation. We are going in the other direction. While small \nand rural communities have long had to cope with limited and unreliable \nservice, we are grateful to have limited and even unreliable service. \nWe are grateful to be able to get into a little prop--because that is \nwhat we have--and get from here to there because we can connect in the \nhub-and-spoke system.\n  All of these problems have been exacerbated by the weakened financial \ncondition of most U.S. airlines. I am going to talk about that this \nafternoon. The reduction or elimination of air service has a \ndevastating effect on the economy of small communities. Having adequate \nair service is not just a matter of convenience or pride, it is a \nmatter of survival: economically, psychologically--self-esteem. Without \naccess to reliable air service, no business is willing to locate its \noperations in these areas of the country, no matter how attractive the \nquality of life, no matter how much less the housing costs, no matter \nhow much land may be available. They will not go there. Airports are \neconomic engines that attract critical new development opportunities \nand jobs.\n  West Virginia has been able to attract firms from around the world. \nWhy? Because corporate executives know they can visit their operations \nwith ease--for no other reason. As I will explain in my next speech \nabout the state of the airlines, which is a very depressing speech and \ntherefore important, that is in jeopardy. Rural and smalltown America \nmust continue to be adequately linked to the Nation's air \ntransportation network. That is all we can do. We can't get from here \nto an important place directly, but we can link into the hub-and-spoke \nsystem, which has been what we have always done.\n  I wind up. Small and rural communities are the first to bear the \nbrunt of bad economic times and the last to see the benefit of good \neconomic times. That is not fair. Americans are Americans. The general \neconomic downturn and the dire straits of the aviation community have \nplaced exceptional burdens on air service to our most isolated \ncommunities. The Federal Government must provide additional resources, \nand our bill does that.\n  The bill also reaffirms our commitment to rural America by increasing \nthe essential air service--the Presiding Officer well knows what that \nis--and also to the Small Community Air Service Development Program, \nfor 4 more years, and we also have a passenger bill of rights which \nwill be discussed later.\n  The industry would be required to provide a number of things: Telling \npeople about what planes are on time, what are not, what the pattern \nis; sort of to get a sense of all that, but there is a lot more. So all \nof us recognize there are no quick and easy solutions to this timely \nand timeless problem that plague our aviation industry.\n  Aviation incorporates so many things that are so critical to all of \nus. It connects people to distant family members, links businesses to \nbusinesses, allows people to interact easily on a global scale. We are \na global world, but it is still amazing to me to be able to get on a \nplane in the morning in West Virginia and be in Asia that same day.\n  So what railroads were to the 19th and 20th centuries, air \ntransportation is to the 21st century; with all due respect to our \ninterstate highway system. So given the challenges our Nation's \naviation system faces, I think we must pass S. 1300, which is called \nthe Aviation Investment and Modernization Act.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I would like to inquire as to how much \ntime I have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 37 minutes remaining for the use of \nthe minority at this time.\n  Mr. INHOFE. First of all, let me say to my friend from West Virginia, \nwe have done a good job in the areas you are talking about because it \nwas not too long ago that all the AIP concentration was going to big \nregionals. Due to our efforts, we now have given greater power to the \nState aeronautic boards, who have a better idea as to what the needs \nare in the State of West Virginia, my State of Oklahoma.\n  I think we have come a long way. I would certainly echo what you say. \nI am a little privileged to be the last active commercial pilot in the \nSenate, so I take a personal interest in these things.\n  But there is nothing that can help a community be more viable than a \ngood general aviation airport, an airport that can serve the commercial \ncommunity. In fact, you can look through our State and see where the \ncommunities are not doing well and tie that to the capacity they have--\nair traffic capacity.\n  So I think we are going to be doing a good thing by addressing that \nthis afternoon. That is not why I am here though.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/29/senate-section/article/S3469-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3469-S3472]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            BIOFUEL MANDATES\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, we are in the midst of global food \ndifficulties. You have been seeing it on television, and it is the \nresult of decades of misguided environment and energy policies. As \nworldwide food availability decreases and prices continue to skyrocket, \ndecades of ill-conceived planning by politicians and bureaucrats right \nhere in Washington, afraid of expanding our energy supplies, are now \nbearing ugly fruit.\n  American families and the international community continue to suffer \nfrom these misguided policies, and Washington has to take the first \nstep to begin to address these problems. I think we know what the \nproblem is right now. We have mandated certain things to take place in \nterms of our fuels, it has had a result of increasing prices of food, \nbut it has another unintended consequence; that is, it is diverting the \nuse of corn to go to fuel as opposed to food.\n  Now, I am here today to demand two dramatic and necessary actions to \nhelp mitigate our current biofuel policy blunder. I have always \nsupported all forms of energy, including biofuels, for a diverse and \nstable energy mix, but currently policy has skewed common sense and \nviolated the principles of sound energy policy.\n  These effects are being felt in my home State of Oklahoma, where I am \nhearing concerns regarding ethanol.\n\n[[Page S3470]]\n\nScott Dewald, with the Oklahoma Cattlemen's Association, described one \naspect of biofuel's unintended consequences on April 28. He said:\n\n       Cow-calf producers all the way to the feeding sector are \n     feeling the pinch of high corn prices. Today's biofuels \n     policies have completely ignored the costs to the \n     livestock sector.\n\n  Now, first, Congress has to revisit the recently enacted biofuel \nmandate, which can only be described as the most expansive biofuel \nmandate in our Nation's history. The mandates were part of last \nyear's--it was December it was taken up--Energy Independence and \nSecurity Act of 2007. Congress has to have the courage to address this \nissue and to address it now, to recognize we made a mistake in \nDecember.\n  Second, the EPA--this is something people are not aware of, even \nthough this is mandated. EPA has the Congressionally-given authority to \nwaive all or a portion of these food-to-fuel mandates as part of its \nrulemaking process. The EPA has to thoroughly review all the options to \nalleviate the food and fuel disruption of the 2007 Energy bill.\n  A lot of people do not realize and did not think--at the time they \nthought, well, this is very helpful to the corn States. We all want to \nhelp the corn States. My State of Oklahoma also grows corn. But they \ndid not think about the unintended consequences of the cost of all fuel \nand everything you see on the shelves in the grocery store.\n  Last summer, when I offered an amendment to the Energy bill that \nwould have put in place a stocks-to-use mechanism to provide the EPA \nAdministrator more flexibility in waiver authority in the instance of \ncrop shortages, I was told by the majority whip my amendment was not \nnecessary.\n  Incidentally, The Hill newspaper reported yesterday the same majority \nwhip who said my amendment was not necessary now acknowledges that:\n\n       U.S. ethanol policies may be partly to blame for a global \n     food crisis threatening to leave millions hungry.\n\n  I am glad to have his support in this concern I am expressing today. \nDuring the 2007 floor debate, he said:\n\n       There is already a waiver provision in the bill that offers \n     protection to consumers if corn prices or availability become \n     unsustainable.\n\n  Last June when I offered this amendment, corn was trading at $3.70 a \nbushel. Less than a year later, corn is now trading at $6 a bushel. \nCorn prices and availability are now unsustainable. I ask my colleagues \nwho opposed my amendment to now join me in calling for the EPA to \nexercise its waiver authority provided in the underlying bill.\n  I am working with my colleague from Texas, Senator Kay Bailey \nHutchison, to urge the EPA to take action. Senator Hutchison also \nannounced she is introducing legislation that will freeze the biofuel \nmandate at current levels, instead of steadily increasing it through \n2022.\n  Senator Hutchison correctly noted this is a commonsense measure that \nwill reduce pressure on global food prices and restore balance to \nAmerica's energy policy. The whole world is now reacting to the \nconsequences of overzealous biofuel mandates.\n  While I supported realistic mandates in the past, I continue to \nsupport the development of cellulosic ethanol. I was one of eight \nSenators who voted against the 2007 Energy bill, with its restrictive \nbiofuel mandates, last December.\n  On Tuesday, December 4, I joined with several Senators, including \nJack Reed, a Democrat from Rhode Island, Ben Cardin, Bernie Sanders, \nand Susan Collins, in writing a letter to the President to:\n\n     . . . urge the administration to carefully evaluate and \n     respond to unintended public health and safety risks that \n     could result from the increased use of ethanol as a general \n     purpose transportation fuel.\n\n  The letter noted the administration had called for a national effort \nto reduce consumers' demand for gasoline by 20 percent in 10 years, in \npart through increased use of renewable transportation fuels such as \nethanol. Sadly, these onerous biofuel mandates, which would \nsignificantly increase renewable fuel use, particularly the use of \nethanol over the next two decades, became law.\n  Since December, the world has been confronted with irrefutable \nevidence that our current biofuels mandates are having massive and \npotentially life-threatening consequences. Once again, we are reminded \nhow restrictive Government mandates and ill-advised bureaucratic \nmeddling produce unintended consequences. Trying to centrally manage \nand plan a global food distribution network and economy through clumsy, \nunrealistically high mandates has been a proven failure.\n  An April 28 article on our current biofuel mandates in the National \nReview, by Phil Kepren and James Valvo, detailed the mindset of \nbureaucratic planners.\n\n       Each new generation of central planners believes the \n     previous generation wasn't smart enough. Yet central economic \n     planning is forever doomed to failure since the approach \n     itself limits human freedom, ingenuity, entrepreneurship, and \n     innovation.\n\n  To put it in other terms, as Ronald Reagan said: ``The more the plans \nfail, the more the planners plan.''\n\n  A large auto manufacturer has erected a billboard for their lineup of \nso-called eco-friendly cars that run on ethanol that is currently being \nprominently displayed not far from the Capitol. This advertisement--I \nsaw it yesterday--asks a simple question: ``Why drill for fuel when you \ncan grow it?''\n  That sounds like a politically correct question, to which the auto \ncompany's marketing team must have thought was an obvious answer. Let \nme allow world leaders and mainstream media outlets, the UN, and former \nbelievers in mandated Government standards to further answer the \nbillboard's marketing campaign in no uncertain terms; that is, what the \nquestion is: Why drill for fuel when you can grow it?\n  The answer is found in India's Finance Minister's statement he made \nearlier this month. He said:\n\n       When millions of people are going hungry, it's a crime \n     against humanity that food should be diverted to biofuels.\n\n  Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi said:\n\n       Food prices were raising the specter of famine in certain \n     countries. A conflict is emerging between foodstuffs and fuel \n     . . . with disastrous social conflicts and dubious \n     environmental results.\n\n  The United Kingdom Prime Minister, Gordon Brown, has called for a \nreevaluation of biofuels. He said:\n\n       Now that we know that biofuels, intended to promote energy \n     independence and combat climate change, are frequently energy \n     inefficient we need to look closely at the impact on food \n     prices and the environment of different production methods \n     and to ensure we are more selective in our support.\n\n  The Scotsman Brown also noted hunger is:\n\n     the number one threat to public health across the world, \n     responsible for a third of child deaths. Tackling hunger is a \n     moral challenge for each of us.\n\n  The President of the European Commission, Jose Manuel Barroso, has \nnow called for:\n\n     an investigation into whether the push for biofuels is to \n     blame for rising food prices.\n\n  According to an article in the United Kingdom Register, the EU may:\n\n     cancel its target of requiring 10 percent of petro and diesel \n     to be biofuel by 2020.\n\n  That is what they are doing in the United Kingdom. Now they recognize \nthey made a mistake. The article explained:\n\n       Recent weeks have seen riots over food prices in Egypt, \n     Haiti, Indonesia and Mauritania. Rice prices have hit record \n     levels this year and several countries have banned exports. \n     India has renewed a ban on all exports of nonbasmati rice.\n\n  U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon warned in April that high food \nprices could wipe out progress in reducing poverty and hurt global \neconomic growth. The U.N. Secretary-General said:\n\n       This steeply rising price of food has developed into a real \n     global crisis.\n\n  He called for world leaders to meet on an urgent basis. You know, it \nis funny that I have been quoting the United Nations. I am probably the \nbiggest critic of the United Nations in this Chamber. But I have also \nbeen very active over the years in Africa and doing the very thing we \nare trying to do now, to make sure that fewer people starve to death.\n  The head of the U.N. world food agency summed up global food \ndifficulties this way. He said:\n\n       A silent tsunami which knows no borders is sweeping the \n     world.\n\n  On April 25, the U.N. food agency chief, Jacques Diouf, warned of \npossible civil war in some countries because of global food shortages.\n\n[[Page S3471]]\n\n  I wish to pause a moment and note that some of the rhetoric by the \nUnited Nations and others may be a bit over the top and prone to hyped \nalarmism. I have taken to this Chamber many times to debunk so-called \nenvironmental crises and media manipulation of environmental issues.\n  I do not want to now be accused of overhyping our current global food \nsituation. But please do not let over-the-top rhetoric obscure the fact \nthat the world is currently facing a serious biofuel mandates problem \nand needs remedying.\n  Ironically, the anti-energy environmental left has spent decades \nworrying over various crises that never seem to materialize. You have \nto give the environmentalists credit, they may finally get their bona \nfide crisis, but alas, it will be one created by the very policies they \nadvocated.\n  It is kind of interesting because we can recall the environmentalist \ncommunity advocating the use of ethanol and the mandates and then not \nrecognizing this creates a greater pollution problem as well as a \nstarvation problem.\n  The most interesting is the mainstream news outlets have now turned \non biofuels and, in particular, corn ethanol. Publications that \nnormally uncritically parrot the leftwing environmental agenda are now \namong the biggest denouncers of our current biofuel policies.\n  The New York Times, for example, has stated:\n\n       Soaring food prices, driven in part by demand for ethanol \n     made from corn, have helped slash the amount of food aid the \n     government buys to its lowest level in a decade, possibly \n     resulting in more hungry people around the world this year.\n  Time magazine was blunt in an April 7, 2008, article titled ``The \nClean Energy Scam,'' by reporter Michael Grunwald, who wrote that our \ncurrent policies on corn ethanol are ``environmentally disastrous.'' \n``The biofuels boom, in short, is one that could haunt the planet for \ngenerations--and it's only getting started,'' Grunwald wrote.\n  Time magazine also featured Tim Searchinger, a Princeton scholar and \nformer Environmental Defense attorney who said:\n\n       People don't want to believe renewable fuels could be bad. \n     But when you realize we're tearing down rain forests that \n     store loads of carbon to grow crops that store much less \n     carbon, it becomes obvious.\n\n  Time magazine also said the rising prices were ``spurring a dramatic \nexpansion of Brazilian agriculture, which is invading the Amazon [rain \nforest] at an increasingly alarming rate.''\n  Former CBS newsman Dan Rather has also weighed in. Rather wrote on \nApril 27:\n\n       When more acreage is devoted to corn for ethanol, less is \n     available for food production.\n\n  In this case I agree with Dan Rather. He said:\n\n       Here in the United States, food is less often a matter of \n     life and death, but it is putting an additional dangerous \n     strain on families who are already struggling to get by in a \n     faltering economy.\n\n  Rather added:\n\n       Already there are reports of charitable food pantries \n     unable to meet the needs of those they serve.\n\n  The New York Sun put it bluntly about the impact of our policies: \n``Food Rationing Confronts Breadbasket of the World.'' That was an \narticle on April 21.\n  A 2007 study by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and \nDevelopment concluded that biofuels ``offer a cure [for oil dependency] \nthat is worse than the disease.'' Other organizations have weighed in. \nThe National Academy of Sciences conducted a study finding corn-based \nethanol may strain water supplies. The American Lung Association has \nraised air pollution concerns from the burning of ethanol in gasoline. \nCornell ecology professor David Pimental called our current ethanol \npolicy a ``boondoggle.''\n  Pimental said:\n\n       It does require 30 [percent] more energy oil equivalents to \n     produce a gallon of ethanol than you actually get out, and it \n     causes a lot of severe environmental problems. This is very \n     significant. It takes 1,700 gallons of water to produce 1 \n     gallon of ethanol.\n\n  No one ever talked about that last December.\n  Friends of the Earth has urged the UK to abandon its current biofuel \ntargets, which I believe they are now doing. Food campaigner Vicky Hird \nfrom Friends of the Earth said:\n\n       [UK Prime Minister] Gordon Brown is right to be concerned \n     about the impact of biofuels on food prices and the \n     environment. Evidence is growing that they cause more harm \n     than good. Food production must be revolutionized to prevent \n     a global catastrophe.\n\n  Jane Goodall, the internationally famous primate conservationist, \nwarned about biofuels and the impact on the rain forests in Asia, \nAfrica, and South America:\n\n       We're cutting down forests now to grow sugar cane and palm \n     oil for biofuels.\n\n  She said this in September of last year.\n  The group, Clean Air Task Force, recently reported that nearly 12 \nmillion hectares of peat land in Indonesia has been converted to \naccommodate a palm oil plantation. The land was reportedly drained, \ncleared, and burned for conversion to a plantation.\n  Even Miles O'Brien of CNN, a man of whom I have been harshly \ncritical, and yet a man I consider to be a good friend in spite of our \nhonest differences of opinion, and I are together on this issue. He \nreported on CNN on February 21:\n\n       If every last ear of corn in America were used for ethanol, \n     it would reduce our oil consumption by only 7 percent.\n\n  He is right. O'Brien also reported:\n\n       Corn ethanol is not as clean, efficient, or practical as \n     politicians claim.\n\n  I agree with this. I am glad to find something on which my good pilot \nfriend and I can agree.\n  Lester Brown, who has been dubbed ``the guru of the environmental \nmovement,'' has added his voice in opposition to our current biofuels \npolicies. Brown cowrote, on April 22:\n\n       It is in this spirit that today, Earth Day, we call upon \n     Congress to revisit recently enacted Federal mandates \n     requiring the diversion of foodstuffs for production of \n     biofuels.\n\n  Brown wrote that our current biofuel mandate was ``causing \nenvironmental harm and contributing to a growing global food crisis.''\n  Brown continued:\n\n       Turning one-fourth of our corn into fuel is affecting \n     global food prices. U.S. food prices are rising in twice the \n     rate of inflation, hitting the pocketbook of lower income \n     Americans and people living on fixed incomes.\n       America must stop contributing to food price inflation \n     through mandates that force us to use food to feed our cars \n     instead of to feed people.\n\n  Brown concluded:\n\n       It is impossible to avoid the conclusion that food-to-fuel \n     mandates have failed. Congress took a big chance on biofuels \n     that, unfortunately, has not worked out. Now, in the spirit \n     of progress, let us learn the appropriate lessons from this \n     setback, and let us act quickly to mitigate the damage and \n     set upon a new course that holds greater promise for meeting \n     the challenges ahead.\n\n  I agree. Not very often do we agree, but I do agree with that because \nthere is something we can do about this. When you have Lester Brown, \nMiles O'Brien, Dan Rather, Time magazine, the New York Times, the \nUnited Nations, and Jim Inhofe all in agreement on changing an \nenvironmental policy, you can rest assured the policy is horribly \nmisguided. All of these publications and individuals now realize the \npure folly of the Federal Government's biofuel mandate.\n  You might ask, how did we get here? I would say, when the Republicans \nwere the majority party, I was the chairman of the Senate Environment \nand Public Works Committee. I worked successfully with my colleagues to \ncreate a comprehensive yet measured approach. The result of this work, \nthe Reliable Fuels Act, was ultimately incorporated into the 2005 \nEnergy bill. This original renewable fuels standard--that is, the RFS--\ntook a commonsense approach in that it prescribed just 4 billion \ngallons of renewable fuels in 2006, growing to a feasible 5.5 billion \ngallons in 2012. This low rampup allowed time and flexibility for the \nmany foreseen and unforeseen challenges likely to surface with the \nimplementation of such a program. Under my leadership, the committee \nheld at least 13 hearings on the RFS program, examining issues from the \nfuture of transportation fuels to the most recent and, unfortunately, \nlast oversight hearing in September 2006 which highlighted the \nimplementation of the RFS program.\n\n  However, despite the enormous amount of attention and the eventual \nlegislative enactment of that now greatly expanded RFS program, the EPW \nCommittee has failed to hold even one hearing on RFS this Congress.\n\n[[Page S3472]]\n\nThis morning I challenged the chairman of that committee. I am still \nranking member, but I challenged Chairman Boxer to hold such a hearing. \nDespite the EPW Committee's failure to conduct any oversight, by 2007 \nit had become increasingly clear that to double the RFS mandate into a \nshorter timeframe would prove reckless and premature. Yet many in \nCongress refuse to acknowledge the many warning signs.\n  The 2007 Energy bill mandated 36 million gallons of biofuels by 2022. \nOf this, 15 billion gallons are now required from corn-based ethanol by \njust 2015. Washington was abuzz last year with talk of energy \nindependence, cutting our reliance on foreign sources of energy, \nincreasing supplies of fuels, investing in biofuels, lowering the price \nof energy, especially prices at the pump--all fine goals. Yet this \nCongress's actions didn't meet its rhetoric. I believe a secure energy \nsupply has to be grounded in three principles: stability, diversity, \nand affordability. Our policies have to promote domestic energy \nproduction, including oil, gas, nuclear, corn, as well as renewable \nfuels.\n  I have said this over and over. We need all of the above to meet the \nenergy crisis in America. What the Democrats and the green movement \nfailed to understand is environmental regulations are not free. They \nhave a very real price. We should be producing more fuel at home. It is \ngood for our security, good for jobs, good for consumers.\n  Working with Congressman Frank Lucas, I sponsored and secured Senate \npassage of the first national transitional assistance program to help \nfarmers grow dedicated energy crops for cellulosic biofuels. This \nmeasure is vital to the development of cellulosic biofuels in the \nUnited States because it would encourage U.S. agricultural producers \nwithin a 50-mile radius of a cellulosic biorefinery to produce nonfood \nenergy crops for clean burning fuel.\n  In addition, I am proud of the research taking place in my State of \nOklahoma. It is being done by the Noble Foundation and its partners. By \nfocusing on cellulosic ethanol, we can stimulate a biofuels industry \nthat doesn't compete with other domestic agriculture. Since you can \ngrow it all over the country--and that is not to be said about corn--\nyou avoid the transportation problems of Midwest-focused ethanol. \nCellulosic ethanol can increase both energy and economic security.\n  Washington has a long way to go to get energy policy right. The \nfuture of energy is going to require a wide variety of fuels and \napproaches. We all need to work together to achieve our common goals. \nThe only way they can defeat us is to divide and conquer. We have seen \nexamples of that recently. But we all need to work together. I call on \nall of my colleagues today to set aside our differences and work \ntogether for an abundant, secure, and environmentally sound energy \npolicy.\n  It is worth repeating that when you have Lester Brown, Miles O'Brien, \nDan Rather, Time magazine, New York Times, the United Nations, and Jim \nInhofe all in agreement on changing an environmental policy, you can \nrest assured that the policy is horribly misguided. All of these \npublications and individuals now realize the pure folly of the Federal \nGovernment's current biofuel mandates. Once again, I call on Congress \nto revisit the enactment of this mandate.\n  Secondly, what we have to do--and I still am the ranking member of \nthe Environment and Public Works Committee which has jurisdiction over \nthe EPA--is to call upon EPA to put a stop to the mandate now.

I thank my friend and colleague from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. President, I rise today in support of the bipartisan agreement \nreached by the Senate Finance and Commerce Committees on the \nreauthorization of the Federal Aviation Administration Airport and \nAirway Trust Fund. In my view this agreement represents the true \nmeaning of the word ``compromise'' and shows what is possible when we \nreally roll up our sleeves and go to work. I have been working on this \nbill for 2 years. Reauthorizing the FAA and the Airport and Airway \nTrust Fund is not only a top national priority, but it is a top \npriority for my State of Kansas as well. Kansas and aviation have a \nlong history together. Aircraft pioneers such as Lloyd Stearman, who \nhappened to sell his company to Walter Boeing, Walter Beech, Clyde \nCessna, E.M. Laird, Amelia Earhart, William Lear, and many others, all \nhave close ties to Kansas. It was a team of Kansans that really created \nthe first commercially produced airplane in the United States. It was \ncalled the Laird Swallow. This plane took flight in April of 1920, just \n88 years and a few weeks ago. My, how far we have come.\n\n  Today, about 40,000 employees in Wichita and the surrounding counties \nmake their living building planes, manufacturing parts, and servicing \naviation. The aviation industry directly and indirectly supports over \n140,000 jobs in Kansas--140,000 jobs--and will soon contribute roughly \n$9 billion annually to our State's economy. That is not only \nsignificant, that is amazing.\n  Kansas is home to nearly 3,200 aviation and manufacturing businesses, \nincluding Cessna, Hawker-Beechcraft, Bombardier-Learjet, Boeing, Spirit \nAeroSystems, Garmin, and Honeywell, just to name a few. However, \naviation is not simply an economic engine in Kansas, it is part of our \nhistory, our way of life, and, most importantly, part of our future. It \nis an example of our entrepreneurial spirit.\n  In late October of 2006, at my invitation, newly appointed Department \nof Transportation Secretary Mary Peters traveled to Kansas to see \nfirsthand what the aviation industry means to our State. Congressman \nTodd Tiahrt and I joined the Secretary on a tour of Cessna's \nheadquarters and manufacturing facility in Wichita to show the \nimportance of general aviation--general aviation--to the Kansas \neconomy.\n  Cessna actually traces its roots back to Clyde Cessna who built his \nfirst plane in Rago, KS, in 1911.\n  The Secretary and I then traveled to Olathe, KS, to visit the Kansas \nCity air traffic control center. There we spoke with the controllers \nand the trainees about their work, listened in as they actually \ndirected traffic through the Kansas City airspace, making it possible \nfor people to fly in safety.\n  During our visit, the Secretary heard firsthand from industry leaders \nabout the importance of updating our air traffic control system, and \nthat the current tax mechanisms provide the most appropriate avenue to \nraise the necessary funds to upgrade into what they call NextGen \ntechnology--next generation technology.\n  This key message was delivered to me and the Secretary personally, \nand I have been delivering that same message to my colleagues since \nthis debate began some time ago. It is no secret that I care \npassionately about this issue and how general aviation is treated, and \nto make sure they are treated fairly. With my State's close connection \nto the history of this industry, obviously, you can see why.\n  Kansas manufactures--this may be unbelievable to some--Kansas \nmanufactures roughly 70 percent of the world's general aviation \naircraft--70 percent.\n  Throughout this debate, general aviation has been called to increase \nits contribution to the Airport and Airway Trust Fund to help pay for \nthe modernization of our air traffic control system.\n  All along the way, general aviation has stepped to the plate and \nagreed to help pay for the necessary increases to move our aviation \ninfrastructure into next generation technology.\n  I cannot recall a time when an industry has come to me and said: We \nwant to help. We are willing to support an increase in our taxes to \nactually do so. But that is exactly what the general aviation community \ndid. Their only request has been that they be able to pay through the \ncurrent efficient and effective tax structure of the fuel tax. That was \ntheir only request.\n\n[[Page S3473]]\n\n  The agreement finally reached between the Finance and Commerce \nCommittees respects this request and allows general aviation to be part \nof the modernization solution without creating a new bureaucracy or \nadditional redtape. The agreement would allow AvGas to remain at its \ncurrent rate, but would increase the Jet A fuel tax from 21.8 cents to \n36 cents per gallon on general aviation flights.\n  Now, this raises an additional $250 million dedicated to updating the \nair traffic control technology that will increase safety and decrease \ncongestion--something that is in the headlines every day. At the same \ntime, our commercial airlines and passengers are held harmless from tax \nincreases, given the challenges they face today.\n  I am pleased this agreement recognizes the value of both the \ncommercial aviation and general aviation to our Nation's transportation \nsystem. I realize there have been strong feelings on both sides of this \ndebate.\n  My goals, as we drafted this bill, were very clear: One, ensure that \nour air traffic control system is updated and remains safe for all \npassengers and aircraft; and, two, protect the general aviation \ncommunity and Kansas jobs, which would have been threatened by \nsomething called a user fee.\n  Today, I am pleased to say we have succeeded on both counts. This \nlegislation represents the best of bipartisan compromise in a real \neffort to make our skies safer. I am proud to be part of this \ncompromise, as are the 40,000 workers employed in Kansas in aviation \nmanufacturing.\n  Kansas has a long history of being the world's leader in aviation \nachievements. This agreement guarantees that Kansas and our great \ngeneral aviation industry will remain leaders in the sky. Kansas is--\nalways has been--and remains the air capital of the world under this \nagreement. I thank my colleagues for helping us reach an agreement that \nwill maintain our world standing.\n  Also included in this agreement is a fix to the projected funding \ndeficit in the highway trust fund for 2009. This 1-year patch will keep \nnecessary transportation construction projects on schedule and help our \nState transportation departments meet their financial obligations.\n  I am hopeful the Senate will continue to work in the spirit of \nbipartisanship on the bill so we can quickly move to a conference \ncommittee and eventually have a bill signed into law before the current \nprogram expires.\n  We must do this. American travelers and businesses and pilots deserve \nthe predictability and stability that comes with passing this bill.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I believe Senator Casey wishes to \naddress the Senate. I yield to my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. CASEY.

Who seeks recognition?\n  The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Gasoline Prices\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, today I rise to speak about the price of \ngasoline and the price of diesel fuel, which is affecting every driver \nin America. My principal message is that Washington policies should not \ndrive up the prices at the pump. At an absolute minimum, Federal \npractices should not be making prices any worse.\n  According to the American Automobile Association, the average retail \nprice for regular unleaded gasoline is $3.60 a gallon. The average \nprice of diesel fuel is $4.24 a gallon. This is before this summer's \ndriving season has even started.\n  Consumers all across America are hurt by the inflationary pressures \nat the pump. My constituents in Wyoming know firsthand the huge impact \nthat $110 or $120 per barrel of oil has on their wallets. I visit with \nthem every weekend. The price at the pump in Casper, WY, just 3 weeks \nago was $2.91. This past weekend, it was $3.31. Wyoming ranks at the \ntop of all States in terms of vehicle miles traveled on a per capita \nbasis. Because of my State's sparse population and great distances, \nthat means it is not uncommon to commute 20, 50, or even 100 miles \nround trip to work, to school, or just to buy groceries.\n  Today's current oil prices are primarily due to supply and demand \nfundamentals. At close examination, there\n\n[[Page S3476]]\n\nare really several different underlying contributors to today's high \nprices: rising world demand, especially in India and China; \ngeopolitical tensions in the Middle East, in Venezuela, in Nigeria; \nlimited options for acquiring additional supply; the weakness of the \nU.S. dollar; environmental regulations; and perhaps even excessive \nmarket speculation and manipulation. Recognizing this, Federal \nGovernment practices should not--should not--drive prices even higher. \nThat is why I am announcing legislation today, S. 2927, that provides \nfor a temporary suspension of Federal oil purchases for the Strategic \nPetroleum Reserve.\n  This Strategic Petroleum Reserve was initially created in the mid-\n1970s. It was set up to protect the Nation from oil supply disruptions \nthat followed the Arab oil embargo. I support the goal of protecting \nAmerica's energy security. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve has served \nour Nation well. This legislation, though, says enough is enough. At \ntoday's high prices, this legislation tells the Government to stop \nputting any more oil into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve--to stop \ndoing it whenever the average price of gasoline is over $2.50 a gallon. \nThis chart clearly shows when we went above the red line, above $2.50, \nand when it has come below and when it is above. This has been in the \nlast 3 years. This legislation also tells the Government to stop \nputting oil into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve when the price of \ndiesel fuel exceeds $2.75 a gallon.\n  Currently, the United States is buying about 70,000 barrels, 70,000 \nbarrels of oil each and every day to save and inject underground. The \nGovernment keeps buying it every day, regardless of price. When the \nprices of fuel go up, people try to use less. They carpool, they use \npublic transportation. Not the U.S. Government--70,000 barrels every \nday regardless of need, regardless of price. The Strategic Petroleum \nReserve already contains 700 million barrels of oil.\n  The Administrator of the Energy Information Administration recently \ntestified to the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. He said \ntaking this much oil out of the market every day does drive up the \nprice for American drivers. He wasn't sure of the amount. He estimated \nit could be $2 per barrel of oil, maybe a nickel per gallon. A private \nanalyst has argued that continuing to fill the Strategic Petroleum \nReserve could add as much as 10 percent to the price of gasoline--10 \npercent. While there appears to be a disagreement on the magnitude, it \nis clear that when the Government is competing with the American \ndriver, it does have an impact. Every day, the Government is pulling \n70,000 barrels of crude oil from the market. This is oil which could \notherwise be used by airlines, by trucks, or by our neighbors.\n  My bill would also impose fiscal responsibility on future oil \npurchases. When the Federal Government buys oil at today's prices, it \nis an expensive proposition for all taxpayers. At current prices, it \nwill cost over $8 million a day for the Government to purchase these \n70,000 barrels of oil. Well, that equates to about $250 million a \nmonth, nearly $3 billion a year. The impact to the Treasury and to the \nAmerican driver is real. Currently, the goal is to fill the Strategic \nPetroleum Reserve with up to 1.5 billion--billion--barrels of oil. At \nthe current rate of putting in 70,000 barrels a day, it will take \nanother 30 years to achieve this level--70,000 barrels a day for 30 \nyears.\n  I recognize that a temporary suspension by itself is not going to \nbring down the price of gasoline to $2.50 or even $3 a gallon \novernight. But I made a commitment to the people of Wyoming. I made a \ncommitment to do what I can to help when it comes to Washington \npolicies that just don't seem to make sense. As a physician, I took an \noath to do no harm. As a Senator, I am committed to a philosophy of \nGovernment accountability and fiscal responsibility.\n\n  In addition to temporarily stopping the stockpiling of oil at these \nhigh prices, there is a second component to this bill: commonsense \nsteps for fiscal responsibility. This legislation includes simple \nrecommendations put forth by the Government Accountability Office.\n  This bill would require dollar cost averaging when it comes to \npurchasing oil in the future. We could save taxpayers money if we just \npurchased the same dollar amount of oil each month rather than the same \nvolume of oil each month. This means you end up buying more oil when \nthe prices are low and less oil when the prices are high. The practice \nworks for individual investors. It is what millions of Americans do \nevery month with their retirement plans.\n  There is an article in this week's Fortune magazine. It is entitled \n``Where to Put Your Money Now.'' The article says: With the markets \ngiving off so many mixed signals, use dollar cost averaging. The \nFederal Government should operate with that same prudence. If the \nDepartment of Energy had used this approach in recent years, it could \nhave saved American taxpayers over $590 million.\n  The Federal Government could also save taxpayer dollars by storing \nheavier grades of crude oil. The Government Accountability Office has \npointed out that such a strategy would be more cost-effective and \nprovide more refiners with the kind of oil the refiners can actually \nuse.\n  These are two fundamental steps to improve Government accountability \nand fiscal responsibility. Many of us complain about Government waste. \nIn this legislation, we have a chance to do something about it.\n  I fully recognize that our energy problems are complex. This body \nrecently adopted new corporate average fuel economy requirements to \nimprove long-term efficiency in our cars and in our trucks. Increased \nenergy efficiency and conservation must be an important part of any \nlong-term energy solution. Other policies worthy of debate include \nexpanded domestic production of energy, and we have also held hearings \non excessive speculation and market manipulation. More recently, some \nhave called for a holiday on the Federal gasoline tax. All of these \nefforts are worthy of debate. A temporary halt on adding more oil to \nthe Strategic Petroleum Reserve is really the low-hanging fruit. If we \ncan't agree on these simple steps for fiscal responsibility, how will \nwe come to an agreement on the more complex solutions to energy \nsecurity?\n  I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this \nlegislation without delay. With gasoline prices at an alltime high, the \nAmerican driver--the American driver--should not have to compete with \nWashington policies that are driving up the price at the pump.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I wish to take some time today to address a \ncertain portion of H.R. 2881. Before I begin those remarks, I also wish \nto mention that there are a number of communities in Virginia that \nexperienced some pretty devastating weather effects yesterday as a \nresult of high winds and tornadoes. I want the people in those \ncommunities to know we have been in continuous contact from my office \nwith the Governor's office and we have people from our office down in \nthese communities, and we are committed to ensuring that appropriate \ngovernmental assistance be made available and remain available until \nthe effects of this unfortunate weather occurrence are remedied.\n  I wish to thank the chairman for bringing this bill to the floor, and \nin general, I support the bill. Our Nation's air traffic control \nsystems are in serious need of modernization. We all know that. This \nbill in most ways is the right step in addressing those challenges. But \nI would like to take a few minutes today to talk about an issue that is \nvitally important to a lot of communities in and around Reagan National \nAirport in northern Virginia.\n  I am deeply troubled by a provision in this bill that would add 20 \nadditional slots at Reagan National, including several potential \namendments that could further harm that airport as well as Dulles \nInternational Airport and their neighboring communities.\n  We should recall that in 1987, Congress created the Metropolitan \nWashington Airports Authority in order to run Reagan National and \nWashington Dulles International Airports. The creation of the Airports \nAuthority established a professional organization to operate the \nairports efficiently and represented a commitment to the surrounding \ncommunities regarding aircraft noise and traffic. I think that\n\n[[Page S3477]]\n\nbears repeating. Congress made a commitment to the residents of \nAlexandria, Arlington, and Fairfax County on the operation of Reagan \nNational Airport when it transferred authority on these issues over to \nthe Airports Authority. Those commitments were codified by Congress in \nthe so-called perimeter and slot rules. Changes to these rules threaten \nto seriously degrade service to the airports, and they break the \npromises that were made to these surrounding communities.\n  In an ideal world, it sounds appealing to have more flights to Reagan \nNational Airport, but the fact is that there are basic physical \nconstraints to that airport that simply cannot be ignored. If anyone \nhas ever tried to fly out of Reagan National during peak hours, they \nknow that parking can be extraordinarily difficult, that ticket \ncounters can be incredibly congested, and that the number of gates that \npark the jets is limited. I am told that an increase of just four \nairplane slots, for example, could result in an additional 400 to 500 \npassengers going through this airport an hour.\n\n  Nearly 10 years ago, the Airports Authority rebuilt much of Reagan \nNational, transforming it into one of the most efficient airports in \nthe Nation, as the facilities constructed were matched to the number of \nflights established by law. Any increase in the number of flights will \noverburden critical airport facilities and infrastructure, causing \nserious disruptions. New flights, obviously, would create greater \ndemand for parking at a time when parking is difficult, affect gate \naccess, and all these other areas I mentioned before.\n  When the Airports Authority upgraded their facilities in the 1990s, \nit did so with these slot and perimeter restrictions in mind. These \nwere carefully crafted rules that work in harmony to manage this \nairport's capacity. Adding more flights would quickly exceed the \nphysical capacity of the airport.\n  Importantly, the slot rules created an airport in balance with its \nsurrounding neighborhoods. Because Reagan National is convenient to \nmany air passengers, it is appreciated and well used. But this \nconvenience comes at a heavy price for many of the airport neighbors in \nthe form of aircraft noise and related traffic situations on the roads \nin these areas. Adding flights beyond what was agreed to in this \nlegislation breaks the bond that was created with the neighbors of the \nairports. It unfairly burdens them for the sake of the convenience of \nothers.\n  I note that the city of Alexandria, Arlington County, the McLean \nCitizens Association, the Mount Vernon Citizens Association, the \nWashington Council of Governments, and Virginia Governor Tim Kaine all \noppose these changes.\n  I am particularly concerned that there is a tipping point with these \nmatters. We have to be concerned about quality of life in these \ncommunities as we measure them against the convenience of using the \nairport.\n  It strikes me that the desire to change the slot and perimeter rules \nat Reagan National is not being driven by market demand but rather by a \nfew airlines seeking a competitive advantage over others. By allowing \nexisting rules to be altered further for a select class of airlines, \nCongress would be allocating this scarce resource for the convenience \nof a few and, again, in contradiction to the larger community need.\n  The bottom line question is, How many more additional aircraft and \nhow much more noise should local citizenry have to endure before we \nhave crossed this important threshold?\n  Congress added 24 new slots in 2000 and another 22 slots in 2003. If \nwe continue to allow more flights this year, how many more are we going \nto have to continue to allow the next time this bill comes up?\n  The communities of Northern Virginia should not have to continually \nsuffer for the convenience of a relative few.\n  I close by saying that the Congress made a commitment to these \nVirginia communities when it ceded control to the Airports Authority. \nIt should honor those commitments. Let's allow the Airports Authority \nto run Washington's airports. I urge my colleagues to reject any \nchanges to the slot and perimeter rules at Reagan National.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following my \nremarks, Senator Schumer from New York be allowed to speak for 10 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, before us is H.R. 2081, which is the \nreauthorization of the Federal Aviation Administration and, of course, \nthat is the authority tied directly to America's airlines and the body \nof public policy under which they operate. It comes at a time when all \nof us are frustrated by what was once a great American industry, and \nthat, of course, is the airline industry. We set the records, we \nestablished the world standards in all respects to aviation, and now \nour industry is in great trouble. It is in great trouble for a lot of \nreasons, but one of the underlying reasons today is the substantial \ncost in aviation fuel that all of these large carriers must acquire on \na daily basis and the inability to simply pass it through to the \nconsumer.\n  Of course, that is exactly what is going on in nearly every industry \nin America today. We are experiencing an energy shock to our \npocketbook--whether it be my private pocketbook or an Idahoan's private \npocketbook or a corporate private pocketbook--in a way that leaves us \nwith no ability to assume it, to consume it in a way that does not \ndamage our choices on staying alive as a major air carrier or our \nchoice as a consumer where we put our money--with what few \ndiscretionary dollars we have left.\n  In that context, it is so easy to blame somebody else for a problem \nthat largely this Congress has observed, talked about, and denied \naction on for nearly 20 years. Those of us on energy committees in the \nCongress who said the answer to a looming problem was going to be \nconservation, new technology, increased development, and production of \nexisting energy sources over the last two decades--and we have largely \ndenied ourselves those options--are now today wringing our hands in \nfrustration about the phenomenal cost of energy to the American \nconsumer.\n  So what do we do? We reach out to blame someone when we cannot find \nit easy to blame ourselves. So to whom do we turn? We say it has to be \nExxonMobile's fault; look at all of their profits. Or it has to be \nChevron's fault or it has to be Marathon's fault or, if you read in the \npaper today, British Petroleum has record profits, a 12-percent \nincrease in return on investment. Gosh, we have to blame those big oil \ncompanies because surely they are in control of the market, surely they \ndemand the price, and it seems it has to be their fault.\n  I have brought before us today a chart that might change our minds \njust a little bit. When we talk about ExxonMobile as it relates to \ntheir position in the world, well, my goodness, they don't control the \noil supply of the world. They have a very small piece of it. Chevron, \noh, my goodness, they don't control the oil supply of the world. They \nhave a very small piece of it.\n  Who owns the oil of the world today from which we buy? Not U.S. \ncompanies but world countries--Saudi Arabia, Saudi Armco, the largest \nproducer by a magnitude of three or four times. Then walk right on down \nto 11, 12 of the leading major producers are not companies, they are \ncountries, and it does not happen to be the United States of America \nthat is in that top 12 group. We should be, but we are not because we \nhave denied ourselves the ability to develop our oil reserves in \nAlaska, offshore United States, offshore west coast, offshore east \ncoast, oh, all in the name of the environment even though it is our \ntechnology today that is the world-class, environmentally proven and \nsound technology for deep sea oil development. So then we blame \ncorporate America for our own fault. Now our consumers are angry. And \nlisten to the speeches given\n\n[[Page S3478]]\n\non the floor of this body accusing or blaming someone else for the \nproblem we, in large part, created.\n  What are we experiencing today? I believe we are experiencing \nsomething that is simply called petronationalism. The Saudis have it \nfigured out. They got the oil, we got the bucks; they sell us their \noil, they get our bucks. That is pretty simple, isn't it? Sixty-four \npercent of the energy consumed out of the pump at the local gas \nstations on the corners of America today comes from somewhere else in \nthe world, not the United States. We are spending over $1 billion a day \nsomewhere else in the world to buy their oil. And if Americans want to \nbe mad, they ought to be mad at their politician or politicians who, \nfor the last 20 years, have denied the reality of the marketplace, all \nin the name of being supergreen or all in the name of just not liking \nbig corporations, and so we couldn't let the Exxons, the Chevrons, or \nthe Marathons do something about it.\n  Several years ago, I met with the president of American Oil before it \nmerged. He was opining that they were never going to develop in the \nUnited States anymore because they could not afford to because of the \nregulations and the cost to produce a barrel of oil in the United \nStates when they could go to the Caspian area of Central Europe or when \nthey could go to Saudi Arabia or anywhere else in the Middle East. So \ntoday we suffer the reality of our own politics, and we ought to be \nable to do something about it.\n  Some of you who might have been listening a few moments ago heard the \nSenator from Wyoming making good common sense that we ought to quit \nbuying oil out of this current market and putting it in our Strategic \nPetroleum Reserve. We have enough there for the time being in case \nsomething happened in the Middle East that created a crisis. It would \nnot last very long because we would suck it out of the ground and put \nit in our pumps to avoid an oil shock. But the reality is quite simple. \nWhen you have a world with a growing demand for the consumption of oil \nand its products and you are not producing more, the price is going to \ngo up.\n\n  Ten years ago the Chinese were not in the market. Ten years ago the \nIndians were not in the market. They are in the market today and they \nare increasing their demand out of the world's supply at a rate of 8 or \n9 percent per year.\n  Is the world's supply increasing? No, it is not. Is the world's \nrefining capacity increasing? Very little. So Americans are competing \nagainst the Chinese and the Indians and everybody else for their gallon \nof gas. That is the reality of the market today.\n  Oil is not a national commodity. It is a world commodity. As the \ndependency went up 60 percent over the last three decades, the overall \nconsumer demand went up. Do ExxonMobil and Chevron and every other \nAmerican company control it? No, they do not. Foreign nations control \nit and they are getting wealthy off of American's great ability to \ncreate wealth. If we do not get this under control as quickly as \npossible, we will simply spend ourselves broke and the rest of the \nworld will have all of our money and then--guess what. They are now \ncoming to the great banks of our country and saying: We see you have a \nfinancial problem. We would like to buy an interest in your bank and \ngive you a big chunk of cash that we got by selling you oil.\n  They no longer own their oil because they sold it to us and we burned \nit. But they have our money and they are now coming back and buying our \nfinancial institutions. Isn't that an interesting cycle? The wealth we \nonce sent overseas to Saudi Aramco and to all of these other national \ncompanies is now coming back to the United States in the form of them \nowning our financial institutions. Does that make good sense?\n  Right now we are going to look for any amount of cash we can get to \nbolster our financial institutions that are in trouble--possibly \nbecause of the housing industry or some other kind of large investment. \nSo you might say that is a pretty good deal. I suggest the bad deal \nstarted 20 years ago when we began to progressively deny our country \nand its companies the right to produce and supply the marketplace. That \nis what we have done. Today we are paying the price.\n  I am going to be spending a good deal of time over the next several \nmonths talking about every segment of the energy portfolio of our \ncountry, not only gas and oil but electricity in all other forms and \nconservations and photovoltaics, wind, and cellulosic. All of that is \ngoing to be terribly important for the American consumer in the years \nahead.\n  The bad news is what we have to say to the American consumer today is \nnone of it is going to be ready for 4 or 5 or 6 or 8 or 10 years. In \nthe meantime, your energy bill is going to become an ever larger part \nof your overall cost of living and your family budget. There is not \nmuch a politician can do about it because they have already damaged the \nmarketplace in which you have to live.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. By unanimous consent, the Senator from New \nYork is recognized.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Before I get into the substance of my remarks on \nMedicaid regulation, I compliment my colleague on his speech. I do not \nagree with all of it; I agree with some. I note one of the reasons he \npointed out on his chart is it was foreign countries that owned most of \nour oil supply. That is true. I would note and commend to him to look \nat the Saudis, who have the largest number of oil fields and are the \nlargest producer. Actually at a time of increasing demand, as my \ncolleague from Idaho well knows, Saudi Arabia has cut back on \nproduction. It was higher in 2005 than it was in 2006, and it was \nhigher in 2006 than it was in 2007. I will be coming to the floor, \neither later today or, more likely, tomorrow, to talk about that.\n  The Saudis are, No. 1, the short-term answer. We can talk about \nincreasing production here, whether it is alternative energy or fossil \nfuels. We can talk about increasing conservation. They are vital, \nnecessary, and cannot be avoided. They are long-term answers. But the \nquickest short-term answer to the problem would be for the Saudis to \nincrease production.\n  They have cut back. They talk a good game. We see pictures of \nPresident Bush arm in arm with the Saudi leader, the Saudi King, yet we \nget nothing in return. Yet we are considering selling them some of the \nmost advanced weapons we have. So stay tuned tomorrow, where some of us \nare going to be talking about that and augmenting in a certain way what \nthe Senator from Idaho was talking about.\n\n\n                   Moratorium on Medicaid Regulations\n\n  Mr. President, today I rise to speak about the moratorium on Medicaid \nregulations. Last week the House passed a bipartisan bill with \noverwhelming support to block the ill-advised Medicaid cuts the Bush \nadministration has proposed. The House bill introduced by Chairman John \nDingell passed by a vote of 349 to 62. By definition, that had to have \na majority of both parties--128 Republicans and every Democrat voted \nfor this bill. It was an incredible victory--at least a first step \ntoward a victory for American patients who are served by hospitals, for \nhardworking physicians and other health providers as well as case \nmanagers and social workers who do so much to help those in need. It \nwould extend all the way to those who work in hospitals at 2 a.m., \nsweeping the floors, mopping, to make sure the hospital is spick and \nspan for the next morning.\n  Later today Majority Leader Harry Reid will ask for unanimous consent \nthat H.R. 5613, protecting the Medicaid Safety Net Act--the same bill \nas passed the House--be approved. I hope my colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle will go along with this vitally needed piece of \nlegislation. The bill is now on the Senate calendar, thanks to the \nmajority leader and Chairman Baucus. Many of us on this side and I \nbelieve many on the other side hope we will have a chance to take it up \nthis afternoon. These proposed Medicaid rules the administration \nproposed could not come at a worse time. State budgets are already \nworsening due to the weakening of the economy, and few States can \nabsorb these massive and unvetted cuts. The administration did not look \nhere or look there at specific places where they might save. Oh, no, it \nwas a meat-ax, an almost across-the-board cut at a time when our \nhospitals, our economy, and most of all our people who are sick cannot \ntake it.\n  If the Congress does not act, the States will face terrible choices--\nto cut\n\n[[Page S3479]]\n\ntheir Medicaid Programs or cut other programs to free up more funds for \nMedicaid. In a sense it will undo much of the stimulus package, putting \nmoney in the hands of people so they can spend it and then requiring \nthe States to cut back.\n  We need a moratorium so the next administration can make things \nright. We need a moratorium so this administration will not be able to \nsucceed in its meat-ax approach to health care and to Medicaid in \nparticular.\n  Let me tell you a little more about the eight Medicaid regulations \nthis administration has proposed. I am sure many of my colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle have heard from their hospitals, their \nGovernors, and constituents, that these rules are a disaster for our \nhealth care system.\n  The expiration of moratoria on two regulations, GME--that stands for \ngraduate medical education--and the IGT, intergovernmental transfers, \nis fast approaching. It reaches us on May 25, 2008. That is a little \nless than a month away.\n  We have two additional moratoria that are expiring on June 30: the \n``rehabilitation'' and ``school-based health'' rules. Then, if that is \nnot enough, there are at least four other rules that have no moratoria, \nand they go into effect shortly, piling on the people and an industry \nthat at this point is in bad enough shape.\n  What would happen if we didn't pass H.R. 5613 is that our States, our \nhospitals, our public providers who do so much important work for \nAmerican patients would be devastated. Right now they are in a terrible \nstate of panic--and that is not an exaggeration--over these proposed \nchanges that will cost billions more dollars.\n  Like so many of my colleagues, I believe the integrity of the \nMedicaid Program is extremely important, but I think a large majority \nof the Senate agrees these rules go way too far and will end up hurting \npatients and the very system that serves them. With close to 50 million \nAmericans uninsured in my own State of New York, the estimate is there \nare over 2 million adults and kids who do not have health insurance. We \nare penny wise and pound foolish to allow reductions in the critical \nsafety net funding that currently exists.\n  The Medicaid GME, or graduate medical education rule, is one I am \nparticularly worried about. This proposal represents a major shift in \nadministration policy. By proposing not just to cut but to eliminate \nMedicaid GME, the Government is essentially forcing the Medicaid \nProgram to shirk its responsibility to cover its share of training \nphysicians. The GME regulation would pull the Federal rug out from \nunderneath the Medicaid support for training physicians at a time when \nacross the country, in rural and urban areas alike, we are experiencing \na shortage of physicians in every specialty and in primary care.\n  For example, a community in New York State's southern tier, the area \nthat borders Pennsylvania, experienced a 20-percent decline in general \nsurgeons from 2002 to 2006. In 6 rural counties in the Mohawk Valley, \nthere was a 33-percent loss in general surgeons over that same time \nperiod.\n  The impact of the GME proposal is estimated to be a $3 billion loss \nover 5 years to New York State teaching hospitals alone. The public \nhospitals in New York State have told me how devastating the cuts would \nbe if these rules are implemented.\n  For instance, Coney Island Hospital, a hospital that tends to the \npoor, tells me they would no longer be able to offer smoking cessation \nprograms for pregnant mothers. What a terrible shame. What a \nwrongheaded approach. These hospitals are using these funds in a cost-\neffective way that will improve health, but this administration is \nsaying no to them and no to patients.\n  We talked about the sacredness of life, and we know a baby in vitro \nshould be given, if not a head start, at least an equal chance. But if \nthat baby's mother is smoking, the health of that child is impaired.\n  ``Smoking cessation programs work. Let's cut them out.''\n  No rationale, no discussion saying they do not work, just cut them. \nThat is wrong. Prevention is important. Yet these rules make prevention \nefforts, such as smoking cessation programs, impossible.\n  They also hurt medical and dental residents. I recently heard from a \ndentist trainee, a dentist who was training in a New York public \nhospital, who said the wait for an appointment is already way too long. \nWith these unwise regulations, that wait increases tenfold, and what \nwas originally a minor dental treatment could end up a huge problem and \nend up costing the Federal Government and the State government more.\n  This dental trainee said these rules will increase emergency visits \nfor situations that could have been prevented. It will increase \nunnecessary antibiotic prescriptions and reduce our ability to reach \nout and educate the community about dental care.\n  One of the hallmarks, and why the European systems are more cost \nefficient, is they focus more on education and prevention. We are \ncutting it out here. Instead of moving it forward and becoming more \ncost efficient by focusing on prevention, we are saying, Prevent it? \nWhy would we want to do that?\n  We should be expanding prevention and expanding dental care in the \nearly phase, not rolling it back.\n  With health care costs rising and health care reform the No. 1 issue \non our constituents' minds, how can we allow these rules to go forward \nand make things so much worse? We need to vote on this legislation. We \nneed to take this important step for health care.\n  I urge my colleague, the minority leader, to let this bill move \nforward. I urge all of my colleagues to do what the House did, a broad, \nbipartisan vote in favor.\n  We need to take this important step for health care. The list of \nsupporters of the bill H.R. 5613 is a virtual who's who of health care: \nthe American Medical Association, the American Hospital Association, \nthe National Governors Association, the National Association of Mental \nIllness, the American Federation of Teachers, the National PTA, and the \nlist goes on and on. More than 2,000 national and local groups have \ncalled for passage.\n  I urge all Members of the Senate to join the list of supporters when \nSenator Reid asks for unanimous consent later this afternoon to allow \nus to move to H.R. 5613. I hope that will be met by unanimous accord on \nthe other side. Our health care system demands no less.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Energy Incentives\n\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, there has been a fair amount of discussion \nhere on the floor today about what to do with respect to rising costs \nof gasoline and a discussion about what we should do in response to \nthis runup of prices. I heard the Presiding Officer speak earlier \ntoday--I thought with passion and with wisdom--on an appropriate course \nof action. I wish to mention a few things that I think we ought to do.\n  No. 1, we should be investing tax dollars in basic research and \ndevelopment to make a reality the lithium ion battery that is going to \nprovide power for a flex-fuel plug-in hybrid vehicle called the \nChevrolet Volt over the next 24 months or so, a vehicle that will run \nfor 40 miles on a charge of its battery and use auxiliary power on \nboard the vehicle to raise fuel efficiency well beyond that, maybe as \nhigh as 70, 80 miles per gallon. That is what we ought to be doing, and \nwe are.\n  Another thing we ought to be doing is using the Government's \npurchasing power to help commercialize the new technologies. Whether it \nis flex-fuel plug-in hybrids, whether it is very low emission diesels, \nwhether it is fuel cell-powered vehicles, we should be using the \nGovernment's purchasing power to bring them to the marketplace. And we \nare doing that too. This year, there is a requirement that 70 percent \nof the cars, trucks, and vans the Federal Government purchases, both on \nthe civilian side and on the military side, have to be advanced-\ntechnology vehicles.\n\n[[Page S3480]]\n\nThat includes vehicles purchased by the Postal Service.\n  We also ought to be providing tax credits to encourage consumers to \nbuy highly energy efficient hybrid vehicles, highly efficient, low-\nemission, diesel-powered vehicles when those are produced and when they \ncome to the marketplace. And we are doing that. That is part of our \nlaw. We provide a tax credit for folks who buy highly energy efficient \nhybrids and very low emission diesels, a tax credit that is worth up to \nclose to $3,500 per vehicle. When the Chevrolet Volt or other flex-fuel \nvehicles, plug-in hybrids come on the marketplace in the next couple of \nyears, we should provide an even greater tax credit to encourage \nAmerican consumers to purchase those.\n  Several years ago, we voted here in this Chamber to create a \ncommission. We create a lot of commissions around here. But this was an \ninfrastructure commission, a transportation infrastructure commission. \nIt was part of our major 5-year, 6-year bill that we pass every so \noften on transportation projects, a lot of it roads, highways, and so \nforth, but transit is included in there too.\n  When we passed the last bill, several years ago we said we want to \ncreate this commission, and we want the commission to go out and look \nat our infrastructure needs, transportation infrastructure needs across \nthe country, quantify those for us and tell us what you think it is \ngoing to cost to bring our roads, highways, bridges, and transit \nsystems to a state of good repair, and tell us how you think we ought \nto pay for those improvements. That commission was formed, worked hard \nfor a year or so, and then came back to report back to us earlier this \nyear as to how bad the situation is and what it is going to cost to fix \nit. They came back and said: We need to spend, to bring us out of the \n20th century and into the 21st century, something like $225 billion a \nyear--$225 billion a year; I think that is what they suggested--over 50 \nyears, over the next 50 years. They called for actually increasing the \ngasoline tax by I think a nickel a year for 5 years, 6 years, something \nlike that.\n\n  We have seen suggested to us a number of ideas for providing for a \nholiday for the gasoline tax, to suspend collecting the gasoline tax in \nthis country, maybe for the summer. Now we are hearing from people: \nLet's extend it not for 3 months over the summer but for 3 months \nbeyond that--which, ironically, would take us through the election, \njust past the election.\n  Let's think about that. In a day and age when we know our roads, \nhighways, bridges, and our transit systems are falling further and \nfurther out of a state of good repair, making our transportation system \nand our economy even less efficient, we know we are not raising enough \nmoney to begin to catch up with the backlog, much less to address the \nnew needs. The notion of diminishing the revenues that are available to \ntry to improve our transportation system suggests to me that we are \nfocused more maybe on the election than we are on the needs of our \ncountry.\n  A friend of mine used to say: Leadership is staying out of step when \neverybody else is marching to the wrong tune. Leadership is staying out \nof step when everyone else is marching to the wrong tune.\n  I used to say, when I was Governor of Delaware: Things worth having, \nwhether it is health care, whether it is education, whether it is \ntransportation--roads, highways, bridges--if they are worth having, we \nought to pay for them. If we are not willing to pay for them, we should \nnot have as many of them.\n  I mentioned a few minutes ago how we are providing tax credits to \nencourage consumers in this country to buy more energy-efficient \nvehicles. Wonder of wonders, the big three are beginning to produce \nthem. After years of building these behemoths and the gas guzzlers, \nFord and Chrysler are actually displaying and engineering and selling \nvehicles that Americans ought to be buying. The quality is vastly \nimproved over what it was 10 or 20 years ago. I will mention a couple \nof them.\n  GM sells hybrid vehicles, not just the big SUVs like the Tahoe and \nthe Yukon but also midsized sedans like the Saturn Aura and the \nChevrolet Malibu, both of which were actually ``Cars of the Year'' this \nyear and last year. Ford has a number of hybrid products on the road as \nwell, not just the Escape but another as well. Chrysler joins the \nparade this summer by launching the hybrid Dodge Durango and the hybrid \nChrysler Aspen. I understand from a friend of mine who is driving the \nChrysler Aspen that in the city it is getting about 22 miles a gallon \nand on the highway it is expected to get close to 30 miles a gallon. Is \nthat where we want to be and need to be? No, but that is a huge \ndifference over the vehicles it replaces. Chrysler is launching, this \nfall, in the 2009 model year, very low emission, highly energy \nefficient diesel-powered vehicles.\n  We are, through our Tax Code, encouraging Americans not just to buy \nToyota Priuses and Hondas but to buy hybrids, low-emission diesels that \nare manufactured by Ford, Chrysler, and GM. They are making them and we \nought to buy them, and in doing that we begin to reduce the demand for \noil that threatens to engulf us.\n  I ride the train back and forth most days. I live in Delaware, and I \ngo back and forth. As my colleague, the Presiding Officer, knows, I go \nback and forth almost every night to Delaware. A strange thing is going \non with respect to passenger rail ridership in this country.\n  I used to serve on the Amtrak board when I was Governor of Delaware, \nand every year we would see ridership go up by a couple of percentage \npoints. We would struggle, try to raise money out of the fare box to \npay for the system and the expansion of the system. Well, the first \nquarter of this fiscal year, ridership at Amtrak is up 15 percent. \nRevenues are up by 15 percent. People are starting to realize that \nmaybe it makes sense to get out of our cars, trucks, and vans and take \nthe train or take transit. Transit ridership is up again this fiscal \nyear more dramatically than it has been in some time.\n  Americans are beginning to literally buy homes in places that are \ncloser to opportunities for transit--for rail, for bus, for subways, \nfor the metro systems. As we have seen the drop in home prices across \nthe country--in some cases, very dramatic--among the surprises, at \nleast for me, is to see housing prices stable and in some cases \nactually going up in places where people can buy a home and live and \nget to work or wherever they need to go to shop without driving to get \nthere.\n  I don't know how gullible we think the American voters are to suggest \nto them that we are going to have this holiday on gas taxes, Federal \ngas taxes, for 3 months or for 6 months, maybe to get us through the \nnext election, and then when the elections are over we will go ahead \nand reinstate the gasoline tax to what it has been even though in doing \nthat we might be depleting further the money available for \ntransportation improvements. I don't know how foolish we think the \nAmerican voters are. They are a lot smarter than that. They are a lot \nsmarter, maybe, than we give them credit for being.\n  I think in this country people are crying out for leadership. They \nare calling out for Presidential leadership, whether it is from our \nside of the aisle or the Republican side. People want leaders who are \nwilling to stay out of step when everybody else is marching to the \nwrong tune, and I would suggest that the wrong tune is to suspend the \nFederal gasoline tax and at the same time not replace the dollars that \nwould otherwise go into the transportation trust fund to fix our \ndilapidated, our decaying transportation system. Voters in this country \ndeserve better leadership from us. I am determined, I am committed to \nmaking sure we provide and pay for that.\n  Before I close, there are a lot of good ideas for things we ought to \ndo. I mentioned, tongue in cheek, that we ought to provide more R \ninvestment for a new generation of lithium batteries for plug-in hybrid \nvehicles. I say, tongue in cheek, we ought to use the Government \npurchasing power to commercialize advanced technology vehicles. We are \ndoing that. I said with tongue in cheek we ought to provide tax credits \nto encourage people to buy highly efficient hybrid vehicles and very \nlow diesel-powered vehicles that are efficient. We are doing that.\n  There other things we need to do too. We need to invest in rail \nservice. We can send from Washington, DC, to Boston, MA, a ton of \nfreight by rail on 1\n\n[[Page S3481]]\n\ngallon of diesel fuel. I will say that again. We could send from \nWashington, DC, to Boston, MA, a ton of freight by rail on 1 gallon of \ndiesel fuel. But we as a government choose not to invest in freight \nrail and, frankly, to invest very modestly in passenger rail. It is a \nhighly energy-efficient way to move people and goods.\n  One of my colleagues spoke a little bit ago and talked about why, as \nhas Senator Dorgan, at a time when gasoline prices and fuel prices are \nso high, when the cost of a barrel of oil is 120 bucks a barrel, we are \nbuying oil and putting it in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve when we \nare almost up to 100 percent capacity. That is a good question. It is \nfoolish for us to continue to buy as much oil as we are right now to \nfurther drive up prices. We should stop filling the Strategic Petroleum \nReserve as long as prices are at this level. One of my colleagues \nraised the question of speculators. If you go back a year ago, almost a \nyear ago from today, the cost of a barrel of oil was something akin to \n$60, $63 a barrel. The price today is about $53 more than that. We have \nseen an increase of probably 75 percent in the price of a barrel of oil \nfrom last year to this. As somebody who studied some economics when I \nwas in school, I believe in the law of supply and demand. But the law \nof supply and demand is not driving up the price of a barrel of oil \nfrom roughly $65 a barrel a year ago to almost twice that today. \nSpeculation is going on that I don't fully understand. Maybe others do, \nbut I don't. But I know something beyond the law of supply and demand \nis driving these prices of oil through the roof.\n  The investigative committees in this Congress, along with the \nGovernment Accountability Office and the administration, need to be all \nover that. Find out what is causing it and how we can stop it. It is \ndifficult for the Congress. We write a lot of laws. I don't know how we \ncan repeal the law of supply and demand, but more than the law of \nsupply and demand is in effect in driving up oil prices.\n  Some have said: Why don't we have a holiday for the gas tax for this \nsummer or for 3 months or 6 months and replace that with some kind of \nwindfall profit tax on the oil and gas industry. I would suggest, if we \nare going to take away some tax advantages enjoyed by the oil and gas \nindustry, the smarter thing is for us to use the revenues that would be \ngenerated in that way to extend the soon-to-be-expiring tax credits for \nthe production of electricity from wind, solar, geothermal. Those tax \ncredits expire at the end of the year. Businesses, individuals who are \nthinking of putting in place systems, small and large, to provide for \nalternative energy need some certainty. They need to know what the Tax \nCode is going to be. The sooner the better. To be fiscally responsible, \nwe can't extend the tax credits without paying for them. The extension \nof the tax credits reduces revenue to the Treasury and makes the \ndeficit bigger. We need to pay for it. I would suggest, if we look \ncarefully at some of the tax credits enjoyed by the oil and gas \nindustry, we could probably find something there that is not fair or \nreasonable or productive. I suggest we use those revenues, not to \noffset the revenues that would be lost from suspending the Federal \ngasoline tax until after the election but to use those revenues to make \nsure we extend tax credits for renewable energy, wind, solar, \ngeothermal, and so forth.\n  I will have a chance to come back later in the week and talk about \nthis some more. Sometimes we underestimate the wisdom of the voters. I \nthink it was Thomas Jefferson who said: If you tell the American people \nthe truth, they won't make a mistake. I will do my dead level best to \nmake sure, during the course of the debate on this notion of waiving \nthe gasoline tax or having a holiday on the gasoline tax until after \nthe election, I am going to make sure, I hope with a number of my \ncolleagues, the American people understand the truth and the full \npicture and that they will make the right decision. Hopefully, we will \ntoo.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Madam President, I rise this afternoon to speak for a few \nminutes on the bill before the Senate, the FAA modernization bill. It \nis an extremely important reauthorization. At the end of the day, as we \npass this legislation, it will be the kind of bill that we look back on \nand wonder why we were not able to work out the differences a little \nbit faster, and get it signed into law a little bit more quickly \nbecause this is a bill that is of great importance to our \ntransportation infrastructure, to those who rely on the aviation system \nevery day for business travel, for family travel, and for their jobs, \ntheir livelihood.\n  This is an important piece of legislation because it lays the \nfoundation for modernization of our aviation infrastructure and the \ntechnology, the air traffic control systems that we depend on every day \nto keep our skies safe. Technology continues to evolve, that is a good \nthing. It improves efficiency, improves safety, and can really have a \npositive impact in the skies. But at the same time, we all understand \nthat technology costs money. To purchase new systems, to install them, \nto train our traffic controllers to make sure they are in the strongest \npossible position to use that equipment costs money.\n  There is no question that one of the debates that delayed this \nlegislation was over how to fund the infrastructure improvements that \nare in the bill, not whether to fund, and I suppose that is good news. \nThere was general consensus that there needed to be a strong and clear \nfunding commitment, but there was some debate over the exact mechanism.\n  I certainly want to give credit to Chairman Baucus and Chairman \nInouye of the Finance and Commerce Committees; the Ranking Member \nGrassley and Vice Chairman Stevens; and, of course, Senator Hutchison \nand Senator Rockefeller for the work they did on the Aviation \nSubcommittee.\n  There was a lot of disagreement as to whether we should create a new \nfee system, whether we should create a new bureaucracy for assessing \nfees on general aviation. I am pleased to see that we did not go that \nroute. We have a system for collecting aviation taxes in place, taxes \non aviation fuel and jet fuel. There was a recognition on all sides \nthat that tax burden needed to be increased to keep pace with the needs \nof the aviation system. It is an efficient system. It is one that \nworks. It is one that is well understood. I think it would have been a \nmistake to try to create a new bureaucracy when we have such a system \nin place.\n  So this legislation will increase the taxes on general aviation jet \nfuel pretty significantly from about 22 cents a gallon to 36 cents a \ngallon, but there is a recognition that so long as that money stays in \nthe aviation trust fund, so long as it is used to upgrade the aviation \nsystem, it will be well spent.\n  This tax increase on general aviation jet fuel will provide nearly \n$290 million annually in additional funding for the NextGen air traffic \nsystem, and that is something to be commended. It addresses the impact \nof air traffic growth because it increases the system's capacity and, \nat the same time, improves the efficiency and, of course, our focus at \nall times has to be safety.\n  One of the points that is most impressive about our aviation system, \nboth on the commercial aviation and general aviation side, over the \nlast couple of decades is the improvement in safety. The improvement in \nperformance and safety per thousand miles flown or 100,000 miles flown \nhas been significant, and everyone benefits from that improvement. \nConsumers benefit from a safer system and, of course, a safer system, a \nsafer workplace, a safer environment is less costly and less expensive.\n  This legislation also provides increases to the Aviation Improvement \nProgram, AIP. That is a program that is important to airports, large \nand small, across the country. In New Hampshire, the Manchester Airport \nhas undergone tremendous levels of growth during the past decade, and \nmuch of that improvement, infrastructure, and investment at Manchester \nhas been\n\n[[Page S3482]]\n\nfunded through the AIP, including the airport's noise reduction \nenhancements.\n  Today in New Hampshire, everyone benefits from the improvement in \nthat infrastructure, the expansion at Manchester. The improvement in \nefficiency, not just in New Hampshire but across northern New England, \ncreates a different choice for consumers, for businesses, and for \ntourism as well. That makes a difference, a real difference, in our \nnorthern New England economy.\n  This bill is not perfect. Rarely does anyone stand on the floor of \nthe Senate and announce that a piece of legislation is perfect, but it \nis a good bipartisan effort. We will have opportunities to improve it, \nperhaps on the Senate floor during this debate, perhaps in conference, \nbut it is important that we not bog down this legislation with \namendments that will derail the bill, that will kill the bill, that \nwill create a controversy that will make it difficult, if not \nimpossible, to complete work on it in the coming weeks. It is a bill \nthat needs to get done. It is a bill that needs to be sent to the \nPresident, not least of all so that the funding commitment for new \ntechnology can be implemented as quickly as possible.\n  Madam President, I again commend the work of the Senator from Texas \nas the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Aviation. I serve with her \non the Commerce Committee, and I have really enjoyed working on this \nlegislation. We had an exciting markup, to say the least, several \nmonths ago, but I am pleased to see we have been able to work through \nthose differences and bring a very strong product to the floor.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I commend the Senator from New \nHampshire. He was, indeed, a very important part of the negotiations on \nthis bill. It is a complicated bill. He represents a State that has \ngeneral aviation. It is very important to the service in his State. He \nspoke up for that service. In fact, in the bill, there are some very \nimportant components that are strong for general aviation, and also \ncities that have lost service in the past after deregulation we want to \ntry to help get back in service with some incentives for service by \nsmaller, maybe startup airlines.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire, Mr. Sununu, has been a very important \npart of helping us negotiate this bill that we have brought to the \nfloor.\n  I know my chairman, Senator Rockefeller, is going to be here soon. I \nhope we will be able to come to closure on the aviation part of this \nbill. I have very strong concerns about some of the provisions in the \nFinance Committee part that is going to be put into this bill. I hope \nthe Finance Committee will work with us to take away some of the \nextraneous tax provisions that have nothing to do with aviation so that \nwe can pass a good, solid bill that addresses aviation safety, which \nevery consumer is interested in doing, that addresses the need for \nbetter service to our smaller communities, that increases the \nmodernization of our air traffic control system, and that assures that \npassengers are taken care of when there are inordinate delays, and \nespecially when they are on an airplane, maybe sitting on a runway for \nseveral hours at a time, and there are some very important parts of the \nbill that address the rights of passengers and the needs of passengers.\n  I hope we can get an aviation bill passed. I hope we can move out the \nextraneous provisions out and let the Finance Committee do those \nseparately, which they certainly have the capability to do. But I do \nnot want to hold up this good consumer bill.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues, Senator Rockefeller, \nSenator Inouye, and Senator Stevens on the committee, and Senator \nSununu who just spoke, to get a good bill on which we can then go to \nconference with the House.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Federal Deficit\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I rise to speak briefly about where we \nare headed as a government and specifically what we are passing on to \nour children, which is regrettably a lot more debt than they deserve. \nThis year the Federal deficit is projected to be close to $400 billion. \nThat is up from last year, where it was under $200 billion. That is not \na good trend, to be driving up the deficit.\n  It is also not a good trend to be putting on the books program after \nprogram which will end up costing our children a lot of money, and \nwhich we borrow from our children to pay for.\n  This bill, which is brought forward today, has in it, unfortunately, \na couple of items--at least one specifically--actually a couple that \nare questionable, in which we are spending money which could much \nbetter be used to reduce the debt on our children. As I said, this year \nalone we are going to add $400 billion of debt to our children's backs. \nProbably the most significant in this account is something that has \nnothing to do with air transportation. You can call it the train to \nnowhere or the fast track to waste. It is the train they are proposing \nto build somewhere in New York to go somewhere in New York which is \ngoing to cost $1.7 billion.\n  Clearly this is not the right bill for that proposal. But even if it \nwere the right bill, this would be not an appropriate proposal. This is \na situation where folks from New York, who are good and decent people, \nhave decided to raid the Federal Treasury to get some money to pay for \nsomething--in a very questionable way, by the way; by basically waiving \nFICA taxes, which they are not paying to begin with, for town \nemployees--State employees. They have decided to raid the Federal \nTreasury for the purposes of building this train to nowhere.\n  We have seen this before, these specific projects, which benefit a \nspecific place, which are not defensible. This certainly falls into \nthat category. But in the broader context it becomes even less \ndefensible because we are facing such a large deficit. We are not only \nfacing this very significant deficit of almost $400 billion, we are \nconstantly adding to that deficit. There are now, within the framework \nof the walls of this Capitol building--there are not four walls, there \nare lots of different walls in this Capitol building, but within this \nCapitol there is a series of ideas which is being promoted, which is \nalso on a fast track, regrettably, a fast track of spending, which is \nalso going to end up ballooning that deficit further than $400 billion.\n  There is, for example, a proposal being floated which has merit in \nconcept but, when it comes to paying for it, nobody is willing do that, \nwhich will cost close to $60 billion. That is a proposal to \ndramatically expand the GI bill, as it is known. There is a proposal to \nexpand unemployment insurance, even in States where unemployment has \nnot hit numbers where it represents an immediate problem. \nTraditionally, unemployment under 6 percent or 5.5 percent is deemed to \nbe full employment. In much of this country today, many States have \ntheir unemployment rates under 5.5 percent. But there is a proposal to \nexpand the number of weeks a person can claim unemployment, even in \nStates where there is essentially a number that represents full \nemployment and that is going to cost $15 billion.\n  There are proposals in the farm bill, which has all sorts of gimmicks \nand all sorts of machinations to cover its costs and claim that it is \npaid for, which will cost billions and billions of dollars. The farm \nbill itself is a $285 billion bill. Huge expenditures are coming down \nthe pike here, which are going to have to be paid for by our children.\n  There are proposals for further relief for Katrina of $5 billion. \nThere are food stamp proposals of billions of dollars. There are Byrne \ngrants, competitiveness grants, county payments, Bureau of Prisons--all \nof these ideas are floating around this Capitol as ideas on which we \nshould spend more money. Most of them have good and reasonable \narguments behind them. But the problem is they also, almost in every \ncase, end up passing more debt on to our children.\n\n[[Page S3483]]\n\n  In many instances, especially the train to nowhere in New York, you \ncannot justify it. It is wasteful spending at the expense of our \nchildren and it is inappropriate because this debt is building up and \nup. As a result, paying off this debt is going to mean the taxes on our \nchildren are going to have to go up and up as they move into their \nearning years.\n  The practical effect of that is that the next generation, our kids \nand our children's children, are not going to be able to afford as high \nquality a lifestyle as our generation has because they will have to be \npaying so much to support the Federal Government and the debts of the \nFederal Government. They will not be able to afford to send their kids \nto college, assuming college is even affordable at that time. They will \nnot be able to buy that first home. They will not be able to live the \nhigh quality of lifestyle that has become the nature and character of \nAmerican life, because the cost of the government, which we have \nincurred today, will have to be paid for by them tomorrow.\n  It is not fair. It is not right. It used to be around here people \ntalked about the deficit a lot. They used to point to it as a failure \nof our Government and there used to be genuine efforts to try to reduce \nthe deficit--on the spending side of the ledger from our side of the \naisle and on the other side of the aisle by raising taxes. But that \ndiscussion has waned. There is no focus right now on the deficit, I \nsuspect in large part because we now have a Democratic Congress and \ndeficit spending is justifiable if it meets an interest group's claims \nthat they have a right to this money or they believe should have a \nprogram, such as the train to nowhere in New York, which is promoted by \nour colleagues from the other side of the aisle who represent New York.\n  In the end, if we do not return to the basic concept that every \nfamily in America has to confront, which is you need to pay your bills \nas they come in and you cannot put too much money on the credit card \nbecause that means down the road you are not going to be able to pay \nthat credit card and you are going to have to suffer significant \ncontraction as a family--if we do not face up to that real fact of day-\nto-day existence that most Americans must realize, as far as how their \nspending meets their income, or if we do not as a government face up to \nthat, we are going to fundamentally undermine our Nation. We are \ncertainly going to do significant damage to our children and their \nfuture.\n  We talk a lot now about the weakness of the dollar and how that has \ncaused the price of gasoline to jump dramatically, which it has. The \nweak dollar has caused energy costs and costs of commodities which are \nnot produced in the United States to be driven up in large part because \nthe dollar has weakened so much. One of the drivers of the weak dollar \nis a belief in the international community that we are not going to put \nour fiscal house in order, that we are going to continue to run \ndeficits that are excessive, and that is what we are doing as a \nCongress.\n  We have some responsibility here. You can't make great progress \nunless you begin somewhere. A good place to begin might be to take this \n$1.7 billion that is proposed in this bill to spend for the train to \nnowhere, or the fast track to waste, and eliminate that program and \ntake the revenues that are alleged to be used to offset that program \nand use them to reduce the debt on our children's heads. Reduce that \ndebt by $1.7 billion. That is progress. Granted, in the overall scheme \nof things it is not a huge amount of money compared to the total debt \nthat is being incurred, even this year, the $400 billion, but you have \nto start somewhere. This would be a good place to start.\n  Let's stop the wasteful spending which is adding to the Federal debt, \nwhich inevitably will undermine the quality of life of this Nation and \nespecially pass on to our children obligations which there is no reason \nwe should ask them to bear.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, when the Senate considers the Federal \nAviation Administration Authorization Act, I will offer a bipartisan \namendment to strike section 808 of the substitute to this bill. The \nsection I wish to strike would impose a significant competitive \ndisadvantage on airlines that have done the most to protect their \nemployees and provide for the secure retirement of those employees and \ncurrent retirees. It would increase the pension obligations of these \nairlines above what is required of the airlines they compete with. It \nis fundamentally unfair. Such a move would undermine the ability of \nthese airlines to maintain their commitments to their workers, \nparticularly in today's struggling economy.\n  In 2006, with several airlines facing the prospect of bankruptcy, the \nPension Protection Act adjusted how struggling airlines that had frozen \ntheir defined benefit pension plans could calculate their pension \nobligations. Those airlines were allowed to devote significantly less \nfunding than their competitors toward payments to their pension plans. \nUnderstand, airlines facing bankruptcy that were on the cusp of losing \ndefined benefit retirement plans were given better treatment under the \nTax Code than those that didn't file bankruptcy and tried to keep their \nword to their employees under their defined benefit plans. Airlines \nthat maintained their pension plans weren't given this benefit. As a \nresult, American, Continental, Hawaiian, Alaskan, and US Airways were \nplaced at a significant competitive disadvantage, only because they \ncontinued to offer their workers defined benefits for retirement. Those \nare the benefit plans, incidentally, that workers like the most. They \nare the ones that guarantee what you will receive when you retire, as \nopposed to a defined contribution plan, for example, that says a \ncertain amount of money will be set aside, and maybe it will earn a lot \nbefore you retire, maybe it will not. The defined benefit plans--which, \nincidentally, Federal employees and Members of Congress have--are the \nbest. These airlines that had similar plans for their employees and \nretirees and avoided bankruptcy were put at a disadvantage. The \nairlines facing bankruptcy, throwing away their pension plans, and \nchanging them, were given a better break under the Tax Code than those \nthat continued in business, avoiding bankruptcy and keeping their word \nto their employees and retirees.\n  In 2007, I joined with Senator Harry Reid, adding language to the \nIraq supplemental that tried to address this unfairness and inequity. \nUnder the 2006 law, airlines that had prohibited new workers from \nparticipating in their defined benefit plan were allowed to assume a \nrate of return of 8.85 percent on their pension investments. The 2007 \nlaw allowed the other airlines, those that had maintained the previous \ndefined benefit commitment, to assume an 8.25-percent return. I know \nthese numbers probably in the course of the speech don't impress you, \nbut they should. It makes a significant difference of how much money an \nairline has to put in the pension plan, and the Tax Code, the law of \nour land, requires it. Airlines that had frozen their plans were \nallowed to amortize their plan shortfalls over 17 years; in other \nwords, those that were facing bankruptcy and walking away from many \naspects of their pension plans were able to take a longer period of \ntime to pay out what was necessary to bring their plans up to solvency. \nThe 2007 law gave airlines with defined benefit plans only 10 years, \nnot 17. Therefore, airlines that are offering their workers defined \nbenefits retirement face a competitive disadvantage.\n  The 2007 law I mentioned earlier partially closed the gap. Section \n808 of this FAA reauthorization bill would tilt the playing field away \nfrom the airlines that already face this competitive disadvantage \nbecause they offer the very best pension benefits to their employees.\n  What it comes down to is this: Airlines are declaring bankruptcy in \nevery direction. Some are reporting record losses. Last week, American \nAirlines reported a loss of $328 million in the first quarter, \nvirtually all of it attributable to increases in jet fuel. A few days \nlater, United Airlines, another\n\n[[Page S3484]]\n\nmajor airline based in my home State of Illinois, announced first \nquarter losses, if I am not mistaken, of nearly $500 million and the \nneed to lay off some 1,000 employees. Now comes this FAA \nreauthorization bill, and it includes a provision that will create an \neconomic burden and hardship on some of these airlines that are \nstruggling to survive. Could this Senate pick a worse time to hammer \naway at these airlines, when they are struggling to deal with jet fuel \ncosts that are going through the roof and an uncertain economy facing a \nrecession? If there was ever a bad idea, this is it.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Will the Senator yield for 15 seconds?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I thank the Senator.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that all postcloture time be \nyielded back and that the motion to proceed be agreed to and the motion \nto reconsider laid upon the table; that once the bill is reported, the \nSenator who is now speaking be recognized to offer a substitute \namendment; that upon reporting of that amendment, no further amendments \nbe in order during today's session and that there be debate only today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, will the Senator from Illinois \nfurther yield?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I want to say I am in complete agreement with what \nthe Senator from Illinois has said. I know he is going to finish his \nstatement, but he is making exactly the point I think needs to be made \nin this debate.\n  We will have an amendment tomorrow. Senator Durbin and I are going to \ncosponsor an amendment that would fix the issue about which he is \nspeaking. The idea that we would pass an FAA reauthorization that would \nmodernize our facilities, that would put more safety precautions in \nplace, that would give passengers more rights and, oh, by the way, \nwould also bankrupt some of our airlines in the meantime is ridiculous.\n  The bill will be so good. Senator Rockefeller has done a great job. \nWe have compromised. We have worked on a bipartisan basis. Then, all of \na sudden, we see this pension issue rise up that would put one, maybe \ntwo airlines into bankruptcy, and then we have taken away all the \nadvantages of this very good bill.\n  I commend the Senator from Illinois. I look forward to working with \nhim tomorrow on an amendment--or whenever we are designated to put our \namendment in place--and hope the balance we had is restored in the \npension issues so that airlines that are offering defined benefit \nplans--which are so rare these days--will still be able to offer \nemployees that, even at a greater cost.\n  I look forward to working with my colleague from West Virginia to \nmake sure this very good bill goes forward without the bad tax \nprovisions and the pension provision that was added, not by our \ncommittee, but by the Finance Committee.\n  I thank the Senator for yielding. I look forward to working with the \nSenator to fix this pension issue.\n  Thank you, Madam President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Texas for \njoining me in offering this amendment. This is a bipartisan amendment. \nWe urge our colleagues: Take a close look at this. At the end of the \nday, if we pass this FAA modernization bill and force more airlines \ninto bankruptcy because of this provision, is that our goal?\n  We have lost so many airlines already, and now a major airline, such \nas American Airlines, which avoided bankruptcy and managed to keep its \npromise to its employees and retirees, and has provided significant \nfunding for its pension, is going to be penalized by this bill.\n  Ask the people whose pensions are affected, those members of unions \nwho are supporting our efforts to stop this change in the law. I cannot \nunderstand the motivation behind this change.\n  When this was originally considered a few years back, there was \nanother group in charge in Congress and a chairman of the House Ways \nand Means Committee who singled out several airlines that were not \nfacing bankruptcy and created a disadvantage for them. We tried to \nremedy it last year, and we got a temporary fix in there. And here they \ncome again: this group that wants to keep changing this law, penalizing \nthese airlines--at absolutely the worst possible moment. Wouldn't it be \nironic if this were passed and the airlines that worked the hardest to \navoid bankruptcy, the airlines that worked the hardest to keep the \ndefined benefit plans--absolutely the gold standard when it comes to \nretirement--wouldn't it be ironic if the language of this bill ended up \ncapsizing these airlines at this precarious moment in our economic \nhistory.\n  I am going to urge my colleagues: Take a close look at this. Ask \nyourselves: If the beneficiaries of these retirement plans oppose this \nchange, if the airlines oppose this change, if there is no argument to \nbe made as to why you would treat these airlines differently than those \nthat have faced massive changes in their pension plans, why in the \nworld would we want to pass this amendment?\n  At the end of the day, I want to make sure we have FAA modernization. \nBut I also want to make sure there are airlines still serving America \nin every corner of America so our people have a chance to travel for \nbusiness, for leisure, whatever it might be.\n  I urge my colleagues: Please take a close look at this. I hope they \nwill consider supporting the Durbin-Hutchison amendment when it is \noffered tomorrow morning. It will be the first item of business. I hope \nwe can entertain a debate and move to its consideration at an early \ntime.\n  There is no reason to delay this. The sooner we remove this cloud \nfrom these airlines that have worked so hard to stay in business and \navoid bankruptcy the better.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, all postcloture time \nis yielded back.\n  The motion to proceed is agreed to, and the motion to reconsider is \nlaid on the table.\n  The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Illinois \nfor allowing himself to be interrupted twice, and I wish him a good \nevening.\n  Madam President, I wish to talk, with your permission, for about 25 \nto 30 minutes on what I consider to be the core problem we face; and it \nis the real condition that people need to know about the American \naviation industry.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/29/senate-section/article/S3484-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3484-S3496]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    FAA REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2007\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I call up my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from West Virginia [Mr. Rockefeller], for \n     himself, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Baucus, and Mr. Grassley, proposes \n     an amendment numbered 4585.\n\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Salazar). The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, as I was indicating, I do not think \nmost of our colleagues--they pick on certain subjects within aviation \nthat are of interest that have hot buttons to them--look at the general \nsituation of where the U.S. commercial aviation industry is, how bad \nits situation is, and I think it is time to tell the truth about that \nbefore we begin the debate on this bill.\n  After posting nearly $35 billion in cumulative net losses from 2001 \nthrough 2005, over the past 2 years, American commercial air carriers \nwere able to recover financially for a brief period from the effects of \nSeptember 11's grounding and subsequent adjustments. That is \nunderstandable.\n\n[[Page S3485]]\n\n  Domestic airlines earned an estimated net profit of roughly $3.8 \nbillion last year, more than twice the $1.7 billion net profits they \nachieved in 2006. That would appear to be going in the right direction. \nThis year, however, marks a turning point, which I fear will be a \nsustained downturn in the industry's long-term outlook. Within the past \nweek alone, we saw the Nation's third largest carrier--Delta--announce \na first quarter loss of $6.4 billion. On that same day, the Nation's \nfifth largest airline--Northwest Airlines--posted a quarterly loss of \n$4.1 billion.\n  This month, we witnessed four of our airlines--Frontier Airlines, \nAloha Airlines, ATA Airlines, and Skybus Airlines--forced to declare \nbankruptcy. Four airlines collapse in 1 month, and two airlines \nannounce a combined loss of $10.5 billion in one single quarter. I \nthink this underscores the dangerous direction in which I believe our \naviation industry is now truly heading.\n  It is clear that in 2008 this industry is moving through what could \nbe one of the most tumultuous periods it has ever experienced in our \nhistory. The recent window of profitability that commercial aviation \nexperienced now seems to have closed. A worrying question for all of \nus--and for the future of our economy--is whether these losses will \ncome to characterize its long-term financial outlook. I fear it will.\n  The challenges confronting our Nation's aviation market have now \nsharply affected a variety of consumers and stakeholders. Airline \ncompanies have been posting multibillion dollar losses this quarter \nalone. Tired and frustrated passengers are being caught up in the \nthousands of flights that have been canceled or delayed due to a number \nof things, including safety issues. A quarter of the airline industry's \nentire workforce have lost their jobs since the year 2000. I will \nrepeat that: One quarter of the airline industry's entire workforce \nhave lost their jobs since 2000. The air traffic control system remains \noutdated. As I indicated, we are trying to catch up with Mongolia. And \nmanagement problems continue to beset the industry's overseer, the \nFederal Aviation Administration.\n  Compounding all of these difficulties is the reality that the \nindustry is operating against a backdrop of a weaker American economy \nand general turmoil in global credit markets. Aside from all this, \nhowever, there remains one factor that has done more to change the face \nof the commercial aviation sector than any other; that is; the \nescalating cost of its lifeblood. We call it the price of oil.\n  To illustrate this dramatic spike in costs, it is worth recalling \nthat back in 2000 the price of oil stood at $30 a barrel. Recently, oil \nprices have been approaching $120 a barrel. But this does not \nnecessarily reflect the true cost to the airlines, as there is a \ndifference between the price of oil and the price of jet fuel, what the \nindustry refers to as the ``crack spread.'' This means that, for \nexample, on April 18, 2008, when oil was trading at nearly $116 a \nbarrel, the price of jet fuel per barrel was trading at nearly $144--\n$116 for a barrel of oil becomes $144 for airplanes.\n  Such a dramatic increase in the industry's largest single cost \nclearly illustrates the extent of the problem it must absorb. With oil \nprices alone having risen 75 percent in the past year, it is somewhat \nunsurprising that the move toward further consolidation is gaining in \nspeed.\n  It seems increasingly inevitable that the Delta-Northwest merger \nproposal will unleash a wave--a further wave--of industry \nconsolidation. I note that various airlines have been considering a \nnumber of possible pairings for some time now.\n  In September 2005, US Airways and America West Airlines merged. In \n2007, US Airways pursued an unsuccessful bid for Delta, and Midwest \nAirlines was purchased jointly by Texas Pacific Group and Northwest.\n  Numerous reports also indicate that further consolidation between \nUnited Airlines and Continental Airlines is likely--we will see--to \nhappen as a consequence of the move by Delta and Northwest to \nconsolidate--the domino theory.\n  With the emphasis on pursuing market share prior to 9/11, the big air \ncarriers are now focused on route and flight profitability and are less \nwilling to fly half-empty planes to keep their nationwide networks \ncompetitive. In an effort to improve their financial standings and \ncompete with smaller carriers, many legacy airlines--commercial \nairlines--have aggressively sought to cut costs by reducing labor \nexpenditures and by decreasing capacity through cuts to flight \nfrequency, use of smaller aircraft, or the elimination of service \naltogether to some communities.\n  The major U.S. carriers have shown much more capacity discipline over \nthe past few years and have retired, to their credit, many older, \ninefficient aircraft. Available seat miles--which is a term of art: a \nmeasure of capacity--increased only 0.3 percent in 2006, down from a \n3.3-percent increase in 2005, and an 8.7-percent increase in 2004. As a \nresult, load factors have increased by more than 10 percent since 2000, \nbringing in more revenue per operation. Profitability. Statistics from \nthe Air Transport Association show that the legacy carriers' combined \nfleet was 2,860 aircraft in 2006, an 18-percent reduction from almost \n3,500 planes at the end of 2000. So it has gone from 3,500 planes in \n2000 to 2,800 aircraft in 2006. That is clearly a trend.\n\n  In West Virginia, aviation represents about $3.4 billion of the \nState's gross domestic product. To us, that is a rather huge figure. It \nemploys over 50,000 people in our State. So the State has a direct \ninterest in the impact any consolidation within the industry may have \non services. I know the Presiding Officer knows that feeling.\n  I have said before that while I am not unilaterally opposed to \nconsolidation, I do believe every transaction has to be considered on \nits own merits. With regard to Delta-Northwest as a merger, I believe \nit is critical that the Federal agencies examine the fine details of \nthe merger thoroughly before approving it.\n  Now, this is of particular concern to me because Delta and Northwest \nprovide critical air services to my State of West Virginia that allow \nbusinesses in our State to be connected with the rest of the world. I \nhave said in the past, and I reiterate here today, that air services to \nsmall communities in my State and across the country depend on network \ncarriers that use hub-and-spoke operations. There are no other \nsustainable options available to us. None. We have very few private \naircraft, and obviously they are not available for commercial use. Low-\ncost carriers are not going to serve West Virginia's communities \nbecause we do not have the volume of passengers to work with their \nbusiness models.\n  My State needs healthy network carriers if we are to attract new air \nservices. At present, low-cost carriers are not going to fill the \nservice void in our markets. It disturbs me, then, that since March 13 \nof this year alone, American air carriers have exited from 86 routes \nthroughout the country, my guess would be all of them rural. I fear \nthese airlines plan to exit many other routes in the future.\n  It was to ensure West Virginians continued access to adequate air \nservices that I helped to create and expand the Small Community Air \nService Development Program and the Essential Air Service Program. Both \nof these arrangements provide a Federal subsidy for air carriers to \noperate out of very rural areas. From my perspective, an adequate air \nservice in West Virginia is not just a convenience but it is a flatout \neconomic necessity for our survival.\n  The airline industry is not only about the viability of the companies \nthat it comprises. It is important that we not forget the increasingly \nlarge number of American passengers who underwrite the industry by \nconsuming its services each year. Passenger traffic demand has now \nsurpassed pre-9/11 levels, with total passenger enplanements of 745 \nmillion in 2006, nearly 12 percent higher than the 666 million \npassengers who enplaned in 2000. The FAA's most recent forecast \nestimates passenger enplanements will grow to 794 million in 2008.\n  We are all aware and have probably often experienced ourselves the \ndelays and the cancellations that seem to be a growing feature of this \nindustry. Air carriers and their passengers continue to be plagued by \nsevere weather problems--which seem more than normal each year--and an \nair traffic control system that lacks the necessary capacity to handle \ndemand effectively. That is why, when we talk about building an air \ntraffic control system, which is at\n\n[[Page S3486]]\n\nleast up to Mongolia--and as I said this morning, that is a little bit \nof an exaggeration because they had no air traffic, and so they started \nwith what we want to move to. They started with what they should have \nstarted with, and that is digital GPS.\n  These conditions produced near gridlock at several key gateway \nairports throughout the country this past summer which almost matched \nthe record delays reached in the summer of 2000. Congestion and delay \nproblems cost the airlines and passengers billions of dollars each year \nin lost productivity, canceled flights, and, obviously, fuel expenses.\n  The severe congestion and delay problems that continue to plague air \ncarriers and their passengers further exacerbate the high cost, \ntherefore, of fuel. Inclement weather, an out-of-date air traffic \ncontrol system, and management problems keep planes in the sky longer, \nwhich only increases fuel-burn. Due to these conditions, only 69 \npercent of reported commercial airline operations arrived at their \ndestination on time during June and July of 2007.\n  I am pleased we have been able to work with the FAA on several \nefforts currently underway to address these problems, including a \ncontinuous focus on expanding infrastructure and adopting operational \nprocedures, such as the implementation of reduced separation \nrequirements and programs such as this fascinating acronym, the Area \nNavigation and Required Navigation Performance program, that permit \nmore precise navigation of aircraft. But, you see, that is very \ndifficult to do with x ray, with ground radio. That is why we need an \nair traffic control system which is modern, as every other modern \ncountry in the world has. Furthermore, since many of these delays \noriginate in the New York City airspace, the FAA has committed itself \nto taking a number of specific steps to relieve congestion there--and I \napplaud them for that--including airspace redesign and the opening of \nmilitary airspace to create additional capacity during particularly \ncongested times.\n  All of these efforts are a part of a longer term endeavor to solve \nthese problems by modernizing the entire air transportation system \nthrough the implementation of the Next Generation Air Transportation \nSystem, the system I have been talking about a good deal. I am \nconfident we can continue to pursue a workable strategy to increase the \ncapacity of the National Airspace System to keep pace with projected \ngrowth and demand for air travel while ensuring that we continue to \noperate the world's safest aviation system. But then again, you always \nhave to look underneath the figures.\n  The pending Delta-Northwest merger could represent an absolute \nwatershed moment in aviation industry history which would have a \ndramatic and wide-ranging impact on the industry, passengers, \nemployees, and our national economy. This merger is emblematic of the \naviation sector's future, in my judgment. We must acknowledge that a \ngreater degree of consolidation is becoming simply unavoidable due to \npressing economic factors, and we have no excuse to not manage these \nchanges responsibly.\n  I will always remain a fierce defender of West Virginia's right to \nadequate and reliable air services. That is why I went there in the \nfirst place. That is why I am there. I fight for fairness, and we don't \nhave it in aviation, and I fear losing more of it. Even in these new \nchallenging times for the sector, I will continue to ensure that my \nState is not adversely affected by this consolidation or any \nconsolidation.\n  Finally, I am concerned that even when the aviation industry did \nreturn to profitability over the past 2 years, services in my State did \nnot dramatically improve or expand. They weren't investing. Now that \nthe sector looks to be heading toward a more decidedly bleak future \nover a prolonged period, our efforts need to be redoubled so as to \nensure crucial air services to small and rural communities everywhere \nare rightfully defended.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, today we debate the FAA reauthorization, \nand it is a debate that probably should have been joined a long time \nago. This is a piece of legislation that has been kicking around here \nfor a long time. I serve on the Senate Commerce Committee. I know both \nthe House and the Senate reported bills out many months ago. We are \nfinally now getting a bill on to the floor for debate. It is important \nwe do this.\n  This is legislation that is critical to the infrastructure that \nsupports our aviation industry, which is a critical industry to \nAmerica's competitiveness, and if we look at what is happening in the \nairlines these days, obviously, we need to do everything we can to make \nsure we have a viable and effective aviation industry and commercial \nairlines are able to operate and provide the services to travelers who \nneed to get, every single day, to places both here at home and around \nthe world to conduct business and to recreate.\n  In the course of this debate, I cannot help but be struck by the fact \nthat I do not see there is anything we can do in the FAA \nreauthorization that addresses what fundamentally is probably plaguing \nthe airline industry more than anything else, and that is the high cost \nof energy.\n  I am looking at some information, graphs, some data. We can look at \nthis graph for January of 2004 and see where the cost of crude oil and \nthe cost of fuel for the airlines, for the aviation industry, was then \nand where it is today. Follow the red line, the way it tracks up. That \nspikes up. That is almost a straight vertical line.\n  If we take another graph which shows what the consumption of fuels is \nin the airline industry, the green line--you probably, Mr. President, \ncannot see this; it is too far away, but the green line shows \nconsumption has been fairly static in terms of the amount of fuel that \nis used. But if we look at the expense or the cost of the fuel, it has \nincreased at a sharp and dramatic rate.\n  My point very simply is that we cannot affect, I do not think, in a \nvery substantial way, what is plaguing and ailing the airline industry \nand a lot of other industries in this country absent addressing the \nfundamental cost issue of energy independence.\n  If we look at where we are as a nation today and where we were 30 \nyears ago, not much has changed. I remember as someone growing up \nduring the oil embargoes and what we were experiencing in the late \n1970s and a real concern at the time about our dependence, \noverdependence, dangerous dependence on foreign sources of energy. At \nthat time it was 55, 60 percent. Here we are 30 years later and we are \nmore than ever dependent on foreign sources of energy. Mr. President, \n60 to 65 percent of our petroleum comes from outside the United \nStates. We have very little control over the supply. The only way we \nfix that, the only way we can impact energy costs in this country in a \nmeaningful way is to increase supply.\n\n  We can talk a lot about a lot of issues with regard to this problem, \nthis challenge we face as a country. There are some things we can do to \nimpact the demand side, too, and we did that in the Energy bill last \nyear. We increased for the first time in a very long time fuel economy \nstandards so now automobiles are going to be built to standards that \nwill require more miles per gallon than they currently get. That will \nhelp control, to some degree, the demand side. Obviously, I think \nindividual consumers in this country, drivers in this country, are \ngoing to begin to take steps to reduce the amount of fuel they consume \nbecause it is impacting so adversely their pocketbooks on a daily \nbasis.\n  But there is not anything we can do totally on the demand side to get \nus out of this mess we are in. We have to do some things to impact \nsupply. I can't help but think that if we had taken some of these steps \nyears ago, back in 1995 or thereabouts when President Clinton vetoed \nlegislation that would have allowed oil exploration on the North Slope \nof Alaska--at the time it was argued, oh, it will take 5 to 10 years \nfor us to develop this resource and when we do, it will not be that \nmuch anyway. It is only 1 million or 1\\1/2\\ million barrels a day, and \nthat is not that significant in the overall scheme of things. Here we \nare 10 years\n\n[[Page S3487]]\n\nlater. If we had done that then, this would be fully developed, we \nwould have the barrels of oil on a daily basis, the daily equivalent of \nwhat we get from Saudi Arabia, available to meet our demand in this \ncountry.\n  It has probably been, since that time, half a dozen times we voted on \nthat. In the House of Representatives, I don't know how many votes we \nhad over there that would have allowed authorized exploration for oil \non the North Slope of Alaska. We have had that vote in the Senate, \nsince I have been here, on at least one occasion, maybe two times, \nwhere we were a couple votes short of reaching that magic 60-vote \nthreshold that would allow us to move forward and explore some of these \nopportunities that we have to grow our supply, our domestic supply of \nenergy.\n  Because he had listened to this debate for some time--I have been in \nthe Congress, now, for the better part of 10 years and always was \ninterested when the debate would come to the floor of the House or the \nSenate and you would hear both sides come to the floor and make their \narguments--I actually went up to Alaska and visited the section 1002 \narea where it is proposed we develop this oil resource. We landed in \nBarrow, AK, in February, a couple years ago. It was 38 below. We \nvisited a couple of the existing sites at Prudhoe Bay and then we went \nover to section 1002, which is the vast area we are talking about for \ndevelopment. What struck me is we are talking about a 2,000-acre \nfootprint that would be used to access the oil below the surface, and \nwith modern technology, you can actually get to those reserves below \nthe surface with horizontal or directional drilling, with a minimal \nfootprint on the surface, and it would be done during certain parts of \nthe year where it wouldn't impact wildlife or anything.\n  Incidentally, there were caribou everywhere. Anybody who is worried \nabout the caribou on the North Slope of Alaska, they have nothing to \nworry about because, if anything, it has been increased since the \nactivity that has taken place up there.\n  But this particular area is a very isolated, remote area on the North \nSlope of Alaska. The estimates run from somewhere between 6 billion and \n16 billion barrels of oil beneath the surface or, as I said, the daily \nequivalent of about 1.5 million barrels a day, which is comparable to \nwhat we get from Saudi Arabia.\n  To put it in perspective, a 2,000-acre footprint, for those who come \nfrom my part of the country who have an agricultural background, that \nis the equivalent of three sections of farm ground. That in an area of \nsome 19.2 million acres in what they call ANWR, this refuge area. But \nif you look at the State of Alaska in its totality, Alaska, believe it \nor not, is 7.5 times the size of the State of South Dakota. You could \nput South Dakota geographically into Alaska 7.5 times. That is how vast \nthis area is up there. It is part of our country, part of an area that \nhas enormous resources below the surface that could be very meaningful \nin terms of addressing America's energy needs.\n  When you visit that area, you cannot help but be struck with, No. 1, \nhow supportive the governmental leadership is in that area--the \nGovernor, the State legislature, in many respects most of the local \ncitizens. There are always those who are opposed to this type of \ndevelopment. We heard from them as well. But overwhelmingly, the \nmajority of people in that area want to see this development.\n  Here we are again facing a crisis as we head into the summer driving \nseason, travel season, vacation season. Families are looking, making \nplans. In my State of South Dakota, farmers are getting into the field, \nand they are having to deal with the input costs associated with high \nfuel costs, diesel costs. This is an economic issue that affects \nliterally every American but particularly those middle-income Americans \nand those who this summer are looking at making plans to travel. They \nare going to be facing $3.50 gasoline, perhaps higher than that. Who \nknows how high that is going to go?\n\n  My point very simply is we should have been taking these steps many \nyears ago. We are now paying a price for inaction on the part of this \nCongress when it comes to the things we can do to add to supply in this \ncountry, to make sure we are taking full advantage of the domestic \nresources we have right here at home so we do not have to continue to \nallow other countries around the world to hold us over a barrel when it \ncomes to our energy needs.\n  The other thing we ought to have been doing--again this is something \nthat is long overdue--is developing more refinery capacity. We are \npretty much maxed out. We have not built a new refinery since 1976. \nThey will tell you they have added or expanded existing refineries, and \nall that is true, but at the end of the day we have not done very much \nin terms of addressing the refinery shortage we have in this country \neither. So when it comes to raw resources such as the oil, petroleum \nresources below the surface on the North Slope of Alaska, when it comes \nto the ability to refine that into gasoline, we have some deficiencies \nthat are of our own making. I regret the fact that we were not able to \nfind the votes in this body to do these types of things many years ago, \nwhen today it would make a big difference in the challenge we face.\n  The other issue, the other point I will make--because I think it gets \nback at this issue of how doing some of these things, although at the \ntime they may have seemed to be not that substantial, could make a \ndifference at the margin--is what has happened with renewable energy in \nthis country. We are now generating about 7.5, almost 8 billion gallons \nof renewable fuel or ethanol in America today. One would think perhaps, \nwhen you use 140 billion gallons of gasoline on an annual basis, that \nthat is not that big of a dent. But there was a study done by Merrill \nLynch, it was reported in the Wall Street Journal a few weeks back, \nthat were it not for ethanol, the price per barrel of oil and the price \nper gallon of gasoline would actually be 15 percent higher than it is \ntoday. So even though it is 7.5 billion gallons out of a 140-billion-\ngallon annual demand for gasoline, it is affecting the price because it \nis impacting supply in a positive way.\n  In the same way, if we had opened the North Slope of Alaska when we \nhad an opportunity to do so, we would have that 1\\1/2\\ million barrels \na day coming into this country, which also would significantly impact \nthe supply in a way that would begin to bring down prices. The only way \nwe are going to bring downward pressure on prices is to increase \nsupply. That is why I have been such a big advocate for renewable \nenergy.\n  We are at 7.5 billion gallons today. The Energy bill that passed last \nyear calls for 36 billion gallons of renewable fuel by the year 2022. I \nthink we can reach that. We are not going to reach it with corn-based \nethanol. We have to diversify the production of ethanol in this country \nwith other forms of biomass, whether that is by woodchips out of our \nforests, whether it is by switchgrass, which we have an abundance of on \nthe prairies of South Dakota--but there are a lot of opportunities for \nwhat we call the next generation, for cellulosics, to meet the demands \nfor energy in this country. I think we should be moving full steam \nahead when it comes to support for renewables so we can lessen the \ndemand on foreign energy and we can become more energy efficient here \nat home and develop the supplies of fuel we have.\n  That being said, even if we get to 36 billion gallons of renewable \nfuels, we still will be way short of what we need. We are going to need \na mix of fuels. We are going to rely on some of those traditional \nsources of fuel such as petroleum. Coal-to-liquid holds great promise \nin terms of being able to be used as a fuel, and coal is something we \nhave in infinite amounts. We ought to be developing these types of \nresources. I think we also ought to be allowing States that want to, \nparticularly some States in the upper Midwest, where ethanol is \nproduced, to go to higher blends. We are at 10 percent ethanol today. \nThere are States I think would like to go to higher blends. We ought to \nallow them, particularly when the studies are concluded by the \nDepartment of Energy and the EPA, which are determining the impact on \ndrivability, materials compatibility, emissions--all those sorts of \nthings. When they come back, which I believe they will, and \nconclusively determine that going to higher blends would not in any way \nadversely impact any of those metrics I mentioned, we ought to be \nmoving to higher blends of ethanol because I think that also will help \ntake pressure off oil prices as we continue to use more and more \nrenewable energy.\n\n[[Page S3488]]\n\n  These are all parts of a solution. We need supply. But we have not \ntaken the necessary steps to add to supply. If not now, I don't know \nwhen. When we get prices such as we are seeing, and the impact that is \nhaving on transportation industries such as aviation, such as trucking, \nsuch as agriculture, these are impacts on our economy that are only \ngoing to bring great economic strain to many industries and a loss of \njobs.\n  We can do something about it. We ought to be doing something about \nit. We need to now authorize, even though we have had many \nopportunities to do it in the past--we ought to do it on the North \nSlope of Alaska and offshore and other places where we have these \nreserves. We ought to allow refineries to be built. We tried to get \nlegislation through that would allow refineries to be built on BRAC \nbases; in other words, bases that were closed through the BRAC process, \nand it was blocked by the Democrats on the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee.\n  Even when it came to the renewable fuel standard last year, that \npassed through the Senate and House and ultimately was signed into law, \nthere is a deficiency there as well which has come to light now and a \nchange that was made at the very 11th hour by the Speaker of the House \nthat prevents biomass, residual types of biomass such as slash piles \nthat are generated in our national forests, to be used to make \ncellulosic ethanol.\n  That makes absolutely no sense. We have waste products in our forests \nthat add to fuel loads that create fire hazards. All we are simply \nsaying is these types of products could be used to make next-generation \nbiofuels and help grow our supply of renewable energy, and that was \nstripped out, at the 11th hour, by the House in the conference.\n  That is very unfortunate because it is steps such as that, it is \nsteps such as blocking legislation that would allow for expedited \npermitting of refineries on BRAC bases, it is things such as blocking a \nvote on opening the North Slope of Alaska to oil exploration--those are \nthe types of things that are stopping us. Those are the types of steps \nand maneuvers in the Senate and the House that are stopping us from \nadding to the supply of energy so we can do something about it, so we \ncan impact, in a meaningful and positive way, the high prices that are \naffecting consumers across this country.\n  I wish to make one observation as well with regard to renewable \nenergy because ethanol has come under a lot of criticism of late, much \nof it I think inspired by opponents of ethanol, such as oil companies. \nPeople are talking about the high cost of food, and food prices have \ngone up in this country. But if you think about it, the amount of corn \nthat goes into a box of corn flakes, for example, it is about a nickel. \nIf you think about what impacts the cost of the things we buy at the \ngrocery store, transportation has a profound impact on the cost because \nyou have transportation, you have packaging, processing--all those \nthings which are very energy intensive. So when you have high energy \nprices, high fuel prices such as we are facing today, that has more to \ndo with the costs of food than the cost for a bushel of corn is ever \ngoing to have, when it comes to corn flakes or when it comes to popcorn \nor many of the other things that are being mentioned now by some of \nthese groups opposing ethanol.\n  I also would point out what I mentioned earlier and that is that were \nit not for ethanol--this again was reported upon by the Wall Street \nJournal a few weeks back, a study done by Merrill Lynch--oil prices, \nper-barrel oil prices and per-gallon gasoline prices would be about 15 \npercent higher. Couple that with the fact that a high commodity price \nmeans the Federal taxpayers under our farm programs are not making \npayments to producers to the tune of a savings of about $8 billion last \nyear, according to the USDA, and there are lots of impacts that are not \nbeing mentioned by those who are specifically singling out ethanol and \ncriticizing ethanol for the increase and runup in food costs.\n  Add to that or couple that with this piece of data that comes out of \nthe USDA, that $8 billion in savings in taxpayer payments would be made \nunder farm programs that were not made, that didn't go out this last \nyear because of high product prices. That is a substantial savings to \nthe taxpayers of this country. Again, couple that with the fact that \nethanol has contributed 15 percent reduction in the overall costs of \nfuel in this country, ethanol is having the impact we hoped it would by \nincreasing supply and taking pressure off the price at the pump in this \ncountry.\n  High fuel costs, high food costs, all these things are impacting \nconsumers across this country. We cannot solve that problem. We cannot \nsolve the problem of the airlines until we do something to develop our \ndomestic resources right here at home.\n  We have some supplies, some reserves underground even in places that \npreviously had not been contemplated as a source of energy, in places \nsuch as the Dakotas where we are now finding there are some reserves \ndown there, that with prices being what they are may be economically \nrecoverable. We should be doing everything we can to develop domestic \nresources, whether it is on the North Slope of Alaska, whether it is \noffshore, whether it is in the Dakotas, in the form of oil below the \nsurface, or corn that grows above the surface that is renewable that we \ncan use every single year. We need to be developing resources right \nhere at home that will lessen our dependence upon foreign sources of \nenergy and do something to take the pressure off these high gas prices \nwe are seeing today that are affecting every single American.\n  I hope we will pass a comprehensive energy bill, one that includes \nincreasing our supply, one that finally, once and for all, will allow \nus to get to that 6 to 16 billion barrels of oil beneath the surface on \nthe North Slope of Alaska, which is widely supported by the political \nleadership in Alaska, the local citizenry there, that increases the \namount of renewable energy we use in this country by allowing States \nthat choose to increase and go to higher blends, perhaps to 20 percent \nor 30 percent ethanol. These are all things we could and should be \ndoing today--allowing refineries to be built on bases that have been \nclosed, and allowing for expedited permitting when it comes to \nconstructing those refineries. These are all things that ought to be \npart of this energy solution. I think people are going to hold this \nCongress accountable if we do not take steps in that direction. My hope \nwould be that before we move out of here before the next break--we have \ngot a break coming up in a couple of weeks--we will take some action \nthat will do something meaningful to lower energy prices for people in \nthis country, increase our supply to build new refineries, to support \nthe increased use of renewables. Those are all things that will happen \nand provide solutions and meaningful relief to the hard-working people \nin this country who are now faced with much higher gasoline prices.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Menendez). The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n\n                                 Energy\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I know a couple of my colleagues will be \ncoming to the floor, specifically Senator Cantwell will be coming to \nthe floor, to speak about some energy issues in a moment. When she \ndoes, I will relinquish the floor.\n  I wanted to make a couple of comments. I listened with interest to my \ncolleague from South Dakota making comments about the energy situation. \nWe agree on much of what he has said and disagree on perhaps some \namount of it. But renewable fuels, ethanol, providing renewable energy, \nall of that is very important.\n  The area where we would perhaps not agree is ANWR, which in my \njudgment ought to be a last resort rather than a first resort. But I \nmight say to my colleague from South Dakota that particularly with \nrespect to the Outer Continental Shelf, if you measure where oil \nexists, the best resources and reserves of oil and gas on the Outer \nContinental Shelf first are in the Gulf of Mexico; second, off \nCalifornia; third, off Alaska.\n  One of the things we have recently done on a bipartisan basis in this \nCongress was to pass something called Lease 181, which opened up a \nportion of the Gulf of Mexico for development of oil and gas. I was one \nof the four Senators who led the effort on that. I was pleased to do \nthat because we are now\n\n[[Page S3489]]\n\nproducing and are going to be producing more oil and more natural gas \nfrom one of the most productive areas in the eastern Gulf of Mexico. So \nproduction is certainly one of the areas we ought to be concerned \nabout, as the Senator indicated. Production, conservation, efficiency, \nand renewables, all of these are important elements of an energy \npolicy.\n  No one has ever accused this Congress of speeding. I understand that. \nThis system is not established to be necessarily efficient. It has \nchecks and balances, which makes it very hard to get things done. But \nthere is an urgency at this point, an urgency for families, for \nfarmers, for truckers, yes, for businesses and airlines with respect to \nwhat is happening with the price of gasoline.\n\n  There are a lot of reasons for all of this, and I am not here to try \nto ascribe blame, I am here to say: Let's fix some of these things. I \nam going to offer an amendment, by the way, to the FAA reauthorization \nbill, that deals with something that as of today I note that 67 Members \nof the Senate have agreed to.\n  Some while ago, I introduced the notion of prohibiting the further \nmovement of oil underground into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. I \nhave introduced legislation on that matter. Long ago I introduced it, \nhad discussions with the Energy Committee about it. I had 51 Senators \nsign a letter to the President to say: Stop putting oil underground \nwhen the price of oil is $115, $120 a barrel. Stop taking oil out of \nsupply and putting it underground into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. \nIt is already 97 percent full. Why would we take oil out of supply to \nput upward pressure on prices, on both oil and gasoline, at a time when \noil is at a record high? That makes no sense. Let us use at least some \nreservoir of common sense. Fifty-one Members of the Senate signed my \nlegislation, signed the letter to the President in support of my \nlegislation.\n  Today, 16 members of the minority signed a letter to the President. \nThey have also introduced legislation. So 51 and 16, 67 members agreed, \nthat includes the person who spoke on the floor today. Senator McCain \nhas called for the identical policy. That is 67. That is veto proof. If \n67 Members of this Senate say to this President and this \nadministration: Stop sticking oil under the ground, nearly 70,000 \nbarrels of sweet light crude every day--that is the most valuable \nsubset of oil. We have had testimony before the Energy Committee that \nsuggests it has put as much as a 10-percent increase on the price of a \nbarrel of oil or a gallon of gasoline. And while families and farmers \nand truckers and airlines and all of these businesses are trying to \nfigure out how on Earth do we pay this fuel bill, and while we see the \ndamage and the dislocation of this country's economy because of it, \nthis administration merrily goes along sticking oil underground. It is \nunbelievable. At the very least you ought to expect some common sense \nhere.\n  Now, what has gotten us into this mess? Well, let me describe what is \nhappening with Saudi Arabia. And if ever we should wonder about the \ndanger of being overly dependent on oil from off this country's shores, \nthis is the chart that shows why.\n  The Saudis, who have the largest reserve of oil in the world by far, \nhave reduced their production by 800,000 barrels a day since 2005. They \nhave reduced production by 800,000 barrels a day. That is part of the \nproblem. So we sit here in the United States with a prodigious need for \nenergy to make this economy work. And, by the way, as an aside, I have \nsaid before: We stick straws in this planet and suck oil out of the \nplanet. We suck out 86 million barrels of oil a day. One-fourth of it \nis required here in the United States of America. We use one-fourth of \neverything that is produced every day in this world, on this planet. \nOne-fourth of that oil is used here in the United States. We have an \nenormous appetite. So we need to conserve; we need more efficiency in \nthe use of energy. We have done some things in that area. The CAFE \nstandards increased fuel efficiency by 10 miles per gallon over 10 \nyears. We have done some things in a range of these areas, but we are \nfar too dependent on foreign sources of oil. When the Saudis decide \nthey are going to cut back oil production by 800,000 barrels a day, and \nthey say to us: Oh, by the way, with our strategic relationship, we \nwant you to sell us precision munitions, it seems to me we ought to not \nbe arming to the teeth the Middle East.\n  But aside from that, strategic partnerships run both ways. You cut \nyour oil production by 800,000 barrels over 2 years; and by the way, we \nwould like some strategic weapons for our strategic need in the \nregion--it does not seem to me that is the way a partnership should \nwork.\n  But let me describe with a couple of charts what is happening with \nthis strategic reserve. Here we see that oil prices have nearly doubled \nin 1 year. There is no natural reason for that. The supply-demand \nrelationship in the marketplace does not justify this. The marketplace \nsimply is not working.\n  We have these people who shake the cymbals and worship at the altar \nof the marketplace. By the marketplace, that is the greatest allocation \nof goods and services known to mankind. Well, I believe it is a great \nallocator of goods and services. I used to teach economics in college \nbriefly, and I understand the marketplace. But the marketplace needs a \nreferee from time to time because sometimes the marketplace does not \nwork; the arteries get clogged, it does not work.\n  So here is what has happened in a year. Oil prices nearly doubled in \na year. Now, my colleagues have used quotes, and I have used many \nquotes. I am going to use one by Mr. Gheit, because Mr. Gheit said it \nall. He said: There is no shortage of oil.\n  Who is Mr. Gheit? He has worked for 30 years for Oppenheimer and \nCompany, the top energy analyst for Oppenheimer. He said:\n\n       There is no shortage of oil. I am absolutely convinced that \n     oil prices shouldn't be a dime above $55 a barrel.\n\n  Oil speculators, including the largest financial institutions in the \nworld--he said:\n\n       I call it the world's largest gambling hall. It is open 24/\n     7. Unfortunately it is totally unregulated. This is like a \n     highway with no cops and no speed limit and everybody is \n     going 120 miles per hour.\n\n  What is he talking about? He is talking about hedge funds neck deep \nin the futures market. He is talking about investment banks neck deep \nin the futures market. Is this because hedge funds and investment banks \nwant to wallow in oil? Do they want to bathe in oil? Do they want to \ntake it home and store it in their garage? They do not want to see oil. \nThey want to speculate and make money.\n\n  They have made a lot of money. People who never had it are buying \nthings from people who never will get it. So they are making money on \nboth sides of the transaction.\n  Now, what does that do when you have this kind of unbelievable \nspeculation? It causes the runup of prices in a very dramatic way. \nThere is a trader named Andrew Hall. I would not know him from a cord \nof wood; never met him, never will, I suppose. He earned $250 million \non the commodity market over the past 5 years, one-quarter of a billion \ndollars. He was betting. All of this is betting. He is betting long \nterm, short term. He is not somebody who takes oil as a commodity; he \njust bets.\n  There are a couple of things we ought to do. I will be very brief. \nOne, in order to be engaged in the futures market, as I have said \nbefore, if you want to speculate in the commodities future market for \noil, for example, you only require 5 to 7 percent down; only 5 to 7 \npercent margin. You can control $100,000 worth of oil with $5,000 to \n$7,000 of your own money.\n  If you wanted to wager, that is a good way to do it, I suppose. If \nyou want to do it in the stock market, to do this on margin, it takes \n50 percent to buy in the stock market. But if you go to the commodities \nmarket, you can speculate to your little heart's content with 5 to 7 \npercent. That makes no sense. It ought to be 25 percent, in my \njudgment, or perhaps if you want to buy oil futures, you ought to take \npossession of the oil.\n  But one way or another, when you have a market that is not working, \nand you have speculation running out of control, I think there is an \nobligation on the part of this Congress to address that. Because that \nspeculation is driving up the price of oil, and driving the price of \ngasoline well up beyond where the fundamentals would suggest. It \ninjures the American drivers, consumers,\n\n[[Page S3490]]\n\nbusiness, and it injures this country's economy.\n  The second point I indicated I was going to make is on the Strategic \nPetroleum Reserve. This chart shows what the Strategic Petroleum \nReserve looks like. These are holes in the ground, and we shove oil \ndown those holes. We save it for a rainy day; it's 97 percent filled at \nthis point. We are putting just under 70,000 barrels a day every day \nunderground right now.\n  Sixty-seven Members of the Senate as of today have expressed \nthemselves publicly. They think it is the wrong thing to do. They think \nthis administration is making a mistake and they ought to stop it. Now, \nwhy do people say that? Because they know if we stop taking that 70,000 \nbarrels of sweet light crude and sticking it underground, it will be \npart of the inventory out there, and they know that would put downward \npressure on gas prices and downward pressure on oil prices. That is why \n67 people have come to this conclusion.\n  The question is: What do we do to try to stop this? Well, when you \nput oil underground, you drive up to the gas station, you see the \neffects of this kind of policy. The question is: What do we do to put \nsome downward pressure on prices? Stop filling the Strategic Petroleum \nReserve and stop it now.\n  There is a bill on the floor of the Senate, the FAA reauthorization \nbill. I am part of the committee that has produced this bill. We need \nto modernize the system for aviation in this country. It is desperately \nin need of modernization. It is going to cost some money to do that, \nbut we do not have much choice. We have had, I think, four airlines \ndeclare bankruptcy in the last month and a half.\n  A substantial part of it, announced by every one of those airlines, \nhad to do with the price of jet fuel.\n  I am going to offer, as an amendment on this bill, legislation that \nwould call a halt to filling the Strategic Reserve. To stop taking oil \nand sticking it underground, and put some downward pressure on jet fuel \nprices, downward pressure on gasoline prices. Some say this doesn't fit \non this bill. It does. Fuel prices are why three or four airlines have \ngone bankrupt in the last month and a half.\n  I will be over here tomorrow speaking about this topic because I \nbelieve strongly that we should do something about this issue.\n  My colleague Senator Byrd used to talk about Aesop's fly. He \ndescribed the fable Aesop's fly who was sitting on the axle of a \nchariot who would observe: My, what dust I do raise. There are some \nhere in the Congress who have that notion, that if you just make a \nlittle bit of noise and have a little bit of activity, you can claim a \nlot of success. The fact is, that is not what the American people want \nthis time. They want this Congress to understand the urgency, \nunderstand the problem, understand what it is doing to this country's \nfamilies, and do something about it. When you have speculation that \nruns out of control, this Congress has a responsibility to do \nsomething. We can't have someone else do it, we can't wait for somebody \nelse. It won't get done. If we don't do it, it won't happen.\n  These are two steps I believe we ought to take: No. 1, increase the \nmargin requirement and stop the speculation in the futures market to \nbegin to put downward pressure on prices; No. 2, stop putting oil \nunderground when prices are at a record high and put downward pressure \non prices. If we did both of those things, I am convinced we would \nbring oil and gas prices back down and we would provide some relief to \nthe American driver and to the American economy.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I come to the floor this evening to talk about the \nenergy crisis, the price of oil, and how consumers are seeing the \nimpacts of high oil prices in their everyday lives. The high price of \noil is impacting businesses and many consumers can't afford to take \nfamily vacations and trips, dragging down our economy over all, and \ndragging us further into an economic downturn.\n  What I have heard today on the Senate floor from many of my \ncolleagues is accusations and claims about what is going on and what \nmight have transpired on various issues that might have caused the high \nprice of gasoline and certainly the price of crude oil, which is now \nwell over $100 a barrel. I think it is important to think about what \nCongress has already done and to make sure we are telling consumers \nwhat needs to be accomplished to solve the problem.\n  What we are hearing from analysts on Wall Street is that this issue \nis going to continue to exacerbate, and that oil prices will continue \nto rise. When we think about oil futures all the way out to 2015, still \nbeing over $100 a barrel, and oil futures impacting the physical price, \nit raises a lot of concerns about how the economy can sustain such a \nhigh price of fuel.\n  Let's start with some basics about supply and demand because many of \nmy colleagues on the other side of the aisle have talked about the fact \nthat they think oil supply hasn't been there, that growth in the \nnumbers of people in India, China, other countries, is exacerbating the \nproblem.\n  While we have seen growth in demand from other countries, this \nchart--starting in 1980, going all the way to 2006, and showing some \nnumbers until 2008; the orange line is demand, and the yellow line is \nsupply--except for some anomalies here, shows that supply and demand \nhave kept pace. So anybody who wants to say this is all about supply \nand demand hasn't looked at a chart such as this showing that these \nlines pretty much track each other. What it tells us is that we have to \nlook at other fundamental things that are happening in the marketplace \nand not just make accusations about what is going on.\n  In fact, if you want to look at the high price of gasoline, you can't \nsay it is just an increase in demand. During the summer season, motor \ngasoline consumption in the United States is actually projected to \ndecline by four-tenths of a percent, and it is projected to decline by \nthree-tenths for the whole year. We are actually seeing a decline in \ndemand. Obviously, that is not a surprise. Given the high price of \nfuel, people are not able to afford to continue their normal habits. \nBut the issue isn't that the price is being driven up simply because \nthere is this increase in demand. The high price of gasoline also isn't \nabout the fact that there are low inventories. Some people have wanted \nto say this issue is about low inventories. When you look at what the \nindustry says, here is an oil analyst who basically says that gasoline \ninventories are higher than the historical average at this time of the \nyear. So there is really no need to worry about tight supply. Here is \nan oil analyst saying that.\n  It points, again, to other questions about what is going on. Some \npeople have said: Let's blame it on renewables. Many Democrats have \nbeen big supporters of renewable energy, big supporters of getting \nalternatives into the marketplace, because we believe if you get \nalternative fuel into the marketplace, it will lower the demand on \nnormal fossil fuel and create some competitive advantages. I know there \nare some people--a Governor--basically saying: You ought to repeal the \nwhole RFS. You ought to get rid of this issue as it relates to having a \nrenewable fuels standard. Here is the Wall Street Journal report from \nMerrill Lynch saying that without biofuels, the price would be even \nhigher, and that basically oil and gasoline prices would be 15 percent \nhigher if biofuels weren't helping to increase the output. So it is \nwrong to say that somehow our focus on renewable fuels has exacerbated \nthe situation when, in fact, it has done nothing but help the \nsituation. In fact, I love that this Texas AM study basically \nfound that ethanol has increased in excess of what our renewable fuels \nstandard was, indicating that relaxing the standard would not cause a \ncontraction in the industry, nor would it cause a reduction in the \nprice of corn.\n\n  The issue today is where do we go for solutions. Part of the issue is \nthat many of my colleagues are saying it is all about more supply of \nfossil fuel for the United States. We have had this debate so many \ntimes in the Senate. We\n\n[[Page S3491]]\n\nhave had a debate about whether the United States, with 3 percent of \nthe world's oil reserve, really is going to make a dent in increasing \nsupply and giving consumers a chance to get off fossil fuels. We are \ngoing to have a big debate about global warming and its impact and \nwhether we should even keep our focus on fossil fuel or accelerate \ngetting off of it.\n  Many times today, even down at the Rose Garden, we hear the word \n``ANWR'' again, and how ANWR was the secret recipe for lowering gas \nprices in America. I obviously don't support opening up drilling in the \nArctic Wildlife Refuge because it is a wildlife refuge. But I certainly \ndon't support it when even our own Energy Information Administration \nhas said that drilling in the Arctic Wildlife Refuge would only reduce \ngasoline prices by a penny per gallon and only 20 years after we got to \npeak production. So at a penny per gallon, if people use 400 to 500 \ngallons of fuel, we are talking about a few dollars of savings there \nover many, many months. So the notion that ANWR would be some way of \nsolving our problems just isn't true.\n  I know a lot of people have talked about refinery capacity, and I \nthink you need to talk to the oil companies about refinery capacity and \nwhy they have not expanded. I know my colleague Senator Boxer has been \nout here many times talking about how she had to stop consolidation in \nher State because they didn't want to keep a refinery open. But I know \nthis: We know it is not environmental regulation. In fact, according to \nthis CEO of an oil company:\n\n       We are not aware of any environmental regulations that \n     would prevent us from expanding our refinery capacity or \n     siting a new refinery.\n\n  So we know it is not about environmental regulations. That is not \nwhat is stopping them either.\n  Some people have said: Don't take the tax incentives away from the \noil industry; don't do that because somehow that is what is keeping the \nindustry afloat. The industry is making record profits. They are making \nso much profit they don't even know what to do with the profit. They \nare buying back their own stock.\n  We know this: We know the President of the United States, George W. \nBush, said:\n\n       With $55 oil, we don't need incentives for oil and gas \n     companies to explore.\n\n  It is way above $55 a barrel. So I take him at his word that we don't \nneed incentives to continue to explore at that level.\n  Let's talk about what is the issue. Let's talk about what is the \nproblem we need to solve, for which we need to be responsible to \nconsumers, to businesses, to the economy, and to make sure we continue \nto deal with this threatening crisis.\n  I know one oil analyst who looked at these markets. And maybe the man \non the street, if you ask him, he thinks something is going on in the \noil market. He doesn't think it is about supply and demand. He didn't \nhappen to see that first chart I put up, but he knows something is \ngoing on because he sees the irregularity of prices. But this analyst \nsaid: Unless the U.S. Government steps in to rein in speculators' power \nin the market, prices will just keep going up. Basically he is saying \nthat speculators have too much power in the market right now, and \nunless the Government does its job, the prices are going to keep going \nup. So it is time for us to act. It is time for us to get smart about \nthis.\n\n  It reminds me of the debate we had when the Enron crisis hit the \nelectricity markets. It probably took well into 2001, when many people \nsaid: Do you know what, this is all about environmental regulation, or, \nthis is about not enough refineries, and it is about the fact that \nthere is a supply shortage. They came up with all these things.\n  So as 2002 rolled around and as more and more investigation was done, \nwe found out that, no, it was actually manipulative schemes by various \nindividuals within a very large organization--actually several \norganizations--that purposely manipulated the electricity markets. They \ndid this so they could short supply and drive up the price.\n  Now, Congress acted in 2005. We said--after we found out all the \nfacts, we heard all the terms: Death Star, Get Shorty, all the various \nschemes that had been manipulated--we kept thinking: How could this \nhappen when we had a Federal Power Act that said, on the wholesale rate \nof electricity and natural gas, you have to have just and reasonable \npricing. We thought that is a clear enough message for people. But, in \nfact, it was not. It was not a clear enough message. It cost my State \nbillions. It cost California's economy billions. So what did we do? \nCongress made it illegal to use manipulative devices or contrivances in \nthe electricity or natural gas physical markets, and we greatly \nincreased the penalties for market transparency violations.\n  Now, why did we go to the extent of doing this? We could not believe \nthat such activities were in some way a gray area and that somehow \npeople were still confused post-Enron that this kind of activity was \nOK. Some people said: Well, you already have the electricity and \nnatural gas markets under the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. \nWhat else do you need?\n  But I was very proud that Congress passed this legislation. Since \nthat law has been on the books, since 2005, the Federal Energy \nRegulatory Commission, as it relates to electricity and natural gas \nmarkets, has been aggressive about pursuing this power and using it.\n  What have been the results? Well, the result has been making market \nmanipulation illegal when it comes to oil and natural gas, so that they \nhave had 64 investigations, 14 settlements, $48 million in civil \npenalties, two ongoing market manipulation cases that could net over \n$450 million in civil penalties, and a dramatic increase in self-\nreporting and self-policing. It is like one of my staffers said: If you \nwant people to straighten up, let them know there is going to be a cop \non the beat. Let them know there is going to be someone investigating \nthese activities and we are not going to tolerate it, and people will \nstart obeying the law. So we did that.\n  In 2007, we decided that if this kind of pervasive activity was still \ncontinuing in the natural gas and electricity markets--if that was \nstill happening--maybe there was some correlation here with what was \nhappening in the oil markets, because clearly, after looking at all \nthose charts we just went through about supply and demand, and \neverything else, we could not understand what was happening. We have \nhad oil company executives tell us that the price of oil today should \nbe at somewhere between $50 and $60 a barrel given where supply and \ndemand is. Oil company executives are throwing up their arms saying: We \ndon't know why the price of oil is well over $100 a barrel. So we, in \nthe Energy bill in 2007, passed a law saying it is time to make the \nsame laws we have for natural gas and electricity apply to oil markets. \nWe said that any person who uses, directly or indirectly, ``any \nmanipulative or deceptive device or contrivance'' in connection with \nthe wholesale purchase of crude oil or petroleum distillates--that that \nwas illegal and that Congress made violations subject to penalties of \nup to $1 million a day. That is $1 million a day because we believe, if \nyou are doing these kinds of activities, every day that you have \nengaged in those activities you should pay a fine for that.\n  Now, where are we today with this authority? Because some people say: \nWell, you passed a law. Is it working? This law does not really go into \neffect until the Federal Trade Commission adopts rules and puts them \ninto action. That is what we are waiting for now. My colleagues on the \nCommerce Committee have urged the FTC to hurry about this task, that it \nis so important to our economy and to consumers to hurry about this \ntask. I know Senator Reid has encouraged them, Speaker Pelosi has \nencouraged them. So we are in the process now of hoping that the FTC \nwill implement this rule and give proper notice but start the process \nbecause once the marketplace knows--just as they did in natural gas and \nelectricity--that these kinds of activities will not be tolerated, we \nmight be able to make a dent in what is happening with this excessive \nspeculation in the energy markets.\n  Well, let's look at what exactly the market manipulation behavior is \nthat we are concerned about. We basically have said we are interested \nin whether companies have manipulated the supply, whether they have \ngiven false reporting, whether they have cornered\n\n[[Page S3492]]\n\nthe market, and whether they have engaged in any kind of rogue trading. \nThose are the things we are concerned about.\n  Well, let's talk about supply manipulation for a second because that \nis something for which people might say: Well, it is just about supply \nand demand, and how do you pass a law about supply and supply \nmanipulation? Believe it or not, there are good Federal statutes on the \nbooks starting with a lot of case law and a lot of history. What we are \nsaying is, we do not want any artificial influencing of supply in the \nenergy markets. We do not want someone creating something that is not a \nnormal part of business but is artificially used to create a shortage--\nfor example, diverting or exporting marginal supply in tight markets. \nThat is, we know the market is tight on oil. You can go back to that \nchart on supply and demand. They pretty much track very closely. So it \nis a tight market. When you have an event like Katrina, it is even \ntighter.\n\n  Our question is, Did somebody export supply outside the country just \nto create a shortage in the United States and drive up the price? Have \nwe had hedge funds holding crude oil ships off the coast just so the \nprice will go up for a few more days?\n  That is the second point: holding supply deliveries temporarily to \nboost prices. We have people now who are major players in the oil \nmarket who really are not the end users of crude oil supply. They are \njust big financial movers in the marketplace. They are not taking the \ndelivery of oil because they are out there delivering it to various \njobbers or what have you. They are there for a financial investment.\n  In fact, we want to know if some of these inventory management \nstrategies that have basically reduced physical supply--and basically \neverybody just trades their reserves on paper, and everybody just \ntrades the paper around, where that, in fact, does not have much \ntransparency to it. So we do not know how much that creates that \nmanagement system in and of itself. Where we used to have 30 days of \ncrude oil supply, thereby, the market was not so tight. Now we have \nthis paper inventory system. We do not know what that really means. We \ndo not know how much supply is really in reserve. Is that being used to \nmanipulate supply?\n  Then, obviously, what we saw--I just think back to the Enron days \nwhen people said: Oh, no, no one would ever shut down a powerplant just \nto short supply. They would never do something like that. It must all \nbe about the fact that really something was wrong. Well, we found out \nthat there were purposeful shutdowns of various powerplants to short \nthe market and to drive up the price. So we want to know if there are \nunnecessary and untimely ``maintenance'' shutdowns just to impact \nsupply in the marketplace of oil.\n  We also want to know whether there is false reporting because false \nreporting can lead to misleading or inaccurate statements that also can \nhinder the marketplace.\n  Part of this legislation we passed in this bill is to say, in 2007, \nthat if you gave false information, that was also subject to civil \npenalties of up to $1 million a day because part of this--the same in \nthe Enron case--is it was very hard to understand these schemes. If it \nwas not for videotapes that were put together, we would have never \nknown exactly how these schemes would have worked just by looking at \nthe books. So we want the Government to look at some of this \ninformation and if there are manipulative schemes. But if they provide \nfalse information, we believe that also should be a penalty.\n  Now, we know that in one case of natural gas--El Paso Merchant \nEnergy--they reported nonexistent trades to reporting firms while at \nthe same time failing to maintain certain records. They basically \ncreated false information about the trades that were going on. The \nresult was six traders were convicted for false reporting and \nattempting to manipulate the energy market.\n  Now, the reason why this is so important to the subject we are \ndebating today is that manipulation has happened in natural gas, and \nwhy this is so important now is because in the oil markets, and \nparticularly in the oil futures market, we do not even have the same \ntransparency in reporting requirements that we do with other \ncommodities like natural gas. We have given them an exemption in the \nEnron loophole that was done in 2000 as part of the Commodity Exchange \nAct, so they do not have those reporting requirements. So we cannot \neven go and get some of this information to know that something like \nwhat was happening with El Paso Energy is transpiring in the oil \nmarkets, as it did in the natural gas markets.\n  So it is one of the reasons why we want to close the Enron loophole \nand to say that the trading of energy futures, which definitely impacts \nthe price of oil today--and we will get to that on another day out here \non the floor, about how the energy futures price impacts oil today, we \nwill get to that, but for today we just know that if you do not have \nreporting, then there is no way--whether it is the SEC or the CFTC or \nFERC or the FTC--no one has any ability to get access to the \ninformation.\n  We also know that we want cornering the market to be illegal. \nCornering the market would be exploiting the market power through \nexcessive mergers like natural monopolies or blocking new entrants to \nbasically corner the marketplace. We know this is something about which \nwe have a great deal of concern. We know British Petroleum attempted to \ndo this. Basically, they purchased excess propane in Texas, within the \npipelines, to hold it from the market and then sell it high. We know \nthey did that in trying to corner the market. The end result was that \nthe Department of Justice and the CFTC ended up with a settlement case \nagainst them in the number of $303 million. So we know these things are \nhappening in other energy markets, and we know they are a problem in \nthe--potentially a problem--in the oil markets today.\n  We also know rogue trading is potentially a problem as well.\n  Mr. President, I am not going to take much more time on this issue as \nit relates to the high price of gasoline. I plan to continue to come \nout to the floor to talk about this issue about the need for the CFTC \nto promulgate this rule and get on about investigating the oil markets \nand to make sure consumers are protected.\n  I talked about what I think the rule needs to do. It needs to \nprohibit the manipulation of supply and to have a strong statute and \npenalty for falsifying information. It has to have a prohibition on \ncornering the market.\n  I believe that rogue trading is something else we are seeing in the \nmarketplace. We need to have a prohibition on that. People might ask: \nWhat is that? It is employing manipulative trading schemes such as \nbuying or selling large volumes of stock or futures contracts with the \nintention of influencing prices.\n  You can imagine, if somebody has a large position in one of these \nenergy supplies or stocks, that basically ends up impacting the \nmarketplace. We actually found this with the Amaranth case, in the area \nof natural gas. Amaranth sold large volumes of what is called next \nmonth natural gas delivery in the last 30 minutes of the market. What \nthey did is basically crashed the close of the market. By selling large \namounts of futures contracts for delivery of natural gas at the close \nof the market they manipulated the price and benefitted their large \npositions in other financial derivatives, and that ended up impacting \nthe physical price of natural gas. The good news is the FERC, because \nof the 2005 law we passed, was on the beat, doing its job. \nUnfortunately, consumers paid something akin to $9 billion in increased \nnatural gas costs before the FERC could get this situation under \ncontrol. Now they are in the enforcement phase of a $291 million civil \npenalty against Amaranth. We know these situations are happening with \nrogue trading.\n  We know of another case that is similar to rogue trading and price \nmanipulation, where Marathon Oil allegedly attempted to sell oil \ndelivery contracts below the market prices in order to basically lower \nthe market price, benefitting them as a net purchaser of foreign crude \noil. So there ended up being an investigation by the CFTC, and today \nthey are in a $1 million settlement with the CFTC on that issue.\n  All these issues, I believe, need to be investigated in the oil \nmarkets. They need to have a strong statute passed by the CFTC, similar \nto in 2005 for electricity and natural gas, where we can\n\n[[Page S3493]]\n\nsee the results of the investigation, we can see that a Federal agency \nis doing its job; we need to do the same thing with the oil market.\n  In fact, there are five things I think we need to do that would help \nprotect consumers from high prices of gasoline. Our economy and \nconsumers cannot afford much more.\n  We need to close the Enron loophole, in which that 2000 law said that \nonline trading promulgated by Enron, they said, they don't have the \nsame transparency, don't have to open their books or allow people to \nsee what they are doing. We know for other commodities the Securities \nand Exchange Commission and CFTC look at those things to make sure \nthere is not a manipulation in the marketplace. We cannot even get \nthese because we gave them an exemption. That needs to be repealed. We \nneed to require oversight of all oil futures markets. That is, as I \nsaid, the oil futures price affects the physical price of oil. If \npeople are going to buy oil futures well into 2015 at over $100 a \nbarrel, it is going to impact the physical price of oil today. If you \ncan buy oil at over $116 in the oil futures, it is hard to believe that \noil is going to drop much below that in the physical market. But these \nare markets--unlike, again, our commodities in the United States, on \nNYMEX or the mercantile exchange, such as corn or soybean futures, this \nis an exchange the United States doesn't have any regulatory impact on. \nWe don't have the ability to look at those books, any enforcement \nmechanisms. We don't have the ability to protect consumers on that kind \nof speculation if there is manipulative activity going on.\n  As I said, we need to get the CFTC to finish their work. This is so \nimportant that I think the Department of Justice should coordinate all \nthese agencies because there are futures activities, there is a \nphysical market, and there is the falsification of information. What \nhappened with Enron is the Department of Justice created a task force, \ncalled the Enron Task Force. It coordinated these agencies and got to \nthe bottom of what was happening with the electricity markets and the \nmanipulation. I think the Department of Justice should create an Oil \nMarket Fraud Task Force to do the same thing.\n  Lastly, I know my colleagues will talk about this on the floor--to \nmake price gouging a Federal crime. There are 28 States in our country \nthat have the ability, in an emergency, to make a declaration in the \nevent of a natural disaster, or huge anomalies in the market, and help \nstabilize the situation with executive power. I am willing to give that \nsame executive power to the President of the United States. I hope he \nwould use it.\n  In conclusion, there is a lack of transparency in energy trading \nmarkets. We need to fix that. This is one of the CFTC Commissioners who \nsaid:\n\n       I am generally concerned about a lack of transparency and \n     the need for greater oversight and enforcement of the \n     derivatives industry.\n\n  He is basically talking about this offshore exchange, where we don't \nhave the same kind of oversight that we do. In fact, I said earlier \nthat we have more regulation of hamburger and the future of beef than \nwe have of oil. I will tell you that oil is critically important to our \neconomy, and it needs to have the same kind of transparency and \noversight as other futures commodities.\n  Last, I will reiterate that even on Wall Street, even the analysts \nwho know what is going on in the marketplace, who know these prices are \noutrageous, not based on supply and demand, are saying:\n\n       Unless the U.S. Government steps in to rein in speculators' \n     power in the market, prices will just keep going up.\n\n  An energy analyst said that this month.\n  It is clear the marketplace even thinks there is too much speculative \npower, and the answer is for us to do our jobs--for the FTC to do their \njob, to get the help of DOJ, and for us to make sure we are doing our \njob on oversight in giving consumers protection. But I think there are \nvery few people in America who do not think these prices are out of \ncontrol, that it is not normal market forces, it is not normal supply \nand demand, and if it keeps careening out of control, it is going to \nwreck our economy. It is certainly wrecking consumers' pocketbooks \nright now.\n  I hope we will take action. I hope the Federal agencies will get on \ntheir feet and be aggressive about protecting consumers on this \nimportant issue. I know we will continue to talk about this on the \nfloor as we continue to pass legislation that does protect America from \nthese out-of-control gasoline prices.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, Senator Coburn has agreed to come to the \nfloor. I have a couple unanimous consent requests. He wanted to be \npresent when I made these.\n\n\n                   Unanimous Consent Requests--S. 579\n\n  Mr. President, every year, hundreds of thousands of women in America \nare diagnosed with breast cancer. Breast cancer will strike \napproximately one in eight American women in their lifetime, with a new \ncase diagnosed every 2 minutes in America. This year alone, it is \nestimated that 250,000 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer, and \n40,000 of them will die.\n  We have made remarkable progress in breast cancer diagnosis and \ntreatment, but we still do not know the cause of breast cancer. There \nare theories but no one really knows. Scientists have identified some \nrisk factors. Those factors help explain fewer than 30 percent of the \ncases.\n  This legislation that I am going to ask unanimous consent for in just \na few minutes, the Breast Cancer and Environmental Research Act, would \nestablish a national strategy to study the possible links between \nbreast cancer and the environment and would authorize funding for such \nresearch.\n  Eminent scientists believe the breast cancer that is being found, \ndiscovered in America, very likely is the result of something in the \nenvironment. Resulting discoveries could be critical to improving our \nknowledge of this complex illness which could lead to better prevention \nand treatment and even perhaps one day a cure.\n  Although we first introduced this legislation in 2000, and despite \nstrong bipartisan support--right now we have 68 Senators supporting \nthis legislation and are cosponsors of it, Democrats and Republicans--\nCongress has yet to act and send this bill to President Bush. Last \nsession, the bill was reported out of the HELP Committee, but one of \nour colleagues prevented final Senate passage. This session we have \nworked in good faith to address any concerns that have been raised \nabout this legislation. As a result, this act was once again reported \nout of the HELP Committee, and as I have indicated, it is sponsored by \n68 Senators.\n  It is long past time for the Senate to take up and pass this broadly \nsupported bipartisan legislation. Too many women and their families \nhave waited too long for Congress to act. I tried recently, last week, \nto pass this legislation by unanimous consent, but one Senator objected \nto my request. In response to that objection, I then offered a time \nagreement that would allow for 2 hours of debate on this bill with two \namendments on each side. I think this is a fair offer for legislation \nthat over two-thirds of this body have cosponsored. This offer was \nrejected.\n  I urge that we have this matter move forward. I urge my colleague to \nreconsider this offer and end the opposition to this matter--opposition \nto even debating this legislation which enjoys such broad bipartisan \nsupport. It is time to offer more than words of encouragement to those \naffected by breast cancer. Our wives, mothers, sisters, daughters, and \nfriends have waited long enough.\n  I therefore ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nimmediate consideration of Calendar No. 628, S. 579, the Breast Cancer \nand Environmental Research Act; that the committee-reported substitute \nbe agreed to; the bill, as amended, be read three times and passed, and \na motion to reconsider be laid upon the table; and that any statements \nbe printed at the appropriate place in the Record as if given with no \nintervening action or debate.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n\n[[Page S3494]]\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I will not take the time now to go into \ndetail. I will wait until the Senator from Washington finishes her \nspeech.\n  I will say I have a personal involvement with this issue. My sister \nhas breast cancer. My sister-in-law has breast cancer. My most \ncherished person in the world besides my wife and children and \ngrandchildren died of breast cancer. She was a breast cancer nurse \nspecialist. I understand the disease. We spend more on breast cancer \nresearch than any other cancer in this country today. We spend $100 \nmillion on environmental causes related to breast cancer research.\n  I don't object to us spending money on breast cancer research. I \nobject to us making the decisions about what the scientists know we \nshould do versus what the politicians want us to do. So I will spend \nsome time after the Senator from Washington State speaks outlining in \ndetail my opposition to putting one cancer ahead of the other 70, No. \n1; and one disease that--specifically, we are going to put one specific \ndisease and one ideology of a specific disease ahead of all of the \nothers, and I will outline that in detail.\n  On the basis of that, I will object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I understand the objection, but I would hope \neveryone within the sound of my voice understands the lack of logic to \nthe statement just made by my friend, the Senator from the State of \nOklahoma. If he has problems with this legislation, why would he \nprevent the whole Senate from taking it up? Why wouldn't he come to the \nfloor as legislators are supposed to do rather than some guerilla \nattack and not allowing this to come up, recognizing if I bring this to \nthe floor, it takes time.\n  Now, I don't understand why, if he has all of these great ideas as to \nwhat should or shouldn't be done. Let's bring this to the floor, offer \nan amendment, offer two amendments. Why stop this matter from being \nlegislated?\n  So I understand. I can't wave a medical degree, but I can wave the \nfact that this legislation is important to many people in America \ntoday, and this legislation gives them hope that something can be done \nto find a cause and hopefully a cure. If my friend is so certain of his \nposition, he should be able to offer an amendment and prevail in that \nregard.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nconsideration of Calendar No. 628, S. 527, the Breast Cancer Research \nAct that was just spoken about, at a time to be determined by me \nfollowing consultation with the Republican leader, and that the bill be \nconsidered under the following limitations: that other than the \ncommittee-reported substitute, the only first-degree amendments be four \namendments--two for each leader--that are relevant to the provisions of \nthe underlying bill and substitute; that there be a time limit of 1 \nhour for general debate on the bill and 1 hour on each amendment; with \nall time equally divided and controlled between the leaders or their \ndesignees; that upon the disposition of all amendments, the use or \nyielding back of all time, the substitute, as amended, if amended, be \nagreed to; the bill, as amended, be read a third time with no \nintervening action or debate; and the Senate proceed to a vote on \npassage of the bill, as amended.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. I would like to ask the majority leader a question. Are \nyou aware of the thousands of studies that have already been \npublished--\n  Mr. REID. Of the what?\n  Mr. COBURN. Are you aware of the thousands of studies that have \nalready been written on this subject?\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, I am not aware of the thousands of \nstudies. I am aware of the need to move forward with this legislation. \nI would say to my friend, if, in fact, there are thousands--and I don't \nin any way doubt the word of my friend--then why should that be a basis \nfor stopping us to legislate on this issue?\n  We have 68 Senators who believe this legislation is important. If \nyou, the Senator from Oklahoma, have a cause that this legislation is \nill-founded, people are--I have changed my position on legislation \nbefore, and I can't understand why you would stand in the way of \nallowing this legislation to be legislated. That is what we do here. We \nare legislators.\n  So, no, I am not familiar with the thousands of studies.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I appreciate the majority leader's \nresponse to my question. The reason is because the policy is wrong. We \npassed the NIH Reform Act just to eliminate this sort of issue because \nwhat we know is, out of the 2,037 diseases, we don't know which one to \nfund properly. We don't know which one to spend the most money on, but \npeer-reviewed science does. So what we have decided is, because we have \na very effective lobbying group on this because it does impact hundreds \nof thousands of women, we are going to step right back in the middle of \nthe NIH reform and say we didn't need it.\n  So the policy of us directing spending on research when we don't have \nthe knowledge base to know that is the right thing to do--and the \nresearchers agree with this, that we don't have the knowledge--in the \ncontext of all of the other 2,037 diseases, I will object to moving \nforward on this because the policy is wrong. It is not about debating \nit. I am happy to debate it all you want. But the policy is wrong.\n  Who says that the women who died of breast cancer this year are more \nimportant than the same number of people who died from lung cancer that \nis not related to smoking? Are we going to say that? Should we tell the \nNIH everything they should do, every amount of money, every disease we \nshould decide, based on the effective lobbying of people who are \nabsolutely affected--there is no question about that--but should we \nmake that decision? The answer is no, we shouldn't. We should let the \nexperts, not the Senators, not the Representatives, but the scientific \nexperts make those decisions. We have given that charge to the NIH. \nThat is what we ought to do. They would more sooner come to a cure and \nsolve the problem than with us micromanaging the NIH.\n  With that, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I first got interested in diseases of women \na number of years ago when in my Las Vegas office three women came to \nsee me. They didn't want to be there. They were embarrassed for being \nthere. They had a condition. It is called interstitial fasciitis. I had \nnever heard the words before, and it is still hard for me to say these \nwords after all of these years. But I looked into this. The NIH and the \nscientific community and the country thought this was a psychosomatic \ndisease; that this was something these women had in their head; that \neven though each of them described the pain the same--like slivers of \nglass being shoved up and down their bladder--it was all in their head.\n  I had the good fortune of having a woman, who is an orthopedic \nsurgeon, who had this same condition, and she said: This is not in my \nhead, it is in my bladder, and something should be done to study this. \nWe have begged the NIH to do it. We have had others that we have asked \nto do it, and they are not doing anything: You, Senator Reid, should \nhave something done about this.\n  And we did this. We established a registry. We did that by \nlegislation. As a result of that, now almost 50 percent of the people \nwho have that disease have medicine to take that takes away their \nsymptoms, the pain. It is pretty good.\n  Have we cured the disease? No, we haven't. But progress has been made \nbecause, as policymakers, that is what we do. We set policy. The NIH is \na body of this legislature, this Congress, and we have an obligation \nand a right to direct them to do things. Now, they do good work. They \ndo very good work. But there are other things that we think they should \nbe doing.\n  Who cares about this, my friend asks? Well, who is lobbying for this, \nhe asks? Two hundred and fifty thousand women who are going to get the \ndisease this year are the lobbyists. They don't come here, all of them, \nand 40,000 to 250,000 are going to die. Now, is every penny of this \nmoney that we want to appropriate going to hit the mark and do the \nright thing? Maybe not, but it is going to lead to some discoveries \nthat\n\n[[Page S3495]]\n\nwill help this disease and probably other diseases.\n  So I say, I am disappointed and we are going to continue to work this \nissue. This issue is not going to go away. It is not only this Senator \nbut 67 other Senators and others who will support this when and if we \nget this to the floor. So I appreciate the courtesy of my friend from \nOklahoma. He is a gentleman. I disagree with him on occasion, but I \nappreciate his statement.\n\n\n                  Unanimous Consent Request--H.R. 5613\n\n  Mr. REID. We have more than 50 million low-income people--about 1 out \nof 6 Americans--depend on Medicaid for their health care. These are the \npoorest of the poor.\n  This administration has issued a series of regulations that will \nundermine the Medicaid safety net and create barriers for accessing \ncare for the poorest of the poor.\n  These regulations, touted by the administration as ``savings,'' would \nnot lower health care costs.\n  Instead States--already facing tough economic times, strained \nbudgets, and increased demand for services such as Medicaid--will \neither have to raise revenues elsewhere or be forced to cut services to \nour Nation's most vulnerable at a time when they need help the most.\n  Each regulation has different impact on individuals, providers, \ncommunities, and States. They include, among other things, detrimental \nprovisions, such as limiting services for people with disabilities; \npreventing children from receiving health care during the schoolday; \ncutting payments to public hospitals and other safety net providers for \nsuch undertakings as emergency rooms, burn units, and trauma centers.\n  The administration claims these regulations are necessary to fight \nfraud and waste in the Medicaid Program. But in a recent hearing on the \nMedicaid Program, the General Accounting Office testified it did not \nrecommend the administration's proposed changes. They would not help.\n  We are committed to ferreting out any fraud that may exist in the \nMedicaid Program. But regulations that harm our most vulnerable and \nplace greater burden on fiscally strapped States are clearly not the \nway to accomplish this end.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nconsideration of Calendar No. 719, H.R. 5613--which, I might add, \npassed the House by a huge vote--a bill to protect the Medicaid safety \nnet; that the bill be read the third time and passed and the motion to \nreconsider be laid on the table, with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, there is $38 billion worth of fraud in \nMedicaid. We are on an unsustainable course as a nation. We have $74 \ntrillion worth of unfunded liabilities. When we talk about controlling \nspending and earmarks, we always hear it is a mandatory program.\n  Finally, not all of what the administration has done do I absolutely \nagree with but on key points I do. These rules will make a difference. \nIf we are interested in fraud, let's write the regulations to get out \nthe fraud. That hasn't been the offer. All we are willing to do as a \nbody is say to the administration you have ideas that will get rid of \n$42 billion worth of fraud over 5 years, but we don't like it because \nwe are feeling pressure from the State Medicaid directors, when we know \nStates game Medicaid. A great example: There is nothing in this to stop \nany Medicaid Program from taking a child from school to the doctor, but \nit does stop the 500-some-odd million dollars being spent on \ntransporting schoolchildren back and forth to school who don't have a \nmedical appointment. So what we have is a system that has been gamed. \nWe have allowed it.\n  Now the administration put something forward which we don't like and \nwhich we ought to negotiate with them to change, rather than saying you \nare not going to do any of it. The fact is the unfunded liabilities \nassociated with the Medicaid Program are about $12 trillion. We are \ngoing to do something--just forget it.\n  I applaud the administration for making an effort to try to fix some \nof this. But to say you cannot do any of it, when some of it is very \nbadly needed, is wrong. So unfortunately, Mr. Leader, I have to object \nagain.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, as I indicated in the last piece of \nlegislation we tried to move forward on, would my friend allow us to \nbring it to the floor and debate the issue and offer amendments to it?\n  Mr. COBURN. I am objecting not solely for myself. I am happy to work \non trying to put together a proposal with the administration that would \nmake a difference and then bring it to the floor.\n  Mr. REID. How long do you think that would take?\n  Mr. COBURN. Two weeks.\n  Mr. REID. I appreciate that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington State is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. May I inquire how much longer the Senator is going to be?\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Three or four minutes.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nrecognized following the Senator from Washington.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I say to the majority leader, I \nappreciate what he said on behalf of women. Washington State has one of \nthe highest rates of breast cancer in the Nation. We have a very good \ndetection program and good survival rates. We don't know the cause of \nit, but we know it is very important to continue the research.\n  I know that in 1992, the so-called year of the woman, when we had one \nof the largest classes of women elected to the Congress, we saw an \nincrease in women's health research. Why? Because women were in the \nCongress to say it was important to us to not have the research \ndirected in a way that favored some of the particular programs that \nwere about men's health.\n  So I thank my colleague. The majority leader is right to say we have \nto respond to our constituents who are concerned about this issue and \nwant to give attention to it. Clearly, women's health research hasn't \ngotten all the attention it deserves in the past.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. Does the Senator acknowledge that with diseases such as \ninterstitial fasciitis, more than 90 percent of the people who have \nthat disease are women? Women-related diseases have not gotten the \nattention they deserve, and one reason is because the legislature has \nbeen dominated by men.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. That is what we found in the 1990s, in that we didn't \nhave enough representation to ask the hard questions, to say our \nconstituents were not being heard on this issue and to raise this in \nvarious committees. Frankly, that was the time period when, for the \nfirst time, we had a woman on every committee in the House of \nRepresentatives. Once we got women on every committee, we asked the \nhard questions and increased the percentage of women's health research.\n  I think it is a very poignant point to the fact that, while NIH does \ngood work, we have to respond to our constituency and, certainly, there \ncan be discrepancies and issues that the larger public should have a \nsay in as to health research.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n\n                            Cancer Research\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I wish to spend a few minutes answering \nthe question as to why would one Senator, in the light of all the other \nSenators who have cosponsored this bill, stand and block a bill that 60 \nsome Senators want to see passed? I think it is a great time for us to \ndefine what is wrong in our country today.\n  What is wrong is we think about the next election far off and more \noften than we think about the next generation. I want us to cure breast \ncancer as badly as anybody else. The point Senator Reid did not tell \nyou is we are already spending $100 million on this very subject, the \nenvironmental connection to breast cancer. We are also spending more on \nbreast cancer research than we are any other cancer, and yet it is not \nthe leading cause of death.\n  We are going to have 160,000 people die this year from lung cancer, \nthe\n\n[[Page S3496]]\n\nsame number who are going to die from breast cancer, 40,000 of which \nhave no relationship to smoking, but you do not see anybody on the \nfloor telling the NIH to do a study between the environmental effects \nand nonsmoking-related lung cancer.\n  The reason it is important is a little example of penicillin. It is a \ngreat example. We stumbled onto that through the science of \nmicrobiology, but we would never have gotten there if we had told the \nNIH: Study scarlet fever and find a cure; study strep tonsillitis and \nfind a cure; study syphilis and find a cure; study gonorrhea, and we \nhad gone four or five different ways. The point I am making is basic \nresearch is what we ought to be doing.\n  In the mid-nineties, I was one of the strong advocates for increasing \nthe size of the NIH budget. It ought to be twice what it is today. The \nreason it is not $60 billion a year instead of $29 billion is because \nwe will not fix the waste in Medicaid of $42 billion over 5 years, we \nwill not fix the $90 billion in fraud in Medicare, we will not fix the \n$8 billion that was paid out by the Pentagon for performance bonuses \nthat nobody earned last year, we will not fix the $50 billion that is \nassociated with waste within the Pentagon. Nobody will fix it. We had \none wheelchair that was sold multiple times for $5 million to Medicare \nin Florida alone--one wheelchair. We will not do the hard work that \ncreates the long-term best interest for our country, but we will \ncertainly respond to--granted, very real issues, but in an \ninappropriate way that does not get us where we want to go.\n  The NIH budget spends more on breast cancer research than any other \nresearch. We are going to spend $100 million on research on the link \nbetween breast cancer and the environment. Plus, the Defense Department \nis going to spend another $138 million, and the Centers for Disease \nControl and Prevention combined is greater than $1 billion. There is \nnot any other disease we do that on right now. Yet we are going to tell \nthem to do more of the same they are already doing, and we are never \ngoing to think about the other people with other diseases, the other \n2,037 diseases that are not as well organized and have nowhere close to \nthe same investment at NIH.\n  The point is, the hardcore, heavy-duty, peer-reviewed science ought \nto guide us, not emotion, not my poor cousin Sharon Wetz who died 6, 7 \nyears ago of breast cancer, not my sister who has breast cancer, not my \nsister-in-law who has breast cancer. What we ought to be doing is what \nis in the best overall good for this country as a whole. And if we need \nto spend more money on breast cancer, then the way to do that is to get \nrid of some of the waste and double NIH, but any dollar we spend on \nbreast cancer is a dollar we are not going to spend on colon cancer, it \nis a dollar we are not going to spend on thyroid cancer, it is a dollar \nwe are not going to spend on lymphoma, because we are going to take it \naway.\n  In this bill, it says this should not interfere with peer-reviewed \nresearch. If that is the case, then this will never get appropriated. \nSo either this bill is about doing research or it is about a press \nevent for a politician. I will tell you, I think it is the latter.\n  In 2006, we modernized the NIH to keep exactly this thing from not \nhappening. We took away all the silos. We gave the Director the power \nand the authority to start making great decisions based on what the raw \nscience was telling him so when we invest in raw science, we magnify \nthe potential benefits that come from it. Now we are going to go back \nand say we are going to start picking diseases; we are going to start \nmanaging it. Why do we need a staff at NIH? Let's let the Senate pick \nevery disease and how much we are going to spend on every one of them; \nwe obviously are qualified.\n  We are not qualified.\n  I find it amazing--I do not doubt Senator Reid's story, but as a \nsurgical resident in 1984, I was doing cystoscopies and diagnosing \ninterstitial cystitis. We didn't think it was psychosomatic. We knew it \nwas a real disease 3 years before Senator Reid came to the Senate.\n  The question politicians ought to be asking is what is NIH doing? \nWhere is the oversight on what they are doing? Find out what they are \ndoing. How does their work rank in comparison to the other disease \ninitiatives at NIH? We have not had a hearing on that issue.\n  The HELP Committee has had hearings on multiple speciality disease \nbills. So we are back into answering a real need, but maybe it is not \nthe best priority. What if we spent the same money we are going to \nspend on this disease and we got a breakthrough that cured all cancers, \nbut because we decided we were going to reconnect with one specific \naspect of one potential risk for one cancer, we missed it?\n  The wisdom of this body has to be to think in the big picture and in \nthe long term. I have diagnosed breast cancer over 500 times in my \nmedical practice. It is a gut-wrenching, life-changing disease. \nFortunately, we have had great improvements in it and our diagnostic \nskills are getting better, especially with digital MRI on breast \nexamination. Early diagnosis has an impact, but what we do and how we \ndo it is going to matter.\n  I will put forward that Senator Reid can bring this bill to the \nfloor, and if he brings it and we take the time--and I am more than \nhappy to take 4 or 5 days to talk about how we should work at NIH, and \nI am happy to do that--and the bill will pass, but then are we going to \ndo the same thing with every other disease the HELP Committee brought \nout? There are about eight other bills just like this bill. We are \ngoing to tell NIH: You have to spend this money here, you have to do it \nhere. Regardless of what the raw molecular science says, regardless of \nwhat the peer-reviewed literature says, we are going to tell them what \nto do. Consequently, we are going to delay scientific discovery.\n  My opposition is not that I don't want to cure breast cancer. My \nopposition is not that I don't want us to find a cure. I want to find a \ncure for all of them. I am a two-time cancer survivor. I would love to \nprevent colon cancer. I don't like walking around with half a colon. \nThere are a lot of consequences to it. I don't like having melanoma and \nhaving half my neck taken away. I don't like it, but I don't want colon \ncancer to displace possible cures for everybody and in the best \ninterest of this country.\n  Will I object? Every time I come to the floor I will object because I \nthink the ultimate underlying policy is wrong. The way we solve breast \ncancer in this country is double the NIH funding and let science drive \nthe way we need to go. The way we double NIH funding is get rid of the \n$300 billion waste, fraud, and abuse that is in the discretionary \nbudget every year which most of us don't have the courage to attack \nbecause it might gore somebody's ox.\n  To those who have breast cancer, as a physician and somebody who has \nbeen through cancer, I know your fear. I have been there. I have \nexperienced the questions. I have experienced the chemotherapy. I have \nexperienced the losing of 30 or 40 pounds. I have experienced the \nnausea and vomiting that is persistent with you for 4 or 6 months. Most \nof all, what I have experienced is, we have a great health care system \nand great research in this country that is saving a lot of lives. If we \nwill get our hands out of it as politicians, they will be able to save \na whole lot more lives than when we put our hands into it and tell them \nwhat they must and shall do.\n\n  I thank the good Lord for the time he has given me. I am 5 years out \nthis month from colon cancer. There is no guarantee, but while I am \nalive, I am going to do things that are in the best long-term interest \nof our research for health care, that give us the most life for the \ndollars that we invest. If that is pleasing politically, great. If it \nis displeasing politically, it is OK too. What is important is we are \ngood stewards--not just with the money but with the direction to allow \nscience to lead us to cures.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Brosh\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the life of Army \nCorporal Benjamin Brosh, of the 2nd Battalion, 327th Infantry Regiment, \n1st Brigade Combat Team, 101st Airborne Division, out of Fort Campbell, \nKY. Corporal Brosh was killed last week in Balad, Iraq, when a car \npacked with explosives detonated near his position at Forward Operating \nBase Anaconda. He was 22 years old.\n  Corporal Brosh has roots in Mississippi and Colorado, where his \nmother still lives and where he loved to ski. Those who knew him \nremember his energy, sense of humor, his love for his family, and his \ncommitment to the Army and to the soldiers with whom he served.\n  He entered the Army in 2006, shortly after experiencing and enduring \nthe devastation that Hurricane Katrina wrought on his community. The \nstorm stirred Benjamin to understand his gift for helping others in \ntimes of need. Although the storm had badly damaged his own crabbing \nbusiness, which he had built out of his childhood love for fishing, \nBenjamin spent the days and weeks after the storm helping his family \nand friends dig out from the wreckage. ``He just worked like a Trojan, \nand didn't want anything from it,'' recalls a family friend whose home \nBenjamin cleared of mud and debris.\n  He carried his dreams of helping others into the Army and then to \nIraq, where, amid the violence of firefights and roadside bombs, he \nremained focused on doing what he could to help ordinary Iraqis rebuild \ntheir lives. Benjamin's father recalls how much he enjoyed delivering \nsoccer balls to Iraqi children and then challenging them to a pickup \ngame. In a war zone wrought with confusion and tragedy it is hard to \nimagine a gesture of humanity more powerful than that of an American \nsoldier joining with Iraqi kids in a soccer match.\n  Corporal Brosh's passion for assisting others was matched only by his \ncommitment to protecting the soldier next to him. He was a pillar of \nhis unit, sustaining his fellow soldiers with his good spirits, \noptimism, and courage. He dispensed advice and encouragement and, \nultimately, offered his life to protect his unit.\n  The words we offer to honor Corporal Brosh cannot begin to describe \nthe heroism of his daily work or the depth of his character and \nconvictions. From his memory, though, we draw a model for service and \nduty to which we can all aspire.\n  At a 1963 gathering remembering the life of the poet Robert Frost, \nPresident John F. Kennedy reminded the crowd that, ``A nation reveals \nitself not only by the men it produces, but also by the men it honors, \nthe men it remembers.''\n  Our Nation tends to recognize those men and women of wide acclaim, \nwith whose accomplishments we are already familiar. This, however, is a \ntime of heroes. Over a million and a half Americans have left their \nfamilies for deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan. Benjamin Brosh, a \nyoung man who learned his power to help others in the wake of Hurricane \nKatrina, gave even more than most. He lent his character, he lent his \noptimism, and he lent his life to his country. If a nation, as \nPresident Kennedy suggests, reveals itself by the citizens it produces, \nthen Corporal Brosh is America at our finest. He is a patriot and a \nhero.\n  To Benjamin Brosh's parents, James and Barbara, and to all his \nfriends and family, our thoughts and prayers are with you. I hope that, \nin time, your grief will be assuaged by the pride you must feel in \nBenjamin's service and by the honor he bestowed upon his country. This \nNation will never forget him.\n\n\n                     Sergeant David ``DJ'' Stelmat\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise today to honor U.S. Army Sergeant \nDavid Stelmat of Littleton, NH. On March 22, 2008, Sergeant Stelmat was \ntragically taken from us, along with two fellow soldiers from the North \nCarolina Army National Guard's 1132 Military Police Company, when his \nhumvee encountered an improvised explosive device in Bagdad, Iraq. At \nonly 27 years old, SGT David Stelmat, or DJ as he was known to his \nfriends and family, will always be remembered as an adventurous, fun-\nloving young man who enjoyed the outdoors.\n  The attacks of September 11, 2001, were the worst our Nation has ever \nexperienced. Terrorists hijacked commercial airplanes, turned them into \nweapons, and brutally steered them into the World Trade Center Towers \nin New York, the Pentagon only miles from here, and the last plane lost \non a field in Pennsylvania as a result of the heroic stance of the \npassengers aboard. It has become part of New Hampshire lore that in the \nwake of this tragedy, when our Nation was looking to heal itself, DJ, a \n1998 graduate of Profile High School, along with a friend, climbed to \nthe top of the Old Man of the Mountain and placed an American flag in \nthe iconic profile. Pictures of DJ's action quickly spread and served \nas a patriotic symbol of our State and our country.\n  Upon returning home from military service to our Nation as part of \nthe infantry in Afghanistan, DJ attended the New Hampshire Technical \nInstitute in his ardent desire to become an emergency medical \ntechnician. I am sure that this patriotic need to help our Nation heal \nafter September 11 came from the same source of motivation which led to \nhis burning desire to achieve his goal of military service as a combat \nmedic.\n  In January 2006, DJ joined the New Hampshire National Guard's 237th \nMilitary Police Company. In August of that year he completed training \nas a health care specialist. After receiving training, he deployed with \nthe 1132nd Military Police Company. As a testament to his service, \nSergeant Stelmat's awards include a Bronze Star, Purple Heart, Army \nGood Conduct Medal, National Defense Service Medal, Iraq Campaign \nMedal, Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, Armed Forces Reserve \nMedal with ``M'' device, Army Service Ribbon, Overseas Service Ribbon, \nCombat Action Badge, Expert Rifle Weapons Qualification Badge, and an \nOverseas Service Bar.\n  My deepest sympathy, condolences and prayers go out to DJ's loved \nones, especially his parents. The service and sacrifice of Sergeant \nStelmat remind me of the words of another son of New Hampshire, Daniel \nWebster, who said, ``What a man does for others, not what they do for \nhim, gives him immortality.'' As combat medic, there is no doubt but \nthat DJ put his country and his fellow soldiers before himself. For \nthis selflessness, we are eternally grateful. May God bless U.S. Army \nSergeant DJ Stelmat.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/29/senate-section/article/S3497-2", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3497]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nCOMMEMORATION OF THE 265TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE BIRTH OF THOMAS JEFFERSON\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, on April 13, 2008, America celebrated the \n265th anniversary of the birth of Thomas Jefferson, who first served as \nVice President and then subsequently was elected as the Nation's third \nPresident in 1801.

I was privileged to attend along \nwith John Casteen, current president of the University of Virginia, and \nmany other invited guests from the Commonwealth of Virginia.\n  Given the importance of this occasion and the respectful tributes \ndelivered by the President, the First Lady, and two eminent scholars, I \nwish to record this event for the American people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/29/senate-section/article/S3497-3", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3497-S3498]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TRIBUTE TO BARB HESS\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I would like to take a few moments to \npay tribute to a remarkable teacher who has touched the lives of \ncountless students in Davenport, IA. Miss Barb Hess is retiring after \n46 years teaching various social studies courses at Davenport Central \nHigh School.\n  Many of us can think back to one favorite teacher who stands out \namongst all the rest; who because of a unique combination of \npersonality and teaching skills, was able to spark an interest in a \ncertain subject or learning in general. Miss Hess has been such a \nteacher\n\n[[Page S3498]]\n\nfor an extraordinary number of students. Her profound impact on her \nstudents and on Central High is attested to by her colleagues who wrote \nme an impassioned letter recounting her impressive career, as well as \nby a great many of her former students, including a member of my staff.\n  In the classroom, Miss Hess commands respect and maintains discipline \nwith only a few softly spoken but firm words, making clear that \nappropriate behavior is expected. She holds high academic expectations \nfor her students, challenging them to achieve their potential. Her \ncourses, many of which she developed herself, push students to think \ndeeply and critically. Her students know that she expects papers to \ndemonstrate clear writing with well reasoned arguments backed by solid \nresearch. In a time of much discussion about lack of rigor in high \nschool coursework, Miss Hess's classes stand out as an example of \nrigorous preparation for higher education and other life-enriching \nopportunities.\n  Her high expectations for her students are a natural outgrowth of the \nhigh expectations she sets for herself. Although Miss Hess holds both a \nbachelor's and a master's degree from Drake University, she has never \nceased to enhance her own knowledge of the subjects she teaches. She \ncan always spot plagiarism, often because she is intimately familiar \nwith the original source.\n  Outside the classroom, Miss Hess has been the adviser for the student \ncouncil starting in 1974 and has advised numerous other student groups \nand organizations. In fact, she has organized, advised, or assisted \nwith more functions at Davenport Central over the years than can be \ntallied. Barb Hess has been a loyal ``Blue Devil'' since her student \ndays, consistently supporting sports teams, fine arts events, and other \nextracurricular activities over the years.\n  Barb Hess is a fixture at Davenport Central High School, having \nachieved near legendary status among those familiar with the school. \nHer imprint on the institution will continue to be felt very strongly. \nHer imprint on the lives of her students will be even more enduring. \nThe best teachers combine extensive content knowledge with a certain \nintangible ability to connect with students and to inspire them to \nexcel in school and life. Miss Hess's ability to care about each \nstudent as an individual, and unique talent for bringing out the best \nin students of all kinds, places her among the best of the best. She \nwill be missed in her classroom at Central High, but her legacy of \nimproving the lives of generations of students will last forever. I \nthank Barb Hess for her years of service to Iowa's youth and I wish her \nthe very best in her retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/29/senate-section/article/S3498-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3498-S3500]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              NORTH KOREA\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, the guard told the story of a father, a \nmother, a son, and a daughter who were stripped naked and led into a \nroom together. The room was made of glass, ten feet wide, nine feet \nlong, and seven feet high. Leading into the glass room where the family \nstood was a metal injection tube. Outside the room, a group of \nscientists waited with pens and note pads. The guard recalls that the \ngas began to flow through the tube into the glass room. At first, the \ngas collected along the floor. The family stood together in the middle \nof the room. Then, as the cloud of gas rose from the floor of the \nchamber, the son and the daughter began to vomit and then to die. The \nmother and father tried to save them. They stood as high as they could \nto gasp the last clean breaths of their lives, to breathe that air into \nthe lungs of their children, and to preserve their lives for a few more \nmoments. Soon, the parents, too, began to vomit and die. One by one, \nall four succumbed and collapsed into the cloud of gas. Eventually, the \nfather, the mother, the son, and the daughter all lay dead on the floor \nof the gas chamber.\n  The story I have just told you did not happen decades ago in Nazi \nGermany. It happened recently, and there is every reason to believe \nthat things just like it may continue to this day, perhaps at this very \nmoment. They happened in a country with which our diplomats are talking \nabout granting full diplomatic relations and all of the mercantile and \ndiplomatic privileges of membership in the civilized world.\n  This story happened to forgotten people, in a forgotten part of a \nforgotten country. You have probably never heard of it, yet it is the \nscene of crimes against humanity whose scale and depravity rival those \nof Mauthausen, Tuol Sleng, or Srebrenica. The place is called ``Camp \n22.'' It lies in the far northeastern corner of North Korea.\n  Camp 22 is not history than we can condemn from the safe distance of \ntime. Yet too many of us refuse to confront it, perhaps because we are \nafraid that confronting the crimes of Camp 22 would also require us to \nconfront its moral imperatives. We cannot say that we act according to \nour values when we invite mass murder into the community of \ncivilization, with all of its diplomatic and mercantile privileges. It \nis to horrors like these that we must say ``never again,'' and mean it, \nand act.\n  It is a massive place, perhaps hundreds of square miles in area. \nFormer guards say that 50,000 men, women, and children are confined \nthere. Camp 22 is a killing field where guards murder children for \nscavenging garbage to eat, where prisoners are publicly stoned to death \nand disemboweled, and where entire families are slaughtered for no more \nreason than to serve as examples for other prisoners. It is a place \nwhere torture, starvation, and disease kill 20 percent of the prisoners \nevery year, and where children die because their parents are accused of \nthought crimes.\n  Camp 22 is only one of an archipelago of concentration camps in North \nKorea. The U.S. Committee for Human Rights in North Korea estimates \nthat 400,000 people have been murdered in these camps. Survivor Kang \nChol Hwan describes spending ten years in another camp, Camp 15, where \neach spring brought a grim new harvest of deaths from starvation and \ndisease.\n  The only people who have ever seen Camp 22 are its guards, its \nvictims (none of whom has ever escaped), and the thousands of dead \nwhose corpses and bones are strewn in its hills, fields, and ravines. \nKim Jong Il's regime still denies that these camps exist. No foreigner \nhas ever been permitted to go near them. Until North Korea allows us to \ngo to the camps to prove or disprove these reports, we cannot know for \ncertain what is happening there. Still, commercially available \nsatellite imagery allows us to look upon Camp 22 for ourselves and \nverify what the survivors tell us in detail. Google Earth has made \nwitnesses of us all. In these times, anyone with an Internet connection \ncan look down into hell at Camp 22 and witness Holocaust Now.\n  I would like to thank the Rev. Chun Ki Won, whom many have dubbed the \n``Schindler of the East.'' Reverend Chun himself has led hundreds to \nsafety and himself spent nearly nine months in a Chinese prison when he \nwas caught trying to get into Mongolia with a group of refugees. The \nfloor charts of satellite photos I am about to show were vetted by \nrefugees, both victims and guards, he is in touch with in Korea and \nelsewhere. They identified the details of these gulags and confirmed \ntheir existence.\n  I want to show you Camp 22 today. I want you to see its fence lines, \nits gates, and moats. I want you to see the huts where its prisoners \nlive, the coal mines where men are worked to death, and the forests and \nfields where the dead are discarded. I want you to be haunted by these \nthings when you consider how we should deal with Kim Jong Il's regime, \nand when you are deciding what kind of a country we will be. I ask that \nyou hear what I have to say while there is still time to stop this, and \nbefore our government surrenders the last pressure it may have to stop \nit. In Camp 22, it is forbidden to mourn the dead. Mourning them will \nnot bring them back, but it may save others who still suffer.\n  Using Google Earth's highest resolution, it is possible to trace the \ncamp's circumference perhaps hundreds of square miles. Unfortunately, \nonly the western half of the camp can be seen in publicly available \nhigh-resolution imagery. The alleged gas chamber is outside of this \narea.\n  Tracing the camp's boundaries is not difficult. The camp is \nsurrounded by electrified barbed wire fences from which vegetation has \nbeen cleared away. The sharp corners in the fence lines make them \nimpossible to confuse with roads. At regular intervals, there are guard \ntowers or distinctive guard posts.\n\n[[Page S3499]]\n\n  In North Korea, fence lines like these are the distinctive mark of \nconcentration camps, with a few exceptions, such as Kim Jong Il's \npalaces, and certain nuclear sites. For example, there is the fence \nline of Camp 14, the so-called ``life imprisonment zone'' at the \nheadwaters of the Taedong River, from which no prisoner is supposed to \nleave, dead or alive.\n  Another camp that can be identified by its fenceline is Camp 15, made \ninfamous by Kang Chol Hwan in his gulag memoir, ``The Aquariums of \nPyongyang.'' Kang was sent to that camp at the age of nine. It was not \nuntil his release 10 years later that he learned why he and his family \nwere sent there. His grandfather had come under suspicion for having \nlived for many years in Japan. Kang and his family were arrested one \nnight and taken to Camp 15 in accordance with the North Korean doctrine \nthat class enemies must be rooted out for three generations.\n\n  Former guard Kwon Hyuk claims that the fences around Camp 22 are 2\\1/\n2\\ meters high, and electrified with 3,300 volts of electricity. He \nalso says the camp is surrounded by spiked moats in places. Photographs \nfrom Google Earth also reveal trenches, railroad gates, and guard \nposts. In some pictures, you can even make out what appear to be \nclusters of people in the camps.\n  The farmers who live outside the gates of the camps cannot pretend \nnot to know what goes on beyond the fence. One recent defector, who \nlived in this area, described living near Camp 22 to his English \nteacher, who wrote about them in the Washington Post. According to this \nyoung North Korean refugee, because food and alcohol are scarce in the \ncountryside, the camp guards sometimes went to his house to drink, \nusually heavily. In their intoxication, the guards would confess to \ntheir sense of remorse.\n  When American soldiers and news cameras reached the gates of Dachau \nin 1945, we and millions of men and women of conscience throughout the \nworld made a simple, solemn promise: ``never again.'' Who among us \ntoday questions the righteousness of that promise? And who among us \ndoubts that much of its meaning lies buried in the mass graves of Tuol \nSleng, Rwanda, and Darfur? Why have we not done better? Perhaps the \ncivilized world erred by making a promise it could not keep. We cannot \nsolve all of the world's problems or suppress the worst impulses of \nhumanity. Still, ``never again'' was, and is, a promise worth keeping \nif we read it as a promise, first, to speak the truth; second, to do no \nharm; and third, to find ways within our means to stay the hand of the \nmurderer.\n  We find ourselves in the possession of information not unlike that \nwhich was in our possession in 1943. Our government had aerial \nphotographs of Auschwitz, Dachau, and Buchenwald, too, and the accounts \nof the survivors were there for us to act on or disbelieve. Perhaps all \nof the evils of Camp 22 and these other camps are fictions. If that is \nso, let Kim Jong Il open them to the eyes of the world. Let him refute \nme and all of us who believe that it is beneath our nation to \ncollaborate with evil of this depth.\n  I am aware that some in Washington, including many in our State \nDepartment, would prefer to hear even less discussion of the atrocities \nin North Korea for the sake of a diplomatic process that has taken \ndecades to get us nowhere. I was deeply ashamed this year when I read \nin the Washington Post of how our State Department's East Asia Bureau \nhad tried to pressure the authors of this year's human rights country \nreports to airbrush the section on North Korea, invoking ``the \nSecretary's priority on the Six-Party talks'' and asking the authors to \n``sacrifice a few adjectives for the cause.'' Perhaps this diplomat was \nguided by a sincere but mistaken belief that there will be time to deal \nwith North Korea's atrocities when its disarmament is negotiated first. \nFor those who are suffering and dying in these camps, this year, there \nmay not be a next year.\n  With all due respect to Secretary Rice, I have come to doubt that our \nState Department is as serious about ending these atrocities as it is \nabout pretending that we have progressed toward disarming North Korea. \nWhy, more than 3 years after this Congress unanimously passed the North \nKorean Human Rights Act, are American consulates in China and other \ncountries still refusing to let North Korean refugees in their gates? \nUnder Assistant Secretary of State Christopher Hill, who tells us that \nhe intends to make human rights one of many issues to be addressed \nthrough a ``normalization working group'' within the six-party talks, \nnow says that America can raise its objections to these atrocities ``in \nthe context of two states that have diplomatic relations.'' Some of us \nhad observed years ago that Ambassador Lefkowitz, our Special Envoy for \nHuman Rights in North Korea, has been sidelined and silenced. Recently, \nwe watched with embarrassment how he was treated when he dared to make \nthe obvious connection between Kim Jong Il's malice toward his own \npeople and his malice toward us.\n\n  After all, the basis of any negotiated disarmament or peace must be a \nshared interest in the preservation of human life. What does it tell us \nthat Kim Jong Il holds human life in such low regard as to run places \nlike Camp 22, and then lie so flagrantly as to deny its very existence? \nWhat lessons can we take from the fact that he left two and a half \nmillion North Koreans to starve to death while he expended his nation's \ndepleted resources on nuclear weapons and luxuries for himself and the \nelites? What does it tell us that, according to multiple witnesses, \nthis regime kills newborn babies of refugee women returned from China \nin the name of protecting North Korea's racial purity? Does this regime \nvalue human life including North Korean life--as we value it? If not, \nisn't it reasonable to conclude that neither a desire for peace nor \ngood faith will motive Kim Jong Il to keep this latest agreement?\n  And finally, what does it tell us that China, the guarantor of that \nagreement and host for the six-party talks, green-lighted North Korea's \nnuclear test in 2006? Or that it has just announced a new plan to \nundermine the U.N. sanctions that followed that test by letting the \nregime's officials hold accounts in Chinese banks, in Chinese currency? \nOr that it has flagrantly violated the U.N. Refugee Convention for \nyears by offering bounties to people who catch and turn in North Korean \nrefugees, so that it can string them together like fish on lines, with \nwires through their wrists and noses, as it leads them back to the \ndeath camps and firing squads? Or that it has bullied the UNHCR into \nrefusing asylum to North Korean refugees? And what do we have to say \nabout China's efforts to cleanse its territory of North Korean refugees \nto ensure that this year's Olympic games will be free of the wretched \nrefuse of its tyrannical satellite?\n  Do not misunderstand my words. I am certainly not advocating war. \nAfter all, if we wish to rid the world of this repellent regime, we \nneed only stop sustaining it. Kim Jong Il has already ruined North \nKorea's economy. He cannot sustain his misrule without the cash he \nreceives from other nations, through aid, trade, and crime. Recent \nreports by economists and NGO's tell us that North Korea's regime has \nnever been in greater economic distress, and that it has lost even the \ncapacity to feed its elite. As Kim Jong Il shows stubborn contempt for \nour diplomatic efforts, we must relearn the lesson that diplomacy only \ninfluences evil men when it is backed by pressure. In the case of North \nKorea, the threat of economic pressure will gain power in the coming \nmonths . . . but only if we do not throw it away.\n  Nor do I fail to grasp that our idealism must sometimes find ways to \nconform to our immediate interests. But those who say that America \nshould stand only for its pecuniary interests and abandon its values \nhave forgotten how America built the treasures it now seeks to protect. \nWe have always been a nation of ideas of values. What else unites us? \nWe differ in our ethnicities, faiths, and even in the climates and \ncultures of our vast country's regions. If our values no longer guide \nus, we are nothing more than another color on the chessboard, and we \nhave ceased to be a beacon for the world's hopes, a model for its \ndevelopment, and a magnet for its talents. What a tragedy that would be \nfor a nation that, as De Tocqueville said, is great because it is good. \nI do not say that we are perfect; after all, our tendency to revel in \nour own imperfections has made our society far more just and good. And \nwith\n\n[[Page S3500]]\n\ngreatness, and with goodness, come obligations to conform the pursuit \nof our interests to the pursuit of our values.\n  Here is an occasion when our values and our interests both demand \nthat Kim Jong Il be given a stark choice: transparency or extinction. \nLet us resolve that we will not allow Kim Jong Il to plunge North Korea \ninto famine again this year. Let all nations of conscience join to deny \nthe Kim Jong Il the means--through trade or unrestricted aid--to \nperpetuate his rule and his luxurious lifestyle while the North Korean \npeople suffer and starve. America should stand ready to help the people \nof North Korea, if and only if we can verify that every last citizen, \nsoldier, peasant, and prisoner--including the prisoners in Camp 22--can \nshare equally in the aid we should offer generously. If Kim Jong Il \nrefuses the just terms on which we must condition our assistance, then \nwhy should we extend the misery of his people by delaying his meeting \nwith the ash heap of history? That is why I am resolved to oppose, to \nthe last breath in my body, adding this country to the list of Kim Jong \nIl's benefactors and abettors until the prisoners of Camp 22 are fed, \nhealed, housed, and freed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/29/senate-section/article/S3500-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3500]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n      COMMENDING HAWAII'S LEXUS ENVIRONMENTAL CHALLENGE CHAMPIONS\n\n Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I congratulate the Dream Team, a \nteam of eight students from Farrington High School in Honolulu, HI, for \nwinning the grand prize in the 2007 to 2008 Lexus Environmental \nChallenge. The Lexus Environmental Challenge is a multiphased national \ncompetition between 350 middle and high schools from across the \ncountry. The challenge addressed issues from global warming awareness \nto informing communities about the critical importance of water \nconservation.\n  Over the course of 7 months, the Dream Team competed against 350 \nmiddle and high school teams from across America in challenges \naddressing local environmental issues. The Dream Team was one of 55 \nteams invited to compete in the final global challenge where students \nwere asked to develop a program that could potentially change the \nworld. For their final global challenge, the Dream Team took advantage \nof Hawaii's ethnic diversity to educate people around the world about \nthe benefits of clean renewable energy by creating a video message in \n11 different languages ranging from French to Samoan to Tagalog and \nArabic.\n  The members of Farrington High School's Dream Team include Genevieve \nCagoan, Robin John Delim, Carmina Figuracion, Robin Monzano, Minh Trang \nNguyen, Herald Nones, Maria Sheville Lee, and Princes Rosit. The team \nwas led by Ms. Bebi Davis, a Farrington High School chemistry teacher \nwho was the team's adviser.\n  The grand prize for the Lexus Environmental Challenge is $75,000. Ms. \nDavis will receive $7,000 for various classroom projects, Farrington \nHigh School will receive $15,000, and the remaining $53,000 will be \nsplit equally among the eight members of the Dream Team.\n  I congratulate the Farrington High School Dream Team for its great \naccomplishment in capturing the 2007 to 2008 Lexus Environmental \nChallenge grand prize. I wish all of them the best in their future \nendeavors, and I urge them to continue to set an example for future \ngenerations.

Mr. President, on April 29, 1958, the District \nCourt in Pueblo, CO, established the Southeastern Colorado Water \nConservancy District. That action resulted in a firm water supply for \nthe Arkansas River Basin, providing much-needed supplemental water to \ncommunities which are home to the wonderful people of this region.\n  The Arkansas River Basin includes communities whose livelihoods have \nalways depended on water: farming, ranching, steel manufacturing, small \nbusinesses. The economic tide in this region has ebbed and flowed \nduring that 50-year period, but its riches lie not in dollars but in \nits people.\n  The Southeastern Colorado Water Conservancy District has served the \nregion and people honorably and with diligence. The district works hard \nto help the Arkansas Valley realize the importance and value of a well-\nmanaged water supply.\n  Currently, the district is spearheading a plan to at last construct \nthe Arkansas Valley Conduit, originally authorized as part of the \nFryingpan-Arkansas Project. The conduit was deemed necessary five \ndecades ago, and the need for clean and safe water supplies for the \npeople of the valley has only increased as water quality is threatened \nand federally acceptable standards have increased. But the Lower \nArkansas Valley, which this project will serve, needs assistance in \nproviding that safe water supply and in meeting those standards.\n  This Arkansas Valley Conduit is a top priority to me as I near the \nend of my tenure in the Senate. As one of the final components of the \nFryingpan-Arkansas Project and as a major goal of the now 50-year-old \nSoutheastern Colorado Water Conservancy District, I congratulate the \ndistrict on their hard work to make this project feature a reality, and \nthank them for all they have accomplished in their half century of \ncommitment to the Arkansas Valley.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/29/senate-section/article/S3500-3", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3500]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              PRUDENTIAL SPIRIT OF COMMUNITY AWARD WINNERS\n\n Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I wish today to honor this year's \nDelaware winners of the Prudential Spirit of Community Award in \nrecognition of their exemplary volunteer service. Congratulations to \nAnna Schuck of Wilmington, Matthew Waldman of Delmar, Alexandra Browne \nof Wilmington, and Taylor Folt, also of Wilmington.\n  I strongly believe that volunteerism is one of the cornerstones of \nAmerican society. As shown on numerous occasions, volunteering is not \nonly good for the community; it is an enriching and rewarding \nexperience for the volunteer, as well. Anna, Matthew, Alexandra and \nTaylor all exemplify this spirit of involvement and giving back to \ntheir communities. They serve as models of selflessness and examples of \nhow rewarding volunteering can be both personally and to the community \nthey serve.\n  The Prudential Spirit of Community Awards was created by Prudential \nFinancial and the National Association of Secondary School Principals \nto inspire and encourage youth volunteerism. Since being founded in \n1995, these awards have honored more than 80,000 young volunteers at \nthe local, State and, national levels.\n  Delaware winner Anna Schuck founded the H.U.G. Club, for ``Helping \nthe Underprivileged Globally,'' at her school, coordinating fundraising \nevents including ``Rock Uganda,'' a series of seven concerts. Her \nefforts helped to raise $14,500 to provide necessities for a school in \nUganda.\n  Middle school winner Matthew Waldman has participated in a variety of \nvolunteer activities, including a charity antique show, bell ringing \nfor the Salvation Army, and a Humane Society walk. Matthew has also \norganized dances instead of birthday parties, asking attendees to \ndonate food and other items instead of bringing gifts.\n  High school Distinguished Finalist Alexandra Browne spent 2 years \ncoordinating events and fundraisers, recruiting volunteers and \noverseeing other logistics as chair of her school's Relay for Life \nfundraising event. The event, which raised more than $60,000, donates \nto cancer research, education, and patient support.\n  Middle school Distinguished Finalist Taylor Folt spent a month of her \nsummer vacation teaching English and American History to students in \nIndia, as well as helping them with maintenance tasks around their \ncampus.\n  Congratulations to this year's honorees, Anna, Matthew, Alexandra, \nand Taylor, who personify the spirit of giving back. These outstanding \nyoung volunteers are an inspiration to me and, I hope, to many others \nthroughout Delaware.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/29/senate-section/article/S3501-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3501]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S3501]]\n                  CONGRATULATING DAVENPORT UNIVERSITY\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I congratulate Davenport on the \nrecent successes of their Athletic Department and student athletes. The \nmen's hockey team won their first American Collegiate Hockey \nAssociation, ACHA, Division II National Championship with a 5-2 victory \nover Indiana University. The women's basketball team won the Wolverine \nHoosier Athletic Conference Championship, WHAC, and made it to the \nSweet 16 of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics, \nNAIA, Division II National Tournament. These are both extraordinary \nfeats considering the Athletic Department at Davenport University was \nformed only 6 years ago. Both programs were honored in a celebration at \nDavenport University on March 26, 2008. These accomplishments bring \ngreat joy and satisfaction to all those associated with Davenport \nUniversity and across the State of Michigan.\n  The hockey team's National Championship came after a third \nconsecutive appearance in the ACHA Division II Final Four. The \nchampionship game ended an exciting week in Fort Myers, FL. Outscoring \ntheir five opponents by a combined total of 40-7, the Panthers \ndominated with their strong offensive attack. Under the leadership of \nhead coach Paul Lowden, the team finished the season with a 35-11-4 \nrecord and won their third straight Great Midwest Hockey League, GMHL, \nregular season and tournament titles.\n  Each player of the Davenport University team made significant \ncontributions to the winning season, including Alex Mikla, Wes \nBaughman, Pat Collar, Justin Poorman, Bill McSween, Jon Stolarz, Jeremy \nBultema, Justin Welker, Eric Troup, Will Collar, Rick Gadwa, Dayne \nGluting, Chad Anguilm, Bobby Collar, Jeff Kraemer, Adam Tomacari, Kevin \nDoyle, Adam Thomas, Kevin Moodie, Chris Joswiak, Scott Knight, Chad \nRutzel, Eddie Wheeler, Jared Mailloux, Chris Green, Brit Ouelette, \nBrett Hagen, Luke Bonnewell, Kenny Jacobs, Jason Kraemer, Jonah \nRogowski, Ben Duthler, head coach Paul Lowden, and assistant coaches \nPhil Sweeney, Jamie Bradford, and Joe Messina.\n  After only six seasons at Davenport University, head coach Paul \nLowden was named the 2008 ACHA Men's Division II Coach-of-the-Year. He \nwas honored with this award at the American Hockey Coaches Association \nCoach-of-the-Year Celebration this past weekend. Coach Lowden was also \nselected by the ACHA as the inaugural head coach for the Men's Division \nII Select Team. The select team traveled to Europe this winter and \nfinished with a perfect 5-0-0 record.\n  The Lady Panthers basketball team, under the leadership of head coach \nMark Youngs, earned their second consecutive Wolverine Hoosier Athletic \nConference title. Senior Jeanette Woodberry, who was named both the \nWHAC Player of the Year and a First Team All-American, led the team to \nvictory. Sara Haverdink and Kristin Bergsma were both named to the NAIA \nAcademic All-American team. The basketball team finished this \noutstanding season with a record of 28-6 overall and 13-1 in their \nconference.\n  Teamwork, determination and a commitment to excellence by each member \nof this basketball team led to their success. The members include \nLyndsey Shepherd, Megan Peters, Sara Haverdink, Andrea Kimm, Brittany \nLyman, Kristin Bergsma, Kristi Boehm, Lynne Blomberg, Kayla Chapman, \nJeanette Woodberry, Emily Rosenzweig, Kallie Benike, Sylvia Welch, \nShannon Slattery, Stephani Roles, along with head coach Mark Youngs, \nand assistant coaches Kelly Wandel, Shannon Callaghan, and Alicia \nBarczak.\n  I am proud to recognize the outstanding achievements of the Davenport \nUniversity Athletic Department. Their student athletes compete \nadmirably in athletics and in the classroom, and maintain an average \nGPA of 3.22. I extend my best wishes to the players, coaches, families, \nand the University community that supported them throughout this \ntriumphant season.\n  I know my colleagues in the Senate join me in congratulating Coach \nLowden, Coach Youngs, and the Davenport University Panthers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/29/senate-section/article/S3501-2", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3501]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      HONORING LEIGH ANNE GILBERT\n\n Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, I wish to recognize the efforts \nof a Floridian who has worked to make a difference in an underserved \npart of our world. Leigh Anne Gilbert, who recently returned to her \nhometown of Orlando, has spent the past 3 years establishing the \nRainbow Primary Neighborhood School in Masthan Nagar, Hyderabad, India.\n  After her husband's job relocated the couple to an undeveloped part \nof India, Leigh Anne recognized the need to serve her new community and \nbegan work on a school to serve the area's children. Through the \nsupport of charitable organizations, Leigh Anne raised the funds \nnecessary to charter and construct the Rainbow Primary Neighborhood \nSchool, which now serves more than 300 impoverished children living in \nthe small Indian village.\n  Leigh Anne was responsible for bringing together all those involved \nin building and operating the school--the designers, construction \nworkers, local government, teachers, and staff. She even recruited the \nservices of the Naandi Foundation--a worldwide charitable organization \nfighting poverty and malnourishment--which delivers meals to the school \nand provides the students health care. Work on the school began in \nearly 2007 and it was completed in March of this year.\n  The effort tested Leigh Anne's physical and mental fortitude as she \nworked tirelessly for the past 3 years to bring all the partners to the \ntable. The project required patience, persistence, and cooperation from \ngovernment officials, community leaders, and charity organizations. On \nWeb posts, Leigh Anne reflected on the project and offered words of \nadvice to those pursuing similar ventures: ``The number one lesson \nlearned: Get partners--rugged, go-to, and knowledgeable partners--then \nleverage the partnerships to meet needs. None of us can go it alone.''\n  On behalf of Florida and the people of the United States, I would \nlike to honor Leigh Anne Gilbert for the tremendous example she has set \nand the good work she has accomplished.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/29/senate-section/article/S3501-3", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3501-S3502]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            SOUTHEASTERN COLORADO WATER CONSERVANCY DISTRICT\n\n Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the 50th \nanniversary of the establishment of the Southeastern Colorado Water \nConservancy District.\n  In the post-World War II era, communities large and small in the \nUnited States envisioned a period of growth and prosperity. Enthusiasm \nin the Arkansas Valley of Colorado was also high, but one limitation \nloomed large: the water needed to build and sustain that growth was \nsimply not available.\n  The regional water users' group decided to pursue a bold vision: the \nFryingpan-Arkansas Project, a complex diversion, storage, and delivery \nsystem, would move water from the western slope of the Rockies to the \ngrowing population on the eastern slope. The project itself is as \ncomplex as the politics of water in the West. It features both western \nslope and eastern slope facilities, some of them at elevations above \n14,000 feet, and multiple dams, reservoirs, tunnels, and conduits.\n  Fifty years ago today, on April 29, 1958, a Pueblo, CO, district \ncourt established under the provisions of Colorado law the Southeastern \nColorado Water Conservancy District. This administrative organization \nembodied the goals of the regional water users' group, which had proven \nadept at promoting the Fryingpan-Arkansas Project through the memorable \nand highly visible sale of small golden frying pans.\n  The original supporters of the Fryingpan-Arkansas, many of whom \neventually served as board members of the district, were committed to \nseeing its promise made true. Their stalwart efforts led to the \nauthorization of the Fryingpan-Arkansas in 1962, and the Southeastern \nDistrict has been managing the project continuously since that time. \nThey fought year after year to see this multipurpose project \nappropriated and constructed. Their success brought the additional \nwater that the valley and its people had hoped for, and many of them \nlived to see it provide benefits to the Arkansas Valley. President John \nF. Kennedy's visit to Pueblo in 1962 to commemorate the start of\n\n[[Page S3502]]\n\nconstruction of Pueblo Dam, the largest component of the Fry-Ark \nProject, remains one of the most memorable events in the history of \nsouthern Colorado.\n  Those of us in the West know that the development and responsible \nmanagement of water is critical to people, to agriculture, to business \nand to the future. The Southeastern District has worked day in and day \nout for over five decades to ensure that the project's purpose is \nfulfilled. They work tirelessly in partnership with the people of the \nArkansas Valley, with their Federal partner, the Bureau of Reclamation, \nand adroitly navigate the rules and regulations of Colorado water law \nto serve the people who depend on this water.\n  I commend the Southeastern Colorado Water Conservancy District for \nits diligence, and I commend the many distinguished people of the \nArkansas Valley who have guided the district during its first 50 years \nas members of its board of directors. They established a tradition of \nvision, leadership, and distinction that will serve the people of \nsoutheastern Colorado well into their next 50 years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/29/senate-section/article/S3502-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3502]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        RECOGNIZING MIKE GEISEN\n\n Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I wish to congratulate Mike Geisen \nfor winning the National Teacher of the Year Award. The National \nTeacher of the Year Program was founded in 1952 by the Council of Chief \nState School Officers. By rewarding teachers who have affected their \nstudents and communities positively, the program focuses public \nattention on some of the philosophies, methods, and wisdom behind \nsuccessful teaching. It has been delightful to learn of Mike's \ncontributions, and I am thrilled that he will be traveling around the \nworld to share his insights as Teacher of the Year.\n  Mike Geisen teaches seventh grade science at Crook County Middle \nSchool in Prineville, OR, but his colleagues and students would call \nthat an understatement. Crook County Middle School principal Rocky \nMiner observed that before Mike assumed chairmanship of the school's \nscience department, students' science test scores had stagnated, with \nabout 55 percent of students meeting or exceeding State standards. Less \nthan 2 years after Mike took the job, 72 percent of Crook County \nstudents were meeting or exceeding State standards.\n  It is clear that other educators have noticed Mike's successes and \nare starting to seek his advice. In October of last year, Oregon State \nsuperintendent Susan Castillo presented him with the Oregon Teacher of \nthe Year Award. A month later, Mike spoke at the Oregon School Boards \nAssociation Conference in Portland about the need for schools to shift \ntheir attention to skills--such as collaboration, innovation, and \nadaptability that are more relevant in a globalized economy.\n  There is no question that Mike can teach and that he can raise test \nscores, but his focus is not directed at the statistical indications of \nsuccess as a teacher. In his application for the National Teacher \naward, Mike wrote the following about America's youth: ``These young \npeople are our equals. They are not simply numbers, conglomerations of \nhormones, or future products. All the latest programs, fads, and \nstatistics are meaningless to a child who isn't cared for on a deeper \nlevel. Whether you are a teacher or parent, businessperson or retired, \nyoung or old: reach deep down into each child with humor, love, and \ncompassion and they will learn from you. They will learn much more than \njust how to read and write; they will learn they are wonderfully \nhuman.''\n  Mike Geisen, or Mr. G, I thank you for your unique contributions. You \nare truly an inspiration to us all. As Henry Brooks Adams once \nremarked, ``A teacher affects eternity; he can never tell where his \ninfluence stops.'' Mr. G, your influence will no doubt continue for \ngenerations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/29/senate-section/article/S3502-2", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3502]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      HONORING LOUISIANA HONORAIR\n\n Mr. VITTER.

Therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana memorializes \n     the commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service and the \n     Congress of the United States to take every action to provide \n     that the amounts received by Louisiana homeowners to offset \n     Louisiana Citizens Property Insurance Assessments on their \n     homeowner's insurance premiums because of the unprecedented \n     damage and destruction of homes in the recent hurricanes \n     shall not be considered as income for federal tax purposes. \n     Be it Further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution shall be \n     transmitted to the commissioner of the Internal Revenue \n     Service, the secretary of the United States Senate, the clerk \n     of the United States House of Representatives, and to each \n     member of the Louisiana delegation to the United States \n     Congress.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-331. A resolution adopted by the Legislature of the \n     State of New York urging the New York State Congressional \n     delegation to oppose S. 40/H.R. 3200; to the Committee on \n     Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n                    Legislative Resolution No. 4858\n\n       Whereas, regulation, oversight, and consumer protection \n     have traditionally and historically been powers reserved to \n     state governments under the McCarran-Ferguson Act of 1945; \n     and\n       Whereas, state legislatures are more responsive to the \n     needs of their constituents and the need for insurance \n     products and regulation to meet their state's unique market \n     demands; and\n       Whereas, many states, including New York, have recently \n     enacted and amended state insurance laws to modernize market \n     regulation and provide insurers with greater ability to \n     respond to changes in market conditions; and\n       Whereas, state legislatures, the National Conference of \n     Insurance Legislators (NCOIL), the National Association of \n     Insurance Commissioners (NAIC), and the National Conference \n     of State Legislatures (NCSL) continue to address uniformity \n     issues between states by the adoption of model laws that \n     address market conduct, product approval, agent and company \n     licensing, and rate deregulation; and\n       Whereas, initiatives are being contemplated by certain \n     members of the United States Congress that have the potential \n     to destroy the state system of insurance regulation and \n     create an unwieldy and inaccessible federal bureaucracy--all \n     without consumer and constituent demand; and\n       Whereas, such initiatives include S. 40/H.R. 3200--the \n     National Insurance Act of 2007--proposed optional federal \n     charter legislation that would bifurcate insurance regulation \n     and result in a quagmire of federal and state directives that \n     would promote ambiguity and confusion; and\n       Whereas, S. 40/H.R. 3200 would allow companies to opt out \n     of state insurance regulatory oversight and evade important \n     state consumer protections; and\n       Whereas, the mechanism set up under S. 40/H.R. 3200 does \n     not, and cannot by its very nature, respond, as state \n     regulation does, to states' individual and unique insurance \n     markets and constituent concerns; and\n       Whereas, S. 40/H.R. 3200 has the potential to compromise \n     state guaranty fund coverage, and employers could end up \n     absorbing losses otherwise covered by these safety nets for \n     businesses affected by insolvencies; and\n       Whereas, S. 40/H.R. 3200 would ultimately impose the costs \n     of a new and needless federal bureaucracy upon businesses and \n     the public; and\n       Whereas, many state governments derive general revenue \n     dollars from the regulation of the business of insurance, \n     including nearly $14 billion in premium taxes generated in \n     2006; in fiscal year 2005-06, insurance taxes generated $987 \n     million in the State of New York: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Congress of the United States be and \n     hereby is respectfully memorialized by this Legislative Body \n     to express its strong opposition to S. 40/H.R. 3200 and any \n     other such federal legislation that would threaten the power \n     of state legislatures, governors, insurance commissioners, \n     and attorneys general to oversee, regulate, and investigate \n     the business of insurance, and to protect consumers; and be \n     it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this Resolution, suitably \n     engrossed, be transmitted to the President of the Senate of \n     the United States, the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives, and to each member of the Congress of the \n     United States from the State of New York.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-332. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Idaho urging Congress to take action to help \n     stop children and employees from accessing Internet \n     pornography; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \n     Transportation.\n\n                       House Joint Memorial No. 7\n\n        Whereas, the Internet has been an extremely important \n     means of exchanging information, and is relied upon in Idaho \n     for business, education, recreation and other uses; and\n       Whereas, many Internet sites contain material that is \n     pornographic, either obscene or inappropriate for children, \n     and a majority of these sites originate within the United \n     States but outside of the state of Idaho; and\n       Whereas, the availability of Internet pornography on the \n     job costs Idaho employers significant numbers of work hours, \n     strains employers' computer equipment, reduces productivity \n     and leads to potentially hostile work environments for men \n     and women; and\n       Whereas, while the custody, care and nurturing of children \n     resides primarily with parents, the widespread availability \n     of Internet pornography and the ability of children to \n     circumvent existing filtering technology defeat the best \n     attempts at parental supervision or control; and\n       Whereas, Internet pornographers are using evolving \n     techniques to lure Idaho children\n\n[[Page S3505]]\n\n     and others into viewing and purchasing pornographic material, \n     defying existing technology designed to block adult content; \n     and\n       Whereas, current methods for protecting computers and \n     computer networks from unwanted Internet content are \n     expensive, block more than the intended content and are \n     easily circumvented; and\n       Whereas, because children, employees and others may seek \n     out pornography, warnings and other labels meant to help \n     avoid inadvertent hits on pornographic sites may simply \n     increase the likelihood that these sites will be visited; and\n       Whereas, credit card verification systems burden credit \n     card companies, are expensive and time consuming to establish \n     and maintain and these systems inhibit legal speech, and \n     other forms of age verification have not been practicable; \n     and\n       Whereas, prior congressional attempts to address children's \n     access to Internet pornography have been held \n     unconstitutional or otherwise have not passed constitutional \n     scrutiny and have not been based on technology that allows \n     individual Internet users to select what kind of Internet \n     content enters their homes and workplaces; and\n       Whereas, protecting the physical and psychological well-\n     being of Idaho's children by shielding them from \n     inappropriate materials is a compelling interest of the \n     Legislature of the State of Idaho; and\n       Whereas, although the state of Idaho has taken rigorous \n     action in an attempt to shield Idaho's children from \n     obscenity and other inappropriate adult content, it cannot \n     effectively curb the programs with Internet pornography \n     within its borders without the support of the United States \n     government; and\n       Whereas, the United States remains in control of the \n     Internet through the Department of Commerce and the National \n     Telecommunications and Information Association; and\n       Whereas, the United States has the ability to create \n     appropriate policies and enforcement tools to effectively \n     deal with these issues: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, by the members of the Second Regular Session of \n     the Fifty-ninth Idaho Legislature, the House of \n     Representatives and the Senate concurring therein, that we \n     strongly urge the United States Congress to take action to \n     help stop children and employees from accessing Internet \n     pornography and that legislation be enacted to facilitate a \n     technology-based solution that allows parents and employers \n     to subscribe to Internet access services that exclude adult \n     content.

A resolution adopted by the Senate of the State of \n     New Jersey urging Congress to enact legislation concerning \n     public disclosure of companies outsourcing jobs; to the \n     Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n                        Senate Resolution No. 24\n\n       Whereas, in recent years, a number of companies have \n     replaced highly-skilled workers from New Jersey with lower-\n     paid, foreign laborers, in a practice known as outsourcing; \n     and\n       Whereas, these outsourcing trends coincide with the U.S. \n     job market's longest slump since the 1930s; and\n       Whereas, many white-collar occupations, including \n     technology and computer specialists, financial analysts, \n     accountants, office support, and call-center employees are \n     among the most vulnerable to outsourcing; and\n       Whereas, the preservation of jobs in New Jersey is of \n     critical importance to the economic well-being of the State; \n     and\n       Whereas, the economic dislocation caused by a company \n     outsourcing jobs threatens the health, safety, and welfare of \n     the people in this State; and\n       Whereas, Forrester Research, Inc. predicts that 3.3 million \n     U.S. jobs will be sent offshore by 2015, accounting for 2 \n     percent of the entire workforce and $136 billion in wages; \n     and\n       Whereas, numerous citizens in the State of New Jersey are \n     unaware that in many circumstances they are not conducting \n     business with a U.S. company but are communicating with a \n     third-party contractor in another country via telephone or \n     Internet; and\n       Whereas, a public list disclosing companies which outsource \n     or are planning to outsource, would help provide a public \n     awareness to discourage outsourcing practices and enable \n     local and state governments to prepare incentives for \n     companies to retain essential U.S. jobs, now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved, by the Senate of the State of New Jersey:\n       1. The Congress of the United States is respectfully \n     memorialized to enact legislation requiring annual \n     publication of a list disclosing companies planning or \n     currently in the practice of outsourcing U.S. jobs to other \n     countries.\n       2.

Res. 24\n\n       This resolution memorializes Congress to enact legislation \n     requiring annual publication of a list disclosing companies \n     planning or currently in the practice of outsourcing U.S. \n     jobs to other countries.\n       A large number of companies across the nation and in New \n     Jersey have replaced highly skilled and educated workers with \n     lower-paid, foreign laborers. This practice is referred to as \n     ``outsourcing'' or ``offshoring.'' Outsourcing U.S. jobs is \n     growing at an alarming rate. Forrester Research, Inc. \n     predicts that 3.3 million U.S. jobs will be sent offshore by \n     2015. The federal government does not maintain a list of \n     companies that currently, or plan to, outsource jobs to other \n     countries. Enacting legislation requiring publication of such \n     a list not only raises public awareness, but also allows \n     state and local governments to prepare initiatives targeted \n     to keep companies from outsourcing critical U.S. jobs.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-334.

This legislation was subsequently \n     passed and signed into law without reauthorization for the \n     Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act; \n     and\n       Whereas, the funding provided through the Secure Rural \n     Schools and Community Self-\n\n[[Page S3506]]\n\n     Determination Act will significantly contribute to the local \n     economy of these counties by providing the necessary funds \n     for schools and roads, which is vital for sustained economic \n     development; and\n       Whereas, these counties depend on the funding from the \n     Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act and \n     unless the funding is secured through legislation as deemed \n     appropriate by the Mississippi congressional delegation, \n     these counties will lose critical funding that it has \n     received for decades; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, by the Senate of the State of Mississippi, the \n     House of Representatives concurring therein, That we, the \n     members of the Legislature of the State of Mississippi, \n     respectfully request that the United States Congress pass the \n     Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act so \n     that these Mississippi counties may continue to adequately \n     maintain the roads and schools and sustain economic \n     development in the state; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Secretary of the Senate is directed to \n     transmit copies of this resolution to President George W. \n     Bush, the Secretary of the United States Senate, the Clerk of \n     the United States House of Representatives, the Governor of \n     the State of Mississippi, each member of the Mississippi \n     congressional delegation, and that copies be made available \n     to members of the Capitol Press Corps.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-336. A resolution adopted by the California State Lands \n     Commission urging the federal government to adopt policies \n     that address climate change; to the Committee on Environment \n     and Public Works.\n\n                               Resolution\n\n       Whereas, California's 1,100 mile coastline, with its \n     beautiful beaches, wild cliffs, abundant fish stocks and \n     fragile environment is a national treasure and a valuable \n     state resource, which is at the heart of a tourist industry \n     that generates nearly five billion dollars in state and local \n     taxes each year; and is central to the state's forty-six \n     billion dollar ocean economy; and\n       Whereas, the California State Lands Commission has \n     jurisdiction over the state-owned tide and submerged lands \n     from the shoreline out three nautical miles into the Pacific \n     Ocean, as well as the lands underlying California's bays, \n     lakes, and rivers; and\n       Whereas, the Commission is charged with managing these \n     lands pursuant to the Public Trust Doctrine, a common law \n     precept that requires these lands be protected for public use \n     and needs involving commerce by means of navigation, \n     fisheries, water related recreation and environmental \n     protection; and\n       Whereas, the impacts of climate change will profoundly \n     affect the public trust values of the lands under the \n     Commission's jurisdiction and the utility of these lands to \n     the public and the environment; and\n       Whereas, climate change is expected to cause oceans to rise \n     by 18 to 59 centimeters by the end of this century according \n     to a 2007 report by the United Nations Intergovernmental \n     Panel on Climate Change (some other estimates are higher); \n     and\n       Whereas, over the course of the 21st century, temperatures \n     are projected to increase by 3 to 10 degrees Fahrenheit, \n     causing ocean temperature to increase, which could cause more \n     intense storms to hit California; and\n       Whereas, these climate change effects would dramatically \n     alter the environment of the California ocean and coast, \n     reducing beaches and wetlands and damaging important \n     infrastructure, including the ports that contribute to \n     California's role in the global economy; and\n       Whereas, of the world's annual human generated emissions of \n     greenhouse gases, which are the cause of climate change, \n     California emits 1.4%, and the United States emits almost \n     25%; and\n       Whereas, California has taken the lead nationally on the \n     issue of climate change and passed AB 32 in 2006, which \n     requires the California Air Resources Board to adopt \n     regulations by 2011 to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in \n     California to 1990 levels by 2020;\n       Whereas, while California has adopted the most innovative \n     and proactive program in the United States for fighting \n     climate change, the federal government has refused to take \n     similar actions to control greenhouse gas emissions and has \n     refused to ratify the Kyoto Treaty, a worldwide agreement to \n     begin to reduce these harmful emissions; and\n       Whereas, on December 21, 2005, California displayed its \n     leadership on the issue of climate change when the California \n     Air Resources Board sent a request to the U.S. Environmental \n     Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) for a waiver under the Clean Air \n     Act that would allow California to adopt stricter vehicle \n     greenhouse gas regulations on new vehicles than the \n     regulations imposed by the federal government; and\n       Whereas, the Clean Air Act specifically allows California \n     to request a waiver from the national emission standard for \n     new motor vehicle engines and impose stricter emission \n     standards than the federal government; and\n       Whereas, Congress granted California the ability to impose \n     stricter emission standards under the Clean Air Act because \n     it recognized the State's unique problems and pioneering \n     efforts with regard to air emissions; and\n       Whereas, for the past 30 years the U.S. EPA has granted \n     California more than 40 such waivers, while previously \n     denying none; and\n       Whereas, on February 29, 2008, the U.S. EPA, for the first \n     time in the history of the Clean Air Act, denied California's \n     December 21, 2005 request to impose stricter emission \n     standard for new motor vehicle engines than those imposed by \n     the federal government; and\n       Whereas, the U.S. EPA denied California's request for \n     waiver even though it recognized that ``global climate change \n     is a serious challenge'' and that ``the conditions related to \n     global climate change in California are substantial;'' and \n     therefore be it\n       Resolved by the California State Lands Commission, That it \n     encourages the U.S. EPA to reconsider and reverse its \n     February 29, 2008 decision that denied California its request \n     for a waiver under the Clean Air Act and precluded the State \n     from imposing strict vehicle greenhouse gas regulations on \n     new vehicles;

A resolution adopted by the Legislature of the \n     State of Louisiana urging Congress to take the actions \n     necessary to provide the state of Louisiana with one-hundred-\n     year flood protection; to the Committee on Environment and \n     Public Works.\n\n                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 39\n\n       Whereas, in the aftermath of the flooding and devastation \n     caused by Hurricane Betsy in 1965, the Congress promised the \n     citizens of southeast Louisiana Category 3 Hurricane \n     Protection, for which the local citizenry contributed \n     significant cost-share funding; and\n       Whereas, the United States Army Corps of Engineers before \n     Hurricane Katrina informed Louisiana that it was protected \n     against a hurricane likely to come no more frequently than \n     once in two hundred years; and\n       Whereas, improvements along the entire Mississippi River \n     system, including its tributaries, and the construction of \n     flood protection reservoirs in states more than one thousand \n     miles from the Gulf Coast deprived the Mississippi River of \n     enormous amounts of sediment needed to sustain coastal lands \n     in Louisiana; and\n       Whereas, southeast Louisiana has played a major role in the \n     shipping and oil and gas industries, benefitting the quality \n     of life and economy of the nation as a whole; and\n       Whereas, the activities of these industries along \n     Louisiana's coast and the construction of the Mississippi \n     River Gulf Outlet, in conjunction with the engineering of the \n     entire Mississippi River system that provided economic \n     benefit and flood protection hundreds of miles upriver from \n     Louisiana which deprived Louisiana of the natural load of \n     sediment, has led directly to the disappearance of two \n     thousand one hundred square miles of Louisiana's coastal \n     lands; and\n       Whereas, these benefits to the rest of the nation have \n     substantially reduced natural barriers to storm surge and \n     thus enormously increased the vulnerability of Louisiana to \n     hurricanes far beyond what it would otherwise be; and\n       Whereas, on August 29, 2005, Hurricane Katrina devastated \n     southeast Louisiana by overtopping levees and breaching \n     floodwalls, with high winds, torrential rains, and flooding \n     causing catastrophic damage to public and private properties \n     in southeast Louisiana, severely impacting the population, \n     local economy, and tax base of these parishes, and reducing \n     the funding capabilities of their respective levee districts; \n     and\n       Whereas, true one-hundred-year protection for southeast \n     Louisiana must be approached from a regional perspective with \n     a contiguous system that eliminates all gaps; and\n       Whereas, in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, one-\n     hundred-year protection for southeast Louisiana was \n     reevaluated by the United States Army Corps of Engineers and \n     approved by Congress; however, the current local cost-share \n     requirement for this protection is estimated to be a minimum \n     of one billion six hundred million dollars for southeast \n     Louisiana, and without payment of this substantial sum, this \n     much-needed protection will not be constructed or will be \n     substantially delayed, jeopardizing the safety and property \n     of the people of southeast Louisiana; and\n       Whereas, since much of southeast Louisiana is still \n     rebuilding and attempting to bring in new development, \n     intervention is required on the federal level to address \n     local cost-share and other local responsibilities in order to \n     construct this much-needed protection; and\n       Whereas, the secretary of the United States Army Corps of \n     Engineers has the discretion to allow local cost share to be \n     paid over a thirty-year period, and this discretion has been \n     applied in situations not as exigent as Louisiana's \n     situation. Therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana does hereby \n     memorialize the Congress of the United States and the \n     Louisiana congressional delegation to take such actions as \n     are necessary to appropriate one hundred percent federal \n     share for one-hundred-year flood protection for southeast \n     Louisiana. Be it further\n\n[[Page S3507]]\n\n       Resolved, That in the event one hundred percent federal \n     cost participation is not authorized, the Congress is hereby \n     urged and requested to take the following actions:\n       (1) Authorize one-hundred-year flood protection for \n     southeast Louisiana at no greater than historic share \n     percentages.\n       (2) Authorize local cost-share participation to be paid \n     over a thirty-year period.\n       (3) Authorize credit for past contributions.\n       (4) Authorize credit for operations and maintenance \n     expenses paid by local government prior to completion of \n     projects by the United States Army Corps of Engineers.\n       (5) Authorize credit to local levee districts at fair \n     market value for borrow materials provided to the United \n     States Army Corps of Engineers; and be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be transmitted to \n     the presiding officers of the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives of the Congress of the United States of \n     America and to each member of the Louisiana congressional \n     delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-338. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Louisiana urging Congress to appropriate \n     sufficient funds to construct one-hundred-year flood \n     protection for southeast Louisiana; to the Committee on \n     Environment and Public Works.\n\n                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 22\n\n       Whereas, in the aftermath of the flooding and devastation \n     caused by Hurricane Betsy in 1965, the Congress of the United \n     States promised the citizens of southeast Louisiana that they \n     would have Category 3 hurricane protection, for which the \n     local citizenry contributed significant cost-share funding; \n     and\n       Whereas, the United States Army Corps of Engineers before \n     Hurricane Katrina informed Louisiana that it was protected \n     against a hurricane likely to come no more frequently than \n     once in two hundred years; and\n       Whereas, levee improvements along the entire Mississippi \n     River system, including its tributaries, and the construction \n     of flood protection reservoirs in states more than one \n     thousand miles from the Gulf Coast deprived the Mississippi \n     River of enormous amounts of sediment needed to sustain \n     coastal lands in Louisiana; and\n       Whereas, southeast Louisiana has played a major role in the \n     shipping and oil and gas industries which provide benefits to \n     enhance the quality of life and the stability of the economy \n     of the nation as a whole; and\n       Whereas, the activities of these industries along \n     Louisiana's coast in addition to the construction of the \n     Mississippi River Gulf Outlet, in conjunction with the \n     engineering of the entire Mississippi River, have led \n     directly to the disappearance of well over two thousand one \n     hundred square miles of Louisiana's coastal lands; and\n       Whereas, the benefits that have been derived by the rest of \n     the nation from Louisiana's working coast and waterways have, \n     in turn, substantially reduced Louisiana's natural barriers \n     to storm surge and thus enormously increased the state's \n     vulnerability to the impacts from hurricanes far beyond \n     what it would otherwise have been; and\n       Whereas, on August 29, 2005, Hurricane Katrina devastated \n     southeast Louisiana with high winds, torrential rains, and \n     flooding which caused the overtopping of levees and breaching \n     of floodwalls, causing catastrophic damage to public and \n     private properties throughout southeast Louisiana, severely \n     impacting the population, the local economy, and the tax base \n     of these parishes, reducing the level of revenue collected by \n     their respective levee districts; and\n       Whereas, true one-hundred-year protection for southeast \n     Louisiana must be approached from a regional perspective with \n     a contiguous system that eliminates all gaps; and\n       Whereas, in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, one-\n     hundred-year flood and hurricane protection for southeast \n     Louisiana was reevaluated by the United States Army Corps of \n     Engineers and approved by Congress; however, the current \n     local cost-share requirement for this protection is estimated \n     to be a minimum of one billion six hundred million dollars \n     for just the projects in southeast Louisiana, and without \n     payment of this substantial sum this much-needed protection \n     will not be constructed or will be substantially delayed, \n     jeopardizing the safety and property of the people of \n     southeast Louisiana; and\n       Whereas, since much of southeast Louisiana is still \n     rebuilding and attempting to bring in new development, \n     intervention is required on the federal level to address \n     local cost-share and other local responsibilities in order to \n     construct this much-needed protection; and\n       Whereas, the secretary of the Army has the discretion to \n     allow local cost-share to be paid over a thirty-year period, \n     and this discretion has been applied in situations not as \n     exigent as Louisiana's: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana does hereby \n     memorialize the Congress of the United States and Louisiana's \n     congressional delegation to ensure the appropriation of a one \n     hundred percent federal share for one-hundred-year flood \n     protection for southeast Louisiana; and be it further\n       Resolved, That in the event one hundred percent federal \n     cost participation is not authorized, the Congress of the \n     United States is hereby requested and urged to take the \n     following actions:\n       (1) Authorize one-hundred-year flood protection for \n     southeast Louisiana at a historic share percentage.\n       (2) Authorize that local cost-share participation may be \n     paid over a thirty-year period.\n       (3) Authorize match credit for past expenditures and \n     construction.\n       (4) Authorize cost-share credit for operations and \n     maintenance expenses paid by local government prior to \n     completion of projects by the United States Army Corps of \n     Engineers.\n       (5) Authorize cost-share credit to local levee districts at \n     fair market value for borrowed materials provided to the \n     Corps; and be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be transmitted to \n     the presiding officers of the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives of the Congress of the United States of \n     America and to each member of the Louisiana congressional \n     delegation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/29/senate-section/article/S3507-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3507]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REPORTS OF COMMITTEES\n\n  The following reports of committees were submitted:\n\n       By Mr. KENNEDY, from the Committee on Health, Education, \n     Labor, and Pensions, with an amendment in the nature of a \n     substitute:\n       S. 1760.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nexempt complex rehabilitation products and assistive technology \nproducts from the Medicare competitive acquisition program; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Medicare Access to \nComplex Rehabilitation and Assistive Technology Act of 2008. I am \npleased to be joined by my colleague from Michigan, Senator Stabenow. \nToday, we unite to ensure access to medical equipment for severely \ndisabled Medicare beneficiaries who seek to lead independent and \nproductive lives.\n  In the 2003 Medicare Modernization Act, MMA, Congress directed the \nCenters for Medicare and Medicaid Services to proceed with a durable \nmedical equipment competitive bidding demonstration project. The \npurpose of this demonstration was to determine whether competitive \nbidding can be used to provide quality medical equipment at prices \nbelow current Medicare Part B reimbursement rates. The bidding will \nresult in a new fee schedule for some selected DME services, replacing \nMedicare's current fee schedule. In other words, competitive bidding \nwill change how Medicare covers medical equipment and also determine \nwhich suppliers may participate in providing such equipment to \nbeneficiaries.\n  It is critical to note that the Medicare competitive bidding program \nwas designed to produce cost savings--both for Medicare and for \nbeneficiaries in the form of lower copayments for medical equipment. \nThe competitive process of submitting bids to supply particular \nservices and products would reduce the price Medicare currently \nreimburses for these items.\n  Although competitive bidding may reduce the cost of some health \nservices, this system will likely prove unworkable in certain \ncircumstances. For example, many rural areas across the country may not \nhave the health care infrastructure to support a competitive \nacquisition program. Small suppliers who service individuals residing \nin areas of low population density may be outbid by larger, distant \nproviders, leading to limited access to medical equipment for Medicare \nbeneficiaries living in these locations.\n  Another unique circumstance for which competitive bidding is \ninappropriate regards complex rehabilitation and assistive technology \nfor individuals with significant and distinctive needs. Under the \ncompetitive acquisition program, thousands of individuals who require \ncustomized medical equipment may be forced to use ill-fitting products \nthat will inevitably increase discomfort, further limit functional \nability, and may even cause loss of function for these individuals who \nseek independence and mobility in their lives.\n  Let me give an example of how the competitive bidding program will \nhamper the ability of Medicare beneficiaries to access necessary \nrehabilitative and assistive technology. If a Medicare beneficiary has \nbeen diagnosed with muscular dystrophy and uses a power wheelchair due \nto the loss of muscle tone in the body, a wheelchair that is tailored \nto the individual is imperative for several reasons. Power wheelchairs \nthat are not adapted to the particular needs of the individual lead to \nmore than mere discomfort, but also can further worsening health. For \ninstance, individuals with muscular dystrophy may have wheelchairs that \nallow them to change positioning in order to breathe more comfortably. \nIn addition, these wheelchairs may also be adapted to accommodate other \nnecessary medical equipment, such as breathing ventilators. Yet with \nMedicare competitive bidding, the process will likely yield more \nuniform wheelchairs, leaving severely impaired beneficiaries with \nlimited options to meet their needs.\n  Our bill will remove complex rehabilitation and assistive technology \nproducts from the Medicare competitive bidding program. In a program \nintended to reduce costs through competition among suppliers providing \nmedical products, it is simply untenable to include such sophisticated \nand personalized equipment. We all agree that we must address Medicare \nspending, but restricting access to necessary products for the \nbeneficiaries that most require them is not the way to approach this \nissue--and may in fact increase costs.\n  I urge my colleagues to join with Senator Stabenow and myself in \nsupporting the Medicare Access to Complex Rehabilitation and Assistive \nTechnology Act of 2008 to support Medicare beneficiaries in receiving \nthe specialized medical equipment they so critically need.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague, \nSenator Olympia Snowe, in introducing the Medicare Access to Complex \nRehabilitation and Assistive Technology Act. This legislation will \nensure Medicare beneficiaries who need complex rehabilitation and \nassistive technology will continue to receive the highest level of \nservice and support necessary to maintain their independence. I am also \npleased to be joined by my good friend, Senator Tim Johnson, in this \neffort.\n  Competitive bidding, while well-intentioned, does not work well for \nitems that must be customized for individuals with complex and \nspecialized needs. Unlike some of the items being considered by CMS for \ncompetitive bidding, complex rehab technologies are not the sort of \nproducts that are easily interchangeable. For example, individuals with \nneuromuscular diseases--such as multiple sclerosis, ALS, cerebral \npalsy, or Parkinson's disease--or conditions such as spinal cord \ninjuries may require specialized services because of the profound and \nsometimes progressive nature of these conditions. Patients' access to \nassistive technology products for their unique needs could be in \njeopardy.\n  I am pleased that our legislation has the support of numerous patient \nadvocacy organizations. As co-chair of the Senate Parkinson's Caucus, I \nhave seen firsthand how assistive technology can make a difference in \nhelping a loved one achieve independence over a disease or disability. \nThe legislation we are introducing today will ensure that the wonders \nof medical technology will continue to be available to the Medicare \nbeneficiaries who need them the most.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SMITH (for himself, Mr. Conrad, and Mr. Kohl):\n  S. 2933. A bill to improve the employability of older Americans; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, on behalf of Senators Conrad and Kohl, I \nintroduce the Incentives for Older Workers Act of 2008.\n  The United States is about to experience an unprecedented demographic \nshift with the aging of the baby boomer generation. According to the \nU.S. Census Bureau, in 1980, individuals age 50 and older represented \n26 percent of the population. By 2050, this is expected to rise to 37 \npercent. In my home State of Oregon, residents age 65 and older are \nexpected to comprise 25 percent of the State population by 2025. This \nwill make Oregon the fourth oldest State in the country.\n  The aging of our population will have a significant impact on many \naspects\n\n[[Page S3511]]\n\nof our society, including our labor market. A 2007 Conference Board \nstudy reports that current retirement trends could create a U.S. labor \nshortage of 4.8 million workers in 10 years. According to Dr. Preston \nPulliams of Portland Community College, 53 percent of Oregon businesses \nreport that it is extremely or very likely that their organization will \nface a shortage of qualified workers during the next 5 years as a \nresult of the retirement of baby boomers.\n  The Incentives for Older Workers Act will help mitigate the effects \nof our aging workforce by providing incentives to older Americans to \nstay in the workforce longer, encouraging employers to recruit and \nretain older workers, and eliminating barriers to working longer. For \nexample, the current Work Opportunity Tax Credit allows employers \ncredits against wages for hiring individuals from one or more of nine \ntargeted groups, such as recipients of public assistance and high risk \nyouth. Our bill would extend that credit for employers that hire older \nworkers.\n  In addition, Social Security benefits are increased if retirement is \ndelayed beyond full retirement age. Increases based on delaying \nretirement no longer apply when people reach age 70, even if they \ncontinue to delay taking benefits. Our bill would allow people to earn \ndelayed retirement credits up until age 72, instead of age 70.\n  To collect, organize and disseminate information on older worker \nissues, the bill also would create a National Resource Center on Aging \nand the Workforce within the U.S. Department of Labor. This center \nwould act as a national information clearinghouse on workforce issues, \nchallenges and solutions for older workers.\n  The bipartisan Incentives for Older Workers Act will provide seniors \nwith the flexibility and opportunity to continue working in retirement \nif they choose to. I look forward to working with my colleagues to \nenact these important reforms. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2933\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to prevent the destruction of terrorist and criminal \nnational instant criminal background check system records; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Preserving \nRecords of Terrorist and Criminal Transactions, or PROTECT Act of 2008. \nI am proud to be joined by cosponsors Senators Feinstein, Levin, \nLieberman, Menendez, Reed, Schumer, and Whitehouse.\n  In 1994, we passed the Brady Law, which requires criminal background \nchecks for all guns sold by licensed firearm dealers. In the 14 years \nsince it was enacted, the Brady law has prevented more than 1.5 million \nfelons and other dangerous individuals from buying guns. I am proud to \nsay that more than 150,000 of those denials have been to convicted \ndomestic abusers because of a law I wrote in 1996.\n  Every time a Brady background check is conducted, the FBI's National \nInstant Criminal Background Check System--or NICS--creates an audit \nlog. The audit log includes information about the purchaser, the \nweapon, and the seller.\n  The information could be extremely valuable to the FBI. The agency \ncould use it to help determine whether gun dealers are complying with \nthe background check requirements, to help law enforcement fight crime \nby figuring out whether a criminal has been able to buy a gun, or even \nto help prevent terrorist attacks.\n  Yet, despite this information's value in fighting crime and \nterrorism, the FBI destroys the background check data.\n  In most cases, the audit log is destroyed within 24 hours after the \nsale is allowed to go through. That's because every year since 2004, a \nrider has been attached to appropriations bills mandating that the FBI \ndestroy the background check record within 24 hours of allowing the gun \nsale to proceed. That means that the purchaser's name, social security \nnumber, and all other personally identifying information are purged \nfrom the system within 24 hours.\n  Once this information is destroyed, the FBI can no longer run \nsearches using a person's name. So if a local law enforcement agency \nwere to call the FBI to see if a criminal on the loose had purchased \nany guns recently, the FBI would not be able to search its database \nusing the suspect's name if the gun was purchased two months, two \nweeks, or even two days earlier.\n  This destruction requirement hinders the FBI's ability to help the \nBureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives verify that gun \ndealers are conducting background checks properly.\n\n[[Page S3513]]\n\nBefore the destruction requirement, ATF could compare the NICS records \nto the paper records that gun dealers are required to keep on file to \ndetermine whether the dealers were submitting all the required \ninformation.\n\n  The destruction requirement also prevents the FBI from determining \nwhether a felon, fugitive, or other person who is prohibited from \nhaving a gun was able to purchase one in violation of the law, and to \nretrieve guns from people who are prohibited from having them. The FBI \nhas only three days to conduct background checks, and sometimes \nreceives information after already approving a sale that the purchaser \nwas legally prohibited from having a firearm. But without the \nbackground check information at hand, the FBI has no way of retrieving \nguns from these dangerous people who never should have been allowed to \npurchase them in the first place.\n  Prior to the 24-hour destruction requirement, the Government \nAccountability Office found that over a 6-month period the FBI used \nretained Brady background check records to initiate 235 actions to \nretrieve illegally possessed guns. According to GAO, 228--97 percent--\nof those retrieval actions would not have been possible under a 24-hour \ndestruction policy. Those are hundreds of guns in the hands of felons, \nfugitives and other dangerous people. We have the power to stop them, \nand we should use it.\n  Up until now, I have been talking about dangerous people who are \nprohibited from having guns under current federal law, such as felons, \nfugitives, and convicted domestic abusers. But there is one category of \nvery dangerous people who are allowed to purchase firearms under \ncurrent federal law-known and suspected terrorists. It is hard to \nbelieve, but nothing in our federal gun laws prevents known and \nsuspected terrorists from purchasing guns.\n  And we know that terrorists exploit this Terror Gap in our gun laws. \nIn a 2005 report that Senator Biden and I requested, GAO found that \nduring a four-month period in 2004, a total of 44 firearm purchase \nattempts were made by known or suspected terrorists. In 35 of those \ncases, the FBI authorized the transactions to proceed because FBI field \nagents were unable to find any disqualifying information within the \nfederally prescribed three-day background check period. I have \nintroduced another bill--the Denying Firearms and Explosives to \nDangerous Terrorists Act S. 1237--to close this Terror Gap, and I urge \nmy colleagues to support that bill as well.\n  Not only do our current laws allow terrorists to buy guns, but the \nFBI also destroys the background check records from terrorist gun \npurchases within 90 days. That means that a joint terrorism task force \nconducting a terror investigation over the course of months or even \nyears cannot call the FBI to find out if the target of the \ninvestigation--someone who is on the terror watch list--purchased \nfirearms last year.\n  The PROTECT Act would address both of these record retention problems \nby preserving records that are critical to effective background checks, \nlaw enforcement, and terrorism prevention. Specifically, it would:\n  (1) require the FBI to retain for 10 years all background check \nrecords involving a valid match to a terror watch list; and\n  (2) require the FBI to retain for at least 180 days all other \nbackground check records.\n  This is a common-sense public safety measure. At a time when 32 \npeople are murdered as a result of gun violence every day in the United \nStates and we are fighting against terrorism, the last thing we should \nbe doing is prematurely destroying a valuable anti-crime and anti-\nterrorism tool that we have at our fingertips.\n  At a Commerce, Justice, Science and Related Agencies Appropriations \nSubcommittee hearing last year, I asked FBI Director Robert Mueller if \nhe thought that background check records should be retained for more \nthan 24 hours. He replied, ``[T]here is a substantial argument in my \nmind for retaining records for a substantial period of time.'' That's \nwhat this bill would do, and I hope my Senate colleagues will join me \nin passing it swiftly.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRAHAM (for himself, Mr. Burr, Mr. McCain, Mr. Chambliss, \n        Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Cornyn, Mr. Alexander, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. \n        Martinez, Mr. Stevens, Mr. Cochran, Ms. Collins, Mr. Barrasso, \n        Mr. Domenici, Mrs. Dole, Mr. Wicker, Mr. Isakson, and Mr. \n        Inhofe):\n  S. 2938. A bill to amend titles 10 and 38, United States Code, to \nimprove educational assistance for members of the Armed Forces and \nveterans in order to enhance recruitment and retention for the Armed \nForces, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am very pleased to join today with \nSenator Lindsey Graham, the Ranking Member of the Personnel \nSubcommittee of the Senate Armed Services Committee, and Senator \nRichard Burr, the Ranking Member of the Senate Veterans Committee, in \nintroducing the Enhancement of Recruitment, Retention, and Readjustment \nThrough Education Act. This legislation, which is designed to greatly \nenhance veterans' education benefits, is also cosponsored by Senators \nChambliss, Lieberman, Cornyn, Alexander, Hutchison, Martinez, Stevens, \nCochran, Collins, Barrasso, Domenici, Dole, Wicker, and Isakson.\n  Mr. President, America has an obligation to provide unwavering \nsupport to America's veterans, servicemembers, and retirees. Men and \nwomen who have served their country deserve the best education benefits \nwe are able to give them, and they deserve to receive them as quickly \nas possible. And that is what our legislation is designed to \naccomplish.\n  The Enhancement of Recruitment, Retention, and Readjustment Through \nEducation Act would increase education benefits for servicemembers, \nveterans, and members of the Guard and Reserve. It would help \nfacilitate successful recruitment efforts and, importantly, encourage \ncontinued service in the military by granting a higher education \npayment for longer service. It also provides a transferability feature \nto allow the serviceman and woman to have the option of transferring \neducation benefits to their children and spouses. In developing this \nlegislation, the one theme we heard from almost every veterans' \nservices organization is the need for such a transferability provision.\n  As my colleagues know, our proposal is not the only measure that has \nbeen offered to increase GI education benefits, and I want to commend \nthe efforts of Senators Webb, Hagel, Warner and others on their work to \nbring this important issue to the forefront in the Senate, by the \nintroduction of S. 22. Each of us supports a revitalized GI program. \nWhile I don't think anyone disagrees with the overall intent of S. 22, \nI believe we can and should do more to promote recruitment and \nretention of servicemen and women and to ensure that veterans and their \nfamilies receive the education benefits they deserve, and in a timely \nmanner. But I remain very hopeful that we can all work together in a \nbipartisan manner to ensure that Congress enacts meaningful legislation \nthat will be signed into law as soon as possible.\n  Unlike S. 22, our legislation builds on the existing Montgomery GI \nBill educational benefits to ensure rapid implementation. Unlike S. 22, \nour bill focuses on the entire spectrum of military members who make up \nthe All Volunteer Force, from the newest recruit to the career NCOs, \nofficers, reservists and National Guardsmen, to veterans who have \ncompleted their service and retirees, as well as the families of all of \nthese individuals.\n  The legislation would immediately increase education benefits for \nactive duty personnel from $1100 to $1500 a month. To encourage careers \nin the military, the education benefits would increase to $2000 a month \nafter 12 or more years of service. Further, it would allow \na servicemember to transfer 50 percent of benefits to a spouse or child \nstarting after 6 years of service, and after 12 years of service, 100 \npercent may be transferred to a spouse or dependent children. This is a \nkey pro-retention provision. In addition, our bill would provide $500 \nannually for college books and supplies while our servicemembers are \ngoing to school.\n\n  The bill also would increase from $880 to $1200 per month the \neducation benefits for Guard and Reserve members called to active duty \nsince September\n\n[[Page S3514]]\n\n11, 2001. Further, it would gradually increase benefits to $1600 per \nmonth for those members of the Guard and Reserves who serve in the \nSelected Reserve for 12 years or more and who continue serving in the \nSelected Reserve.\n  Servicemembers who enlist after they have already received post-\nsecondary education degrees should also be allowed to benefit under an \nimproved GI Bill and be allowed to use their education benefits to \nrepay Federal student loans. Under our bill, servicemembers could use \nup to $6,000 per year of Montgomery G.I. Bill education benefits to \nrepay Federal student loans. And, it doubles from $317 to $634 the \neducation benefits for other members of the Guard and Reserves.\n  Our bill also recognizes the sacrifice of all who have served in the \nGlobal War on Terror, including members of the Guard and Reserve who \nare serving on active duty and deploying at historic rates by doubling \nthe educational assistance for members of the Selected Reserve and, \nagain, making the educational benefits transferable to family members.\n  Finally, I do think it is important that the Administration's views \non this important issue are taken into account. That is why earlier \nthis month, Senator Levin and I wrote to the Department of Defense \nseeking views on proposals to modernize the GI Bill.\n  Again, it is my hope that the proponents of the pending veteran's \neducation benefits measures can join together to ensure that Congress \nenacts meaningful legislation that the President will sign. Such \nlegislation should address the entire spectrum of the All Volunteer \nForce. It must be easily understood and implemented and responsive to \nthe needs not only of veterans, but also of those who are serving in \nthe active duty forces, the Guard and Reserve, and their families. \nTheir exemplary service to our nation, and the sacrifice of their \nfamilies, deserves no less.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter of support be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                     The Secretary of Defense,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 29, 2008.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Armed Services, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: you earlier asked for my views on S. \n     22. Since your request, two other bills have been introduced \n     (H.R. 5684 and, in the Senate, the Enhancement of \n     Recruitment, Retention, and Readjustment Through Education \n     Act of 2008). I welcome the opportunity to outline the \n     criteria the Department has established to evaluate specific \n     proposals, with the ultimate objective of strengthening the \n     All-Volunteer Force, as well as properly recognizing our \n     veterans' service.\n       Our first objective is to strengthen the All-Volunteer \n     force. Accordingly, it is essential to permit transferability \n     of unused education benefits from service members to family. \n     This is the highest priority set by the Service Chiefs and \n     the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, reflecting the \n     strong interest from the field and fleet. Transferability \n     supports military families, thereby enhancing retention. \n     Second, any enhancement of the education benefit, whether \n     used in service or after retirement, must serve to enhance \n     recruiting and not undercut retention.\n       Third, significant benefit increases need to be focused on \n     those willing to commit to longer periods of service--hence \n     the Department's interest in at least six years of service to \n     be eligible for transferability. Re-enlistments (and longer \n     service) are critical to the success of the All-Volunteer \n     Force. Fourth, the program should provide participants with \n     benefits tailored to their unique situation, thereby \n     broadening the population from which we retain and recruit. \n     This includes those whose past educational achievements have \n     resulted in education debt through student loans, and those \n     seeking advanced degrees and who may have earned \n     undergraduate degrees with Department of Defense support.\n       As you may well appreciate, a key issue is the \n     determination of the benefit level for the basic GI bill \n     program. The Department estimates that serious retention \n     issues could arise if the benefit were expanded beyond the \n     level sufficient to offset average monthly costs for a public \n     four-year institution (tuition, room, board, and fees). These \n     costs are presently estimated at about $1,500 according to \n     the National Center for Education Statistics. This would \n     still entail a substantial increase to the present benefit \n     value of $1,100.\n       An important corollary to the GI Bill is the recognition \n     that today, remaining in the military is entirely consistent \n     with the attainment of education goals. Unlike the past, our \n     nation now encourages the fulfillment of college aspirations \n     while serving, thus dealing with readjustment through up \n     front programs, rather than only after discharge. DoD invests \n     about $700 million annually to offer funded, education \n     tuition assistance for our servicemen and women while \n     serving. More than 400,000 members of the armed forces took \n     advantage of such tuition assistance last year.\n       In conclusion, for all these reasons, the Department does \n     not support S. 22. This legislation does not meet, and, in \n     some respects, is in direct variance to the Department's \n     above-stated objectives and supporting criteria.\n       Thank you for the opportunity to comment. We look forward \n     to working closely with the Congress to strengthen the All-\n     Volunteer force through a balanced program of recruiting, \n     retention and education benefits, and to recognize the \n     service of our veterans.\n\n           Sincerely,\n     Robert M.

Res. 540\n\n       Whereas, on September 17, 1787, the Constitution of the \n     United States was adopted, and article I, section 9 declared \n     that Congress could prohibit the importation of slaves into \n     the United States in the year 1808;\n       Whereas, in 1794, the United States Congress passed ``An \n     Act to prohibit the carrying on the Slave Trade from the \n     United States to any foreign place or country'', approved \n     March 22, 1794 (1 Stat. 347), thus beginning the efforts of \n     the United States to halt the slave trade;\n       Whereas, on May 10, 1800, Congress enacted a law that \n     outlawed all participation by people in the United States in \n     the international trafficking of slaves and authorized the \n     United States Navy to seize vessels flying the flag of the \n     United States engaged in the slave trade;\n       Whereas, on March 2, 1807, President Thomas Jefferson \n     signed into law ``An Act to prohibit the importation of \n     slaves into any port or place within the jurisdiction of the \n     United States, from and after the first of January, in the \n     year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and eight'' (2 \n     Stat. 426);\n\n[[Page S3515]]\n\n       Whereas, on January 1, 1808, the prohibition on the \n     importation of slaves into the United States took effect;\n       Whereas, on March 3, 1819, Congress authorized the Navy to \n     cruise the coast of Africa to suppress the slave trade, \n     declaring that Africans on captured ships be placed under \n     Federal jurisdiction and authorizing the President to appoint \n     an agent in Africa to facilitate the return of captured \n     Africans to the continent;\n       Whereas, in 1819, the Royal Navy of Great Britain \n     established the West Coast of Africa as a separate naval \n     station and actively plied the waters in pursuit of slave \n     ships, and Great Britain negotiated with many other countries \n     to obtain the right to search vessels suspected of engaging \n     in the slave trade;\n       Whereas, on May 15, 1820, Congress declared the trading of \n     slaves to be an act of piracy and that those convicted of \n     trading slaves were subject to the death penalty;\n       Whereas the Webster-Ashburton Treaty between Great Britain \n     and the United States, signed August 9, 1842, provided that \n     both countries would maintain separate naval squadrons on the \n     coast of Africa to enforce their respective laws against the \n     slave trade;\n       Whereas, in 1843, the newly formed United States African \n     Squadron sailed for Africa and remained in operation until \n     the Civil War erupted in 1861;\n       Whereas, in 1859, the USS  Constellation, the last all-sail \n     vessel designed and built by the United States Navy, sailed \n     to West Africa as the flagship of the United States African \n     Squadron, which consisted of 8 ships, including 4 steam-\n     powered vessels suitable for chasing down and capturing slave \n     ships;\n       Whereas, on December 21, 1859, the USS Constellation \n     captured the brig  Delicia after a 10-hour chase, and \n     although the Delicia had no human cargo on board upon \n     capture, the crew had been preparing the ship to take on \n     slaves;\n       Whereas, on the night of September 25, 1860, the USS \n     Constellation spotted the barque  Cora near the mouth of the \n     Congo River and, after a dramatic moonlit chase, captured the \n     slave ship with 705 Africans crammed into her permanent \n     ``slave deck'';\n       Whereas after capturing the Cora, a detachment of the  \n     Constellation's crew sailed the surviving Africans to \n     Monrovia, Liberia, a colony founded for the settlement of \n     free African Americans, which became the destination for all \n     Africans freed on slave ships captured by the United States \n     Navy;\n       Whereas, on May 21, 1861, the USS  Constellation captured \n     the brig Triton, and although the Triton did not have \n     Africans captured for slavery on board when intercepted by \n     the Constellation, a search confirmed that the ship had been \n     prepared to take on slaves;\n       Whereas the Triton, registered in Charleston, South \n     Carolina, was one of the first Union naval captures of the \n     Civil War;\n       Whereas, from 1859 to 1861, the USS Constellation and the \n     United States African Squadron captured 14 slave ships and \n     liberated nearly 4,000 Africans destined for a life of \n     servitude in the Americas, a record unsurpassed by the \n     squadron under previous commanders;

\n     and\n       (3) supports the USS Constellation as an appropriate site \n     for the Nation to commemorate the bicentennial of the \n     abolition of the transatlantic slave trade in 2008.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/29/senate-section/article/S3515-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3515-S3516]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 541--SUPPORTING HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE, PROTECTION \nOF CIVILIANS, ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ABUSES IN SOMALIA, AND URGING CONCRETE \n   PROGRESS IN LINE WITH THE TRANSITIONAL FEDERAL CHARTER OF SOMALIA \n   TOWARD THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A VIABLE GOVERNMENT OF NATIONAL UNITY\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD (for himself, Mr. Coleman, Mr. Brown, Ms. Klobuchar, and \nMr. Hagel) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S. Res. 541\n\n       Whereas, despite the formation of the internationally \n     recognized Transitional Federal Government (TFG) in 2004, \n     there has been little improvement in the governance or \n     stability of southern and central Somalia, and stability in \n     the northern region of Puntland has deteriorated;\n       Whereas governance failures in Somalia have permitted and \n     contributed to escalating violence, egregious human rights \n     abuses, and violations of international humanitarian law, \n     which occur with impunity and have led to an independent \n     system of roadblocks, checkpoints, and extortion that hinders \n     trade, business, and the delivery of desperately needed \n     humanitarian assistance;\n       Whereas the Government of Ethiopia intervened in Somalia in \n     December 2006 against the Islamic Courts Union (ICU) and \n     continues to serve as the primary security force for the TFG \n     in Somalia;\n       Whereas a United Nations Monitoring Group on Somalia report \n     presented to the United Nations Security Council on July 20, \n     2007, alleged that Eritreans have provided arms to insurgents \n     in Somalia as part of a long-standing dispute between \n     Ethiopia and Eritrea that includes a series of interlocking \n     proxy wars in the Horn of Africa;\n       Whereas the United Nations estimates that, as of April \n     2008, 2,000,000 people in Somalia need humanitarian \n     assistance or livelihood support for at least the next 6 \n     months, including 745,000 people who have fled ongoing \n     insecurity and sporadic violence in Mogadishu over the past \n     16 months, adding to more than 275,000 long-term internally \n     displaced Somalis;\n       Whereas, despite Prime Minister Nur Hassan Hussein's public \n     commitment to humanitarian operations, local and \n     international aid agencies remain hindered by extortion, \n     harassment, and administrative obstructions;\n       Whereas, in March 2008, United Nations Secretary-General \n     Ban Ki-moon presented his report on Somalia based on recent \n     strategic assessments and fact-finding missions, which \n     offered recommendations for increasing United Nations \n     engagement while decreasing the presence of foreign troops, \n     including the establishment of a maritime task force to deter \n     piracy and support the 1992 international arms embargo;\n       Whereas the United States Government has allocated nearly \n     $50,000,000 to support the African Union Mission in Somalia \n     (AMISOM) and continues to be the leading contributor of \n     humanitarian assistance in Somalia, with approximately \n     $140,000,000 provided in fiscal year 2007 and fiscal year \n     2008 to date, but still lacks a comprehensive strategy to \n     build a sustainable peace;\n       Whereas, over the last 5 years, the Senate has repeatedly \n     called upon the President through resolutions, amendments, \n     bills, oversight letters, and hearings to develop and \n     implement a comprehensive strategy to contribute to lasting \n     peace and security throughout the Horn of Africa by helping \n     to establish a legitimate, stable central government in \n     Somalia capable of maintaining the rule of law and preventing \n     Somalia from becoming a safe haven for terrorists;\n       Whereas a February 2008 Government Accountability Office \n     (GAO) report entitled, ``Somalia: Several Challenges Limit \n     U.S. and International Stabilization, Humanitarian, and \n     Development Efforts'', found that United States and \n     international ``efforts have been limited by lack of \n     security, access to vulnerable populations, and effective \n     government institutions'' as well as the fact that the ``U.S. \n     strategy for Somalia, outlined in the Administration's 2007 \n     report to Congress on its Comprehensive Regional Strategy on \n     Somalia, is incomplete'';\n       Whereas the recent designation by the Department of State \n     of Somali's al Shabaab militia as a foreign terrorist \n     organization under section 219 of the Immigration and \n     Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1189) and as a specially designated \n     global terrorist under section 1(b) of Executive Order 13224 \n     (September 23, 2001) highlights the growing need for a \n     strategic, multifaceted, and coordinated approach to Somalia; \n     and\n       Whereas it is in the interest of the United States, the \n     people of Somalia, and the citizens and governments of \n     neighboring and other interested countries to work towards a \n     legitimate peace and a sustainable resolution to the crisis \n     in Somalia that includes civilian protection and access to \n     services, upholds the rule of law, and promotes \n     accountability: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the United States remains committed to the people of \n     Somalia and to helping build the institutions necessary for a \n     stable nation free from civil war and violent extremism;\n       (2) the President, in partnership with the African Union, \n     the United Nations, and the international community, should--\n       (A) provide sufficient humanitarian assistance to those \n     most seriously affected by armed conflict, drought, and \n     flooding throughout Somalia, and call on the Transitional \n     Federal Government to actively facilitate the dispersal of \n     such assistance;\n       (B) ensure accountability for all state, non-state, and \n     external parties responsible for violations of human rights \n     and international humanitarian law in Somalia, including \n     through the deployment of United Nations human rights \n     monitors and the establishment of a United Nations Commission \n     of Inquiry to investigate abuses;\n       (C) call on all parties to recommit to an inclusive \n     dialogue, with international support, in the interest of \n     promoting sustainable peace and security in Somalia and \n     across the Horn of Africa;\n       (D) urge the Government of Ethiopia, in coordination with \n     the United Nations Political Office in Somalia, to develop a \n     clear timeline for the responsible withdrawal of its\n\n[[Page S3516]]\n\n     armed forces from Somalia, to honor its obligation under the \n     Geneva Conventions to ensure protection of civilians under \n     its control, and to observe the distinction between civilians \n     and military combatants and their assets;\n       (E) urge the Government of Eritrea to play a productive \n     role in helping to bring about stability to Somalia, \n     including ceasing to provide any financial and material \n     support, such as arms and ammunition, to insurgent groups in \n     and around Mogadishu and throughout the region; and\n       (F) call on all countries in the region and wider \n     international community to provide increased support for \n     AMISOM and ensure a robust civilian protection mandate;\n       (3) to achieve sustainable peace in the region, the \n     Transitional Federal Government, including the newly \n     appointed Prime Minister and his Cabinet, should--\n       (A) take necessary steps to protect civilians from dangers \n     related to military operations, investigate and prosecute \n     human rights abuses, provide basic services to all the people \n     of Somalia, and ensure that humanitarian organizations have \n     full access to vulnerable populations;\n       (B) recommit to the Transitional Federal Charter;\n       (C) set a detailed timeline and demonstrate observable \n     progress for completing the political transition laid out in \n     the Transitional Federal Charter by 2009, including concrete \n     and immediate steps toward scheduling elections as a means of \n     establishing a democratically elected government that \n     represents the people of Somalia; and\n       (D) agree to participate in an inclusive and transparent \n     political process, with international support, towards the \n     formation of a government of national unity based on the \n     principles of democracy, accountability, and the rule of law.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, one month ago I urged greater U.S. and \ninternational action to end the horrific violence plaguing Somalia and \nto press for a political solution that will lead to a sustainable peace \nin this war-torn country and stability for the volatile Horn of Africa \nregion. Today, relentless violence in Somalia's capital, Mogadishu, is \nworsening the humanitarian and human rights crisis faced by hundreds of \nthousands of Somali civilians, while Islamist militias have gained \nsubstantial territorial control in south and central Somalia and Somali \npirates are wreaking havoc off the country's coast. In the past few \ndays, a range of actors from the UN's Under Secretary-General for \nHumanitarian Affairs to Human Rights Watch, and even Pope Benedict, \nhave issued urgent appeals for an end to the lawless violence in \nSomalia.\n  Today, I am introducing a resolution that will add the U.S. Senate to \nthe list of those calling for the protection of civilians and a \nrecommitment to the ideals and implementation of the 2004 Transitional \nFederal Charter. The resolution I am introducing--along with Senators \nColeman, Brown, and Klobuchar--acknowledges the good work the U.S. has \ndone, including the allocation of nearly $50 million to support the \nAfrican Union peacekeepers in Somalia. The U.S. continues to be the \nleading humanitarian contributor, with more than $140 million in \nhumanitarian assistance since the Ethiopians went into Somalia in \nDecember 2006.\n  This most recent ``emergency'' response to the situation in Somalia \nhas now gone on for sixteen months and yet conditions on the ground \nhave deteriorated significantly, with some experts claiming Mogadishu \nis worse now than it has been since the civil war began in the early \n1990s. It is clear our current policy towards Somalia is not working--\nand we can no longer rely on temporary measures to stitch the crisis \ntogether.\n  This new Senate resolution aims to refocus U.S. and international \nattention on the medium- and long-term priorities, namely, our \ncommitment to helping Somalis build the institutions and conditions \nnecessary for a stable nation free from civil war and violent \nextremism. The resolution reflects information gleaned from a hearing I \nheld last month in the Senate Subcommittee on African Affairs, in which \nexpert witnesses stressed the need for an inclusive regional political \nprocess that facilitates dialogue and accountability.\n  I will continue to demand a U.S. and international strategy to bring \nstability and security to Somalia until there is evidence that an \neffective plan exists and is being implemented in a consistent and \ncoordinated fashion. For the sake of the people of Somalia and the \nreputation of the U.S. and the international community--not to mention \nour own national security--it is vital to reinvigorate a political \nprocess and stimulate legitimate progress towards that end. Given our \nhistoric role on the Horn of Africa and the critical national security \nconcerns emanating from this part of the world, I encourage my \ncolleagues to join me in calling upon the U.S. administration, other \nforeign donors, the Transitional Federal Government of Somalia, and \nother leaders in the region to end Somalia's descent into instability \nby facilitating political negotiations to address the need for \naccountability and the rule of law, and to prevent future suffering.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/29/senate-section/article/S3516-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3516]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 4579.

Res. 515\n\n       Whereas, between 1975 and 1979, Dith Pran dedicated his \n     life and journalistic career to preventing genocide by \n     exposing the atrocities perpetrated by the Khmer Rouge regime \n     in his native Cambodia;\n       Whereas Dith Pran, the subject of the Academy Award-winning \n     film ``The Killing Fields'', survived the genocide in \n     Cambodia in which up to 2,000,000 men, women, and children, \n     including most of Dith Pran's extended family, were killed by \n     the Khmer Rouge;\n       Whereas Dith Pran assisted many of his fellow journalists \n     who were covering the impending takeover of Cambodia by the \n     Khmer Rouge to escape unharmed from the country when the \n     capital of Cambodia, Phnom Penh, fell to the Khmer Rouge in \n     1975;\n       Whereas Dith Pran was subsequently imprisoned by the Khmer \n     Rouge, and for 4 years endured forced labor, beatings, and \n     unconscionable conditions of human suffering;\n       Whereas, in 1979, Dith Pran escaped from forced labor past \n     the Khmer Rouge's ``killing fields'', a term Mr. Dith created \n     to describe the mass graveyards he saw on his 40-mile journey \n     to a refugee camp in Thailand;\n       Whereas Dith Pran, in the words of New York Times Executive \n     Editor Bill Keller, ``reminds us of a special category of \n     journalistic heroism, the local partner, the stringer, the \n     interpreter, the driver, the fixer, who knows the ropes, who \n     makes your work possible, who often becomes your friend, who \n     may save your life, who shares little of the glory, and who \n     risks so much more than you do'';\n       Whereas Dith Pran moved to New York in 1980 and devoted the \n     remainder of his life and journalistic career to advocating \n     against genocide and for human rights worldwide;\n       Whereas Dith Pran educated people around the world about \n     the horrors of genocide in general, and the genocide in \n     Cambodia in particular, through his creation of the Dith Pran \n     Holocaust Awareness Project;\n\n[[Page S3550]]\n\n       Whereas, in 1985, Dith Pran was appointed a United Nations \n     Goodwill Ambassador by the United Nations High Commissioner \n     for Refugees;\n       Whereas Dith Pran lost his battle with cancer on March 30, \n     2008, leaving behind a world that better understands the \n     tragedy of the genocide in Cambodia and the need to prevent \n     future genocides, largely due to his compelling story, \n     reporting, and advocacy;\n       Whereas Dith Pran said, ``Part of my life is saving life. I \n     don't consider myself a politician or a hero. I'm a \n     messenger. If Cambodia is to survive, she needs many \n     voices.''; and\n       Whereas the example of Dith Pran should endure for \n     generations: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) Dith Pran is a modern day hero and an exemplar of what \n     it means to be a citizen of the United States and a citizen \n     of the world;\n       (2) the United States owes a debt of gratitude to Dith Pran \n     for his tireless work to prevent genocide and violations of \n     fundamental human rights; and\n       (3) teachers throughout the United States should spread \n     Dith Pran's message by educating their students about his \n     life, the genocide in Cambodia, and the collective \n     responsibility of all people to prevent modern-day atrocities \n     and human rights abuses.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/29/senate-section/article/S3550-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3550]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             REGARDING THE POLITICAL SITUATION IN ZIMBABWE\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ.

Res. 533\n\n       Whereas, on March 29, 2008, parliamentary and presidential \n     elections were held in Zimbabwe amid widespread reports of \n     voting irregularities in favor of the ruling Zimbabwe African \n     National Union-Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF) party and President \n     Robert Mugabe, including, according to the Department of \n     State, ``production of far more ballots than there were \n     registered voters. . .[and] the allowance of police in \n     polling places'';\n       Whereas official results showed that the opposition \n     Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) won a majority of seats \n     in the parliamentary elections, and independent monitors \n     concluded based on initially posted results that MDC leader \n     Morgan Tsvangirai received substantially more votes than \n     President Mugabe in the presidential election;\n       Whereas, as of April 24, 2008, the Zimbabwe Electoral \n     Commission has still not released the results of the \n     presidential election, despite calls to do so by the African \n     Union (AU), the European Union, the Government of South \n     Africa, the Southern African Development Community (SADC), \n     United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki Moon, and the United \n     States;\n       Whereas, on April 19, 2008, the Zimbabwe Electoral \n     Commission officially commenced recounting ballots cast in 23 \n     parliamentary constituencies, primarily in districts that did \n     not support candidates affiliated with ZANU-PF;\n       Whereas, on April 21, 2008, British Foreign Secretary David \n     Miliband stated that the ongoing recount was potentially a \n     ``charade of democracy'' that ``only serves to fuel suspicion \n     that President Mugabe is seeking to reverse the results that \n     have been published, to regain a majority in parliament, and \n     to amplify his own count in the presidential election,'' and \n     accused him of trying ``to steal the election'';\n       Whereas, the Government of Zimbabwe has arrested numerous \n     members of the media and election officials, and over 1,000 \n     Zimbabweans have reportedly been fleeing into South Africa \n     every day, while forces loyal to the government have engaged \n     in a brutal and systematic effort to intimidate voters;\n       Whereas, on April 20, 2008, the MDC released a detailed \n     report showing that more than 400 of its supporters had been \n     arrested, 500 had been attacked, 10 had been killed, and \n     3,000 families had been displaced, and Human Rights Watch \n     reported on April 19, 2008, that ZANU-PF is operating \n     ``torture camps'' where opposition supporters are being \n     beaten;\n       Whereas United States Ambassador to the United Nations \n     Zalmay Khalilzad stated on April 16, 2008, that he was \n     ``gravely concerned about the escalating politically \n     motivated violence perpetrated by security forces and ruling \n     party militias'';\n       Whereas, while there is currently no international embargo \n     on arms transfers to Zimbabwe, a Chinese ship carrying \n     weapons destined for Zimbabwe was recently prevented from \n     unloading its cargo in Durban, South Africa, and has been \n     denied access to other ports in the region due to concerns \n     that the weapons could further destabilize the situation in \n     Zimbabwe;\n       Whereas Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice stated on April \n     17, 2008, that President Mugabe has ``done more harm to his \n     country than would have been imaginable. . .the last years \n     have been really an abomination. . .,'' and called for the AU \n     and SADC to play a greater role in resolving the crisis;\n       Whereas, the Department of State's 2007 Country Report on \n     Human Rights Practices stated that, in Zimbabwe, ``the ruling \n     party's dominant control and manipulation of the political \n     process through intimidation and corruption effectively \n     negated the right of citizens to change their government. \n     Unlawful killings and politically motivated abductions \n     occurred. State sanctioned use of excessive force increased, \n     and security forces tortured members of the opposition, \n     student leaders, and civil society activists''; and\n       Whereas annual inflation in Zimbabwe is reportedly running \n     over 150,000 percent, unemployment stands at over 80 percent, \n     hunger affects over 4,000,000 people, and an estimated 3,500 \n     people die each week from hunger, disease, and other causes \n     related to extremely poor living conditions: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate--\n       (1) to support the people of Zimbabwe, who have been \n     subjected to incredible hardships, including violence, \n     political repression, and severe economic deprivation, in \n     their aspirations for a free, democratic, and more prosperous \n     future;\n       (2) to call for an immediate cessation of politically \n     motivated violence, detentions, and efforts to intimidate the \n     people of Zimbabwe perpetrated by Zimbabwe's security forces \n     and militias loyal to ZANU-PF;\n       (3) that the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission should \n     immediately release the legitimate results of the \n     presidential election and ratify the previously announced \n     results of the parliamentary elections;\n       (4) that President Robert Mugabe should accept the will of \n     the people of Zimbabwe in order to effect a timely and \n     peaceful transition to genuine democratic rule;\n       (5) that regional organizations, including SADC and the AU, \n     should play a sustained and active role in resolving the \n     crisis peacefully and in a manner that respects the will of \n     the people of Zimbabwe;\n       (6) that the United Nations Security Council should be \n     seized of the issue of Zimbabwe, support efforts to bring \n     about a peaceful resolution of the crisis that respects the \n     will of the people of Zimbabwe, and impose an international \n     arms embargo on Zimbabwe until a legitimate democratic \n     government has taken power;\n       (7) that the United States Government and the international \n     community should impose targeted sanctions against additional \n     individuals in the Government of Zimbabwe and state security \n     services and militias in Zimbabwe who are responsible for \n     human rights abuses and interference in the legitimate \n     conduct of the elections in Zimbabwe; and\n       (8) that the United States Government and the international \n     community should work together to prepare a comprehensive \n     economic and political recovery package for Zimbabwe in the \n     event that a genuinely democratic government is formed and \n     commits to implementing key constitutional, economic, and \n     political reforms.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/29/senate-section/article/S3550-2", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3550]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ORDERS FOR WEDNESDAY, APRIL 30, 2008\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ.
