Mr. President, this is an important week not only because \nwe are going to finish the housing bill this week but also because \nGeneral Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker will testify. There are a \nnumber of questions they must be asked by Members of the Senate. The \nfirst one is will our troops come home soon or when will our troops \ncome home. And I think they should be asked if the Iraq war has made \nAmerica safer.\n  When the surge began more than a year ago, President Bush labeled the \nstrategy ``return on success.'' As the surge succeeds, according to the \nPresident, our troops would come home. We\n\n[[Page S2620]]\n\nare already hearing General Petraeus has recommended to freeze the \ntroop levels. In fact, there will be more troops after the freeze takes \nplace than before the surge started. I assume President Bush will \naccept this request by General Petraeus. By the President's own \nmeasure, without our troops returning, there will be no success.\n  General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker will be asked a number of \nother questions. We have seen what happened a week or 10 days ago in \nBasra: al-Sadr was attacked by the Iraqi armed services. Al-Maliki, the \nleader of Iraq, didn't notify the American troops or anyone else and \nsimply took off after al-Sadr. That attack was basically a failure. The \npolice didn't police. The Iraqi police didn't police. At least 1,000 \nIraqi soldiers laid down their arms and quit. In fact, they didn't lay \ndown their arms, they gave them over to al-Sadr's forces. Because of \nthat, British artillery was asked to engage, and they did. U.S. troops \nwere asked to come in, and they did. U.S. air support was asked to come \nin, and they did. We lost a number of soldiers and a significant number \nof soldiers were wounded.\n  As some of my colleagues will recall, when this attack by al-Maliki's \nforces took place, President Bush said: This is what it is all about. \nThis shows the success of what I have been telling everyone.\n  Our troops in Iraq face a civil war that is growing more violent by \nthe day--by the day. Any notion of renewed commitment to peace among \nIraqi factions is betrayed by the news every day. Yesterday, five \nAmerican soldiers were killed. In one attack, 2 were killed and 31 were \nwounded.\n  General Petraeus has to be asked the question: Why is this happening? \nThe battle, as we see in the papers today, is intensifying between al-\nSadr and al-Maliki. We have heard today's news that the Sunnis are \nbecoming more violent. The Green Zone, which is supposed to be a safe \nhaven, the safest part of Iraq, has seen a series of attacks over the \nlast couple weeks. People have been killed in the Green Zone. Our \nsoldiers are now being killed in the Green Zone.\n  The chorus for a smarter strategy in Iraq is growing among defense \nand military experts. COL John Gentile, a West Point history professor \nwho has served two tours of duty in Iraq, has said directly about \nPetraeus's action in Iraq, as reported in headline news today in the \nWall Street Journal, among other things:\n\n       We've come up with this false narrative, this incorrect \n     explanation of what is going on in Iraq. We've come to see \n     counterinsurgency as the solution to every problem and we're \n     losing the ability to wage any other kind of war.\n\n  General Petraeus must respond to the criticism of Lieutenant Colonel \nGentile.\n  General Petraeus is responsible solely for the conditions in Iraq. He \nhas responsibilities nowhere else. But others, including Secretary \nGates, Admiral Mullen and Congress and the President must consider Iraq \nin the context of America's interests throughout the world. So General \nPetraeus must be asked: Has the war made us safer?\n  Based on every measure, the answer is a resounding no. Because of \nIraq, our military's readiness for full-spectrum combat is stretched \ndangerously thin and becoming more so every day. Our troops are serving \ntheir second, third, fourth, fifth--and some are believed to be headed \nto Iraq for the sixth time. This is taking a tremendous toll on them \nand their families and the overall status of our military.\n  We are not ready for an unexpected crisis that could arise overnight \nsomeplace other than Iraq. Each additional tour results in \nsubstantially higher rates of post-traumatic stress disorder. On one \ntour, 12 percent of the soldiers are coming back with post-traumatic \nstress disorder; three of four tours, approaching 30 percent.\n  I, in my office last Friday, was leaving, and a young man and his \nwife were there with a baby. The young man married this very pretty \nlady, his wife, the mother of his child, when he was 15. She was 19. He \njoined the Army and went to Iraq. I said: How are you doing? He said: \nNot very well. These were his words: My cognitive abilities are gone. \nHe is having trouble thinking. That is what post-traumatic stress \ndisorder is all about.\n  The military is in such dire need of recruits. I can remember when I \npracticed law I did some criminal defense work. One of the things we \nwould try with some of these young men who were in trouble was to see \nif we could get them in the military. The answer was no; they had \ncriminal records. It is not the case anymore. If you haven't graduated \nfrom high school, the military will still take you. If you have \ncommitted a felony or a serious crime, the military will still take \nyou. In fact, one out of every eight of our new recruits--that is 13 \npercent--have received a waiver for past criminal misconduct. Some of \nthese are felons, these people who are going into the military after \nhaving committed a crime. But even with these people who have no high \nschool diploma, those who have been involved in serious crimes, we are \nstill struggling in meeting our recruitment goals.\n  As has been reported in all the print press and the electronic media \ntoday, we are losing our combat-hardened leaders, those with \nexperience--sergeants, captains. There was a good report on the radio \nthis morning about what are we going to do for colonels and generals 15 \nyears from now, if all the captains are leaving.\n  We recognize General Petraeus's responsibility is Iraq, but in these \nhearings, these meetings with General Petraeus, he is going to have to \nunderstand we have taken our eye off the ball in other crucial areas of \nthe world, including Afghanistan, Pakistan, North Korea, Iran, all \nthrough the Middle East. America's No. 1 enemy, bin Laden, remains \nfree. Al-Qaida is going strong. Because of Iraq, courageous men and \nwomen of our National Guard don't have the manpower and equipment to do \ntheir job and protect us here at home. Because of Iraq, our moral \nauthority is lost in the eyes of many. Our foreign allies are unwilling \nto stand by our side. General Petraeus is going to have to respond to \nsome of these questions: When will our troops come home? Has the Iraq \nwar made our country safer? These are the questions that matter. The \nAmerican people deserve a fair assessment of both.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/07/senate-section/article/S2620-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2620]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I thank the majority leader for his kind \nwords about the housing bill that is before us. This is the measure on \nwhich we are working on a bipartisan basis to deal with what is one of \nthe most serious economic problems we face today in America and across \nthe world. There has been so much subprime mortgage paper put out from \nadjustable rate mortgages and teaser mortgages in the United States \nthat it has gone into financial systems in many countries, and they are \nfacing similar problems to the ones our financial system faces here.\n  I believe there are a lot of steps that are important that we take at \nthe macro levels, things the Federal Reserve does and what the Treasury \ncan do and what the government-regulated, government-sponsored entities \ncan do. But it is also my firm belief that this problem is one that we \nare going to have to save community by community, neighborhood by \nneighborhood, and family by family. That is why I have an amendment \nfiled today, Bond amendment No. 3436, to avoid these problems in the \nfuture.\n\n  I have listened to a lot of homeowners, and one of the real problems \nwe have is right now there is not a clear and simple disclosure of \npayments and interest rates for adjustable rate loans with the so-\ncalled teaser rates. The teaser loans with interest rates and payments \nthat jump up to unaffordable levels played a large part\n\n[[Page S2621]]\n\nin the current subprime mortgage crisis. Many potential borrowers \neither did not understand what they were getting into or were falsely \nassured that everything would be OK. That is a part of bringing relief \nto families and neighborhoods suffering through the current housing \nfinance crisis. I want to ensure we do not face another crisis in the \nfuture because we did not correct the problem.\n  For those of us who have taken out a mortgage loan to buy or \nrefinance a home, we know what a pile of paperwork we face and all the \nlegal jargon. I am a recovering attorney. I have had the experience of \nhaving that stack of papers--enough to choke a horse--put down in front \nof me, and the real estate agent, whoever is there, just says: Sign \nthis, sign this, sign this, sign this, sign this. About 40 minutes \nlater, you are dizzy from signing, and nothing in those papers clearly \ntells you what you are getting into. That is why we passed the original \nTruth in Lending Act and applied it to home mortgage loans. We knew \nthen that most people did not take the time to read and understand the \nfine print in mortgage loan documents.\n  Regrettably, the consumer protections in the original Truth in \nLending Act were written long ago and are outdated--woefully outdated. \nThey were written when most bought a home with a 30-year fixed rate \nmortgage. Now--and this is a good thing--there are many more loan tools \nto help people share in the dream of home ownership. There are \nadjustable rate mortgages, adjustable rate mortgages with initial fixed \nterms, sometimes called teasers, prepayment penalties, refinance \noptions, quicker and easier than ever before. But while more choices \ncan be a good thing, uneducated consumers or consumers who do not have \nassistance in understanding that information may not understand that \nwhat they are doing is falling into a trap.\n  I want to see the disclosures laid out simply so that nobody is \ncaught in a trap the way one of my constituents, Willie Clay of Kansas \nCity, MO, and his family were caught. I shared Willie's story on the \nfloor a month ago when we first introduced the SAFE Act, Security \nAgainst Foreclosure and Education Act, a relief bill, which forms the \nbasis of the Dodd-Shelby bill before us.\n  Willie lives in a working-class Kansas City neighborhood of modest \nranch homes called Ruskin Heights. He was a Vietnam war paratrooper, \nliving largely on disability payments. He refinanced a mortgage in 2004 \nfor a total of $101,000. As we can see, Willie is a man of modest \nmeans. He was not a speculator gambling on the housing market; he was \nnot an investor buying a vacation home; he just wanted to live in a \ndecent home. He was looking for extra money to pay off his medical \nbills, car loans, and some credit cards, and he agreed to a subprime \nadjustable rate loan with an initial fixed rate of 8.2 percent. For \nseveral years, everything went fine. He made the payments, honored his \nagreement. Then, last October, the initial fixed rate ended and the \nloan reset to a variable rate. Given the condition of the market at the \ntime, his new interest rate became 11.2 percent and then was set to \nrise again in March to 12.2 percent, with more rises coming.\n  Willie told the Kansas City Star:\n\n       If the rates go up again, I can't afford it.\n\n  Willie and his wife Ina would have to give up their home and move \ninto an apartment. Willie now admits that he never fully understood how \nan adjustable rate worked when he agreed to the new loan. I will tell \nyou, Mr. Clay, don't feel alone. There are a lot of people who do not \nunderstand the terms of their mortgage, and it is far too confusing \nunder the system we have now.\n  He said:\n\n       I don't have the education to understand it. And they \n     didn't explain it to me. I thought if the interest [rate] \n     went down, your payment went down. If the interest rate went \n     up, your payment stayed the same.\n\n  Willie was now facing a mortgage payment 50 percent higher than when \nhe started. He was trapped in his loan because there was a $2,500 \nprepayment penalty, which prevented him from getting out. This is not \njust Willie Clay's family crisis. The entire neighborhood is suffering \nthrough this housing crisis. There are more than 500 foreclosures in \nhis ZIP Code alone. On Willie's block, there are already several empty \nhouses.\n  Foreclosed homes are dragging property values down for everyone. It \nis becoming a self-perpetuating downward spiral. That is why I felt so \nstrongly about how we need to help these suffering families and \nneighborhoods. That is why we introduced the original Security Against \nForeclosure and Education Act.\n  The ``e,'' for education, focused on language meant to prevent this \nproblem in the future, and that is the subject of the amendment that \nwill be before us when we return to the bill.\n  My amendment, representing the disclosure requirements from the SAFE \nAct that were not transferred to the Dodd-Shelby substitute, updates \nthe Truth in Lending Act to modern times.\n  The Bond amendment will apply to adjustable rate mortgages with an \noriginal fixed or teaser rate. This is the kind of loan Willie Clay had \nand millions of Americans across the country hold. For these types of \nadjustable rate loans with teasers, lenders or brokers will be required \nto provide in large, prominent type the loan's fixed interest rate, the \ninitial fixed payment, and the date on which the fixed rate will \nexpire. The lender or broker will also need to provide an estimate of \nwhat the payment will be when the loan resets from its initial teaser \nrate to a floating adjustable rate. For many subprime borrowers lured \nwith a low teaser rate, this jump can be quite large, and borrowers \nshould be aware of it. If they are not aware of it, then they should \nnot be permitted to do the loan.\n  What we are saying is, put the critical dollars-and-cents items in \nlarge type on the first one or two pages. Don't bury this in a whole \nbunch of legal mumbo-jumbo that we lawyers--my colleagues who are still \nlawyers--love to write to make sure we cover every possible \ncontingency.\n  The Bond amendment also requires lenders to disclose that there is no \nguarantee the loan can be refinanced before the initial fixed rate \nexpires. Too many of the people in this trap now have said and told me \nand others that they were told there was no problem to refinance. Yes, \nthere is a problem, and a lot of borrowers were caught when they found \nout they could not refinance. They did not know how high their rates \ncould go after the teaser rate expired. Any concern they had that they \ncould not afford their loan in the future was put to rest by the broker \nwith a reassurance that there was no problem refinancing the loan \nbefore the teaser rate expired. For many, this turned out to be true, \nbut when the credit market seized up and loan standards were raised, \nthe rest were caught in this squeeze.\n  The amendment I will ask this body to adopt requires a disclosure \nthat there is no guarantee the borrower will be able to refinance the \nloan when the teaser rate expires.\n  The Bond amendment also requires disclosure of any prepayment \npenalty, the amount, and its expiration date. Prepayment penalties is \nwhat caught Willie Clay and his family. While prepayment penalties can \nbe good, giving certainty to the lender, who can in turn provide a \nlower interest rate, people need to be aware of what they are getting \ninto and how it will be costly to get out.\n  That is the theme of this entire amendment. It does not block \nadjustable rate mortgages. It does not block initial fixed rates. It \nallows prepayment penalties, an opportunity to refinance quickly.\n  The advantages in the mortgage business have been good for consumers, \nallowing a new generation of home buyers to share the American dream. \nIt just requires plain disclosure of loan terms so that people will \nknow what they are getting into.\n  Some may ask why we need to be prescriptive in telling brokers what \nto say and regulators what to require. That is because in this \nsituation, current protections and oversight have failed. Brokers and \nlenders did not do enough to disclose to and educate consumers. \nRegulators also failed here, and they continue to fail. Neither HUD nor \nthe Fed required disclosure of these terms in the past, neither sought \nto increase disclosures when the subprime crisis started, and neither's \nmost recent proposal takes this on.\n  The American consumer cannot wait while the bureaucracy, slow to move\n\n[[Page S2622]]\n\nbefore, further delays and equivocates on what must be done now. What \nmust be done is simple, straightforward disclosure of the most basic \nloan terms--rate, payment, new rate, new payment, penalties, and \nguarantees.\n  These are basic consumer protections which I expect will help prevent \na future home loan crisis and trapping of a large number of American \nfamilies who are caught in this situation now. I urge my colleagues to \nadopt them and to support the Bond amendment when it is brought up.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/07/senate-section/article/S2622-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2622-S2624]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             HOUSING CRISIS\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I know the subject is housing. We will \nhave a fair amount of discussion about the legislation on the floor of \nthe Senate today, tomorrow, and later this week when we begin voting on \nit. I wish to start by talking about what got us into this mess because \nit seems to me, if what we are doing at the moment is trying to \nevaluate what we do with the difficulties that exist and the \ndifficulties that confront us and do not deal with the underlying \ncause, we will have missed something very important.\n  The other day, I came to the floor and talked about what was \nhappening in the mortgage industry. What was happening, of course, was \nan unbelievable amount of greed, unbelievable speculation, and the \nresult is this occurrence of subprime loans proliferated across the \ncountry, and then it collapsed. We have investment banks that are about \nto go broke. We have the Federal Reserve Board coming in with a safety \nnet, saying: We will have the taxpayers bail out the investment banks. \nAll of this going on while the Federal Reserve Board, which did its \nbest imitation of a potted plant on these issues, began reducing \ninterest rates and then antes up $30 billion so the American taxpayers \ncould inherit the risk so JPMorgan could buy Bear Stearns. All of this \nhas occurred in recent months.\n  What started it? A lot of things started it. Let me give some \nexamples.\n  This is from an advertisement on radio and television. It is from \nZoom Credit. I don't know Zoom Credit company. But here is what they \nsaid when they advertised their services to unsuspecting buyers. They \nsaid:\n\n       Credit approval is just seconds away. Get on the fast track \n     at Zoom Credit. At the speed of light, Zoom Credit will \n     preapprove you. Even if your credit's in the tanks. Zoom \n     Credit's like money in the bank. Zoom Credit specializes in \n     credit repair and debt consolidation. Bankruptcy, slow \n     credit, no credit--who cares?\n\n  That is what they were advertising: Let us give you a loan. You have \nbeen bankrupt, you can't make your payments, come to Zoom Credit. Does \nit sound like a business model that makes sense to anybody? Not to me.\n  Millennia Mortgage. I don't know this company. Here is what they were \nadvertising:\n\n       Twelve months, no mortgage payment. That's right. We will \n     give you the money to make your first 12 payments if you call \n     in the next 7 days. We pay it for you. Our loan program may \n     reduce your current monthly payment by as much as 50 percent \n     and allow you no payments for the first 12 months.\n\n  They say: Come and get your home loan from us. You won't have to make \na payment for 12 months. We will make it for you. What it doesn't say \nis it goes on the back of the loan and increases the price of that \nhouse.\n  Countrywide was the biggest mortgage company in America, and now it \nhas been acquired by Bank of America. Here is what Countrywide said:\n\n       Do you have less than perfect credit? Do you have late \n     mortgage payments? Have you been denied by other lenders? \n     Call us. . . .\n\n  Are you a bad credit risk? Call us, we are going to lend you some \nmoney. That is unbelievable to me.\n  So you ask, how did we get into this mess? Let me continue.\n  Lowest fixed rate loan in America, they are advertising on this one. \nOne-quarter of 1 percent; that is a twenty-five-hundredths of 1 percent \ninterest rate. A $200,000 home loan, a monthly payment of $41.66. You \nwant to borrow half a million dollars; pay $146.16 a month?\n\n  Is that a business plan from a mortgage company? It doesn't look to \nme like it is. This, by the way, came off the Internet today. The \nreason I am mentioning it is, nothing has changed. They are still doing \nit.\n  This says First Premier Mortgage. One hundred percent loans you get, \nconforming loans. We will offer conforming loans. Perfect credit, by \nthe way, isn't required. So on the Internet you can go to First Premier \nMortgage. Perfect credit isn't required. If you have less than perfect \ncredit, we have loans that will allow you to qualify for a competitive \ninterest rate. You can consolidate everything.\n  So don't worry, perfect credit is not required to borrow from this \ncompany.\n  This is Florida Mortgage Corporation. This is Monday, April 7, 2008. \nThat is today. Go to the Internet today. Here is what they tell you. \nEach month you will receive a loan statement. We have a 30-year fixed \nmortgage that is available to you--30-year fixed mortgage. By the way, \nno income verification.\n  What does that mean? It says: Come to us, borrow some money, we will \ngive you a 30-year fixed mortgage. You can pay up to 2.75 percent \ninterest rate and, by the way, no income verification. We will not have \nto verify your income to give you a big old fat home mortgage. Isn't \nthat unbelievable? Not credit score driven.\n  This is on the Internet today. Nothing is changing. This one is on \nthe Internet today as well: OptionArmConsultants.com. They make this \nsound like this is a terrific loan. You can lower your mortgage payment \nby 50 percent or more per month. You can control up to two or three \ntimes as much real estate as other fixed mortgages. It is saying: Hey, \ncome over here, get a mortgage from us, that way you can speculate, own \nmore real estate.\n  None of these have indicated to the borrower what the terms really \nare. These are all seductive approaches that say: Come and get a \nmortgage from us. You don't need good credit. You can have bad credit. \nYou can be bankrupt. Come and borrow money from us.\n  What they do not say is they are going to throw all those extra \ncharges on the back of the mortgage. They do not tell them when it \nresets later they will not be able to pay the mortgage payment.\n  So that is what has happened. I have heard the largest reset of \nmortgages is going to occur in the fourth quarter of this year. But \nwhat has happened is, millions of families took out these mortgages. \nWere they wrong? Yes, they were wrong. But was the advertising for this \ndeceptive? I believe it was. So millions of families took out a \nmortgage without understanding the consequences.\n  They said: Come and get a mortgage from us. Twenty-five-hundredths of \n1 percent interest rate, we will pay the payments for the first 12 \nmonths--not describing to them, of course, what the reset is going to \nbe on interest rates 3 years from now or 2 years from now.\n  So what happens? Well, what happens is they stick these mortgages in \nwhat they call subprimes. And, by the way, one-half of the folks who \nwere put into a subprime would have qualified for a regular mortgage. \nWhy did they get put into subprime? Because it was much more profitable \nfor the big investment banks and mortgage banks. So they stack all \nthese subprime loans together with other loans, sort of like they used \nto make sausage. It is like packing sawdust and sausage, like they used \nto in the old days. They would put sawdust in sausage, slice it and \ndice it and ship it out. So they sell these loans to hedge funds and \ninvestment banks and everybody is fat and happy like hogs in a corn \ncrib. Everybody is making lots of money, especially the big shots, \nuntil all of a sudden they understand that in these little pieces of \nsausage they bought, they didn't understand what was there. There were \nsubprime mortgages there that could never, ever be repaid, and the \nwhole thing started collapsing.\n  It collapsed to the point of Bear Stearns losing tens of billions of \ndollars of value in 2 weeks. But not to worry. This is a no-fault \neconomy, at least no-fault capitalism for the folks at the top. So the \nFed comes in and says: JPMorgan, you buy Bear Stearns, and we will put \nup $30 million at risk for the American taxpayer.\n  I want to ask this question of the Federal Reserve Board and the \nTreasury Secretary. If these companies are\n\n[[Page S2623]]\n\ntoo big to fail--and that was the proposition with respect to the \nbailout of Bear Stearns--if investment banks are too big to fail, then \nwhy are they too small to be regulated? If we are going to designate \ncompanies as being too big to fail, is there not some responsibility, \nsome obligation on behalf of the American taxpayer to have effective \nregulation?\n  I know regulation is a four-letter word for some, but the fact is, \nsomebody should have been looking over the shoulder of these mortgage \ncompanies. Somebody should have been looking over the shoulder of the \ninvestment banks and, yes, the hedge funds, all unregulated largely, \nand as a result, the tent comes collapsing down.\n  And guess what. The American taxpayer is told: You pay the cost. You \nbear the burden. Even while they are told that, it still goes on today. \nGo to the Internet and see the deceptive advertising on the Internet \nfor the same kind of loans.\n  So we have a housing bill on the floor of the Senate. What I wanted \nto do is to describe how we got here. If we don't do something about \nthat, if we just sit around here like potted plants and say, well, it \nis OK, it is OK for us to decide that there are institutions that are \ntoo big to fail, including investment banks, so we can let them go \nbroke. They are too big to fail because the consequences for the \nAmerican economy would be catastrophic. If these institutions are too \nbig to fail, then we have a reasonable expectation that there be \neffective regulation. And I am going to offer at least one amendment \nthat deals with that subject, and that amendment will deal with the \nFederal Trade Commission.\n\n  The fact is, the Federal Trade Commission does not have the ability \nat this point, in any meaningful way, to go after this kind of \ndeceptive advertising on mortgages. Those who took these mortgages, in \nsome cases, if they took them in order to flip the property and \nspeculate, it is their fault. But I would say in many, and most cases, \nthese are folks who didn't know what the terms were. These were cold \ncalls via a telephone call into the home to say: What is your mortgage \npayment? We have a better deal for you--without disclosing all of the \nterms. Those homeowners are victims, and many are now losing their \nhomes.\n  My amendment will give the authority to the Federal Trade Commission \nto do a rulemaking under the Administrative Practices Act so they can \ndevelop rules about deceptive advertising and take effective and \nimmediate action against those who are engaged in this practice. That \nis just something that must be done.\n  If we just come to the floor of the Senate and pass what is called a \nhousing bill and ignore the other pieces of this puzzle, we will have \nmade a mistake. We need to give the Federal Trade Commission the \nability and the opportunity to go after the companies that were engaged \nin deceptive practices--predatory lending. We have to do that.\n  Now, Mr. President, I want to mention, as well, that my understanding \nis another amendment has been filed and is pending on the floor of the \nSenate to this bill dealing with the extension of renewable energy \ncredits, including the production tax credit and the solar investment \ntax credit. I just wanted to say this: The amendment that is pending \napparently, is a 1-year extension of the production tax credit to \nincentivize wind and other renewable energy resources.\n  Let me tell you what we did with oil and gas. In 1916, this country \nput in place robust, aggressive, permanent long-term tax incentives for \npeople to go look for oil and gas. Well, look what it did. We have \nproduced a lot of oil and gas. Guess what we have done for renewables--\nwind, solar, and others? In 1992, we had a tax credit for wind--the \nproduction tax credit. We had a solar investment tax credit for \ncommercial purposes going back to 1985 but the residential credit was \nenacted in 2005. These have been short-term incentives though, not a \nparticularly aggressive credits and short term.\n  Since 1992, for a country that is desperate to be less dependent on \nforeign sources of energy, we have extended it short term five times. \nWe have let the production tax credit expire three times, and every \ntime it expires, investment simply dries up. This is certainly the case \nfor wind energy. This is stutter, start, stop. It doesn't make any \nsense at all.\n  Look, I will vote for anything that extends the production tax credit \nand renewable energy tax credits for a year or 2 years. I will vote for \nit, but the 1-year amendment look, but that is not what we should be \ndoing.\n  I have introduced a bill that, as a country, will say to the \nrenewable energy industry: Here is where we are headed; count on it, \ninvest on it. For the next 10 years, here is what we intend to \nincentivize.\n  Why do we just stutter, step around with a baby step in one \ndirection, saying start, stop, start, stop, go this way, with a 1-year \nextension of the production tax credit? Well, that will help for 1 \nyear, but that is not what we ought to be doing. Further, it will do \nnothing for solar, by the way. We are way behind on solar energy \nbecause the solar projects take longer to develop--3 to 5 years. If you \nhave this on-off switch that you turn off every year or two, all you \nhave done is dampen and injure the opportunity to make renewable energy \na significant part of this country's energy life.\n  So my hope is those who have announced the extension, and I want to \nwork with them, but I am just saying I think what we have done since \n1992 is a pathetic, anemic response for a country that keeps saying it \nbelieves in renewable energy because we never do enough to manifest \nthat in public policy. If we are going to have an amendment, let's \nboost that amendment, and let's decide to make this a real incentive. \nWe did it permanently nearly a century ago for oil and gas, and now in \nthe last three decades for renewable, we have turned it on five times \nshort term and off three times. What kind of a signal is that? It is \nnot a signal at all.\n  Mr. President, on one other subject, I want to say a word about \nsomething I discussed last week. And I want to show you the photograph \nof a 22-year-old young man. His name is Efraim Diveroli. He is the \npresident of a firm that was awarded $300 million in taxpayer contracts \nto provide ammunition to the Afghan army and police in Afghanistan.\n  Three hundred million dollars was given to that company. It turns out \nthe company is run by a 22-year-old man named Efraim Diveroli. And, by \nthe way, his vice president was a massage therapist named David \nPackouz, a former masseur. Between the two of them, they got $300 \nmillion in taxpayer contracts.\n  I will tell you who gave it to them. The Army Sustainment Command \ndid. I want the general who was in charge of the Army Sustainment \nCommand when this contract was awarded to come to the Congress and \nexplain how you give $300 million in contracts to what had been a shell \ncompany, now run by a 22-year-old and a 25-year-old massage therapist.\n  This is a photo of the building in Florida that supposedly housed \nthis company that received $300 million--$300 million.\n  The office is just an office inside this building, no markings on the \ndoor. The 22-year-old president says he is the only employee, but they \ngot $300 million.\n  Here is a sample of what showed up for that $300 million. They sent \nammunition to the Afghan fighters, and it turns out in some cases to \nhave been mid-1960s ammunition made in China. Almost worthless. But we \npaid them $300 million.\n  Now, I mention this again, as I have so often, because three times I \nhave offered on the floor of the Senate an amendment, and I will again, \nthat would establish a Truman committee to investigate waste, fraud, \nand abuse in this kind of contracting. We have shoveled more money out \nthe door. We have sent pallets of one-hundred-dollar bills on C-130s--\nbillions in cash--to Iraq. We have such unbelievable waste and fraud \nand abuse, I think the greatest in American history, and yet there is \nnothing that represents the kind of oversight that Americans should \nexpect of us. Three times I have offered the establishment of a Truman \ncommittee. Let me describe what the Truman committee was. Senator \nTruman from Missouri on the floor of the Senate proposed a bipartisan \nspecial committee to investigate waste, fraud, and abuse in the \nPentagon, and it passed.\n\n[[Page S2624]]\n\nThey did 60 hearings a year for 7 years. They were started with $15,000 \nappropriations, and they saved $15 billion for the American taxpayer. \nIf ever we need that kind of a committee, it is now.\n\n  Three times I have offered that on the floor of the Senate--three \ntimes. Every vote on the Democratic side of the aisle has been to say, \nyes, we need it. Every vote save one on the Republican side of the \naisle objected and opposed and we have not been able to get this done.\n  I used this example because it was on the front page of the New York \nTimes just last week, about a company that gets $300 million that \nappears now to have been largely wasted--American taxpayers' dollars \nonce again just poured down a rat hole. I use this example to say we \nought to be embarrassed to not have the kind of oversight we should.\n  I am proud to say everyone on this side of the aisle has voted three \ntimes to establish a special bipartisan committee called the Truman \ncommittee. We know this works. We have done it before.\n  I have held up on the floor so many examples. A little white towel \nthat Halliburton was ordering for the troops because they have the \nLOGCAP contract to supply these things, a little white towel their \nbuyer, Henry Bunting, was ordered to buy for the troops. So he orders \nthe white towel and the supervisor says: You can't do that. You need to \norder a white towel with KBR, the subsidiary, Kellogg Brown & Root, \nembroidered on the towel.\n  Henry says: Well, that will triple or quadruple the cost.\n  The supervisor says: That doesn't matter. This is a cost-plus \ncontract. The taxpayer will pay for that.\n  That is a small example, and there are so many large examples. \nWhistleblowers have told us $85,000 brandnew trucks were left beside \nthe road in perfectly safe areas, to be torched because they didn't \nhave a wrench to fix the tire. The attitude was, it doesn't matter; the \nAmerican taxpayer bought those trucks, and they will buy the \nreplacement trucks on a cost-plus contract. It is unbelievable.\n  A woman named Bunnatine Greenhouse came to testify before the policy \ncommittee which I chair. I have held almost all the hearings which have \nbeen held on these issues. The policy committee doesn't have the \nsubpoena power, but you would be surprised how many whistleblowers want \nto talk about what is happening.\n  Bunnatine Greenhouse became the highest ranking civilian official in \nthe Corps of Engineers, judged to be outstanding by all accords. She \nsaid the awarding of these contracts in the Pentagon for \nreconstruction--the LOGCAP contract, RIO contract, all of these \ncontracts--is the most blatant contracting abuse she has seen in her \ncareer. For that, this courageous woman was demoted. She paid for it \nwith her job, but she would not be silenced. Now her career is behind a \ncurtain over in the Pentagon. No one will comment.\n  The American people should not stand for this. We should not stand \nfor it. I intend again to offer the amendment that would establish a \nbipartisan committee to aggressively investigate waste, fraud, and \nabuse in contracting in Iraq; waste, fraud, and abuse in all of the \nother adjunct areas because I believe the American taxpayer is getting \nfleeced, and I believe American soldiers are being disserved by what is \nhappening.\n  I can speak for hours about this subject because I have had somewhere \naround 15 or 17 hearings on this subject. I have had whistleblowers \ncome to tell me they were at a camp that was serving food to 5,000 \nsoldiers a day under the contract, but they were billing for 10,000 \nsoldiers.\n  I have seen the reports that Halliburton was billing for 42,000 meals \na day, and they were serving 14,000. They were overbilling by 28,000 \nmeals. It is just unbelievable when you see the evidence of waste, \nfraud, and abuse and so little interest in pursuing it.\n  There is much more to say about this. I did want to say that the \nstory in the New York Times yesterday ought to once again be a wake-up \ncall. There is a commission that has been established, which is outside \nof this body. The Senator from Virginia, Mr. Webb, and Senator \nMcCaskill and others have worked hard to establish the commission. I \nthink that is a step forward--evaluating and looking at waste, fraud, \nand abuse. But that is not, in my judgment, a substitute for--it \ncertainly is a complement to but not a substitute for the Congress \nhaving a select committee with subpoena power. Without subpoena power \nand the select committee being able to investigate things like a \ncompany getting $243 million to rehabilitate 140 health clinics in \nIraq, 3 years later the money is gone and there are only 20 places they \nhave rehabilitated; otherwise the money is gone. So what happened to \nall the money?\n  We had testimony from a very courageous Iraqi yesterday who said $18 \nbillion, mostly American money, has disappeared. At least disappeared \nwithin his eyesight because he was in charge of anticorruption in the \nIraqi Government. He was in charge of the anticorruption unit in the \nIraqi Government. They tried to kill him three times. He finally left \nbecause he said the corruption was so unbelievable, and he was so \nunable to stop it. He said $18 billion of American taxpayers' dollars--\nhe believes most of it American taxpayers' dollars--has been wasted.\n  Later this week, I am going to speak at greater length about the \nwaste, fraud, and abuse issue because we have to stop ignoring it. We \nhave to start confronting it. My colleague, Senator Reid, has been very \nstrong and assertive in wanting to address this issue. All of my \ncolleagues on the Democratic side have voted three times to establish a \nTruman committee.\n  Let me just mention one additional point. Three weeks ago I met a man \nnamed Herman Wouk. He is one of the great authors in American history. \nHe wrote the books ``The Caine Mutiny'' and ``War and Remembrance.'' I \nbelieve he is 91 years old. He has an unbelievable command of a lot of \nthings. I was so impressed by him. It was a great honor to meet one of \nthe great American authors, Herman Wouk.\n  He said to me, somewhat with a twinkle in his eye, he said: Senator \nDorgan, I don't know much beyond 1945, but I know everything 1945 and \nback because I spent my life studying that history. I was part of it in \nthe military. But, he said, I have written about it, I studied it. He \nsaid: I know everything about this period.\n  He said: You know what you ought to do in the Congress. I am reading \nabout all of these things. You ought to do something, establish a \nTruman committee. Have you ever heard of a Truman committee?\n  I said: Mr. Wouk, I have. I offered an amendment to do that three \ntimes.\n  Then we talked about what the Truman committee had accomplished when \na Democratic President was in the White House and a Democratic Senator \nwanted to put together that kind of investigative committee. People \nwere concerned about it. The fact is, it got done, and the American \ntaxpayer was served.\n  This war in Iraq has lasted longer than the Second World War. This \namount of waste, fraud, and abuse is the greatest in the history of \nthis country, I am convinced, and we are not near what we should be \ndoing to provide the oversight. It is not the fault of this side of the \naisle. It is not the fault of the majority leader. He has been \naggressive and so have we. We have offered it time and time again, and \nwe are not going to stop. The American taxpayer deserves better.\n  I yield the floor and make a point of order a quorum is not present.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/07/senate-section/article/S2624-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2624-S2625]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      STRATEGIC PETROLEUM RESERVE\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, before I leave the Chamber, I do wish to \nmention the Energy Department has made an announcement last week which, \nonce again, stands logic on its head. They have announced they would \ncontinue putting oil into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve underground. \nThey are putting about 60,000 barrels of oil underground right now, at \na time when the price of oil is $100 or $110 a barrel. They are busy \nputting 60,000 barrels a day underground.\n\n[[Page S2625]]\n\n  It makes no sense at all. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which is \nwhere we store underground that amount of oil we want to use in an \nemergency is 97 percent full. So the Strategic Petroleum Reserve is 97 \npercent filled at a time when oil is at a record high. This \nadministration is taking sweet light crude oil, which is a subset of \nall oil, and a highly valuable subset of oil, and putting 60,000 \nbarrels of oil a day underground.\n  They have announced beginning in August of this year, they hope to \nget contracts to do just that. We know that in addition to that, they \nwant to increase that, almost double that, to be around 120,000 barrels \na day underground for the second half of the year. They are going to \nuse their royalty-in-kind authorities and likely some of the $585 \nmillion they had received when they sold reserves because of supply \ndisruptions caused by Hurricane Katrina.\n  So here is where we are: We have oil prices that are akin to a Roman \ncandle, going right through the roof, and instead of doing things that \nwould put downward pressure on oil and gas prices, the administration \nis taking oil through royalty-in-kind transfers, oil payments off the \nGulf of Mexico wells, and sticking it underground in the Reserve and \ntaking it out off supply.\n  I mean, that absolutely makes no sense at all. I followed a car once \ndown a road in North Dakota, an old beat-up car with a back bumper \nhanging by one hinge. He had a bumper sticker, and the bumper sticker \nsaid, ``We fought the gas war and gas won.''\n  I thought, that is not so unusual. I mean, the other side always \nwins. But at least this administration, this Congress, ought to insist \nthat we not put oil underground and stick it in the Reserve, when it is \n97 percent full. We have to pay $110 a barrel for it and you take oil \nout of supply, which puts upward pressure on gas prices.\n  I do not understand who is advising them, but whoever is, I hope \nperhaps they can find someone with a little deeper reservoir of good \njudgment att the moment to suspend putting oil underground in the \nReserve.\n  I have a piece of legislation I have introduced that does the \nfollowing: It would suspend immediately the putting of oil underground \nin the Reserve for the remainder of 2008 unless oil comes back below \n$75 a barrel. But as long as it is over $75 a barrel, and the SPR is 97 \npercent full, let's at least stand up on the side of the average family \nout there that is trying to figure out how they can get a bank loan to \nfill their gas tank.\n  Let's see downward pressure on gas prices rather than allowing this \nadministration to announce on Friday they want to continue to put \nupward pressure on gas prices by seeking to enter into contracts to \ncontinue filling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.\n  Now, the Secretary of Energy says: Well this does not matter much. \nThis is a small amount. It is 60,000 barrels a day. What he does not \nunderstand, I think, is it is a subset, this is sweet light crude, the \nmost valuable subset of oil we have.\n  We had testimony before the Senate Energy Committee that clearly \nindicates this is putting upward pressure on gas prices. We do not know \nhow much. One expert who came before the Energy Committee said 10 \npercent. But why should we sit idly by and have the administration have \na policy of taking oil off the market and putting it underground, \nespecially the sweet light crude?\n  This is not a debate about whether it is increasing gas prices, it \nis. The debate is simply: How much does it increase gas prices, and why \nshould we have anyone in this town busy doing things that increase gas \nprices? How about standing up for the driver? How about standing up for \nordinary families for a change?\n  So I wished to say I noted the press release put out by the Energy \nDepartment as a matter of policy. They are wrong, dead wrong. One way \nor another we are going to deal with it. I chair the subcommittee that \nfunds the Department of Energy. I will have a chance to write the \nChairman's mark. That will be a couple months from now. But I \ndefinitely intend to deal with that in the Chairman's mark. But I hope \nbefore then we can stop 60,000 barrels or more of oil a day from going \nunderground because that is a policy that, in my judgment, flies in the \nface of good sense.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cardin). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, is the parliamentary procedure \nthat we are on the Mortgage Foreclosure Protection Act?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. At the present time, we are still in morning \nbusiness.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I will speak as in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I do wish to say a word about \nthe Mortgage Protection Act, the protection against foreclosure on \nmortgages. Last Thursday, I had offered an amendment that will be \nconsidered perhaps tomorrow and will be voted on and it is a \ncommonsense amendment which says that in order to save somebody's home \nand not have their mortgage foreclosed on, if they have a pile of cash \nsitting over in their retirement account, the 401(k), that they would \nbe able to go in and get $25,000 out of their 401(k) retirement plan to \nuse in order for them to forestall a foreclosure upon their home and, \ntherefore, stay in their home.\n  Now, that is plain common sense, to be able to do that, pull it out, \nwithout paying the 10-percent penalty under current law that you would \nhave to pay in order to take money out of that retirement fund and set \nit aside. Why is it common sense? Because the symmetry of the current \nlaw is you can take money out of the retirement fund without paying the \npenalty in order to buy a home. If you can do that to purchase a home, \nwhy would you not want to give a homeowner the opportunity to keep \ntheir home from foreclosure by allowing them to go into the retirement \nfund or 401(k) fund?\n  It makes common sense, and I am hoping the Senate is going to \nfavorably consider that when we vote on this amendment. It is offered \nby me and a host of other Senators who are cosponsors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/07/senate-section/article/S2625-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2625-S2627]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       SEATING DEMOCRAT DELEGATES\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, the reason I asked to speak as \nin morning business is because I wish to talk on another subject that \nis not the subject of the Mortgage Foreclosure Protection Act but is \nthe continuing saga we have about seating the Democratic delegates to \nthe national convention from the States of Florida and Michigan.\n  Over the weekend, in the State of Florida, the State party met. \nHaving already elected the delegates under their rules from the various \ncongressional districts, the only thing to complete the election of the \nFlorida delegation was the remaining delegates who are selected at \nlarge of the whole State, proportionate to the amount of votes both \nSenators Obama and Clinton got in the January 29 primary--a primary, by \nthe way, that had a record turnout of 1.75 million, almost 2 million \nFlorida Democrats who turned out and voted. As a result of that, in \nthat proportion to which Senator Clinton got 50 percent of the vote and \nSenator Obama got 33 percent of the vote, the rest of the delegation of \nthe total of 211 delegates were selected.\n  So Florida's delegate selection process has gone through under the \nnormal procedures set out by the rules and bylaws of the Florida \nDemocratic Party. So the question now is, now that we have our \ndelegates duly elected, are they going to be seated? Well, of course, \nyou know the position of this Senator from Florida, who has been trying \nfor 9 months now to work a compromise by which we can get the delegates \nseated. But the Democratic National Committee has completely rejected \nall the attempts.\n  Just think, if we had done this last August and September, when we \nwere trying this and had this issue behind us in Florida, how much \neasier it would be\n\n[[Page S2626]]\n\ngoing forward not to face the nail-biting scenario and drama we see \nplaying out in front of our eyes, since both the candidates, Barack and \nHillary, are so close, not only in delegates but in national vote and \nso forth.\n  At the end of the day, I believe, as the Good Book says, come and let \nus reason together, that will prevail and the delegation from my State \nof Florida, as well as Michigan, will be seated. Because at some point, \nthe party chieftains are going to understand that if you want to win \nthe election in November, you can't ``dis'' the delegations from \nFlorida and Michigan. Why? Conventional wisdom says that there are four \nbig States. In order for a Democratic nominee to win, they must get \nthree of those four. What are they? They are Michigan, Ohio to the \neast, and further to the east, Pennsylvania. What is the fourth? \nFlorida. Well, lo and behold, of those critical States in winning a \nPresidential election in the electoral college, as a result of the \nNovember election, lo and behold, two of the four are Florida and \nMichigan. So the party chieftains need to start focusing on November \nand the treatment of Florida and Michigan.\n  Now, I can only speak for Florida--and I know Senators Levin and \nStabenow can certainly speak for their State, and they have been trying \nas well--but it is time to get a formula by which we can seat the \ndelegations.\n  We have tried everything since the Democratic National Committee last \nSeptember said: No, the rules say we can take away half your delegates. \nBut, no, we are going to take the full pound of flesh, and we are going \nto take away all your delegates, Florida. Then they left me no choice \nbut I had to sue the chairman; my party, the Democratic National \nCommittee, I had to sue them in Federal court. The Federal district \njudge in Florida did not agree with my constitutional arguments and \ndismissed the lawsuit. I disagreed with his reasoning because I think \nthe constitutional protections of due process and equal protection of \nthe laws do apply, but nevertheless I didn't have time to file an \nappeal because January 29 was fast upon us, so it is what it is.\n\n  Since then, I have been trying several different things, along with \nmembers of the Democratic congressional delegation of Florida. This is \none of the most recent I have suggested, and other members of the \ndelegation have as well. Since the Democratic National Committee's \nrules say that if a State moves earlier than February 5, that the DNC \nwill take away half of that State's delegates to the national \nconvention, let's try that as a means, in the spirit of compromise, of \ngetting the Florida delegation seated. Of course, since all 211 are now \nelected, duly, in the processes of Florida, you can seat the whole \ndelegation if such a compromise were struck by giving each of them half \na vote. In the spirit of compromise, let's get that done.\n  Four weeks ago, on this floor, when we had that all-night session, \nthe Presidential candidates were all here. Of course I took the \nopportunity to speak to Senator Obama and Senator Clinton about such a \ncompromise. In terms of raw politics, if the whole delegation were \nseated, Senator Clinton would have an advantage of 38 votes, but if you \nseat the delegation with half of its vote, in the spirit of compromise, \nyou cut that in half, and her advantage from Florida would be only 19 \ndelegate votes.\n  I make my appeal again to the DNC. Nobody is happy with where we are. \nEvery time anybody gets on the news programs talking about the \nPresidential contest, which is vigorous and close, everybody asks the \nquestion about what to do about Michigan and Florida. Everybody is \nstarting to understand that it is time to get this decision done, a \ncompromise to get the delegation seated, and to move on. The problem \nis, when you come to these kinds of decisions, one candidate sees that \nit advantages them and the other candidate sees that it disadvantages \nthem, and it is very difficult to get an agreement. However, the \nquestion has to be injected: At the end of the day, what is most \nimportant? I submit that at the end of the day, it is clearly in the \ninterests of the Democratic nominee to be able to win the votes, on \nNovember 4, from the State of Florida and from the State of Michigan. \nYou say: Does that mean those States wouldn't vote for the Democratic \nnominee? I can only tell you what the data say. The data--surveys in \nFlorida--say 22 percent of independents in Florida would be less likely \nto vote for the Democratic nominee because of all this fracas.\n  In truth, once we get a nominee, the electorate is going to be \nfocused on the November election and choosing the leader of the free \nworld and a leader who can straighten out the mess we find ourselves in \nand the huge challenges facing this country.\n  Let me give an example. I was stunned over the weekend to find this \nresult to this question in a major national survey: Is this country \ngoing in the right direction or is it going in the wrong direction? I \nwas stunned to see the results, that 81 percent of the American people \nwere saying the country was going in the wrong direction. That is a \nphenomenal response that begs for leadership in whom we select as the \nnext President of the United States. I do believe we will see down the \nroad, once we have our nominee, that people get focused on that instead \nof the fracas we now have enveloping Florida and Michigan.\n  My final comment, since we have been joined by the esteemed senior \nSenator from California, the chairman of the Rules Committee: If ever \nthere is an opportunity for reform, it is now. If ever there is a \nreminder to us that this chaos begs for order to emerge out of the \nchaos, if ever there is an example of Americans being dissatisfied with \na nominating process, it is now. If you leave it alone and let it take \nits natural course, what is going to happen is States, in the next \nelection, 4 years down the road, are going to be jumping each other. \nSuddenly, your first caucus or primary is going to be on Halloween, and \nas a result you will have an even more chaotic situation. So this begs \nfor a rational plan.\n  Senator Levin and I have offered such a rational plan. It is one \nidea. There are many. Ours would have six primaries, interregional. \nThey would start in March and go through June, and the order of the \nStates collected together interregionally around the country, big \nStates and small States together, would be done by lot, by drawing a \nnumber out of a hat, 1 to 6, whether they go first in March or are \nlast, No. 6, in June. Then 4 years later they would rotate, and the 2's \nwould go to 1's and the 1's would go to the end for the June primary.\n  That bill has been referred to the Rules Committee. It is an idea. \nObviously, in the tumult and the hurly-burly of a Presidential \ncampaign, we are not going to move on legislation such as this. But \ndown the road, in the next Congress, after this election, the chaos \nbegs for order, a rational plan of selecting our Presidential nominees.\n\n  I have offered a number of other suggestions as well. Make elections \neasier. Why do we have to vote just on 1 day--a Tuesday--when people \noften find it very difficult to get off of work or to go to work late \nor to get home early in order to vote? Why don't we make elections \neasier for people? Why don't we give them a 2-week period prior to the \nelection that they could go to designated places in their county to \nvote early? Why don't we make it a lot easier for people to vote, if \nthey want to vote by mail, which is--we traditionally call it an \nabsentee ballot. Let's enable them to call up the supervisor of the \nelections office and get an absentee ballot without them having to \nswear they are not going to be in their community on the day of the \nelection or without them having to swear they are sick and cannot get \nto the poll. Why don't we make it easy? Why don't we give grants for \npeople back in their communities and counties and States to do pilot \nprojects, to study whether we could, in fact, do what Oregon does, \nwhich is to vote by mail, where they get 90 percent participation? Why \ndon't we give grants to do a pilot study as to whether the integrity of \nthe voting process could be retained by voting by the Internet in \ncertain circumstances, such as military overseas ballots? Why don't we \ndo all of this in election reform?\n  Indeed, this Senator would propose the ultimate reach: Why don't we \namend the U.S. Constitution and abolish the Electoral College where, in \nfact, the popular vote for President will determine who is going to be \nPresident instead of this arcane, archaic institution called the \nElectoral College which\n\n[[Page S2627]]\n\nhas caused, several times in our history, a Presidential candidate to \nget the most votes but the other candidate is the one who wins because \nof the Electoral College votes?\n  What I am saying is we ought to put all these ideas on the table. We \nought to make voting easier. We certainly ought to reform the \nPresidential nominating process. And we ought to consider letting the \nmajority rule in this country.\n  We have had a reminder in the chaos of this year. Americans are \ndissatisfied with this process. We need to make it better.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I would like to commend the \ndistinguished Senator from Florida. I have watched him over these \nmonths, and no one has tried harder than he to move toward a solution \nwith respect to the Florida situation. He has told me on several \noccasions that never before have as many people voted in an election as \ndid in Florida. I think the Senator mentioned some 2 million people \nvoting in some primary election. It is inconceivable to you, and \ntherefore to us, I believe, to have a convention where Florida is not \nrepresented. Of course, the same comments would go for the great State \nof Michigan.\n  I just want the Senator to know that I am very appreciative of the \nefforts he has made to try to settle the situation. I only wish they \ncould have been successful. I do not believe the door is closed. I \nthink the more the people of this country understand how important \nFlorida and Michigan are to the democratic process, there will be \nstrong support to reach some accommodation.\n  I thank the Senator for all he has done.\n  (The remarks of Mrs. Feinstein pertaining to the submission of S. \nRes. 504 are located in today's Record under ``Submission of Concurrent \nand Senate Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Stabenow).

Madam President, today President Bush announced he was \nsending the Colombian Free Trade Agreement to the Congress. He expects \nand demands that we take it up and pass it. I regret he has taken that \naction because he proposes that we continue failed trade practices of \nthe past. That makes precious little sense for this country's \ninterests. I am in favor of trade and plenty of it. Trade advances our \ninterests provided it is fair and mutually beneficial between our \ncountry and those with which we have agreements. But I want to cite the \nrecord of President Bush in the last 7 years because when I say our \ntrade policy is a failure, let me describe it this way.\n  When President Bush took office in 2001, our trade deficit was $429 \nbillion. That is way too high. But 7 years later, our trade deficit is \n$815 billion. When the President took office, our trade deficit was \n$429 billion. Now it is almost double, $815 billion. In 7 years, this \nPresident's trade policies have doubled the trade deficit. We are not \nonly collecting a massive amount of debt around the necks of the \nAmerican people, they are encouraging the shipping of U.S. jobs \noverseas.\n  Now the President says: I have a new policy. Let's do more of the \nsame. If you have trade policies that double the trade debt in this \ncountry, and you say let's do more of the same, there is something \nwrong with that.\n  Last month we lost 80,000 jobs in this country. Just last week it was \nannounced, last month we lost 80,000 jobs. And what do we get this week \nfrom the President? Another proposal of a free-trade agreement.\n  Let me describe. We have had plenty of practice with these trade \nagreements. Some long while ago, we had a proposal: We have to have a \nfree-trade agreement with Mexico. At the time we had a $1.5 billion \ntrade surplus with Mexico. The first President Bush began negotiating a \nfree-trade agreement with Mexico. He had a bunch of economists tell us \nhow wonderful this would be; if we can just have a free-trade agreement \nwith Mexico, it would be nirvana. So we did. I didn't vote for it. I \nled the opposition. But we went from a $1.5 billion trade surplus with \nMexico to now a $74 billion trade deficit with Mexico. Think of that. \nWe went from a $1.5 billion surplus to a $74 billion deficit. We are \nborrowing money from the Mexicans in trade. It is unbelievable. Talk \nabout failed agreements.\n  This agreement with Colombia is modeled after NAFTA. It is the same. \nYou have a failure. Let's do more of it, the President says. I don't \nunderstand that at all. It is a curious strategy to decide: OK, let's \nhold up a failure and let's suggest we should double it. I don't \nunderstand it.\n  I was watching CNN this afternoon. Wolf Blitzer, who is a terrific \nbroadcaster--kind of breathless from time to time--was describing the \nPresident coming out in his announcement and essentially demanding that \nthe Congress pass this free-trade agreement. Wolf Blitzer put up on the \nscreen the description the President offered, saying: Most of \nColombian-made goods come into this country with no tariff on them. \nMany of American goods go to Colombia with a tariff as high as 35 \npercent.\n  They put up on the screen this zero and 35 with two arrows, Colombia, \nUnited States. I am thinking to myself, it is curious that the \nPresident uses this to say we have to have this trade agreement with \nColombia, as if we have no leverage with Colombia. We are sending a lot \nof money to Colombia, and have for a long while, to help President \nUribe fight the insurgents, the FARC, the insurgent organization. We \nare sending American tax dollars down there in substantial quantity. We \ndon't need to do a bad trade agreement with a failed NAFTA strategy \nwith Colombia to get them to reduce their tariffs, if they have tariffs \non American goods going to Colombia. All we have to do is say: Look, we \nare sending a lot of money down here to help you. Get rid of your \ntariffs. If we don't have tariffs on your goods coming north, don't you \nput tariffs on American goods going south.\n\n  We don't have to pass a bad trade agreement to get that result. We \njust have to say to President Uribe: We have been bankrolling a fair \namount of the effort that you are making, and we are doing it because \nwe want to help you. But in the process of wanting to help you with \nAmerican tax dollars, we expect you to remove the tariffs.\n  I have met with President Uribe. I have been in his office in \nColombia. I have a lot of respect for him. It is a tough job down \nthere. They have real problems. Some say: This discussion about labor \nissues and trade agreements is not so relevant. It is pretty relevant \nin a country where one labor leader is killed every week on average \nthis year. It is pretty relevant when 97 percent of the killings of \nColombia labor leaders going back to 2001 have been unpunished--97 \npercent. It is pretty relevant, it seems to me. I accept that President \nUribe has a lot of issues, a lot of problems. We as a country have \ntried to help him. But it seems to me it doesn't help anybody for this \ncountry and for President Bush to try to push through a bad trade \nagreement.\n  While I have respect for President Uribe of Colombia, I don't have \ngreat happiness about President Uribe being involved in America's \npolitical system. He decides apparently that he believes he should \ncomment on our Presidential race. He says, of one of our Presidential \ncandidates, ``I think it is for political calculations that he is \nmaking a statement,'' referring to a statement that one of the \npolitical candidates for President said that he didn't support this \ntrade agreement with Colombia. So the President of Colombia says:\n\n       I think it is for political calculations that he is making \n     a statement.\n\n  I don't think we need the President of Colombia describing motives of \nour Presidential candidates. There is a perfectly reasonable approach \nto support or perhaps oppose the Colombian Free Trade Agreement. The \nreasonable approach is to say we like failure. We want to do more of \nthe same. So give us what you gave us in NAFTA and run a small trade \nsurplus up to a huge deficit.\n  But there is also a perfectly logical reason for a Presidential \ncandidate or a Member of Congress who may wish to\n\n[[Page S2628]]\n\nsay at some point: We ought to do a U-turn and say this country is for \ntrade. We are for trade and plenty of it. We believe in trade and \nplenty of trade. But we demand and insist at long last that it be fair \nto our country. I don't think the Colombia agreement by itself is some \nsort of pivotal moment. I don't allege that. But I do say I don't think \nwe ought to sit here with a President who has doubled the trade deficit \nin 7 years and take advice about what we do in the next 90 days.\n  These trade agreements have not worked in our country's interest. \nTrade agreements should be mutually beneficial when we negotiate them, \nwhether it is with China, Mexico, Canada, Europe, or Japan. They ought \nto be mutually beneficial. I am flatout tired of seeing the results of \nbad trade agreements.\n  I guess some may say if you have an $815 billion trade deficit, it \ndoesn't matter. That means over $2 billion a day we are putting in the \nhands of foreigners because that is what we are buying every day that \nexceeds our ability to export. We are importing $2 billion a day more \nthan we are exporting in goods. That debt someday will have to be \nrepaid with a lower standard of living in the United States. You would \nthink at long last someone would say this strategy isn't working.\n  It is true that whether it is the Colombian Free Trade Agreement, the \nfree-trade agreement with Mexico or Canada or the agreements we have \nwith China, it is true that no one in this Chamber is going to lose \ntheir job to a bad trade agreement. It is other people who will lose \ntheir jobs--people working in manufacturing plants making bicycles or \nwagons or producing textiles or in high tech.\n  I wrote a piece once about Natasha Humphries who lost her job. She \nwasn't a textile worker. She went to Stanford and did everything right, \na young African-American woman who did everything right and then went \nto work for Palm Pilot. Regrettably, her last job was to train the \nengineer from India who was hired at one-fifth the salary they were \npaying Natasha Humphries.\n  So should American youngsters who come out of our colleges, should \nAmerican workers coming out of our colleges, aspiring to work in \nengineering, be willing to work for 20 percent of the salary that is \npaid in this country in order to compete with an engineer from India? \nThose are questions we ought to start asking in this country.\n  Everybody says we need to train more engineers and scientists. That \nis true but not if their first job and their last job is to train their \nsuccessor who is an engineer in India making one-fifth the salary.\n  So I went further than talking about Colombia, except to say this: \nThis is not new. We in this Congress have been for so long a catcher's \nmitt of bad trade agreements from Presidents--for years and years and \nyears--and this trade agreement is the model of NAFTA. It is the same \nold thing. There are a couple labor provisions and environmental \nprovisions in it, but it is largely the same old strategy.\n  I just remind my colleagues what happened with Mexico. Nobody writes \nmuch about it. Nobody speaks much about it. But we did a trade \nagreement with Mexico. We had all of these claims, all of these boosts, \nall of these suggestions of what was going to happen. We had a $1.5 \nbillion surplus with Mexico in our trade relationship; in other words, \nit was about balanced. Now it is a $74 billion United States trade \ndeficit with Mexico. We end up, some years later, borrowing money from \nthe Mexicans, even as we ship our jobs across the line. That is a trade \nstrategy that I think is bankrupt for our country.\n  My hope is the U.S. House, which likely will deal with this first, \nwill make short work of it and simply send a message. The message to \nthe President is simple: This country stands for trade. Yankee \ningenuity and shrewd Yankee business stand for trade. It is in our \nblood. But we also stand for fairness, and at last--at long last--this \ncountry will begin to write fair trade agreements with other countries \nthat stand up for our country's economic interests as well. Yes, we \nwant to pull up others, but we will not any longer allow trade \nagreements that push down this country's standards. That has been the \ncase for too long.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, \n     the amount appropriated under section 301(a) of this Act \n     shall be $3,900,000,000 and the amount appropriated under \n     section 401 of this Act shall be $200,000,000.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, it is not my desire to debate this \namendment at length at this time. I only\n\n[[Page S2629]]\n\nwanted to call it up so it will be available for the Senate to consider \nas we continue to debate this extremely important housing bill that is \nin front of us.\n  Late last week, the Senate considered the question of additional \nfunding for housing counseling. When the Senate voted on that matter, \nthere were 16 Senators who were absent from the Chamber. So that \namendment did fail at the time on a procedural vote. But I do believe \nsome Senators may have voted against our initial amendment because it \nadded funds to the overall cost of this bill. The new amendment I have \njust called up will add the necessary funding for housing counselors \nfrom within the funds already in the bill.\n  Senator Schumer and I are going to be talking about this amendment in \ngreater detail at the appropriate time. I think as we continue to try \nto address the housing issue, we all remember there are up to 2 million \nfamilies who may go into foreclosure this year, and our main objective \nought to be to make sure they do not go into foreclosure. That is what \nthis housing counseling funding does. It is extremely important. I hope \nas we move this bill along we will be able to add the additional \nfunding.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Renewable Energy\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, over the last several weeks, a number \nof visitors have come to Capitol Hill urging us to support renewable \nenergy. There is a lot of interest in this country for so-called \nrenewable energy. The idea is for us to be less dependent on energy \nthat is shipped from other parts of the world. Some of those places are \nunfriendly to us.\n  A number of us are also very concerned about climate change, and we \nwould like cleaner energy. Renewable energy is usually cleaner energy. \nSome of us, as I do, live in parts of the country where clean air is a \nproblem. We have coal plants that produce sulfur and nitrogen, and now \nwe have become more concerned about mercury, so we are interested in \nclean air. So if there is some way to find new sources of renewable \nenergy which can help our country have cleaner air, deal with climate \nchange, and be less dependent on other countries, that would be a \nterrific thing for the United States of America.\n  Senator Ensign and Senator Cantwell, the Senators from Nevada and \nWashington, have offered to the housing bill an amendment that would \nprovide support for renewable energies. I would like to talk about the \nEnsign-Cantwell amendment No. 4419, and I hope I would be construed as \ntalking about it in a friendly way. Because Mr. Kyl, the Senator from \nArizona, and I have a proposal, amendment No. 4429, which we have \nalready introduced that we believe would improve the Ensign-Cantwell \namendment in support of renewable energies. I would like to talk about \nthat amendment for a few minutes this evening.\n  Today, the Federal support for renewable energy is basically in a \npiece of legislation called the renewable electricity production tax \ncredit. That gives 2 cents or 1 cent for each kilowatt hour produced of \nrenewable energy to a variety of emerging technologies.\n  In summary, the Ensign-Cantwell amendment extends the production tax \ncredit for 1 year in its current form, with the addition of wave and \ntidal as a qualified emerging technology. Senator Kyl and I propose to \ndouble the amount of time that the tax credit is extended from 1 year \nto 2 years to focus it more on emerging rather than proven \ntechnologies, to focus it on baseload technologies--that is to say \ntechnologies that will produce large amounts of reliable electricity \naround the clock and not just from time to time--and that would treat \nthe various technologies the same, and it wouldn't cost any more than \nthe estimated $6 billion or $7 billion over the next 10 years that the \nEnsign-Cantwell amendment would cost.\n  So that is our goal: to extend from 1 year to 2 years the extension; \nto focus on emerging baseload technologies to treat wind fairly, which \nhas been the proven technology that has received most of the support to \ndate; and not to spend more money than Senator Ensign and Senator \nCantwell have proposed.\n  Here is a picture of where we are today. The renewable electricity \nproduction tax credit began in 1992. As with many Government subsidies, \nin the early stages it was suggested that it would just be there for a \nwhile until the technology was proven and then we would step back and \nlet it flourish on its own in the marketplace. But the year 1992 was a \nlong time ago.\n  Here are the technologies that today get Federal support through the \nrenewable electricity production tax credit. Getting 2 cents per \nkilowatt hour are closed-loop biomass, which is the burning of plant \nmaterials grown specifically for energy production; and geothermal, \nheat from underground. Solar received this support for several years, \nbut it was removed in 2005 because this is a tax credit that focuses on \nenergy produced, and most people who use solar power put panels on \ntheir roofs so they weren't really selling that power to the grid or to \nthe utility company. So the solar manufacturers and others came to me, \namong others, and said this production tax credit isn't doing anything \nfor them.\n  In the Energy Policy Act of 2005, I was the sponsor of a proposal \nthat increased the amount of Federal subsidy for the solar panels. Now, \nthere is within the Federal law a separate provision that provides an \ninvestment tax credit for what appears to be a very promising idea \ncalled solar thermal powerplants. Instead of putting a panel on your \nroof, what you would have instead is a whole field full of mirrors that \nwould then catch the Sun, turn it into steam, put the steam \nunderground, and then you could use the steam as you need it to \nproduce electricity.\n\n  What people often forget about solar and wind energy is it is \navailable when the Sun shines and when the wind blows, and that may not \nbe when you want to turn your air-conditioning on or run your computer. \nThe solar thermal plant has the potential of being a 50-megawatt plant \nor a 100-megawatt plant or a 500-megawatt plant. Solar thermal is \nbeyond the experimental stage.\n  I believe Pacific Gas and Electric on the west coast is putting in \none 500-megawatt solar thermal plant. There may be another. If there \ncan be solar thermal powerplants, that would be a tremendous addition \nto our arsenal of electricity-producing facilities in this country \nbecause most parts of America can benefit from solar power if the \ntechnology can catch the sunlight and we can store this solar energy. \nBasically, with solar and wind, you have always had to use it or lose \nit, and if the wind blew at midnight but your air-conditioner was on at \n5 o'clock, the wind power, or the solar power for that matter, was not \nof much value.\n  So closed loop biomass, geothermal, and wind are receiving a tax \ncredit of 2 cents per kilowatt hour of electricity produced. These have \nbeen preferred. This is an example of the Government doing what I don't \nmuch like, along with many others on this side of the aisle, which is \ncalled picking and choosing technologies. I would rather see, if we are \ngoing to subsidize toward an objective, that we let the marketplace \npick the technology. But we, in our wisdom, have said today biomass, \ngeothermal, and wind get 2 cents per kilowatt hour of electricity \nproduced and sold to a utility for distribution to customers.\n  Now, over here on the 1-cent side, 1 cent per kilowatt hour had been \nand would, under the Ensign-Cantwell bill, continue to be open-loop \nbiomass, small irrigation power, landfill gas, trash combustion--\nJohnson City, TN, made a contract with a private company that takes its \nlandfill trash and over the next number of years makes electricity from \nit and pays the city $1 million a year, which helps reduce property \ntaxes. So that is promising. Also, qualified hydropower, about 7 \npercent of our electricity in the United States comes from rivers and \ndams. It is small, new hydropower projects that are qualified to \nreceive this tax credit. Wave and tidal facilities are interesting. In \nthe East River in New York,\n\n[[Page S2630]]\n\nthey are taking what amounts to be wind turbines and putting them under \nthe water. There is more energy in the waves and in the rivers than \nthere is in the air; in fact, so much that it broke the blades from the \nturbines and they are having to replace them, but at least there is \nenergy there. We would subsidize that to the tune of 1 cent per \nkilowatt hour under the Ensign-Cantwell proposal.\n  Here is the difference that Senator Kyl and I would make. We would \nmove wind to the 1-cent per kilowatt-hour column. Why would we do that? \nBecause wind is a proven technology. We know it works. Where the wind \nblows, such as in Texas and the Great Plains states, wind works. The \nelectricity produced is competitive. Where it doesn't blow, such as on \nBuffalo Mountain in Tennessee--the Tennessee Valley Authority \nratepayers are paying some big bill to developers in some other big \ncity to put up a bunch of wind turbines on top of our mountaintops that \nonly work 10 percent of the time in August when we need the electricity \nthe most. So it may work in Minnesota and South Dakota, but it doesn't \nwork in the foothills of Tennessee.\n  So wind is a proven technology. We would like to focus more on \ntechnologies that have the capacity of becoming baseload technologies; \nthat is, that might produce large amounts of electricity all day and \nall night if we needed it. Wind can't do that. Solar, until lately, \nhasn't been able to do that. But biomass, geothermal, irrigation power, \nlandfill gas, trash combustion, hydropower, wave and tidal, all of \nthose have a potential--a potential--to substitute for what we use \ntoday, which is primarily coal, nuclear power, and gas.\n  So the Alexander-Kyl proposal would, for about the same amount of \nmoney, give 2 years of business certainty to those emerging renewable \nenergy technologies. It would focus then on the emerging ones, not the \nproven ones. It would focus on those that have the capacity to produce \nbaseload power. It would treat wind fairly because wind would still \nget, under our amendment, 2 years instead of 1; and wind would, based \non my computation, get more of the Federal dollars than any other of \nthe types of technology, and the extended tax credit would, as amended, \ncost about the same.\n  Now, let me go to a picture of where our renewable electricity comes \nfrom today. This green line, this is wood, burning wood; bonfires, one \nmight say. We call that biomass, I guess, in scientific terms. Biomass \nhas consistently produced about 35 million Megawatt-hours of \nelectricity over recent years. That is a fair amount of electricity. \nThis is waste, such as the landfill at Johnson City, TN, that I was \ndescribing, where we take what we have disposed of and turn it into \nelectricity. That is beginning to amount to something. Our waste is \nbeing burned to consistently generate about 15 million Megawatt-hours \nof electricity.\n  The red line is geothermal. It is also consistently generating about \n15 million Megawatt-hours of electricity per year. I have seen some of \nthese technologies. You drill deeply into the ground, and the heat \ncomes up and you can use that on a regular basis.\n  The yellow line is wind. We can see that it has increased rapidly \nsince 1999. It has been the technology that has grown the most, \nalthough it is still less than 1 percent of all of the electricity that \nwe produce. Then down here at the bottom is a blue line which is solar. \nThe reason the solar is so small is because this represents electricity \nwhich is sold to the utilities; as we say, sold into the grid. Most \npeople haven't sold their solar power into the grid. They have just put \nthe panels on top of their houses or their businesses and used it when \nit was available to reduce their demand for electricity from the grid.\n  Now, let me go to the larger overall picture of where our electricity \ncomes from because if we are talking about a realistic use of limited \ndollars--and we do have limited dollars in the Federal Government--\nsometimes it doesn't seem as though we know that. Where will we put \nthose dollars? Ensign-Cantwell say let's add about $6 billion or $7 \nbillion toward this worthy goal of renewable energy.\n  Well, let's look at the whole picture. This is where our electricity \ncomes from today. We are not a desert island. The United States of \nAmerica uses a lot of electricity, about 25 percent of all of the \nelectricity in the world for about 5 percent of the people. That is the \nnumber of us who are Americans. How do we produce that electricity? \nToday, almost half of it is coal. Half of the electricity is coal. If \ncoal disappeared, the lights would go off, the industries would stop, \nthe computers would shut down, and there would be a revolution in our \ncountry. Forty-eight percent comes from coal.\n  Next comes gas, natural gas. During the 1990s, almost all the new \npowerplants were natural gas. The advantage to that was they were \npredictable, and easy to build. Investors in utilities could make \npractical business decisions, and they were cleaner than coal in terms \nof nitrogen and sulfur and mercury and carbon. The problem is it drove \nthe cost of natural gas from $2 a unit to--at one point in the last few \nyears $14 or $15 a unit--and begin to drive almost all of the chemical \nindustry jobs and many other manufacturing jobs out of the United \nStates. It began to drive up the cost of farming so that many farmers \nhave a hard time making a profit because natural gas is used to make \nfertilizer, and that drove up the cost of food to people who couldn't \nafford to pay more for it.\n  So using natural gas increasingly for electricity is not a good idea \nfor our country right now, particularly since the Congress the other \nday voted down my amendment by 52 to 47 to allow us to drill offshore \nfor more natural gas so that we could increase the supply and reduce \nthe price and reduce our dependence on foreign natural gas. So that is \nsecond. And third is nuclear power. Nineteen percent of all of our \nelectricity in America comes from nuclear powerplants, which have the \nadvantage of having no nitrogen, no sulfur, no mercury, and no carbon, \nif one is concerned about climate change. Then comes hydroelectric, \nwhich in 2007 produced 6 percent of our electricity in the United \nStates. This is electricity from our rivers and the dams. There are \neven some parts of the United States where people want to take the dams \nout of the rivers for a variety of environmental reasons, which may be \ngood reasons, but that will reduce one source of clean electricity. \nThen we get down to oil, petroleum.\n\n  Sometimes we get oil confused with electricity. We do not use much \noil to make much electricity in this country. We use some natural gas. \nWe use oil in automobiles for fuel, but we don't use it for \nelectricity. Actually, it produces about the same amount of electricity \nas all the renewable technologies put together. Wood is less than 1 \npercent; waste is half of 1 percent; geothermal, half of 1 percent; \nsolar is not sold into the grid; wind is not even 1 percent. The point \nis, the renewables are less than 3 percent of the electricity we use.\n  We live in not only a big economy but a growing economy. The \nTennessee Valley Authority, in the area where I live, in 7 States, has \nsaid to me they need 700 more megawatts of electricity every year \nduring this next few years. The Dominion Power Company, which is \nVirginia, I read in the Washington Post the other day, is estimating \nthey need 400 more megawatts. Madam President, 700 megawatts is more \nthan one gas plant or more than one coal plant or a little more than \nhalf of a nuclear powerplant, which today takes 8 or 10 years to build. \nWe not only use a lot of electricity, primarily produced from coal, \nnuclear, and gas, and very little from renewables, but it is growing, \nand if it doesn't grow, our incomes will go down and we will not enjoy \nthat same high standard of living.\n  I know, having been a Governor, when I was recruiting Nissan to come \nto Tennessee and Saturn to come to Tennessee--now one-third of our \nmanufacturing jobs in Tennessee are automotive jobs, and we have nearly \n1,000 suppliers of auto parts in Tennessee--one of the most important \nitems in our favor after location and a right-to-work law is the supply \nof large amounts of reliable, low-cost, clean electricity because that \nis not available everywhere in the United States and certainly not \neverywhere in the world.\n  This is the picture of where we get our electricity and what we are \ntalking about in the Ensign-Cantwell amendment. The amendment Senator \nKyl and I have is to increase this renewable electricity from about 3 \npercent of all the electricity we produce to something a little higher. \nBut in the next 10\n\n[[Page S2631]]\n\nor 12 years, it is not going to be a lot higher. It will be somewhat \nhigher, and we hope we stumble upon something that will make a big \ndifference. Even though, for example, wind has been around and heavily \nsubsidized since 1992, it is still only eight-tenths of 1 percent of \nall the electricity produced in the United States.\n  The only difference in this next chart title is the word ``clean.'' \nWe care about clean really for three reasons: nitrogen, sulfur, and \nmercury. Federal ozone standards were stiffened recently. That means \nKnoxville, Chattanooga, Memphis, and cities in our region have to work \nharder to have cleaner air to meet those standards because a lot of the \ndirty air comes in from other parts of the United States which have \ndirty plants, mainly coal plants.\n  The clean electricity, which we prefer--and this is the reason the \nTVA is now focused on nuclear production--is 69 percent nuclear. That \nis an important figure for anyone who cares about clean air and climate \nchange. Nearly 70 percent of all the clean electricity produced in the \nUnited States today is nuclear power; 21 percent of it is \nhydroelectric. There are not going to be more dams on rivers. And this \nlittle bit here, which all adds up to about 8 or 10 percent, is \nrenewable energy. So if you care about climate change and if you care \nabout clean air in this generation or in the next 10 years, you better \nlook at nuclear or hydroelectric. Hydroelectric will not grow rapidly \nbecause there are not going to be a lot more dams, or we better be \nrealistic about renewable or look at one other area, which would be \nconservation.\n  What have we done with our money? We have tried to focus, so we say, \non renewable energy. I noticed in the debates here people talk about \nall the different kinds of renewable energy. The fact is, almost all of \nour investment has gone to wind. This, I imagine, would startle most \nSenators to know, that over the next 10 years, we are already committed \nto spending $11 billion subsidizing wind power although it produces \nless than 1 percent of our electricity and it does not produce it when \nwe need it, it does it when the wind blows. But we have proven we can \nproduce electricity from time-to-time when the wind blows. We have \nlarge amounts of huge turbines that are going up around the country, \nsome in our most scenic areas, which in some parts of America are \nproviding useful power, but at what cost?\n  This is a recent report that I asked for and just received this week \nfrom the Energy Information Administration where I asked: How much are \nwe spending of the Federal taxpayers' dollars to subsidize the \nelectricity we are using in this country?\n  Remember, coal produces about half the electricity we are using at \nthis minute in the United States of America--44 cents per megawatt \nhour. Refined coal, which is a very small part of coal, is a very \nexpensive subsidy--at this moment, the biggest Federal subsidy for \nelectricity. For natural gas, almost nothing, a quarter per megawatt \nhour; nuclear, $1.59 per megawatt hour; biomass, 89 cents; geothermal, \nless than a dollar; hydroelectric, two-thirds of a dollar; solar, $24 \nper megawatt hour for Federal subsidies of electric power. This is a \nlittle misleading because, as I mentioned earlier, almost no one sells \nelectricity today into the electric grid. That is all this represents. \nIf you had extra electricity from the panels on your roof and you sold \nit to the local power company, that is what this would be. Only few \npeople do that today.\n\n  In the future, we may have solar thermal plants. Wind we have quite a \nbit of, and we spent $23.37 per megawatt hour actually produced for \nwind. Landfill gas, $1.37; municipal solid waste, 13 cents; all \nrenewables average $2.80, and all sources, $1.65.\n  I would argue wind is over subsidized, that we are not making the \nwisest use of our Federal dollars when we take a proven technology and \nspend $24 per megawatt hour and we starve a lot of the other emerging \ntechnologies and we ignore what we are spending for the ones on which \nwe rely.\n  For example, we spend $24 per Megawatt hour for wind and $1.59 for \nnuclear. Nuclear produces 70 percent of our clean electricity. Wind \nproduces about 2 percent of our clean electricity. If we were \nsubsidizing nuclear power at the rate we subsidize wind, we would be \nspending $340 billion over the next 10 years for nuclear power. No one \nis proposing we do that. It would not be a wise expenditure even though \nit is a working technology that today provides most of our power, and \nif we are going to deal with climate change in a new generation, we \nwould have more nuclear power.\n  I am doing this to show how disproportionate our renewable energy \nsubsidies have become.\n  Coal provides half of our electricity. We have two problems with \ncoal: one is it has too much of three pollutants--nitrogen, mercury, \nand sulfur--and the other is carbon. We can get the nitrogen, sulfur, \nand mercury out of coal almost entirely. So would it not be better to \nspend some of this money on coal and have clean air or to spend some of \nthis money on investing in the recapture of carbon from coal plants so \nthey can be operated cleanly?\n  One of the major environmental organizations has a coal solution for \nclimate change because it knows China is producing two new dirty coal \nplants a week, and unless we invent a clean way to use coal, which \nmeans also getting rid of the carbon, then the rest of the world will \nnot use it. If we do it, they will do it also or they will suffocate. \nIf they do not do it, we will soon suffocate because the air blows all \naround the world and comes back to Los Angeles and then Wichita and \nthen to Knoxville, Nashville, and Memphis as well.\n  This list of federal subsidies of electric power from the Energy \nInformation Administration is a very revealing chart. It would suggest \nthat at the very least, what we might do with a proven technology, \nwind, which is competitive where the wind blows and not competitive, \nobviously, where it doesn't, is take some of that money and focus it on \nsome of the other emerging technologies which have been starved over \nthe last 15 years because wind has gobbled up most of the money, and \nthese new technologies have a capacity for being baseload technologies.\n  The solar thermal powerplant is a very good example. If it works for \nthe Pacific Gas & Electric company, I bet you the Tennessee Valley \nAuthority, within a short period of time, will start building it for \nreliable power plants. Why would they do that? Because last summer, in \nthe middle of our drought, when we were all sweating and the rivers had \nrun dry and lakes had run dry and our air-conditioners were turned up, \nthe TVA had to go out and buy 6,000 or 7,000 megawatts of electricity. \nWhat did they buy? They bought natural gas because it was all that was \navailable. They were paying--and I know my numbers are going to be a \nlittle off here--they were paying in the neighborhood of $78 or $80 per \nMegawatt hour for natural gas as compared to $2 per Megawatt hour for \nelectricity from their hydro plants. They badly need some other form of \nclean energy.\n  Why spend 2 cents per kilowatt hour on wind when we can still \nsubsidize wind generously at 1 cent per kilowatt hour and release \nenough money to extend to 2 years the length of the subsidy for other \nemerging technologies?\n  Just to be specific, the percentage of the renewable electricity \nproduction tax credit that goes for wind energy is 75 percent. In other \nwords, 75 percent of all the money we give to renewable energies goes \nto wind. It does not go in meaningful amounts to this broad list of \nrenewable technologies. Over a 10-year period, from fiscal year 2007 to \n2016, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation, in a letter they \nwrote to me in May of 2007, we are committed to spend $11.5 billion, \nand the Ensign-Cantwell amendment would add another couple billion \ndollars to that. So we would be spending $13 billion or $14 billion for \nwind even though we are subsidizing at a rate of $24 per megawatt hour.\n  Senator Bingaman, the chairman of the Energy Committee, said in the \ndebate on the Energy bill in 2007 that wind will receive about 76 \npercent of the production tax credit subsidy over the next 10 years. \nAccording to the Joint Committee on Taxation, in another report, wind \nenergy is estimated to be 74 percent of that, and it is projected to \ngrow as a percentage of the total production tax credit.\n  What we are doing is increasing our support for a technology that is \nproven, that is not reliable enough to be used for baseload or for \npeaking because it only works when the wind\n\n[[Page S2632]]\n\nblows, you cannot store it, and it is already over subsidized by a \nmassive amount compared to every form of electricity.\n  The largest single Federal tax expenditure for electricity over the \nnext 5 years is the renewable production tax credit, and 75 percent of \nthat goes to one proven technology, wind, which is competitive where \nthe wind blows, not competitive where it does not, is not reliable for \nbaseload, and is not reliable for peaking. That is not being good \nstewards of the Federal taxpayers' dollars at a time when we really do \nneed to encourage renewable electricity and we need to deal with \nclimate change and with clean air.\n  I have just a couple more points.\n  As one might suspect, when you are subsidizing something at $24 per \nMegawatt hour as compared to $1.50 for nuclear and 25 cents for natural \ngas, you get a big surge in wind capacity. That is what happened during \nthe period of the subsidy. Even with this rapid growth, wind produced \n2.7 percent of our clean electricity, of only 0.8 percent of all our \nelectricity. And as I have mentioned several times, wind energy is not \nreliable. You can't store it. It is not produced when you are likely to \nneed it most.\n\n  Another limitation on wind power is it is not available everywhere in \nthe United States. There are some parts of the United States where wind \npower works fine, and there are some Members of the Senate who love to \nadvocate wind power. You can see where those are. It is where the wind \nblows down from the North, and it blows on a reliable basis. So you can \nput up wind, and particularly if you are paying $24 per Megawatt hour \nto subsidize it, you are going to find a lot of investors in Chicago \nand New York and around this country that can make a big buck off \nputting wind up here where it is competitive and where they do not need \nthe subsidy, or putting it down here where the wind doesn't blow, and \nthey apparently get enough subsidy anyway. You may say: Well, if they \nonly get paid when the wind blows, how do they make any money? Well, we \nhave all kinds of tax subsidies for wind, and the production tax credit \nis one, but there are a number of other subsidies that I am looking for \nright now. There are subsidies in agriculture. There is the clean \nrenewable energy bonds--the Federal Government. Those can help build \nthe wind turbines. There is the Department of Energy grant incentive \nprograms for renewable energy production. In the farm bill, there will \nbe some renewable energy and energy-efficient grants and loans. Thirty-\nthree million dollars of that goes to wind. There are a variety of \nState subsidies for wind. Twenty-four States have enacted renewable \nportfolio standards.\n  We have gotten all excited about renewable energy, which is a good \nthing, but what we have forgotten to do to be careful to encourage a \nwide variety of forms of renewable energy, so that we can have reliable \nenergy that has the capacity to be used as a base load or peak load.\n  Then there is the other limitation that affects some people and \ndoesn't affect others. Here is the Buffalo Mountain wind project in \nTennessee. This is the only wind farm in the Southeastern United \nStates. It is the only one the Tennessee Valley Authority has. There \nare 18 of these turbines here. They are tall and they are white. They \nare about twice as tall as the sky boxes in the football stadium at the \nUniversity of Tennessee.\n  Now the Senator from Michigan will smile at that, because Michigan \nand Tennessee have, for years, had a little friendly competition going \nabout who has the largest stadium. We are up to about 107 thousand on a \nSaturday afternoon, and I think the University of Michigan is at 1,010 \nor 1,011 people. So they are a little ahead of us now. But to \nvisualize, each of those stadiums have these large sky boxes, and each \nof these towers is twice as large as those sky boxes. Each one has \nblades extending from the goal line to opposite goal line. They are \nwhite, and they have flashing lights so you can see them from 20 miles \naway during the day.\n  We are paying $24 per megawatt hour to subsidize that all over the \ncountry--only 25 cents an hour for natural gas--in a place where the \nwind doesn't blow. Last August, during the drought, that farm was \noperating at 10 percent. So it doesn't work there very well.\n  My argument is for realism. I would like to see us have a realistic \npolicy. I would like to have clean air and deal with climate change not \nonly in this generation but in the next 10 years. To the extent we need \nto do that with electricity, we need to look first at conservation.\n  The Tennessee Valley Authority operates at about 27,000 megawatts on \nthe average, but every night it has about 7,000, 8,000, 9,000 or 10,000 \nmegawatts of idle capacity. Now, some people remember how Ross Perot \nmade his money. He noticed that in Texas, in the 1960s, the banks were \nclosing at 5 and not using their computers. So he bought their time and \ncame to the States and got a contract to manage Medicaid data, and he \nmade a lot of money doing that. It is the same thing here. We have, in \nthe TVA region, 7,000 or 8,000 megawatts of idle capacity at night. \nThat is seven or eight nuclear power plants. That means we probably \nhave 210,000 megawatts of idle nighttime electric capacity.\n  We should be spending this $11 billion on smart meters that encourage \npeople to buy electric cars and plug them in at night and use the idle \ncapacity we have already built rather than paying $24 an hour for wind \nthat is proven where it works and would not work where the wind doesn't \nblow. Or we should take some of that money, as I have suggested with \nSenator Kyl, and focus it on other emerging technologies. Wind has had \nits chance. It has done well and grown rapidly. Now, I see the majority \nleader, and I will be through momentarily, because I imagine he has a \nreport to make about Senate business. So I will wind up in this way. \nWhat the Kyl-Alexander amendment would seek to do is to improve the \nEnsign-Cantwell proposal by extending from 1 year to 2 the length of \nthe production tax credit extension by focusing it on emerging \ntechnologies, and by focusing it on base-load technologies. Our \namendment would treat wind fairly by adding another billion dollars to \nthe $11.5 billion we are already spending for less than 1 percent of \nour electricity on wind, and that would cost about the same.\n  I hope our colleagues will consider the Alexander-Kyl amendment, No. \n4429, when the Ensign-Cantwell amendment is offered tomorrow.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). The majority leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/07/senate-section/article/S2632-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2632-S2634]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   UNANIMOUS-CONSENT REQUEST--S. 2664\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I appreciate my friend yielding the floor. \nWe are waiting for the Republican leader, who is on his way down here.\n  Good, he is here. But I do express my appreciation to my friend from \nTennessee for yielding the floor.\n  I wish to speak briefly on the subject of the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance bill, known as FISA. Everyone knows this is a very \nimportant issue. The Presiding Officer, a member of the Intelligence \nCommittee and a member of the Judiciary Committee, has worked as hard, \nif not harder, than anyone else on this issue, and I would acknowledge \nhis wide breadth of knowledge on this important piece of legislation. \nWe have relied on the Presiding Officer to give us direction and \nunderstanding of this bill, and he has done that.\n  We all agree on the need to strengthen the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Act of 1978. Congress has modernized the act many times \nsince then, and there is broad agreement on improvements that should be \nmade now. I have said many times we need to give the Intelligence \ncommunity all the tools it needs without compromising the privacy of \nlaw-abiding Americans.\n  The Senate passed its bill in early February. The House, which passed \na bill on this subject last November, passed a new version before the \nEaster recess. The new House bill is similar to the Senate bill, \nalthough there remains disagreement over the issue of immunity. In any \nevent, the two Houses must resolve their differences so the final bill \ncan be enacted.\n  The President keeps giving speeches saying the House must yield to \nhis demand to pass the Senate bill. But that thing we call the \nConstitution keeps\n\n[[Page S2633]]\n\ngetting in the way. You can't pass legislation unless the House and the \nSenate put their stamp of approval on this, and the House has not been \nwilling at this point to move. That is how our system works. The \nPresident must work with the Democrats in Congress to find common \nground and also give some direction to Republicans in the House and the \nSenate to negotiate this.\n  We have tried, since this legislation passed, to work out some type \nof a compromise. Legislation is the art of compromise. A number of \nmeetings have been scheduled, but with rare exception, Democrats have \nbeen meeting with themselves. The Republicans have not been coming to \nthese meetings. There are some positive signs the Republican position \nmay be thawing. I hope that is true. We need good will on all sides to \nfinish this important piece of legislation.\n  On several occasions, I have proposed a 30-day retroactive extension \nof the law that expired in February, so the so-called Protect America \nAct can move forward, at least for a limited period of time. My purpose \nis to make sure there is no gap in the intelligence-gathering capacity \nand to set a deadline for final action on a long-term bill. But the \nPresident has threatened to veto such a bill, and it has been blocked \nprocedurally by the Republicans.\n  So I now again propose such an extension. The Republicans may again \nobject. If they do, they bear responsibility for the fact this law is \nnot in place.\n  Eventually, the President and Republican leaders must come to the \nnegotiating table for the good of the country. We believe that is \nsomething that needs to be done and can be and should be done.\n  I now ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate \nconsideration of Calendar No. 583, S. 2664, a 30-day extension of the \nProtect America Act; that further, the bill be read a third time and \npassed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, with no \nintervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I will \nmake a short statement in response to what the majority leader has said \nbefore making an objection.\n  Last August, we passed a 6-month authorization which we called the \nProtect America Act, and it gave us plenty of time to complete our \nwork. Yet our Democratic colleagues didn't put a bill on the Senate \nFloor until the week before Christmas. Even then, a Democratic \nfilibuster forced the majority to pull it. We should have turned to it \nat the start of the year. Instead, we went to Indian health care. That \ncaused another delay, which forced another extension. Our Democratic \ncolleagues claimed this extension would give us enough time to complete \nour work. Unfortunately, that extension has come and gone.\n  The Senate used that time to overwhelmingly pass a bill that gives \nour intelligence professionals the tools they need to protect good \ncorporate citizens whose assistance is essential. As a result, the \nSenate bill--the bipartisan Rockefeller-Bond bill--is the bill we know \ncan get a Presidential signature. We also know a majority of the House, \non a bipartisan basis, would pass it, if they had a chance to. Instead, \nthe House has not used that time wisely. It refused to pass a bill that \nmeets the minimum required criteria.\n  So now our Democratic colleagues want yet another extension as cover \nfor their failure to responsibly act. What is needed, to keep the \nprogram going, is not another extension, not another delay. Rather, we \nneed to get serious in protecting companies that helped protect our \ncountry. Right now, these companies face multibillion dollar lawsuits \nbecause they answered our call for help. We asked them to come help us. \nThe Government is not in the communications business. They will not \ncontinue to help us if they are sued out of existence for doing so. If \nthey do not help us, then, of course, we will not have a program at \nall.\n  In short, to ensure the continued functioning of this vital \nintelligence program, we need to protect our intelligence operations, \nnot the trial lawyers. To address that concern, I ask unanimous consent \nto modify the UC the majority leader offered by including an amendment \nat the desk that would enact the liability protections passed by the \nSenate on an overwhelming bipartisan vote of 68 to 29. That is the \nliability title of the Rockefeller-Bond bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. McCONNELL]. Mr. President, if it is appropriate at this time, I \nobject to the original unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I appreciate my friend, the Republican \nleader, coming to the floor and objecting to this rather than having \nsomeone do it. He gave his explanation, and I appreciate that. It would \nhave been easy for anyone on the other side to object, and I appreciate \nhis laying out the reasons.\n  But I would say this is not the way to negotiate on the Senate Floor. \nWe have tried. Senator Rockefeller supported the Senate position. I \ndidn't, but Senator Rockefeller did and a number of Democrats supported \nthe Senate-passed position and that was something Senator Rockefeller \nrecognizes. As a result of that, he has tried very hard--February, \nMarch, and, of course, he is also working in April--to try to work \nsomething out. But as I indicated, he has called meetings and \nRepublicans would not come. Even the people leading the committee, \nSenator Bond and others, wouldn't show up for the meetings to try to \nwork something out.\n  Initially, the White House directed none of its people to come. It is \na little tough to work something out when that is, in fact, what is \nhappening. The House must be involved. As I have indicated, that is the \nConstitution.\n  We pass a lot of things the House disagrees with. They pass things \nthere that we disagree with. No matter how foolish they may think we \nare or we think they are, we have to work together and get things \npassed. That is where we are with this legislation.\n  I would say to my friend, there is no need to criticize trial lawyers \nand try to focus blame on any one group of people. There are a lot of \nconsumer organizations that have nothing to do with trial lawyers, who \nreally do not like what the Senate did and they have really made their \nvoices heard.\n  My friend said this unanimous consent request is cover for failure to \nresponsibly act. I would say I think we are at the point where we are \nas a result of the White House's irresponsibility. Many say what was \ndone in the Senate is only something to protect the telephone \ncompanies, the President, and Vice President from liability. We have \neven gone so far as to say if, in fact, there is liability, and the \nphone companies are not responsible for having done this--that they \nwere following orders from the White House or whomever they follow \norders from, someone in one of the intelligence communities--then the \nGovernment should pay for it. It is called substitution.\n  Senator Levin has pushed this a long time, as has Republican Senator \nArlen Specter. It is not as if we are not trying to work through this. \nIt just appears to me, as has happened for more than 7 years with this \nadministration, it is the President's way or no way. I think we have \ncome to the realization here that it is not going to be the President's \nway. He needs to work with us.\n  We believe the actions of the President have been irresponsible. But \nthat is what legislation is all about. His people and the Republicans \nin the Senate and the House should work with us to see if we can come \nup with something. Just ignoring us is no way to resolve the issue \nbecause it appears pretty clear the House is not blinking.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. At the risk of prolonging this for just one more \nmoment, it is not a solution to absolve the communications companies of \nthe financial responsibility by having the taxpayers of the United \nStates pick up the tab. What is inappropriate here is litigation in the \nwake of a response to the Government to protect American citizens. The \nFederal Government is not in the communications business, not in the \ntelephone business. There will be no program without the companies. It \nis\n\n[[Page S2634]]\n\nthe litigation itself that endangers the program, not just the amount \nof money that might be awarded. Having the taxpayers in effect pay the \nplaintiffs' lawyers is not the kind of solution that is going to \ncontinue the program.\n  This is an area that cries out for bipartisanship, and that is \nexactly what happened in the Senate. By an overwhelming vote of 68 to \n29, a substantial--I guess every single one of the 29 were Democrats--a \nsignificant number of Democrats, more than half, voted for this \nbipartisan bill. We know for a fact there are 21 Democrats in the House \nwho support what the Senate did. If you add those 21 Democrats to the \nRepublicans in the House, we know there is a bipartisan majority in the \nHouse of Representatives to pass the very same bill we passed in the \nSenate.\n  I keep hoping we will somehow, through this process, evolve the same \nkind of spirit that we were able to exhibit on a bipartisan basis in \npassing the economic stimulus package earlier in the year and that we \nexhibited last week on the housing bill, which presumably will pass \ntomorrow or Wednesday. So I have not given up hope. But this is no \nsmall matter. This is about protecting the American people from attacks \non our homeland.\n  We know we have successfully protected them for almost 6 years now, \nsince 9/11. I don't think we ought to let our guard down and assume \nthat our enemies have gone to sleep. This is an extremely important \nissue. I hope at some point we will figure some way forward that gets \nthe job done, but I do not see it at the moment, and I do not think a \nshort-term extension will help us get there.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, one brief comment. As the Presiding Officer \nknows, under FISA as passed in 1978, that is in effect no matter what \nwe do here.\n  Under the 1978 act, someone can go to a judge and ask that there be \nthis information obtained. We would like it to be streamlined. We think \nthe 1978 act should be modernized. We have been happy to work with the \nWhite House and Republicans in the Senate and House to do that. I say \nthat in recent days we have seen signs that there is a thaw in the \nRepublican position.\n  Does that mean we can get things done? I don't know. But at least \npeople are beginning to talk a little bit and that is good. There have \nbeen some staff level discussions that have been very good too. I hope \nwe can work together to bridge the differences between the House and \nSenate and do everything we can to get that done, but also \nunderstanding the 1978 FISA Act gives the President a lot of leeway to \nget this done anyway.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, to prolong it one more moment here, if \nthat were adequate, we would not have passed the PROTECT America bill \nin the first place. Clearly, the 1978 law is not adequate to meet \ncurrent challenges. There are many problems with the bill the House \ntook up and passed and sent back over here. One is that it would \nrequire prior court approval before our intelligence professionals \ncould monitor foreign terrorists overseas. So the House bill doesn't do \nanything about the problem. The Senate passed a good bill. I hope at \nsome point the House will wake up here and do what is necessary to \nprotect America.\n  In any event, the issue is not going away. The program may go away if \nwe can't figure a way to get the job done. This is a very, very serious \nproblem and I appreciate the good faith and attitude of the majority \nleader. The Senate is really not the problem here. Hopefully at some \npoint the House will realize the best path forward.\n  Mr. REID. Never let it be said that I tried to get in the last word.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/07/senate-section/article/S2634-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2634]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, on March 25, 2008, we marked the 187th \nanniversary of Greek independence. Throughout 400 years of oppressive \nrule by the Ottoman Empire, the Greeks were able to maintain their \nlanguage, religion, and their sense of identity. In 1821, the Greeks \nbegan an 8-year war of independence and in 1829 became the first \ncountry within the powerful Ottoman Empire to achieve its freedom. \nToday, Greece remains one of the oldest democracies in the world, a \ntribute to those brave Greek citizens who risked everything in the \nquest for liberty and freedom.\n  Our own Founding Fathers were deeply influenced by the philosophers \nand statesmen of ancient Greece who first imagined the idea of a \nrepublic. The United States enjoys a long history of cooperation with \nour Greek friends, and we owe much of our civic foundations to the \nGreek concept that the power to govern is vested in the people.\n  Throughout the 20th century, Greece has been a stalwart ally, and is \none of only three countries in the world outside the British \nCommonwealth that has allied with the United States in every major \ninternational conflict. American and Greek soldiers have fought \nalongside each other in efforts to advance freedom, democracy, peace, \nand stability. In this century the Greece-U.S. relationship has \ndeepened as the two countries have partnered to spread greater \nsecurity, stability, and prosperity throughout the Mediterranean, \nSoutheastern Europe, and the Caucasus. Today, Greek defense forces are \ndeployed as part of the International Security Assistance Forces in \nAfghanistan, maintain two battalions of troops in Kosovo as part of the \nNATO peacekeeping force, train Iraqi military officers at the Multi-\nNational Peace Support Center, and provide logistical support to U.S. \nmilitary forces throughout the Mediterranean region.\n  The historic friendship between Greece and the United States has been \none of mutual respect and support. In history they have inspired, and \nin the present they enliven our great Nation. It gives me great \npleasure to join my colleagues as a cosponsor of S. Res. 476 \ndesignating March 25, 2008, as ``Greek Independence Day: A National Day \nof Celebration of Greek and American Democracy.'' I send all Greek \nAmericans my best wishes as we celebrate Greece's independence and \ncontributions to our national heritage.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/07/senate-section/article/S2634-3", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2634-S2635]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  NATIONAL MONTH OF THE MILITARY CHILD\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I urge support for S. Res. 500, which \nhonors military children. The children of our servicemen and women in \nthe Armed Forces have been deeply affected by the invasion in Iraq and \nAfghanistan. Thousands of children have lost a parent serving in \nOperation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom, and tens of \nthousands more must deal with the daily pressure of their parents' \ndeployment. Military children clearly deserve our support.\n  Even in times of peace, these children pay a high price as they are \ntypically required to move to many new locations several times during \ntheir formative years. The Department of Defense agrees that these \nmultiple moves can make it more difficult for military children to do \nwell in school, form lasting relationships with peers and adults, or \ncope with emotional issues ranging from loneliness to anger to \ndepression.\n  In spite of all the challenges facing military children, they \npersevere. Children attending Department of Defense schools continue to \nhave some of the highest test scores in the country. They rank 8th or \nbetter in all categories in comparison to the states in every national \ntest, and they rank first or second in all categories for African-\nAmerican and Hispanic students. Military children also have high school \ngraduation and college enrollment rates significantly higher than the \nrest of the Nation's children. One study estimates that about 75 \npercent of children who graduate from high school with one or both of \ntheir parents in the military go on to college. That's significantly \nhigher than the national average of 67 percent.\n  These are all accomplishments to be proud of. Military children \nunquestionably deserve our support, and the resolution offered by \nSenator Bayh recognizes them and pays tribute to their commitment, \nsacrifice and unconditional support for their parents and\n\n[[Page S2635]]\n\ntheir country. These youth are the children of our national heroes and \ntheir perseverance, patriotism and achievements make them heroes in \ntheir own right.\n  Despite all the obstacles they face, military children continue to \nsucceed. I commend Senator Bayh for his leadership in offering this \nimportant resolution and urge the Senate to support it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/07/senate-section/article/S2635-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2635]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE CHILDREN'S HOME SOCIETY OF IDAHO\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise today to mark the 100th anniversary \nof the Children's Home Society of Idaho.\n  For the past century this organization has served Idaho's abandoned, \nabused and neglected children, first as an orphanage, and now as a \ncounseling and foster care support system. Through the efforts of this \nremarkable organization, tens of thousands of lives have been touched \nand changed for the better.\n  Over the past 4 years, I have become acquainted with the society's \nnewest program, ``The Bridge.'' This program is a partnership with the \nJunior League of Boise, Inc., and the Idaho Department of Health and \nWelfare. It was created to address the crisis Idaho and the rest of the \nnation are facing with an abundance of children entering foster care, \nand a lack of homes providing the care those children so desperately \nneed and deserve.\n  ``The Bridge'' is now helping Idaho to meet its obligation to these \nchildren by bringing the State into compliance with federal mandates \nand by leading the way for significant foster care reform.\n  As an adoptive father who is familiar with the trials and challenges \nof the foster care system, I commend the Children's Home Society of \nIdaho for its contribution to America's children and families and am \nhonored today to mark this important milestone.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/07/senate-section/article/S2635-2", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2635]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                          TRIBUTE TO AMY STOUT\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, today I honor a courageous and \ndedicated young West Virginian: Ms. Amy Stout.\n  Before Amy even graduated high school, she joined the National Guard \nto help finance her college education. Shortly after Amy started her \nfreshman year at Wesleyan, pursuing a degree in psychology, the events \nof September 11 took place. Within hours of that terrible event, Amy \nfound herself guarding the wreckage of United Flight 93, near \nShanksville, PA.\n  Amy remained activated with the National Guard for a year, serving \nStateside in the Pocono Mountains of Pennsylvania while working to \ncomplete her first semester of school. Then, in the fall of 2002, Amy \nwas once again activated, but this time she was sent to Camp Anaconda, \nnorth of Baghdad.\n  At a time when her fellow Wesleyan students were enjoying college \nlife, Amy was serving her country as a gunner, providing security for \n300-mile convoys. After her 12-month deployment, Amy returned to \nWesleyan, determined to help people in as direct a way as possible. She \nchanged her major to nursing.\n  Amy continued to pursue her nursing degree until, once again, the \nmilitary called and Amy was sent back to Iraq, this time for 18 months. \nAmy's tour of duty ended on September 10, 2007, and she was back at \nWesleyan the very next day, September 11, exactly 6 years after she was \nfirst activated by the National Guard.\n  In May 2008, Amy Stout will graduate with her nursing degree. She is \na testament to the incredible bravery of our soldiers who sacrifice so \nmuch to protect this country. Her determination is an inspiration to \nher fellow students and her fellow West Virginians. She has served this \nnation with great honor and dignity and soon she will be a tremendous \nasset to the nursing profession.\n  It is with great pride that I congratulate her on her upcoming \ngraduation and thank her for her service to this Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/07/senate-section/article/S2635-3", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2635]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/07/senate-section/article/S2635-4", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2635]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/07/senate-section/article/S2635-5", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2635-S2636]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, and were referred as \nindicated:\n\n       EC-5665.

A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to improve the \ncollective bargaining rights and procedures for review of adverse \nactions of certain employees of the Department of Veterans Affairs, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \ndesigned to fix the personnel laws that cover the Department of \nVeterans Affairs, VA, health care professionals, including registered \nnurses, physicians, physician assistants, dentists, podiatrists, \noptometrists, and dental assistants. I am proud to have the support of \nmy colleagues, Senators Webb, Brown and Mikulski. This legislation is \nthe companion bill to the pending House bill sponsored by House \nVeterans' Affairs Chairman, Congressman Bob Filner.\n  Our goal is to support the VA health care professionals who work hard \nto provide quality care to our veterans. The bill seeks to return to \nthe partnership agreement of the 1990s between VA management and \nworkforce. Flexible scheduling and basic fairness from management are \nkey issues to recruit and retain a strong workforce.\n  Almost 22,000 of the registered nurse caring for our veterans will be \neligible to retire by 2010. Even more stunning is that 77 percent of \nall resignations of nurses occur within the first 5 years. This is a \nclear signal that more must be done to retain VA nurses and quality \nhealth care staff. Anyone involved in health care understands the \nimportant role that nurses play in the quality of care and patient \nsatisfaction.\n  The VA has several options. VA could invest more of its precious, \nlimited funding on contract care--or, as we recommend, support this \nlegislation and restore the partnership that will encourage our nurses \nand other health care professionals to stay in the VA system to care \nfor our Nation's heroes.\n  West Virginia has four VA Medical Centers, each with a dedicated team \nof health care professionals. I have met with the nurses and other \nprofessionals to hear their requests for flexible scheduling. I believe \nthat we should restore the management partnership and work hard to \nretain our dedicated team of health professionals for our aging \nveterans, and those newly returning from Iraq and Afghanistan with both \nphysical and mental wounds of war that deserved experienced VA care.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA:\n  S. 2825. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to provide a \nminimum disability rating for veterans receiving medical treatment for \na service-connected disability; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, today I introduce the Veterans' \nCompensation Equity Act of 2008. This legislation would mandate fair \nand equitable ratings for veterans whose disabilities require \ncontinuous medication or the use of adaptive devices, such as hearing \naids.\n  Specifically, the bill would require that all veterans who receive \ncontinuous medication or require use of one or more adaptive devices, \nsuch as hearing aids, prescribed by the Department of Veterans Affairs \nor other licensed health care provider for treatment of a service-\nconnected disability, shall be rated at not less than 10 percent.\n  The amount of compensation veterans with service-connected conditions \nreceive is based on a disability rating, which VA assigns. VA uses its \nrating schedule to determine which rating to assign to a veteran's \nparticular condition. Currently the rating schedule provides a minimum \ncompensable rating of 10 percent or higher for most but not all \ndisabilities that require continuous medication. I do not see any \nreason why one veteran who requires continuous medication for treatment \nof a service-connected disability, such as diabetes or asthma, should \nreceive a compensable rating and another veteran who requires \ncontinuous medication for treatment of another disability, such as \nhypertension or chronic sinusitis, is assigned a zero percent rating \nand receives no compensation.\n  This legislation would also provide a minimum compensable rating when \na veteran requires the use of a hearing aid or other adaptive device, \nbut is nonetheless assigned a noncompensable rating under the current \nrating schedule. The use of adaptive devices prescribed by a Department \nof Veterans Affairs or other licensed health care provider for \ntreatment of a service-connected condition would result in a rating of \nat least 10 percent.\n  It is important that veterans who are disabled as a result of \nmilitary service are compensated in a fair and equitable manner. \nProviding different compensation for different medical conditions that \nall require continuous medication or adaptive devices is not just.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to support this measure, so that veterans \nseeking compensation will be treated in a fair and equitable manner.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2825\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Veterans' Compensation \n     Equity Act of 2008''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

Res. 504\n\n       Whereas, beginning on March 10, 2008, Tibetans and Tibetan \n     Buddhist monks began demonstrations in Lhasa, the capital of \n     the Tibet Autonomous Region in the People's Republic of \n     China;\n       Whereas those protests spread to elsewhere in the Tibet \n     Autonomous Region and to Tibetan autonomous areas in the \n     Sichuan, Gansu, and Qinghan provinces of China;\n       Whereas, long-suppressed resentment prompted violent \n     clashes between demonstrators and government forces in the \n     streets of Lhasa, resulting in innocent civilian casualties, \n     the burning of buildings, and extensive property damage;\n       Whereas Chinese and Tibetan sources report dozens of \n     fatalities, and the arrest of more than 1,000 protesters in \n     the Tibet Autonomous Region and surrounding Tibetan areas of \n     China;\n       Whereas Tibet is the center of Tibetan Buddhism and the \n     Dalai Lama is the most revered figure in Tibetan Buddhism;\n       Whereas, the Government of China continues to restrict the \n     rights of Tibetan Buddhists to practice their religion \n     freely;\n       Whereas the Dalai Lama has condemned the violence that \n     began on March 14, 2008, and announced his continuing support \n     for the Olympic Games to be held in Beijing, China;\n       Whereas the Dalai Lama has specifically stated that he does \n     not seek independence for Tibet from China and has called for \n     negotiations to bring about meaningful autonomy for Tibet \n     that allows Tibetans to maintain their distinctive identity \n     within China;\n\n[[Page S2639]]\n\n       Whereas the Constitution of the People's Republic of China \n     guarantees freedom of religious belief for all citizens, but \n     the 2007 Annual Report on International Religious Freedom of \n     the Department of State states that ``[d]uring the period \n     covered by this report, the Government [of China]'s respect \n     for freedom of religion remained poor''; and\n       Whereas, following the demonstrations that began on March \n     10, 2008, the Government of China began severely restricting \n     access to journalists and diplomats and creating a shortage \n     of independent verification of the situation on the ground in \n     Tibet: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) condemns the violence in Tibet and calls for restraint \n     by the Government of the People's Republic of China and the \n     people of Tibet;\n       (2) calls for a dialogue between the leadership of the \n     Government of China and His Holiness the Dalai Lama on \n     meaningful religious and cultural autonomy for Tibet within \n     China and urges that these discussions take place with all \n     deliberate speed;\n       (3) calls for the release of individuals who protested in a \n     peaceful manner and for medical care for those injured and \n     wounded in the violence that followed the protests;\n       (4) calls on the Government of China to cease its efforts \n     to enter monasteries to ``reeducate'' monks and nuns, to \n     respect the right of the people of Tibet to speak of the \n     Dalai Lama and possess his photograph, and to respect and \n     protect basic human rights, as provided in the Constitution \n     of the People's Republic of China;\n       (5) calls on the Government of China to honor its \n     commitment to allow international journalists free access to \n     China from mid-2007 to October 17, 2008;\n       (6) calls on the Government of China to provide a full \n     accounting of the March 2008 protests in Tibet, the response \n     of the Government of China, and the manner and number of \n     detentions and deaths that occurred following the protests; \n     and\n       (7) both--\n       (A) calls on the United States Department of State to fully \n     implement the Tibetan Policy Act of 2002 (22 U.S.C. 6901 \n     note), including the stipulation that the Secretary of State \n     ``seek to establish an office in Lhasa, Tibet to monitor \n     political, economic, and cultural developments in Tibet'', \n     and also to provide consular protection and citizen services \n     in emergencies, and\n       (B) urges that the agreement to permit China to open \n     further diplomatic missions in the United States should be \n     contingent upon the establishment of a United States \n     Government office in Lhasa, Tibet.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, at this time, I send a resolution to \nthe desk. Perhaps, rather than do that, I should just speak about it \nand then introduce it separately.\n  This resolution is sent on behalf of Senator Gordon Smith of Oregon \nand myself. It is also cosponsored by the chairman of the Foreign \nRelations Committee, Senator Biden, as well as Senators Klobuchar, \nBrown, Cantwell, Dole, Obama, Snowe, Menendez, Voinovich, Schumer, \nCollins, and Byrd. It deals with Tibet.\n  It deals with what is happening in Tibet. This is a very difficult \nweek because the day after tomorrow the Olympic torch is coming for the \nfirst time to my city, San Francisco, the only city in the United \nStates that the torch will come to. It has created quite a stir.\n  This resolution condemns the violence in Tibet, and it calls for \nrestraint by the Government of the People's Republic of China and the \npeople of Tibet. It does other things as well; that is, to urge the \nGovernment of China to sit down with His Holiness the Dalai Lama and \ntry to work toward meaningful autonomy with respect to the culture and \nreligion of the people of Tibet.\n  There is an area called the Tibetan Autonomous Region. It has 3 \nmillion Tibetans. There are also 3 million Tibetans in the three \nsurrounding provinces of China.\n  Starting on March 10, Tibetan monks and others began protesting in \nthe autonomous area of western China. The protests were begun \npeacefully by monks who marched in their robes and were an expression \nof these religious people's desire to practice their religion freely \nand without Government interference.\n  The protesters took this action at great personal risk. Many monks \nand marchers carried pictures of the Dalai Lama, the most revered \nfigure in Tibetan Buddhism. Possession of such a picture is punished in \nChina, sometimes severely.\n  Unfortunately and tragically, on March 14, the protests in Lhasa, the \ncapital of the Tibetan Autonomous Region, turned violent. Long-\nsuppressed animosity boiled over. Innocent people were killed in the \nviolence. Homes and businesses were burned in what appears to have been \na riot.\n  Over the days and weeks that followed, the protests spread. They \noccurred in 42 separate Chinese counties. Most were peaceful. In some \ncases, they were met, though, with brute force by Chinese police. This \nresolution condemns force on both sides. The Chinese Government \nresponded to these protests with force and secrecy. The crackdown \nincluded thousands of paramilitary police and possibly the People's \nLiberation Army, who were sent to Tibet.\n  International journalists and official representatives were kept out, \nmaking accurate information difficult to obtain. But we know dozens of \npeople or more have died. We know more than 1,000 people have been \nincarcerated.\n  Now, how did all this happen? Over the past decade, China has flooded \nthe Tibetan Autonomous Region with Han Chinese. They have built a major \nrailroad. Han Chinese have participated in a major building boom in the \ncapital city of Lhasa. In fact, there are many more hotels and \nrestaurants and businesses there today.\n  The majority of Tibetans who live in rural areas benefit very little \nfrom central government investment in this Tibetan economy. Instead, \nthe money has flowed to government-run enterprises, in which Han \ncontrol is dominant.\n  The Tibetans lack the skills to compete. According to the Chinese \nGovernment's 2000 census, the illiteracy rate of ethnic Tibetans in \nChina is 48 percent; that is five times higher than the Chinese \nnational illiteracy rate.\n  Instead of providing educational opportunity to Tibetans, China is \ncurrently advancing patriotic education in Tibet's monasteries. What \nthis means is Chinese reeducation teams go into the monasteries and try \nto reeducate the Tibetan monks. If they do not agree to reeducation, \nthey are often punished and often beaten. The bottom line is, few \nTibetans are prepared to compete for employment and business \nopportunities in the Han-dominated economic environment.\n  I first went to China and was the first American mayor to do so in \nJune of 1979. I went with a delegation of San Francisco businesspeople \nand civic activists to develop the first friendship city agreement \nbetween an American city and a Chinese city.\n  From that flowed an agreement which at one time was the most active \nsister city relationship in the world. That was between the great \ncities of Shanghai and San Francisco. The Chinese have always had a \nlove of San Francisco; it goes back many decades into former centuries \nof Chinese coming to this country and landing in San Francisco first.\n  We developed that relationship and good things happened. The first \nChinese Consulate came to San Francisco and an American Consulate was \nopened in Shanghai. The first COSCO ship came into San Francisco Bay. \nThe first chartered air service landed at San Francisco International \nAirport. A special relationship was developed between Guangdong \nProvince and San Francisco. The first Bank of China opened in this \ncountry and on and on and on with many interesting projects.\n  It turned out the mayor of Shanghai was, first, Wang Daohan and then \nJiang Zemin. Jiang Zemin and I met over an ensuing 8-year period every \nyear. He then went on to become Secretary General of the party and \nPresident of the country. In 1992, 1997, and 1998, I, personally, \ncarried letters from the Dalai Lama to the President of China. In 1997 \nand 1998, I had long discussions with the President of China, President \nJiang Zemin.\n  I would like, if I might, to read parts of these letters. The second \nletter is dated June 12, 1997. It is signed by His Holiness the Dalai \nLama. Let me read this to you:\n\n       When I met Chairman Mao over forty years ago, I felt very \n     assured by him and the other leaders of the new China. The \n     promises made to me gave the people and government of Tibet \n     considerable optimism and confidence. In the mid-1950s, when \n     we were confronted with new crises, it was Premier Zhou En \n     Lai who was able to play a crucial role in restoring my \n     confidence; we met several times during my pilgrimage in \n     India. Unfortunately, the situation in Tibet did not improve \n     despite his best assurances and I ultimately had to go into \n     exile.\n       Despite lost time and opportunities and the turmoil of the \n     recent past, my hopes were renewed in 1979 when Mr. Deng \n     Xiaoping took the initiative to contact me through my brother \n     in Hong Kong, assuring me that short of our demand for \n     separation from the People's Republic of China, all\n\n[[Page S2640]]\n\n     problems could be discussed and resolved. It was a long \n     overdue rapprochement, and within a few years were able to \n     make considerable progress on several fronts.\n       Unfortunately, this initiative, started by Mr. Deng and \n     vigorously carried out by Mr. Hu Yaobang, then Party General \n     Secretary, came to a stuttering halt owing to events in Tibet \n     and elsewhere in China that prevented its natural fruition.\n       Many of the issues are yet to be resolved, and Tibet now \n     draws the concern of more than just the Tibetan people. The \n     primary responsibility for resolving this matter lies with \n     us, and I believe that now is an opportune moment to tackle \n     these problems without prejudice. I have, for my part, openly \n     and in confidence conveyed to you that I am not demanding \n     independence for Tibet, which I believe is fundamental to the \n     Chinese government.\n       I think the issue of Tibet has remained unresolved for too \n     long and any further delay will only complicate the matter. I \n     am also deeply concerned by the growing restlessness among \n     the Tibetan people in recent times. I can fully understand \n     their frustrations. But if a mutually agreeable solution is \n     found, I am confident that I will be able to dispel the \n     Tibetan people's concerns and win their support for my \n     efforts.\n\n  It is signed, ``With my prayers, the Dalai Lama.''\n  I delivered this to Jiang Zemin, in China, on June 12, 1997. On May \n16, 1998, the next year, I returned to China and I delivered another \nletter from His Holiness to Jiang Zemin. I would like to quote from \nthat.\n\n       It is my fervent and sincere hope that you will provide \n     similar leadership in resolving the Tibetan problem. If we \n     look at the issue positively I really do not see major \n     contradictions between our respective positions. If I \n     understand correctly, the main concern of the Central \n     leadership in China is the unity and stability of the nation. \n     My middle-way approach for resolving the Tibetan issue will \n     in fact contribute towards achieving the same objectives.\n       I would like to reiterate here that I am not seeking \n     independence for Tibet. My main concern is for the six \n     million Tibetan people (or whatever the actual figure is of \n     people who consider themselves Tibetans) to be able to enjoy \n     the opportunity to fully preserve their civilisation and the \n     distinct Tibetan culture, religion, and language. I am \n     convinced that this could be achieved through genuine \n     autonomy or self-rule within the framework of the People's \n     Republic of China. Such a situation will also make it \n     possible for the Tibetan people to take full advantage of, \n     and be an integral part of, the socio-economic development, \n     which is taking place in China. It is needless to mention \n     that a solution to the Tibetan problem will gain tremendous \n     international respect for the People's Republic of China as \n     well as for your leadership.\n       Mr. President, it has been four decades since I have had \n     the opportunity to sit down personally with the leader of the \n     Chinese people to have a frank and direct dialogue. With your \n     leadership and initiative, I am confident that we can begin \n     the process of resolving the many issues concerning Tibet. I \n     believe that you are privileged to be leading the People's \n     Republic of China at a unique time in history when it's \n     economy is growing vigorously and when you are gaining a new \n     respectability in the world.\n\n  It goes on.\n\n       May I suggest that at our meeting, you and I discuss \n     relations between the Tibetans and the Chinese government. I \n     am also concerned about the maintenance and enhancement of \n     those cultural, civic, and religious institutions that are so \n     important to the Tibetan people and others throughout the \n     world. In addition, we should discuss the fact that economic \n     growth in Tibet has not matched that of the rest of China, \n     and we would be interested in talking about how we can work \n     together towards poverty alleviation and educational and \n     economic growth.\n\n  There are other parts to these letters. But I would ask that the full \ntext be incorporated at this point in my remarks in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    June 12, 1997.\n       Dear Mr. President: This letter comes to you through our \n     mutual friends Mr. Richard Blum and Senator Dianne Feinstein. \n     Unfortunately, it comes with a shared sense of deep concern, \n     frustration, and great disappointment over the lack of any \n     progress concerning the Tibetan situation.\n       When I met Chairman Mao over forty years ago, I felt very \n     assured by him and the other leaders of the new China. The \n     promises made to me gave the people and government of Tibet \n     considerable optimism and confidence. In the mid-1950's, when \n     we were confronted with new crises, it was Premier Zhou En \n     Lai who was able to play a crucial role in reviving my \n     confidence; we met several times during my pilgrimage in \n     India. Unfortunately, the situation in Tibet did not improve \n     despite his best assurances and I ultimately had to go into \n     exile.\n       Despite lost time and opportunities and the turmoil of the \n     recent past, my hopes were renewed in 1979 when Mr. Deng \n     Xiaoping took the initiative to contact me through my brother \n     in Hong Kong, assuring me that short of our demand for \n     separation from the People's Republic of China, all problems \n     could be discussed and resolved. It was a long overdue \n     rapprochement, and within a few years were able to make \n     considerable progress on several fronts.\n       Unfortunately, this initiative, started by Mr. Deng and \n     vigorously carried out by Mr. Hu Yaobang, then Party General \n     Secretary, came to a stuttering halt owing to events in Tibet \n     and elsewhere in China that prevented its natural fruition.\n       Many of the issues are yet to be resolved, and Tibet now \n     draws the concern of more than just the Tibetan people. The \n     primary responsibility for resolving this matter lies with \n     us, and I believe that now is an opportune moment to tackle \n     these problems without prejudice. I have, for my part, openly \n     and in confidence conveyed to you that I am not demanding \n     independence for Tibet, which I believe is fundamental to the \n     Chinese government.\n       I think the issue of Tibet has remained unresolved for too \n     long and any further delay will only complicate the matter. I \n     am also deeply concerned by the growing restlessness among \n     the Tibetan people in recent times. I can fully understand \n     their frustrations. But if a mutually agreeable solution is \n     found, I am confident that I will be able to dispel the \n     Tibetan people's concerns and win their support for my \n     efforts .\n       I am sure there may be other issues on which clarifications \n     may be needed from both sides in order to create the \n     necessary congenial environment for formal negotiations. My \n     assistants will continue to informally work with your people \n     so that these issues can be clarified to a satisfactory \n     conclusion candidly and in confidence.\n           With my prayers,\n     The Dalai Lama.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                     May 16, 1998.\n     His Excellency Jiang Zemin,\n     President of People's Republic of China,\n     Beijing.\n       Dear President Jiang Zemin: I have been closely watching \n     the developments in the People's Republic of China under your \n     leadership and applaud you particularly for the leadership \n     that you have provided both during the 15th Party Congress as \n     well as the National People's Congress session early this \n     year. Under your core leadership China is moving in the right \n     direction and it is my sincere hope that this process will \n     continue in the years to come. I also commend you for the \n     smooth transfer of power in Hong Kong and more importantly \n     for the way the affairs of Hong Kong are handled currently.\n       It is my fervent and sincere hope that you will provide a \n     similar leadership in resolving the Tibetan problem. If we \n     look at the issue positively I really do not see major \n     contradictions between our respective positions. If I \n     understand correctly, the main concern of the Central \n     leadership in China is the unity and stability of the nation. \n     My middle-way approach for resolving the Tibetan issue will \n     in fact contribute towards achieving the same objectives.\n       I would like to reiterate here that I am not seeking \n     independence for Tibet. My main concern is for the six \n     million Tibetan people (or whatever the actual figure is of \n     people who consider themselves Tibetans) to be able to enjoy \n     the opportunity to fully preserve their civilization and the \n     distinct Tibetan culture, religion, and language. I am \n     convinced that this could be achieved through genuine \n     autonomy or self-rule within the framework of the People's \n     Republic of China. Such a situation will also make it \n     possible for the Tibetan people to take full advantage of, \n     and be an integral part of, the socio-economic development, \n     which is taking place in China. It is needless to mention \n     that a solution to the Tibetan problem will gain tremendous \n     international respect for the People's Republic of China as \n     well as for your leadership.\n       Mr. President, it has been 4 decades since I have had the \n     opportunity to sit down personally with the leader of the \n     Chinese people to have a frank and direct dialogue. With your \n     leadership and initiative, I am confident that we can begin \n     the process of resolving the many issues concerning Tibet. I \n     believe that you are privileged to be leading the People's \n     Republic of China at a unique time in history when its \n     economy is growing vigorously and when you are gaining a new \n     respectability in the world.\n       May I suggest that at our meeting, you and I discuss \n     relations between the Tibetans and the Chinese government. I \n     am also concerned about the maintenance and enhancement of \n     those cultural, civic, and religious institutions that are so \n     important to the Tibetan People and others throughout the \n     world. In addition, we should discuss the fact that economic \n     growth in Tibet has not matched that of the rest of China, \n     and we would be interested in talking about how we can work \n     together towards poverty alleviation and educational and \n     economic growth.\n       I have been often told by our good friends Mr. Richard Blum \n     and Senator Dianne Feinstein, and others, that a meeting \n     between you and me could make important progress in a \n     relatively short period of time on the aforementioned and \n     other pertinent issues.\n       In this context, I would hope that it would be possible for \n     you and me to be able to meet face to face some time in the \n     near future. I look forward to your reply.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   The Dalai Lama.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. This was 1998. It is now 10 years later. And no \ndiscussion. I\n\n[[Page S2641]]\n\nhave tried my level best but no discussion, no ability for the leader \nof 6 million people, part of China, to be able to sit down and discuss \nthem.\n  So the events over the last month have been tragic. But if I think of \nthe frustration that has built up over 40 years, of a leader who has \nrenounced violence, who has proposed a middle way, it is shocking to \nme.\n  Since 2002, six sets of talks have occurred between the Dalai Lama's \nrepresentative, namely his special envoy, Lodi Gyari, and the United \nFront Work Department of the Communist Party of China, but no progress \nhas resulted.\n  Now, to bring this issue to a settlement, the leaders must be \ninvolved. I deeply believe it is in the interests of both the Chinese \nGovernment and the Tibetan people for the leaders to sit down and \nnegotiate how to bring about meaningful cultural and religious autonomy \nfor the Tibetan people and faith.\n  This is essentially what this resolution attempts to do in a \nconstructive way. I know we called Senator Smith. I hoped he would be \nhere. But the floor opened up and I decided to take the opportunity to \nspeak briefly about our resolution. We have worked with the chairman of \nthe Foreign Relations Committee, with other Senators as well. I believe \nthis resolution sets forward in positive terms our concern about what \nis happening with Tibet and with China. I certainly remain open to \ntrying to help in any way I possibly can to bring the two sides \ntogether. I know the frustration I feel, having tried 10 years ago, 11 \nyears ago, 12 years ago, carrying letters from the Dalai Lama and then, \nin virtually every conversation I have had with Chinese leadership \nsince; it has all come to naught.\n  What is happening is there is a newer, younger group of Tibetans who \nsee the large Tibetan community in exile in Dharamsala who say the \nDalai Lama, in pursuing this middle way, hasn't achieved anything, and \ntherefore we have to take to the streets and we have to show that the \nCommunists in China must sit down with us and must talk with us. I \nbelieve that is the scenario playing out in many provinces and all over \nthe world today.\n  It can all be stopped by a different kind of scenario. That is one \nthat recognizes that the Dalai Lama, a historic and well-respected \nreligious leader, should be able to sit down with the leadership of \nChina and discuss the problem and come up with a mechanism that can \nprovide for the cultural and religious autonomy of the people both in \nthe Tibetan autonomous area, as well as in the three surrounding \nprovinces.\n  I hope this resolution will be heard, and I hope we will pass it \nshortly. If there is no objection, I send the resolution to the desk at \nthis time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The resolution will be received and referred \nappropriately.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/07/senate-section/article/S2641-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2641-S2642]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 4438.

PREEMPTION OF STATE LAW.\n\n       Nothing in this title may be construed to preempt the law \n     of any State, to the extent that such State law provides \n     greater protection to consumers than is provided under this \n     title.\n\n     SEC. 816.

and\n       (iii) whether a loan modification or other mitigation \n     effort is appropriate.\n       (b) Safe Harbor.--Absent specific contractual provisions to \n     the contrary, a servicer of a residential mortgage loan that \n     acts in a\n\n[[Page S2706]]\n\n     manner consistent with the provisions set forth in subsection \n     (a), shall not be liable for entering into a qualified loan \n     modification, or other loss mitigation effort described in \n     subsection (a) to--\n       (1) any person, based on that person's ownership of a \n     residential mortgage loan or any interest in a pool of \n     residential mortgage loans or in securities that distribute \n     payments out of the principal, interest, and other payments \n     in loans on the pool;\n       (2) any person who is obligated to make payments determined \n     in reference to any loan or any interest referred to in \n     paragraph (1);\n       (3) any person that insures any loan or any interest \n     referred to in paragraph (1) under any law or regulation of \n     the United States or any law or regulation of any State or \n     political subdivision of any State; or\n       (4) any other person or institution that may have a \n     financial or commercial relationship and association with the \n     persons associated in paragraphs (1) through (3).\n       (c) Rule of Construction.--No provision of this section \n     shall be construed as limiting the ability of a servicer to \n     enter into loan modifications or workout plans other than \n     qualified loan modification or workout plans.\n       (d) Definitions.--As used in this section, the following \n     definitions shall apply:\n       (1) Qualified loan modification or workout plan.--The term \n     ``qualified loan modification or workout plan'' means a \n     modification or plan that--\n       (A) is scheduled to remain in place until the borrower \n     sells or refinances the property, or for at least 5 years \n     from the date of adoption of the plan, whichever is sooner;\n       (B) does not provide for a repayment schedule that results \n     in negative amortization at any time;\n       (C) does not require the borrower to pay additional points \n     and fees;\n       (D) materially improves the ability of the borrower to--\n       (i) prevent foreclosure; and\n       (ii) resume a reasonable repayment schedule based on, but \n     not limited to, debt to income ratio; and\n       (E) would reasonably reduce the likelihood of default of \n     foreclosure during the life of the modification or plan;\n       (F) may waive any prepayment penalties that reasonably \n     inhibited a loan holder from fulfilling his ability to pay \n     down the principal or maintain regular payments as defined by \n     the terms of the loan; and\n       (G) includes full and accurate disclosure to the borrower \n     of the terms of the modification or workout plan, provided \n     that such disclosures are executed in easy to understand \n     terms that demonstrate how the borrower will benefit from the \n     new terms in such modification or workout plan as compared \n     with the terms and conditions of the previous loan of the \n     borrower.\n       (2) Residential mortgage loan.--The term ``residential \n     mortgage loan'' means a loan that is secured by a lien on an \n     owner-occupied residential dwelling.\n       (3) Securitization vehicle.--The term ``securitization \n     vehicle'' means a trust, corporation, partnership, limited \n     liability entity, special purpose entity, or other structure \n     that--\n       (A) is the issuer, or is created by the issuer, of mortgage \n     pass-through certificates, participation certificates, \n     mortgage-backed securities, or other similar securities \n     backed by a pool of assets that includes residential mortgage \n     loans; and\n       (B) holds such loans.\n       (e) Limitations on Safe Harbor.--Except for the provisions \n     of section 2 that limit liability for efforts to pursue \n     qualified loan modifications or workout plans, the provisions \n     of this section shall not be construed to affect or limit any \n     other liability, duty, or other fiduciary obligation of the \n     servicer to the investors and holders of beneficial interests \n     in the pooled loans to a securitization vehicle, as \n     prescribed by any other specific contractual provision agreed \n     upon, or any other liability, duty, or other fiduciary \n     obligation set forth under any--\n       (1) law or regulation of the United States;\n       (2) law or regulation of any State or political subdivision \n     of any State; or\n       (3) established and approved standards for best practices \n     of any industry or trade group.\n       (f) Effective Period.--This section shall apply only with \n     respect to qualified loan modification or workout plans \n     initiated prior to January 1, 2012.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 4493. Mr. BUNNING (for himself and Ms. Stabenow) submitted an \namendment intended to be proposed to amendment SA 4387 submitted by Mr. \nDodd (for himself and Mr. Shelby) to the bill H.R. 3221, moving the \nUnited States toward greater energy independence and security, \ndeveloping innovative new technologies, reducing carbon emissions, \ncreating green jobs, protecting consumers, increasing clean renewable \nenergy production, and modernizing our energy infrastructure, and to \namend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide tax incentives for \nthe production of renewable energy and energy conservation; which was \nordered to lie on the table; as follows:\n\n       On page 82, between lines 7 and 8, insert the following:\n\n                    TITLE VII--CURRENCY MANIPULATION\n\n     SEC. __01. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``China Currency \n     Manipulation Act of 2008''.\n\n     SEC. __02. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The People's Republic of China has a material global \n     current account surplus.\n       (2) The People's Republic of China has, since the beginning \n     of 2000, accumulated a current account surplus with the \n     United States of nearly $1,200,000,000,000, more than twice \n     the size of the cumulative current account surplus of any \n     other United States trading partner during the same period.\n       (3) The People's Republic of China has engaged in \n     protracted large-scale intervention in currency markets, \n     thereby subsidizing Chinese-made products and erecting a \n     formidable nontariff barrier to trade for United States \n     exports to the People's Republic of China, in contravention \n     of the spirit and intent of the General Agreement on Tariffs \n     and Trade and the Articles of Agreement of the International \n     Monetary Fund.\n\n     SEC. __03. ACTION TO ACHIEVE FAIR CURRENCY.\n\n       (a) Determination.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, the Secretary of the Treasury shall--\n       (1) make an affirmative determination that the People's \n     Republic of China is manipulating the rate of exchange \n     between its currency and the United States dollar within the \n     meaning of section 3004(b) of the Exchange Rates and \n     International Economic Policies Coordination Act of 1988 (22 \n     U.S.C. 5304(b)); and\n       (2) take the action described in subsections (b), (c), and \n     (d) of this section.\n       (b) Action.--\n       (1) In general.--The Secretary of the Treasury shall, not \n     later than 30 days after the date of the enactment of this \n     Act, establish a plan of action to remedy currency \n     manipulation by the People's Republic of China, and submit a \n     report regarding that plan, to the Committee on Banking, \n     Housing, and Urban Affairs and the Committee on Finance of \n     the Senate and the Committee on Financial Services and the \n     Committee on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives.\n       (2) Benchmarks.--The report described in paragraph (1) \n     shall include specific benchmarks and timeframes for \n     correcting the currency manipulation.\n       (c) Initial Negotiations.--The Secretary shall initiate, on \n     an expedited basis, bilateral negotiations with the People's \n     Republic of China for the purpose of ensuring that the \n     country regularly and promptly adjusts the rate of exchange \n     between its currency and the United States dollar to permit \n     effective balance of payment adjustments and to eliminate the \n     unfair competitive advantage.\n       (d) Coordination With the International Monetary Fund.--The \n     Secretary of the Treasury shall, not later than 30 days after \n     the date of the enactment of this Act, instruct the Executive \n     Director to the International Monetary Fund to use the voice \n     and vote of the United States, including requesting \n     consultations under Article IV of the Articles of Agreement \n     of the International Monetary Fund, for the purpose of \n     ensuring the People's Republic of China regularly and \n     promptly adjusts the rate of exchange between its currency \n     and the United States dollar to permit effective balance of \n     payments adjustments and to eliminate the unfair competitive \n     advantage in trade.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/07/senate-section/article/S2706-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2706]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           NOTICE OF HEARING\n\n\n                    SUBCOMMITTEE ON WATER AND POWER\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN.

I would say that on the amendments filed--I think there are \nabout 9 or 10 pending amendments--all but one are not germane. The one \nthat is germane, I believe, is Senator Snowe's amendment. It is my \nunderstanding that Senator Murray may have had one today that appears \nto be germane. We want to dispose of this, if cloture is invoked, which \nwe feel comfortable it will be; those two should have the opportunity \nfor a vote.\n  So this is a good piece of legislation. Does it solve all of the \nhousing problems? Of course not. But it is a step in the right \ndirection. It is imperfect. I have to say as an indication of how good \nit is, we are not happy on this side, and they, the Republicans, are \nnot happy on that side. But we are working together, and this \nlegislation I can defend anyplace. It is a good piece of legislation. \nDo I think it would be better if we have the bankruptcy provision? Of \ncourse I do. But it is not there.\n  This is a very strong package. I look forward to passing it. I think \nit sets the proper tone for the many things we have to accomplish in \nthe Senate this work period. We have the patent bill. That is very \ndifficult. We have the highway technical corrections, the supplemental \nappropriations bill. The only way we can get that done is by working \ntogether. We have a number of other issues we need to work on. So I am \nhappy we are able to work together at this point on this very important \nhousing legislation.\n  There will be no votes in the morning. We tried to work things out so \nthat we would have some votes on some of the germane amendments, but in \ntrying to do that, people who have nongermane amendments would not \nallow us to do that.\n  The cloture vote will be at 2:15 as we have announced.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/07/senate-section/article/S2707-4", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2707]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 10 A.M.
