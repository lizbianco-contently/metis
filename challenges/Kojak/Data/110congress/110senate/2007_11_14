Mr. President, this morning, the Senate will be in a period \nof morning business for 1 hour, with the time divided and controlled \nbetween the two parties--the majority controlling the first half and \nthe Republicans controlling the final portion.\n  Following this, the Senate will resume consideration of the farm \nbill. At 2 p.m. today, Secretary Rice and Secretary Gates will brief \nMembers about the current situations in the Middle East. Both of them \nwill be here in S-407 at 2 p.m.\n\n\n                             The Farm Bill\n\n  Mr. President, the farm bill is an important piece of legislation for \nthis country. That is why we do it every 5 years. It is an immense bill \nand includes many different things dealing with the agriculture of this \ncountry. It is similar in its importance to the highway bill that we do \nevery 5 years. The farm bill is one that affects virtually every State.\n  We hear a lot on this Senate Floor and around the country, as we \nshould, about the fact that we import about 65 percent of all the oil \nwe use in this country, but it is not that way with agricultural \nproducts. We do so much in exporting food. It is one of the businesses \nin America that has a positive balance in trade.\n  I was happy yesterday morning when I was told by the minority we were \ngoing to be able to get a list of amendments and work through this \nbill. It is true we got a list of amendments, but it is as unreasonable \nas anything could be unreasonable--270 amendments, and a large number \nof them nonrelevant. Democrats, after having received these,\n\n[[Page S14354]]\n\ncame up with some amendments, but most of ours are, as well, \nnonrelevant amendments, meaning we wanted to match the Republicans. We \nare able to go forward with a handful of amendments, by that I mean \nfive or six amendments, but that is all we need.\n  To show how unrealistic their list is, one only needs to look at the \nlist. Every Senator has a right to propose amendments. Historically, \nhowever, with the farm bill, the average number of nonrelevant \namendments per bill? One, in recent years. My research indicates \nsomething a little different than I mentioned yesterday. In the last \nthree bills, no amendments, nonrelevant; two amendments; one amendment. \nSo an average of one nonrelevant amendment per bill.\n\n  Here we have amendments they want to offer on this bill dealing with \nimmigration, again, even though we debated for weeks on immigration. \nThis bill is not an immigration bill. And, of course, the old faithful \ndeath tax. People come and say, well, farmers have problems, they are \nlosing their family farms. In California, Senator Feinstein heard about \nthat, and so she asked the farm bureau to give her a list of those who \nhad lost their farms because of the estate tax. None. Zero. This is an \nurban myth or maybe even a rural myth. But, of course, a number of \nSenators wanted to try that again--Republican Senators.\n  The issue of the day is the driver's license. A significant number of \nSenators want to offer amendments dealing with driver's licenses. And \nfishing loans, the Rio Grande River--I don't know what that is about--\nthe Gulf of Mexico, the death tax, and the AMT. We are going to do AMT \nbefore we leave here. We don't need to do it on the farm bill. Fire \nsprinkler systems, National Finance Center, the Exxon Valdez \nlitigation, land transfer, AMT tax. I can't give you the exact number, \nbut there are at least six or seven amendments on the AMT tax. Is AMT \nimportant? Of course, it is. We are going to do AMT before this year \nends. Everyone knows that.\n  In short, the Republicans aren't serious about doing the farm bill. \nThis farm bill is headed down for one reason: the Republicans. They \nobviously don't want a farm bill. If we went along with this list, it \nwould make it impossible to conduct a fair and reasonable debate--\nimpossible.\n  So what I am going to do this afternoon is file cloture on the \nDorgan-Grassley amendment, a bipartisan amendment, the one that is \npending, and then on the bill. That will make a determination. All \nthese organizations that say this farm bill is important--and I have \nhad many of them write letters and contact me and say this is so \nimportant, we need to do this, the last farm bill is not as good as \nthis one, it is a great farm bill--we will find out if the Republicans \nare going to kill this bill. It appears they are going to. They are not \nserious about passing a farm bill this year. If they come up with a \nlist of amendments we can deal with, I am happy to do that. But I am \nnot going to do this. It is not good for the Senate and it is not good \nfor the country.\n  I repeat: The average number of nonrelevant amendments on farm bills: \nOne per bill. We have here enough nonrelevant amendments to fill a \nlittle notebook. So that is where we are. It is unfortunate. The \ncommittee has worked very hard. They passed the bill out of the \ncommittee by voice vote. All Senators obviously agreed this was a good \nbill. Saxby Chambliss, the ranking member, and Tom Harkin, the chairman \nof the committee, think it is a good bill--Democrat and Republican.\n  We are in the situation where Republicans are saying: Well, I want to \noffer my amendment on fire systems, the Exxon Valdez litigation, the \nAMT, and, of course, the old faithful, immigration. So that is where we \nare. It is unfortunate that is where we are, but this bill is headed \ndown.\n  I indicated what I am going to do. Unless the Republicans come up \nwith something more realistic, this bill is going to have cloture filed \non Dorgan-Grassley, cloture on the bill, and that is where we will be \non the bill this afternoon sometime.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/14/senate-section/article/S14354-1", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14354]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, the comments I am about to make could \nwell have been made by my friend on the other side of the aisle as \nrecently as last year, when his party was in the minority.\n  Of course, we all know we will indeed pass the farm bill. The only \nissue is: When and how. We actually made good progress yesterday on \nboth sides, defining the realm of possible amendments that might be \nfiled to the bill. The amendments list on our side is actually about \n120, and the Democratic list is 140--approximately 265 amendments on \nthe list.\n  Before my good friend on the other side protests too much about this \nnumber, let me remind Senators that 246 amendments were filed to the \n2002 farm bill, 339 amendments were filed to the 1996 farm bill, \naveraging about 300 amendments per bill. In fact, when Republicans were \nattempting to move the 1996 farm bill through the Senate, the current \ncommittee chairman, Senator Harkin himself, filed 35 amendments. So if \nall 100 Senators emulated the Senator from Iowa, 3,500 amendments would \nbe the normal for farm bill consideration.\n  Thus, the current list of 265 amendments is not insurmountable, and, \nactually, not at all unusual at the beginning of the process of passing \na farm bill. This is a complex bill that only gets reauthorized every 5 \nyears. This time it is 1,600 pages long and includes the first farm \nbill tax title since 1933, adding an extra degree of difficulty.\n  However, Republicans are ready and willing to begin working in \nearnest to address these amendments. What always happens is that most \nof the amendments go away and we gradually work down the list. But this \nis a massive bill. The notion--if I can lift it here--that we are going \nto basically call up a bill of this magnitude, file cloture, and \nbasically have no amendments strikes me as, shall I say, odd at least. \nWhat we always do is try to work out an orderly way to go forward. The \nissue of getting a fixed amendment list, which we were prepared to \nenter into last night, is the way it usually begins.\n  I am a little perplexed as to whether the majority actually wants \nthis bill to pass and is trying to simply blame the minority for trying \nto bring it down. We all know, and I am sure anybody who has followed \nthe Senate at all knows, we are going to pass a farm bill, no question \nabout that. The farm bill is not going to be killed. The issue is \nwhether we are going to have any kind of reasonable process for going \nforward, and I think getting an amendment list is the first step. I was \nhoping we could do that, but, apparently, that is not the case, and I \nregret that we are where we are.\n  But let me reassure everyone, I don't think there is anybody in the \ncountry who knows we aren't going to pass a farm bill, and nobody is \ngoing to kill the farm bill. But we are going to insist on a reasonable \nprocedure for going forward.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, there is no ability to pass a farm bill \nunder the present situation. If people think the farm bill is going to \nbe just passed because the distinguished Republican leader says one is \ngoing to pass, they are mistaken. We have a lot to do. We have 3 weeks \nafter we come back after Thanksgiving and that is it for this year. \nNext year is going to be a very difficult year.\n  We have to figure out some way, next year, to work our way through \nthe Presidential election and all the other elections that are taking \nplace around the country. There is no guarantee--and that is an \nunderstatement--we will have a farm bill.\n  The one question no one answers is, What do we do with nonrelevant \namendments? The history is one per bill. Here we have immigration, AMT \nsix different times, we have fire safety, Exxon Valdez litigation, and \non and on with nonrelevant amendments.\n  This is not the beginning of the process. The process started 10 days \nago, and we have been stalled for 10 days--\n\n[[Page S14355]]\n\n10 days with nothing being done. We can talk about maybe the Democrats \ndon't want it done. We have been here willing and able to work through \nthese amendments, but Republicans have been unwilling to work with us \nin any meaningful way.\n  I would also say, a reasonable process? I am willing to work through \na reasonable process, but we cannot put the Senate through having \nmultiple votes on immigration issues or on nonrelated tax issues. We \nneed to work on a farm bill. I repeat, if the Republicans want to come \nup with some type of a reasonable way to go forward, fine. Otherwise, \nthey can vote to kill this bill, and they will vote to do it.\n  We will vote on the bipartisan Dorgan-Grassley amendment on cloture, \nwhich, in the past, has received overwhelming support in the Senate; it \nhas been done. The amendment has been offered before. And a vote on \ncloture on the bill. If the bill goes down, there may be an opportunity \nwe will bring it back again, but I do not know when. It certainly is \nnot going to be in January. We have a lot of other people who are \ninterested in doing things in January.\n  The Republicans have had their chance to be reasonable on the farm \nbill. I have tried my best to be patient, to be reasonable, to be \nthoughtful on a way to proceed on this bill. What did we get last \nnight? I have said: Right now, Democrats--we can come up with five \namendments, all relevant. That leaves them with the nonrelevant \namendments. We will give them the average--or if they want two, we will \nconsider that. But we are not going to deal with 247 amendments. We \nwant five; we don't want nonrelevant amendments as has been done in the \npast. I don't know how we could be more reasonable than that--five.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. We could have done way more than five amendments over \nthe past week if the majority leader had not filled up the tree and \nprevented amendments from being offered. The last time the tree was \nfilled on a farm bill was two decades ago, on October 31, 1985. In \n1985, the majority leader filled the tree after a week of floor \nconsideration; not after the very first day, but after a week--a week.\n  Here, amendments were prevented by a parliamentary device of the \nmajority leader, which he is certainly entitled to use, to prevent an \namendment process from going forward. Now we have this 1,600-page bill \nwith no amendments allowed, and the majority leader says we ought to \ninvoke cloture on the bill and pass it.\n  Look, we know the farm bill is going to pass. With all due respect to \nmy good friend the majority leader, I know he is bluffing. He is going \nto pass a farm bill. I am reasonably confident the farm bill is going \nto pass after the minority gets an opportunity to offer some \namendments.\n  I am also totally confident that the fact that the amendment list has \na lot of amendments on it at the beginning does not mean they are all \ngoing to be offered or all going to be voted on. That is just the way \nthe legislative process starts on a very large, complicated bill that \nwe only pass once every 5 years.\n  I suppose we are at a stalemate. Obviously, we will continue to talk, \nand hopefully we can work out some way to go forward. But I am very \ndoubtful that the minority is going to be interested in going forward \nin a situation where they basically have no opportunities to affect a \n1,600-page bill that we only pass every 5 years.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if this were a jury, they wouldn't be out \nvery long and they would return a verdict on behalf of the majority. To \nthink someone would be gullible enough to believe the Republicans have \nnot had an opportunity to offer amendments is simply without basis in \nfact. We have said all we have to do is get rid of the Dorgan \namendment. There is plenty of opportunity to offer any amendment they \nwant to offer in relation to this bill--anything they want to offer \nthat is relevant and germane.\n  This is all a game, a game that is being played for reasons to \ndestroy this farm bill, and they are doing a pretty good job. A week \nago last Monday we started on this legislation, and we have \naccomplished nothing because the Republicans have refused to do so on \nthe basis that they have been unable to offer amendments, which is \nuntrue.\n  This is a situation in which we find ourselves. I think Democrats and \nRepublicans are satisfied that the right thing is being done, where \nthey don't have to march down here again on an unrelated matter and \nvote on immigration. We spent a month on immigration matters. Everyone \nknows AMT is going to be resolved. It has passed the House; we are \ngoing to do it here. This is a game that is being played.\n  I repeat, if this were a jury--and it is not, and I understand that; \nat least the jury is not going to be in until next November--we would \nfind a quick return of a verdict because what we have agreed to do is \nwhat has been done in many instances on every farm bill. We do not deal \nwith nonrelevant amendments, and we are not going to on this one unless \nthere is some agreement reached, as I have indicated.\n  I repeat, this afternoon we are going to go ahead and file cloture on \nthis amendment that has been pending for 10 days and file cloture on \nthe bill. If the Republicans don't want a farm bill, they have an \nopportunity to vote not to proceed on the legislation.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, on the issue of nonrelevant amendments \nin the last several decades, the majority leader has indicated the farm \nbill has not had nonrelevant amendments. According to my information, \nthe Democrats have filed seemingly nonrelevant amendments during \nconsideration of the last several farm bills on such things as the \nSocial Security trust fund--offered on a farm bill; bankruptcy--offered \non a farm bill; and convicted fugitives in Cuba--offered on a farm \nbill. So I hope no one seriously believed that nonrelevant amendments \nhave not been offered by the other side on farm bills over the last \ncouple of decades.\n  This is the kind of sparring that frequently goes on at the beginning \nof a big, complicated bill. We all know how it will end. It will end, \nin the end, with a reasonable number of amendments on both sides being \nvoted on and the passage of the farm bill. The timing of that, \nobviously, will be up to the majority leader, who does have a difficult \nchallenge. Floor time is always at a premium in the Senate. We \nunderstand that. But at some point, we will pass the farm bill, in the \nnear future, after we have negotiated a process that is fair to both \nsides.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Republican leader still refuses to \nanswer the question before this body. The question is very direct. Why \nnonrelevant amendments? People can file them; we just have never voted \non them in farm bills. It is very clear we have not voted on them.\n  We had a bill in 2001-2002, one in 1996, and one in 1990. In 1990, \nthere were two nonrelevant amendments that were considered, that is it; \nin 1996, no nonrelevant amendments; in 2001-2002, two nonrelevant \namendments--as I have indicated, an average of one in the last three \nbills.\n  We cannot be in a position here where the first amendment offered is \none that is going to deal with immigration again, border fences, how \nlong the fence is. How many times do we have to vote on how long the \nfence should be between the United States and Mexico, without even \naddressing the fence in northern America? As I indicated, the new \nimmigration legislation of choice to bash people is now the driver's \nlicense--that is here. I don't think we need to get into that. What we \nneed to get into is amendments that deal with this farm bill.\n  Some may say this is sparring. I do not agree with that. I think we \nare about the business of this country. We have a lot to do. The issue \nbefore this body now is this farm bill. I am very disappointed that it \nappears quite likely there will be no farm bill.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, this has been an interesting colloquy, \nbut the parliamentary situation we are in is that unless the majority \nleader gives his consent, no amendments on my side will be allowed. \nThat is an unacceptable way to go forward on a 1,600-page bill that we \npass every 5 years. We will continue to talk. We all know there\n\n[[Page S14356]]\n\nwill be a farm bill. The only issue is when and how, and that is \nsomething we will have to negotiate here in the Senate, as we always \ndo.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, last word, maybe; otherwise, I get the last \nword later.\n  Mr. President, the Republicans offer an amendment. I offered the \nfirst amendment on behalf of Dorgan and Grassley. It is a bipartisan \namendment. If they have an amendment they want to offer, let them offer \nit. I will be happy to stand out of the way. But they are offering all \nthese excuses why they can't do it, and that is too bad.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/14/senate-section/article/S14356-1", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14356]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise today and come to the floor to \nencourage my colleagues to move expeditiously to pass the Food and \nEnergy Security Act of 2007.\n  Sometimes we get caught in our bubble in Washington and we forget, we \nforget there is a whole world outside in this great land of ours: \nworking families, folks who are working hard each and every day to \nprovide for their families, to ensure their safety, to take care of \ntheir children, to be a part of their community, and to help their \nneighbors.\n  On October 25 our Senate Agriculture Committee passed this \nlegislation unanimously, not one single dissenting vote. And that is \nbecause there were a lot of Members who understood the importance of \nthis bill. They came together and worked to come up with a bill in \nwhich everyone had a vested interest.\n  It passed unanimously for good reason. It does a tremendous amount \nnot only for our farm families but for antihunger advocates, for \nenvironmentalists, those working to spur economic development in rural \nareas, and it takes tremendous strides to rid our Nation of its \ndependence on foreign oil.\n  All of those are positive, progressive things that happen in this \nbill, brought together, again, by a group in the Senate Agriculture \nCommittee who wanted to make progress, who wanted to put together a \nbill everybody could be proud of, that everybody could help move \nforward.\n  I know this policy effort is not on the top of everyone's priority \nlist in this body like it is on mine. It is on the top of my mine, and \nit is a huge priority for me for multiple reasons. One, I am a farmer's \ndaughter. I understand. I understand what farm families are doing out \nthere. I understand, when they get up at the crack of dawn, before the \nSun comes up, they get out and work hard, to do something that gives \nthem a tremendous sense of pride. They produce a safe and abundant and \naffordable supply of food and fiber for this country.\n  I also know it is a huge priority for me because of my State, and the \nfact that my State has an economy that is based on agriculture. They \nhave a great sense of pride in not only being able to provide that safe \nand abundant and affordable food supply in the most efficient way \npossible for this great land, but they do so worldwide as well.\n  At a minimum, everyone here should recognize and appreciate what this \nbill accomplishes, even if you take for granted that the grocery store \nshelves are full when you go in that grocery store, even if you take \nfor granted that you pay less than anybody in the developed world per \ncapita for your food source, and even if you take for granted the fact \nthat it is produced in the most environmentally respectful way, and \nalso that it is produced in a way that is safe, through all kinds of \nregulations, all kinds of research that provides us the sound backing \nthat our food source is safe.\n  It is safe for our children, safe for our elderly, safe for our \nfamilies. That is huge. At a time when we are seeing foods coming in \nthrough our borders, through our ports that are unsafe from countries \nthat do not put on those restrictions and regulations, for countries \nthat do not have the efficiency on their farms that we do, it is \nabsolutely critical that we bring ourselves together and focus on this \nbill.\n  In this bill there is a $5.28 billion increase--an increase--to our \nnutrition programs. These are programs that provide assistance and a \nnutritious meal at breakfast and lunch for children, nutritious meals \nfor the elderly across this country, nutritious summer feeding \nprograms, nutritious fruits and vegetables and snacks for school \nchildren. That is a huge step in the right direction.\n  Something we can all get behind is over a $4 billion increase to \nconservation. You know it is unbelievable to see that kind of an \nincrease to reinforce those who love and use the land, that they can do \nso with the incentives to make sure they are using the optimum of \ntechnology and research to conserve that land that means so much to \nthem and to future generations.\n  That is a third straight record for the farm bill in terms of \nincreases in what we are seeing in this underlying bill. There is $500 \nmillion for rural development in our small communities where we are \nseeing a desperate need for broadband and access to the information \nhighway where we are looking for investment from entrepreneurs and \nsmall businesses so that we can keep strong our communities in rural \nAmerica, and we do not see this flight into the cities, making sure \nthose communities can be strong for the schools and for churches and \nfor children and the working families who live in those rural \ncommunities, who have their heritage, their heart is there in that \ncommunity, so that they can stay there, so that we as a nation make \nthose investments.\n  The energy incentives in this bill, when it is coupled with the \nFinance Committee incentives, shows a true commitment to moving \nrenewable fuels into the marketplace. You know, it does not make a bit \nof difference if we continue to produce all of these renewable fuels if \nwe do not get them into the marketplace, if we do not get them into the \nhands of consumers. And it also does not make any difference if we do \nnot start to think outside the box, looking for newer and more \ninnovative processes and research to provide renewable fuels that come \nfrom feedstock that might be leftovers.\n  We know we can make cellulosic ethanol from cotton sticks and rice \nhulls and rice straw, but we have to get that to the consumer. We have \nto get that process going. There are great opportunities in this bill \nfor that.\n  In short, this bill is a win for every region of our great Nation. \nAnd everyone, even if your plow is a pencil, even if you have not spent \ntime walking rice levees or scouting cotton or chopping down coffee \nbean plants in a bean field like I have, even if your plow is a pencil \nand the closest farm is 1,000 miles away from you, it should be so \nobvious to everyone that the farm bill provides exactly what this title \nsuggests: it provides this Nation's security, it provides us with \nsecurity of knowing that we will have the domestic production of a food \nsupply for our people and for our Nation, that we will help feed the \nworld with that safe and affordable and abundant supply of food and \nfiber.\n  Unfortunately, it is clear by the criticisms of the farm bill by the \neditorial boards and major newspapers that many of our hard-working \nfarm families are not getting the respect they deserve for what it is \nthey provide. It is my hope the Senate will not also take for granted \nthe security of safe food and fiber at a time when so much of what is \nentering this country\n\n[[Page S14357]]\n\nis either not inspected, nor safe, or sent back.\n  We had a hearing in the Finance Committee. We were told about port \nshopping, that products coming in commodities, coming into our country \ncome to one of our ports, get inspected, get rejected, and then they \nstart shopping around for a port that does not have an inspector. And, \nyes, we have ports without inspectors.\n  So not only are we accepting substandard food, but we are minimizing \nour ability to produce our own with the control and the oversight that \nensures us that what we produce domestically is safe.\n  This piece of legislation is about national security, just as foreign \npolicy is in many other regions of the world. Why is it we think that \nwhen we go to these trade negotiations, usually the last thing that is \nnegotiated is agricultural products? It is because those countries \nunderstand. Those countries have been hungry. They have been subjected \nto foods that are unsafe or grown in a manner they don't appreciate. \nBut they also know they can control making sure that there is enough \nthere, if they can control and keep out our products. Many of the \ncommodities I grow do find themselves on the international scene as \ncommodities left out of trade agreements. That is because they are \ncritical. They are a staple in the global community for sustenance of \nlife.\n  Whether a country provides subsidies at levels much higher than those \nincluded in this bill or protects their farmers by a prohibitive tariff \nstructure, every country in some form or fashion ensures a domestic \nfood supply. If we continue in the direction we are going, where we are \nseeing for the first time in the history of our country the possibility \nof a trade deficit in agricultural products, what is that going to mean \nto us as a nation? It is going to mean we are then going to be more \ndependent on other countries for food that is critical for children and \nfamilies all across this land.\n  In the United States, the farm bill is the policy that ensures safe \nfood and fiber. We have worked hard in the Agriculture Committee to \ncome up with a bill that was both bipartisan and biregional, agreed \nupon by everybody. Everybody got something positive out of a bill that \nwas respectful to the diversity of this country, to the diversity of \nhow we grow our crops. Lord, it was interesting for me to talk with my \ncolleagues from way up on the Canadian border who had snow in August. \nWe had 12 straight days of over 100-degree weather in Arkansas. We are \na diverse nation and we are blessed to be that way. It is all the more \nreason we have the responsibility in this body to be respectful of that \ndiversity and what it is that each of us has to bring to the table from \nour States. The Agriculture Committee did that.\n  It also respected the needs of those who are less fortunate in the \nnutrition title. It respected the idea that Americans want to ensure \nconservation and good stewardship of the land. We did that. We looked \nat the need for renewable energy, and we have made a huge investment, \nboth in the farm bill in authorizing policy and also in the Finance \nCommittee package that accompanies it, making sure that incentives are \nthere for communities and for ag producers and all of those in rural \nAmerica that not only can we continue the research but get into \nproduction of renewable fuels and, most importantly, that we can get \nthem to the consumer. It doesn't matter how much we produce; if we are \nnot using it, it is not benefiting the environment and not lessening \nour dependence on foreign oil. In the long term, it is not going to \nbenefit growers who are looking for that secondary market.\n  We should all recognize and appreciate the bounty this bill provides \nand what it does for the hard-working men and women in farm families \nacross this country who support each and every one of us every day in \nwhat it is they do for us for that security. I urge my colleagues to \nget serious about passing this bill and providing the certainty our \nfarm families deserve, knowing that Government stands with them. Today, \nthis time right now in our State of Arkansas, it is time to plant the \nwinter wheat crop. Without knowing what the policy is going to be for \nnext year or the year after that or the year after that, it is pretty \nhard to go to that banker and ask for that tremendous loan for that \ninvestment one has to make in producing that safe and abundant, \naffordable food supply, without knowing where one's Government stands.\n  I appeal to my colleagues and ask them to join us on the floor to \ntalk about how important this bill is and, more importantly, to come \ntogether and figure out a way we can make this happen before we go home \nto celebrate Thanksgiving and the incredible bounty this country \nprovides. Let us make sure those who provide for us have an \nunderstanding of where their Government stands on their behalf.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN.

Mr. President, amid the news we have received this last \nmonth on a variety of fronts--some good, some bad--is some very \npositive news from our economy. October marked the 50th straight month \nof positive job creation in the United States, a new record since the \nGovernment began keeping such records in 1939. Unfortunately, Congress \nhas set a record of its own last week, when it finally sent the first \nof 12 appropriations bills that should have been finished before \nOctober 1, when the new fiscal year began, to the President for his \nsignature. Not since 1987, 20 years ago, has Congress taken this long \nto send a single appropriations bill to the President this late in the \nfiscal year. I ask this question: What family, what small business, who \nin the United States could run their fiscal house this way, other than \nthe Congress? Only the Congress has the power to basically suspend the \npowers of disbelief and pass something called a continuing resolution \nso that spending remains on auto pilot at last year's levels, rather \nthan meet the needs of this current year by passing appropriations \nbills. Instead of working hard together, as I genuinely believe most \nMembers of this body want, we see instead a calculated game being \nplayed out.\n  I want to focus specifically on our Veterans and Military \nConstruction bill which should have been passed as a stone-alone bill \nand should have been signed by the President before Veterans Day this \nlast Monday but was not. Rather than working to see that the funding \nfor our veterans and for quality-of-life funding for military families, \nwhich is absolutely essential for a volunteer military force such as \nours, we see this bill has consciously been held behind, even though it \npassed some 2 months ago, presumably to serve as a vehicle for a large \nspending bill that will be offered in December.\n  This veterans funding bill is perhaps the most telling and troubling \nsign of the games this process has degenerated into. It strikes me--and \nI believe I am not alone--that there is a serious discrepancy between \nwhat Congress says to our veterans and what Congress does for our \nveterans. Knowing how important veterans funding is to the President \nand to the country as a whole and to the Members of this body, some of \nmy colleagues have decided instead to use this bill as a vehicle to \nexpand Washington spending and, unfortunately, engage in partisan \ngames. Rather than funding the veterans bill by itself with important \nfunding and benefit enhancements that will serve America's veterans and \nmilitary families, the majority leader has decided, initially at least, \nto try to merge this bill with another bill he knew the President was \ngoing to veto. As a matter of fact, he did yesterday, the Labor-HHS \nbill, because it would cost American taxpayers $11 billion more than \nthe President asked for and included a number of, shall we call them, \n``interesting earmarks'' or special projects designated by Members of \nthe Senate.\n\n[[Page S14358]]\n\n  Fortunately, we were able, through a point of order urged by my \nsenior Senator, Mrs. Hutchison, under Senate rules, to separate the \nVeterans and Military Construction bill from an overloaded Labor, \nHealth and Human Services bill.\n  I ask my colleagues to consider what the American people are supposed \nto think when they see examples such as this. The labor bill the \nPresident vetoed included a special interest earmark for a San \nFrancisco museum called the Exploratorium. I have never heard of the \nExploratorium before, but let me explain a little about this particular \nearmark that was included in the vetoed bill. This is to fund, at \ntaxpayer expense, a museum that has more than 500,000 visitors each \nyear and an annual budget of almost $30 million. Yet the American \ntaxpayer has been asked unknowingly to spend money on Exploratorium--\npayments of more than $11 per visitor over the last 6 years. What is \nperplexing to me is why the majority would knit together funding for \nthis Exploratorium, for example, along with about 2,000 other earmarks \nor special interest appropriations, with money for veterans health \ncare. Why should veterans be required to shoulder the burden not only \nfor this earmark, which I think we could fairly debate the \nappropriateness of, but over $1 billion set aside for earmarks in a \ncompletely unrelated matter and unrelated bill? This is exactly what \nthe majority leader tried to do last week, along with our colleagues on \nthe other side of the aisle.\n  At the end of the day, we were able to stop this strategy and prevent \nour veterans from becoming yet another political football in the \nappropriations process. Unfortunately, we still haven't seemed to learn \nthe lessons from this unfortunate gamesmanship, because we still have \nnot yet passed the Veterans and Military Construction appropriations \nbill, even though it has been sitting there, waiting to go to the \nPresident for about the last 2 months. Just as we were able to free our \nveterans from this pork-laden trap, the majority leader indicated that \nthe veterans bill would not actually ever get independent funding. On \nNovember 7, he said:\n\n       Some Republicans are seeking to separate the two bills, to \n     force a vote just on the VA bill and vote just on the Labor-\n     Health and Human Services bill. If we do that, here is what \n     happens. This bill will go back to the House with only the \n     Labor-Health and Human Services bill. That is all the \n     President will get. He will not get the veterans bill.\n\n  In other words, the majority leader on November 7 said that if we \nwere successful in splitting these two bills apart, the President would \nget the porkbarrel spending bill that pluses up spending for these \n2,000 earmarked special projects and is $11 billion over the \nPresident's requested amount, and the majority leader would make sure \nthat the Veterans and Military Construction appropriations bill didn't \ngo to the President. I don't know how this kind of action can be \ncharacterized other than a shameful way to treat our veterans and to \ndeal with the quality-of-life issues included in the military \nconstruction portion of this appropriations bill.\n  It is past time to fund the Federal Government at appropriate levels \nand to give our veterans and troops currently in harm's way the funding \nthey need, as well as those who have proudly worn the uniform of the \nU.S. military whom we honored just this last Veterans Day, last Monday. \nIt is long past time we put aside the gamesmanship that, unfortunately, \nseems to characterize so much of what happens here in Washington when \nit comes to politics.\n  I think we ought to try to figure some way to work together to \nreverse the lowest approval rating in recent time which the American \npublic currently has with regard to the U.S. Senate, to help put a stop \nto these games and liberate our Nation's finances from the grip of \npartisan politics, I would suggest, and to make sure we do not end up \nin a game of chicken where the American people are told if we do not \npass a bloated Omnibus appropriations bill there will be a shutdown of \nthe Government.\n  I believe we ought to go ahead and pass, by way of insurance, the \nGovernment Shutdown Prevention Act. This legislation will guarantee \nthat the Government continues to work for the American people until \nCongress passes responsible appropriations bills. We need to do this \nsooner rather than later. It does not look as if we are going to get it \ndone this week before we break for the Thanksgiving recess, but we sure \nought to get it done when we come back on December 3.\n  Passing the Government Shutdown Prevention Act will make sure the \nAmerican people need not be frightened into thinking the Federal \nGovernment will not continue to operate and fund essential programs \nwhile we continue to debate what the appropriate level of \nappropriations bills should be.\n  Mr. President, I yield myself 2 more minutes, to be followed by the \nSenator from New Hampshire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, my colleagues from the majority want to \nspend $23 billion above what the President has requested in his budget \nfor discretionary spending. Now, that is $23 billion in discretionary \nspending over and above entitlement spending, which has been operating \nagain on autopilot at the growth rate of about 8 percent per year. They \nhave claimed $23 billion is not all that much money. But I would \nsuggest that only in Washington is $23 billion to be considered pocket \nchange. The American people are smarter than that. They know somebody \nhas to pay for that money. It does not magically appear. What it means \nis the Federal Government is going to reach into their pockets and \nextract it from their hard-earned wages in order to fund these vast \nexpansions of Government programs.\n  We need to make sure that we are better stewards of the taxpayers' \ndollars and that we regain the lost confidence the American people had \nin this institution. We need to take care of problems, for example, \nsuch as the growing alternative minimum tax, which threatens to grow \nfrom 6 million taxpayers this year to 23 million taxpayers next year--a \ntypical so-called tax-the-rich program, which, just as they always do, \ntends to grow to creep into the middle class. We need to make sure the \nmiddle class does not suffer a huge tax increase by dealing with the \nalternative minimum tax.\n  Again, instead of being in lockdown, as we are on the farm bill \nbecause the majority leader will not allow any amendments to be offered \nexcept for ones he cherry-picks, we ought to be solving these problems, \npass a Veterans and Military Construction bill, get it to the \nPresident, and not have a game of chicken with $23 billion in excess \nspending, which we know the President is going to veto. Instead we \nshould engage in a meaningful dialog to try to come up with a \nnegotiated amount. We should eliminate this middle-class tax increase \nwhich is going to grow from affecting 6 million people to 23 million \npeople unless we do something about it before the end of the year.\n  Mr. President, I know the distinguished Senator from New Hampshire is \nhere with us and ready to take the floor, so I yield to him.\n  I ask that the Senator from South Carolina, who I know is coming down \nafter the Senator from New Hampshire, be reserved 8 minutes of the time \nwe have remaining.\n  Mr. President, could I ask how much time we have remaining on this \nside?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Seventeen minutes is remaining.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that it be split \nevenly between the Senator from New Hampshire and the Senator from \nSouth Carolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Texas.\n  First, Mr. President, I join the Senator from Texas in asking that \nthe majority leader and the Democratic membership free the Veterans \nbill and the Military Construction bill, which is ready to be sent to \nthe President, stop holding it hostage for the purpose of holding it up \nwith special interest projects which have nothing to do with the \nmilitary or with veterans, and instead send that bill down to the \nPresident so he can sign it so our veterans can know they are getting \nthe support they need after their great service to our Nation.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/14/senate-section/article/S14359-1", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14359-S14360]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S14359]]\n                             THE FARM BILL\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise to talk a little bit about the \nstatus of the farm bill because I was stunned, obviously, today to find \nthat the majority leader--after for 2 weeks, almost, refusing to allow \nany amendments to the farm bill--has now decided to file cloture on the \nfarm bill and claim this is the way things are done in the Senate. That \nis a statement which is pretty hard to accept with a straight face: the \nconcept that the majority leader would set up a process in the Senate \nwhich, essentially, made him the gatekeeper of all amendments to a \nmajor authorization and appropriations bill--appropriations in the \nsense it has mandatory spending in it--so that any Member of the Senate \nwho wanted to offer an amendment would have to go through the majority \nleader before the amendment would be allowed to come to the floor. \nWell, that is the way they do things in the House of Representatives, \nobviously, with what is known as the Rules Committee. But the Senate \ndoes not do that. The Senate has never done that.\n  I have heard innumerable, wonderful speeches from the senior Senator \nfrom West Virginia, the keeper, basically, of the flame of the \nintegrity of the Senate, Mr. Byrd, on the importance of the amendment \nprocess in the Senate. I happen to subscribe to that, as I thought \nevery Member of the Senate subscribed to that, that the greatness of \nthe Senate is that if we put a piece of legislation on the floor, which \nis a significant piece of public policy, we debate it, we hear ideas on \nit, then we vote on those different ideas, and then we vote on passage. \nWe do not lock down a bill and not allow any amendments to occur on \nthat bill except those that are accepted on the majority side and by \nthe majority leader and then say to the minority: Well, because you \nwould not accept our process of locking down the amendment process, we \nare going to file cloture to shut you out completely.\n  That truly is an autocratic level which this Senate has never seen. \nLet me tell you something, it puts us on a slippery slope. It is very \npossible--in fact, I hope likely--that the other side of the aisle may \nnot be in the majority forever around here and maybe not even through \nthe next election. Certainly, if they continue to produce such a \ndysfunctional legislative calendar, as they have over the last year, I \nwould think the American people would get a little frustrated and ask \nfor a change. But they have now opened the door to running the Senate \nas an autocratic system, as a dictatorial system where the rights of 99 \nMembers of the Senate are made completely subservient to 1 Member, \nwhich is the majority leader, because he has the right of recognition, \nhe fills up the tree, and then when he does not like the amendments, he \nfiles cloture.\n  Let's talk about some of the amendments he does not want us to hear \non this bill relative to the farm bill. He does not want an amendment \noffered which would say to farm families, especially to mothers in farm \nfamilies: You will have access to OB/GYNs. That is one of the \namendments I intended to offer. It would simply say that OB/GYNs who \npractice in farm and rural communities would be immune from excessive \nliability and lawsuits from trial lawyers.\n  We know for a fact we have lost most of our OB/GYNs in rural America. \nThese baby doctors cannot practice in rural America because there are \nnot enough clients for them to generate enough revenue to pay the cost \nof their malpractice insurance, which is generated by these lawsuits \nfrom trial lawyers. Well, the other side of the aisle is a kept group \nfor the trial lawyers, so they do not want anything that could happen \naround here that might limit the income of trial lawyers, including \nallowing baby doctors to deliver babies in rural America to farm \nfamilies. So they are not going to allow me to offer that amendment. \nWhat an outrage.\n  They do not want an amendment which would give firefighters in this \ncountry the right to bargain in order to reach agreement on contracts. \nNow, I do not think fires just burn in cities. Farmers have fires. In \nfact, if you look at what is happening in the West with wildfires, \nthere are a lot of issues of fires for farmers in this country, \nespecially silo fires. I know. I come from an area where there are \noccasional silo fires. They need firefighters. But the other side of \nthe aisle does not want to hear about an amendment that deals with \nfirefighters' rights. No. They want to lock that amendment out of the \nprocess.\n  They want to lock out of the process an amendment which would address \nthe issue of people who are caught up in this terrible mortgage crisis \nwe have. There are a lot of farmers, I suspect, and a lot of Americans \ngenerally who did not know how these ARMs worked when they went into \nthese deals, and they are now finding they are being refinanced at a \nlevel where they cannot keep their homes because their interest rates \nare jumping up into the double-digit levels. When those homes are \nforeclosed on, they get a double whammy of getting hit by the IRS with \nwhat is known as a recognized gain, even though they did not have any \nincome because their home got foreclosed on. This is a really difficult \nthing to do to someone, whether you are a farmer or just an average \nAmerican, to first have their home foreclosed on and then to hit them \nwith an IRS bill for having their home foreclosed on. I was going to \nsuggest we take that issue up on the farm bill because it happens to \nrelate to a lot of farmers who are being foreclosed on.\n  I was going to suggest we take up an amendment which might look at \nsome of these new commodities that were put into this bill, such as the \nasparagus program and the camellia program and the chickpea program, \nbut we do not want to hear about that. No, we do not want to address \nthose issues.\n  We do not want to address the issue of the fact that this bill has in \nit $10 billion--$10 billion--of gamesmanship on moving dates so they \ncan make this bill look more affordable and less costly. They don't \nwant to have an amendment on that which might make the bill honest on \nits face. They don't want to hear that amendment. They don't want to \nhear this amendment, which is sort of ironic.\n  They have put in this bill what is called walking-around money--\nwalking-around money--for the farm States in this country, actually for \nfive farm States, called a $5 billion disaster loan fund. The way we \nhave always handled disaster loans for the farm community--and they \nhave them, and they are legitimate--is we have simply passed an \nemergency bill around here to cover the disaster when the disaster \noccurs. But what this bill does is set up a new fund which will be a \nfloor, essentially, which says there is $5 billion in this kitty \nsitting over here for which if there is a disaster, you take this money \ntoo. What is the practical implication of that? Every wind storm that \noccurs in North Dakota that blows over a mailbox is going to be \ndeclared a disaster so they can get some of this money. It is putting \nmoney on the table that is just going to be used up.\n  We know we are going to fund disasters when they occur. Why would we \nprefund disasters in a way that is going to make it absolutely \nguaranteed that a disaster will occur, even if there is not a disaster? \nWell, we don't want to have an amendment which says: Let's take that \ndisaster money and move it over to IDEA, special education. There is an \naccount that needs some more money. There is an account which would \ngive relief to a lot of families in this country, a lot of small towns \nin this country, farm communities and other communities that have a \nhuge burden of IDEA in special education. Let's take that $5 billion \nout of that emergency account and, rather than having walking-around \nmoney for the five States that usually get this emergency money, use it \nfor IDEA, which will benefit all the States in this country.\n  They don't want to hear those amendments.\n  It is incredible that on a bill of this size--one of the biggest \nbills we deal with as a Congress, one of the most important pieces of \npublic policy we deal with--the other side of the aisle and the \nmajority leader have specifically set up a procedure where amendments \nwill not be tolerated--simply won't be tolerated. Totally \ninappropriate. I think basically what the other side of the aisle wants \nto do is kill this bill.\n  Now, from my perspective, this is not a good bill, and I am going to \nbe voting against it. But I know it is going to pass if it is given a \nlegitimate shot at\n\n[[Page S14360]]\n\npassage because there are a lot of people around here who have these \ndifferent commodities, and they all vote for each other, and, as a \nresult, they build up enough votes to pass this bill. That is the way \nthe farm bill always works. But that is no reason why we should not \nhave a chance to debate it, to address some of these issues, such as \nbaby doctors in rural communities and farm communities, such as the \nneed for firefighters to have adequate bargaining rights, such as the \nneed for people who are getting foreclosed on not getting hit with an \nIRS bill, such as the need to have proper accounting on this bill for \nwhat they are actually spending, such as the need for not setting up a \n$5 billion walking-around money fund, such as the need for the new \ncommodities programs for asparagus, chickpeas, and camellia. We should \nhave amendments to address all these issues. That is what the process \nof the Senate is all about. But it is being denied here. The result of \nthat denial is that those of us who happen to believe the Senate should \nfunction as a place where things are amended and discussed and aired \nand heard are going to have to resist this bill. So the majority seems \nto want to kill this bill, which is unfortunate, because in the end, \nthis bill should at least get a fair hearing.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I think we came into this year very \nhopeful in a lot of ways. The Republicans lost the majority, and in \nsome ways I think that is a good thing. We lost our discipline on \nspending, and for many years our Democratic colleagues were more than \nhappy to help us and even try to one-up us during the period we were in \nthe majority.\n  Our last act as the majority, though, was a good one. We were able to \nstop last year's omnibus bill and force Congress to move ahead under a \ncontinuing resolution that only had about 2,000 earmarks--wasteful \nearmarks. This year, the majority unfortunately has expanded that back \nto about 6,000, which is disappointing because we entered the year with \na lot of promises from the new majority, a lot of hopes about things \nthat would change. Our Democratic colleagues ran on cleaning up the \nculture of corruption and getting rid of a lot of wasteful earmarks.\n  I, for one, wanted to help. In fact, one of the first things I did \nthis year was introduce Nancy Pelosi's, Speaker Pelosi's, earmark \ntransparency bill in the Senate. Unfortunately, the new majority \ndecided it wasn't right the way they did it and filled it full of \nloopholes, and we have been fighting all year to try to continue to \ndisclose a lot of this wasteful spending.\n  Now, as I said, as we end the year, instead of the 2,000 earmarks we \nwere at last year, we are going to 6,000 plus. We are also way over \nbudget. The amount we have over budget this year will translate over \nthe next 10 years to about $300 billion in additional spending. That is \na lot of money for anyone to even conceive of, but just so Americans \nwill know, that amount would allow us to continue the tax relief we \nhave had for the last several years for another 10 years without \nspending any additional money as a government. That tax relief affects \nevery American. Instead, because we haven't acted, because we haven't \nkept our promises, next year millions of Americans, middle-class \nAmericans will experience a new tax that they have never experienced \nbefore, and a lot of them don't know it is coming.\n  The disappointment, I guess, as we end this year is there are so many \nneeds as a nation that we haven't acted on. Instead, we have spent the \nyear with 40 resolutions on Iraq. We have tried to expand Government \nhealth care, holding children hostage to moving to more Government-\ncontrolled health care. The 40 Iraq resolutions were all done holding \nour troops hostage and the funding for our troops and the weapons and \nthe armament they need to succeed. We spent the year on things such as \ntrying to eliminate the secret ballot for workers when folks are trying \nto unionize them. Workers have always had the freedom to vote secretly \nand not be coerced or intimidated, but we have held workers hostage \nthis year.\n  We have all of these new wasteful earmarks. Americans have heard \nabout them, whether it is a hippie museum or monuments to different \nMembers of Congress, billion-dollar parks at the expense of our \nveterans funds. We have balled that all up as we go into the end of the \nyear $300 billion over budget for the next 10 years with wasteful \nearmarks, including monuments to ourselves. I think we have done \nsomething even worse than the wasteful spending because we have tied to \nthis wasteful spending ball at the end of the year the most vulnerable \nand disadvantaged in our society. We have tied the children to it. We \nhave said they need more health care. We have tied our troops to it, \nand we are holding them hostage. Instead of giving them the money they \nneed over the next several months, we are tying them up and holding \nthem hostage.\n  Our veterans, we filled the Veterans bill with wasteful earmarks, and \nwe are holding our veterans hostage. We have basically made human \nshields out of the most vulnerable Americans, and we are challenging \nMembers of the Senate and Members of the House: Vote for this bill that \nis billions over budget, that contains billions of wasteful earmarks. \nYou either vote for this bill or you are voting against children and \nveterans and seniors and voting against our troops. This is no way to \nrun the most important Government in the world.\n  So we end the year with a lot of broken promises. We have not helped \nAmericans buy health insurance; in fact, we have made it harder. We \nhaven't cut spending; we have raised it. We have increased the number \nof earmarks from last year. All we have done is talk. While our troops \nare succeeding in Iraq, we are trying to cut their funding. Instead of \nbroken promises, we need to focus on the promises we need to keep.\n  We have promised Americans since the beginning of our Constitution \nthat we are going to protect them. That is our main purpose. We need to \nkeep our promises to seniors because we have taken their money all \ntheir lives and promised them Social Security and Medicare will be \nthere. We need to keep those promises. We need to keep the promise of \nmaking freedom work for everyone and not to use the problems in our \nsociety as an excuse to replace freedom with more Government, which is \nwhat we are in the process of doing at every turn in Washington.\n  I appreciate the opportunity to speak, and I hope we can end the year \nin a more bipartisan fashion and work on reducing the amount of \nspending, the wasteful earmarks, and try to focus our efforts on the \nreal priorities of this country that affect real Americans and not to \nhold our people hostage to this wasteful spending. We have just another \nmonth or so to finish our business, and I hope we finish it with some \nhonor and dignity in a way that the American people would regain some \ntrust in this Senate and in this Congress.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I come to the floor because it is \namazing to listen to my friends on the other side of the aisle lament \nwhat they view are things not getting done when, in fact, we are \ngetting things done. The truth is, we have been operating this year \nwith an extraordinary slowness on the other side of the aisle because, \nfirst of all, they have participated in 52 filibusters since the \nbeginning of the year--52 filibusters, maybe 53 by the end of the week, \nevery week now. This is unprecedented. It never happened before. It \nnever happened before; to see the minority in the Senate obstruct,\n\n[[Page S14361]]\n\nobstruct, obstruct with 52 different filibusters, trying to stop us \nfrom getting the people's business done.\n  I find it so interesting and amazing when my colleagues lament that \nnot more of the appropriations process is done. As the Presiding \nOfficer knows, our colleagues, the previous majority, didn't do a \nbudget at all last year--at all. We are moving through the process. \nDespite the continual slowdowns, the efforts to stop us from \nproceeding, we are moving ahead. But last year, our colleagues, who \nlament so passionately and who come to the floor every day, didn't even \npass a budget. We came in in January to a new majority and had to clean \nup the mess, literally. There was no budget. We had to pass a budget \njust to get us through the end of the year, to be able to keep services \nfor the American people going, and we did that. We did that.\n  Also, during that process we put in place a few things along the way \nthat we clearly put at the top of the list in terms of appropriations: \nAdditional money for our veterans, clearly a priority for us; a Pell \ngrant for our low-income students trying to go to college to have the \nAmerican dream. We are now at a point where we have the budget, the \nappropriations process that we are working on for next year. We have \nseen nothing but efforts to slow that down, to veto it.\n  Yesterday the President vetoed the part of the budget that focuses on \nhealth care, education for our people, health research into new cures \nfor cancer. It focuses on diabetes and Alzheimer's and Parkinson's \ndisease, all of the areas where we hope to make breakthroughs to be \nable to save lives. The President vetoed that.\n  The President says the slight increase for restoring cuts that the \nPresident and the Republicans have made in the last several years, in \nour efforts to restore those funds to get the priorities right and put \nus back on track for middle-class families, was too much. Eleven \nbillion dollars invested in America is too much. Twelve billion dollars \na month on a war--putting our men and women in the middle of harm's way \nin a civil war every day--is OK, and it is not paid for. The most \nimportant thing is we are losing lives, but it is outrageous that we \nare seeing $12 billion a month being spent.\n  The President vetoed an investment in America yesterday that was less \nthan 1 month in Iraq--an investment in our families, in our seniors, in \nour children, and in the future in terms of education and opportunity \nand research. He vetoed a bill that was, in fact, an effort to invest \nin America.\n  I have to say, despite 52 filibusters, we are, as Democrats, working \nwith colleagues, obviously. We don't get anything done unless it is on \na bipartisan basis. We know that, and we do it every day. But the truth \nis, our majority is getting results for middle-class Americans every \nday. I am proud we have placed veterans at the top of our budget. We, \nfor the first time, have listened. We, the new majority, have listened \nto the veterans of this country, the veterans organizations. We took \ntheir budget called the Independent Budget--the veterans budget--and \nmade it our own so we would make sure our veterans were fully funded. \nWe have addressed the concerns about Walter Reed and what happens when \nour veterans come home and get caught between the military health \nsystem and the VA system.\n  Mr. President, I believe you are about to give me a high sign on the \ntime. I ask unanimous consent for an additional 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered. The Senator is recognized for an \nadditional 10 minutes.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I am very proud of the fact that one of \nthe first things we did this year in addition to supporting our \nveterans was to pass the first minimum wage increase in 10 years for \nworking Americans. An awful lot of those are moms with two children, \nthree children, working one job, two jobs, three jobs, trying to hold \nthings together for their family, working hard every day. I am proud we \nhave passed that. I am proud we have also focused on middle-class \nAmericans and the American dream of college and the opportunity to be \nable to get the skills that young people and people going back to \nschool can receive in order to be able to work hard and be successful \nin our new global economy. We have passed the largest student financial \naid program since the GI bill. I am very proud we have done that. We \nare getting results for middle-class Americans every day.\n  On a bipartisan basis, we have also passed the America COMPETES Act, \nwhich redirects critical resources into math and science and technology \nfor education as well as for research. I am very proud of the fact that \ndespite the need to pass the 9/11 Commission recommendations, we have \ndone that. Again, one of the early efforts by the new Democratic \nmajority was to pass the 9/11 Commission recommendations to focus on \ncritical needs, such as making radios work, so the police officers and \nfirefighters in America can actually talk to each other and not be put \nin the same situation as they were on 9/11 where they were running into \nbuildings they should have been running out of because they did not \nhave the communications equipment that worked. We have focused on real \nsecurity. We have focused, through the appropriations that we have \npassed, on our troops and their families, and I am very proud of that. \nWe have also focused on important and long overdue and neglected water \nresources projects.\n  And it is wonderful to see that not only was it passed on a \nbipartisan basis, but when the President vetoed the bill, we joined \ntogether to say yes to protecting our waters, when the President said \nno. So we are getting things done. We are getting things done every \nsingle day.\n  We are putting the priorities of the American people first. In our \nbudget, we have said veterans are at the top of the list, education \nfunding opportunity is at the top of the list, and we also place \nchildren's health insurance at the top of the list. In this area, we \nhave worked together in a wonderful bipartisan way. People are to be \ncongratulated on both sides of the aisle for working together on \nchildren's health insurance.\n  The President again said no. He has vetoed the bill. We are working \nhard, and we have the votes in the Senate to override the veto. We are \nworking hard to get House Republican colleagues to join us so we can \ninvest and cover 10 million children with health insurance.\n  This is another example of where we have been pushing forward, \nchanging the direction of this Congress, focusing on middle-class \nAmericans, getting things done--trying to get things done over the \nobjection of the President. Again, I have to go back to the whole \nquestion of the funding of the war: $12 billion a month on this war--\nnot paid for. To cover 10 million children in America with health \ninsurance, it is $7 billion a year, and it is in our budget. We have \nfully paid for that.\n  What kind of priorities has the President set, when he will veto \nchildren's health insurance and yet continue to ask for more and more \ndollars for this war? Everything we do around here is values and \npriorities, based on what we think is important, what we think the \npeople who have sent us here think is important. The majority of \nAmericans are saying this country is going in the wrong direction, that \nwhile people find themselves worried about whether they will have a job \nor whether it is going to go overseas or whether they will lose pay, \nlose income, while their health insurance premium goes up--if they even \nhave health insurance--their gas prices go up, and college tuition is \ngoing up. They may find themselves in the situation where they cannot \nsell their homes due to the mortgage crisis or in a situation of \nforeclosure or in a sales situation where they are losing dollars.\n  Middle-class Americans look around them and see a world, under this \nadministration, for the last 6 years, of failed policies and \npriorities--a world that doesn't work for Americans, losing \nopportunities rather than gaining them, working harder and harder but \nseeing the American dream slip away for themselves and their families.\n  We, as the new majority of the Senate, understand this, we get it. We \nare laser focused on what makes a difference to the American people \nevery day. We are focused, and we will be coming forward with efforts \nto help with the mortgage crisis. I have legislation we will be \nbringing forward to make sure that when you lose your home to \nforeclosure or a short sale, you don't get a tax bill on top of that,\n\n[[Page S14362]]\n\nwhich will happen now if your financial institution gives you any kind \nof a break on refinancing. You end up, with the value of the \ndifference, paying taxes on it. We are going to make sure that doesn't \nhappen. We are laser focused on getting the children's health insurance \nbill done, focusing on the right kind of trade policy that is fair for \nAmericans--American workers and businesses. We are focused on \nstrengthening our country, opportunity, valuing work, focusing on the \nthings people care about every single day. When we get up in the \nmorning and we are focused on what we want for our children and \ngrandchildren, in order to be able to have a wonderful life, those are \nthe things we have been bringing forward every single day. We will \ncontinue to do that.\n  We are getting things done for middle-class America. That is our \nfocus. We are getting things done. But I have to say, in conclusion, \nthat this has not been easy. We have had 52 filibusters--which is \nunheard of in the Senate--in less than a year--52 filibusters that \nrequire us to get 60 votes to stop, including, I might add, on the war. \nWe have a majority of Members of this body who want to end this \nstrategy on the war, who have been willing to say we want to put a \ndeadline on what is happening there and refocus on what will truly keep \nus safe. We have a majority of Members--an overwhelming majority--who \nsupported Senator Webb's effort on troop readiness, to say to our \ntroops who are being deployed, redeployed, and redeployed, we should \nfollow the traditional policies of the military; if you have 12 or 15 \nmonths in combat in theater, you should get the same at home for rest, \nretraining, and the opportunity to see your family.\n  We have the majority of Members who have voted to change this policy \nin Iraq, get us out of a civil war, bring our troops home, to have \ntroop readiness policies that make sense; but we have had 52 \nfilibusters, which is too many, stopping us from changing this war.\n  This can go to 53, 54--we know it will keep going through the next \nyear. But so will our focus. We are not going to stop. We are focused \non getting things done. We are getting results for middle-class \nAmericans, and we are going to continue to do that every single day.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I wish to take a few minutes this morning \nto talk about a subject that has tragically received far too little \nattention, and that is the number of veterans who take their lives \nbecause our Nation has failed them.\n  In a breakthrough report last night, CBS News revealed that far more \nveterans commit suicide than has previously been reported by the \nDefense Department and the VA. CBS, in fact, found that in 2005, at \nleast 6,256 veterans took their lives. That is a rate that is twice \nthat of other Americans.\n  CBS also found that veterans who are aged 20 to 24--those most likely \nto have served in the war on terror--are taking their lives at a rate \nthat is estimated to be between two and four times higher than \nnonveterans in the same age group.\n  CBS should be commended for pushing past this administration's \nstonewalling and digging to get those numbers. The administration told \nthe network that even the VA hadn't counted the nationwide numbers.\n  Those findings are sad, they are horrifying, and they should be \npreventable. Frankly, they are a reflection of something that many of \nmy colleagues and I have said over and over. They reflect an \nadministration that has failed to plan, failed to own up to its \nresponsibilities, and failed even to complete statistics on the impact \nof this war on our veterans. From inadequate funding to a lack of \nmental health professionals to a failure to help our servicemembers \nmake the transition from battlefield back to the homefront, this \nadministration has dropped the ball.\n  The Defense Department and the VA, in particular, must own up to the \ntrue cost of this war and do a better job to ensure that our heroes are \nnot lost when they come home.\n  We in Congress are taking steps to try to understand and care for the \nmental health wounds our troops are experiencing, but we clearly have \nto do more. If those numbers CBS is reporting do not wake up America, I \nfear nothing will. It is time for all of us to wake up to the reality \nand the consequences of this war. It is time to wake up our neighbors \nand our communities. It is time to wake up our employers and our \nschools and ask if we are doing enough for our veterans. It is time to \nwake up the White House and demand better care for our veterans, those \nmen and women who have sacrificed for all of us.\n  As I stand here and speak today, a generation of servicemembers is \nfalling through the cracks because of our failure to provide for them, \nand that is shameful.\n  Five years ago, when the President asked us to go to war in Iraq, he \ntalked to us about weapons of mass destruction, he talked about al-\nQaida, he talked about the mission to fight the war on terror, but he \nnever talked about policing a civil war. He never talked about the \nstress of living months without a break and constantly waiting for the \nnext attack. He has never talked about, in my opinion, taking care of \nthose men and women who have served us honorably when they finally come \nhome.\n  In the past, our servicemembers were always given a rest, time to \nrelax, time to regroup for battle. But we are today waging this war \nwith an all-volunteer military. Some men and women are now serving \ntheir second, third, fourth, and now even fifth tour of duty. They are \nstretched to the breaking point. Too many of them are sustaining \ntraumatic brain injuries. Too many are suffering from post-traumatic \nstress disorder. A third of our servicemembers are coming home with \nmental health conditions, and when they finally do come home, they \nstruggle with the memories of battle. In their nightmares, they see \ntheir friends being blown apart. Some of them are turning to drugs and \nalcohol to numb themselves from the pain they are in.\n  The sad truth is that all too often the system we have set up to \nprovide care for them does not help them, and we do not find out how \nmuch pain they are in until, obviously, it is too late.\n  I have taken the time to talk with these servicemembers. I have taken \nthe time to talk with their families. I have heard their stories, and I \nwish to share a few with my colleagues today that illustrate, I \nbelieve, why it is so critical that we take action. These are young men \nand women. They are in their early twenties. They are young men and \nwomen who have served our country. They are someone's son, brother, \nsister, wife, best friend. Losing them is shameful.\n  Let me tell my colleagues about a young veteran named Justin Bailey. \nJustin joined the Marine Corps when he was 18, a few months after he \ngraduated from high school. He was about to separate from the Marines \nin 2003 when his service was involuntarily extended because of the war \nin Iraq.\n  Justin went to Iraq. He was injured, and he returned home in pain and \nsuffering from PTSD. He underwent several surgeries, and over a 2-year \ntime period was prescribed a slew of medications, including hydrocone, \nxanax, and methadone, and he became addicted.\n  Justin slipped through the cracks. Despite seeking help for his \naddiction, he was allowed to self-medicate. Despite warnings from the \nFDA, he was prescribed drugs that were inconsistent with the treatment \nof PTSD. Justin tried to find help, but after 6 weeks in a VA program \nfor addicts with PTSD, he never once saw a psychiatrist.\n  Justin's parents had assumed that he would get proper supervision in \nthe VA program, but he didn't. This past January, Justin took too many \npills and he died of an overdose.\n  The next young man I wish to tell my colleagues about is Joshua \nOmvig. Josh, I am told, was an eager soldier who dreamed of being a \npolice officer. He insisted on graduating from high school early so he \ncould join the military and begin his career. He was sent\n\n[[Page S14363]]\n\nto Iraq. But after one visit home his parents could see he was shaken. \nOrdinary things, they said, made him nervous, and he was having \nnightmares that made him shout out in his sleep.\n  When he completed his tour of duty, he was transitioned back into \ncivilian life after only a couple of weeks. His parents saw he was not \nthe same. They said he didn't say much about Iraq, but he did talk \nabout hearing voices and seeing faces and he was very jittery.\n\n  His parents wanted him to get care, but he refused to see a doctor \nfor fear it would hurt his career. Despite his parents' efforts to help \nhim, Josh could not get over the trauma he experienced in Iraq. It got \nworse and his world slowly unraveled. Josh took his life at the age of \n22.\n  Josh's and Justin's stories came to light because their families came \nhere and asked Congress for help. As a result, we passed the Joshua \nOmvig Veteran Suicide Prevention Act this year because his family \npushed and pushed for legislation that would require the military and \nthe VA to better understand and treat psychological trauma for our \nservicemembers.\n  Are these extreme examples? Well, maybe, but they are not isolated \nexamples, and the reality is many others are slipping unnoticed through \nthe cracks today.\n  It would be one thing if we had no idea what the mental health \nstrains are for our veterans, but that is not the case. We have seen \nservicemembers come home with mental wounds in every military conflict \nin which we have ever been involved.\n  When I was a young college student in the late sixties, I volunteered \nat the Seattle VA. I was assigned to the psychiatric ward. I worked \nwith Vietnam veterans who were my age at the time coming home from \nVietnam. I saw what was in their eyes. For some, it was a blank stare. \nFor many, it was anger. For a lot, it was talking and talking and \ntalking about what they had been through.\n  There was no word called post-traumatic stress syndrome when I worked \nat the VA with those Vietnam veterans. But we know now the strains of \nwar and what it causes, and we should be doing so much more for the \nthousands and thousands of young men and women who are coming home \ntoday and feeling lost and alone in their homes and communities because \nno one has reached out to help them.\n  Our understanding of the impact that warfare has on the minds of \nservicemembers has evolved since I worked at the VA as a young student \nmany years ago. One thing we know is that the mental wound suffered by \nmen and women in uniform can be as devastating as their physical \ninjuries. So it is long past time that the military knock down the \nstigma associated with mental health care. It is long past time that \nthe military provide the care our veterans desperately need and deserve \nand back it up with adequate funding. We must acknowledge that this is \na cost of war we cannot ignore.\n  What can we do to prevent more stories such as Josh and Justin? We \nhave to better understand the trauma our troops have experienced. The \nJoshua Omvig Act we passed takes steps to do that, but it is so clear \nwe have more to do. We need more mental health care clinics, and we \nneed more providers. We need the VA to be proactive. We need them to \nreach out to these veterans who are not enrolled in the VA system and \nwho are at risk for suicide. And we in Congress have to provide the \nmoney to fully fund their care.\n  The Senate has passed a bill that will increase funding for veterans \nby almost $4 billion over what the President asked. I hope we can get \nthose improvements to our veterans as quickly as possible. We have to \nfinally provide a seamless transition for our servicemembers when they \ncome home, and that starts with making sure that veterans can get their \ndisability benefits without having to fight through the system. It is \nunconscionable to me that our heroes return home from the battlefield \ntoday only to have to fight a bureaucracy to get the benefits they were \npromised.\n  Veterans Day was a few days ago. Many of us went home and took part \nin ceremonies to thank our servicemembers for securing our safety and \nour freedom--well-deserved. In my own speech in Kitsap County, at home \nin Washington State, I said I believe that Veterans Day should not be \njust a day for ceremony. It should be a day to consider whether there \nis something more we can do for our veterans. And what are the \nimplications for not doing enough? As the ``CBS News'' report found, \ntoo often the implications are that many veterans are stretched to the \nbreaking point. That is a tragedy. We have to wake up to the reality \nthat we have already lost too many.\n\n  Ours is a great Nation. No matter how any of us feel about this \ncurrent conflict, we know our troops are serving us honorably. But we \nowe them so much more than we have given them so far. We can do better. \nWe must do better. I ask anyone who is listening to me this morning, \nanyone who watched the CBS report and saw those families talk about the \ntragedy of losing a son or a daughter to suicide after they had come \nhome from this war, to reach out and say: Am I doing enough? Do I know \nof a family who is suffering? Do I know of someone at my child's school \nwhose parent has come home? Do I know an employee who has come home \nfrom Iraq? Have I reached out myself and said: I am here for you if you \nneed me?\n  All of us can do more. Congress needs to act and do more as well. We \nare a great nation. We should do much better.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/14/senate-section/article/S14363-1", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14363]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of H.R. 2419, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 2419) to provide for the continuation of \n     agricultural programs through fiscal year 2012, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Harkin amendment No. 3500, in the nature of a substitute.\n       Reid (for Dorgan-Grassley) amendment No. 3508 (to amendment \n     No. 3500), to strengthen payment limitations and direct the \n     savings to increased funding for certain programs.\n       Reid amendment No. 3509 (to amendment No. 3508), to change \n     the enactment date.\n       Reid amendment No. 3510 (to the language proposed to be \n     stricken by amendment No. 3500), to change the enactment \n     date.\n       Reid amendment No. 3511 (to Amendment No. 3510), to change \n     the enactment date.\n       Motion to commit the bill to the Committee on Agriculture, \n     Nutrition, and Forestry, with instructions to report back \n     forthwith, with Reid amendment No. 3512.\n       Reid amendment No. 3512 (to the instructions of the motion \n     to commit to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \n     Forestry, with instructions), to change the enactment date.\n       Reid amendment No. 3513 (to the instructions of the motion \n     to recommit), to change the enactment date.\n       Reid amendment No. 3514 (to amendment No. 3513), to change \n     the enactment date.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I see my friend, Senator Chambliss, is on \nthe floor. I think we are both very frustrated. I don't think, I know \nwe are both very frustrated that we are stymied on this farm bill. We \nare not moving anywhere. But in hopes that maybe we can get something \nmoving, I am going to propound some unanimous consent requests to see \nif we can't break out and move ahead.\n  So I inquire of my colleague, Senator Chambliss, as to whether we can \nagree to a time limitation for debate with respect to the pending \nDorgan-Grassley amendment. Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that \nthere be 60 minutes of debate prior to a vote in relation to the Dorgan \namendment No. 3508, with the time equally divided and controlled in the \nusual form; that upon the use or yielding back of time, the Senate vote \nin relation to the amendment; that no second-degree amendment be in \norder prior to the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Senator from Georgia.\n\n[[Page S14364]]\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, unfortunately, based upon the status of \nthe amendments at this point in time and based upon the comments by the \nmajority leader this morning, at this point in time I am going to have \nto object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I now ask unanimous consent that we \nproceed to the Lugar-Lautenberg amendment regarding farm program \nreform; that there be 2 hours of debate with respect to the amendment \nprior to a vote; that no amendments be in order to the amendment prior \nto the vote; that the time be equally divided and controlled in the \nusual form; that upon the use or yielding back of the time, the Senate \nproceed to vote in relation to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, again, as much as I would love to \naccommodate the chairman of the committee, based upon the status at \nthis time and the comments of the majority leader this morning, I will \nhave to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, in light of that objection, I would \ninquire as to whether we can enter into an agreement on the Roberts \namendment No. 3548; that there be 90 minutes for debate prior to a vote \nin relation to the amendment, with the time equally divided and \ncontrolled in the usual form; that upon the use or yielding back of \ntime, the Senate vote in relation to the amendment, with no second-\ndegree amendment in order prior to the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, again, based upon the process that we \nare now involved in and the comments of the majority leader this \nmorning relative to the farm bill, I will have to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, let's see if there can be agreement to \nconsider the Stevens amendment No. 3569; again that there be 60 minutes \nof debate prior to a vote in relation to the amendment, with no \namendment in order to the amendment prior to the vote, and the time be \nequally divided and controlled in the usual form; that upon the use or \nyielding back of time, the Senate proceed to vote in relation to the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, once again, based upon the process we \nare now engaged in and the comments of the majority leader this \nmorning, I will have to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we proceed to \nthe Allard amendment No. 3572; that there be 60 minutes of debate prior \nto a vote in relation to the amendment, with the time equally divided \nand controlled in the usual form, with no second-degree amendment in \norder prior to the vote; that upon the use or yielding back of the \ntime, the Senate proceed to vote in relation to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Reserving the right to object, I would say there may \nbe some common ground.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the unanimous consent request of the \nchairman be modified and that the pending amendments and motion to \nrecommit be withdrawn and the only amendments in order be the \nbipartisan list of first-degree amendments I have sent to the desk and \nthat all first-degree amendments be subject to relevant second-degree \namendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator so modify his request?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I do not modify my request.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Then, Mr. President, I will have to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am certain the Senator will have another \nunanimous consent request of his own very shortly, as he just \nenunciated. I just proposed five requests for votes in relation to \namendments that are relevant to the farm bill. As we just heard, there \nare objections to each one of those.\n  We are ready to move ahead. We have been here now a week, over a \nweek, on this farm bill, and we are stuck, dead in the water. Again, my \nfriend, Senator Chambliss, said he wanted to send to the desk a list of \namendments that have been looked at. Not all of them have been filed, \nas I understand, but they have been talked about. As I understand it, \nthere are 255 amendments. That is ridiculous. Of course, we are not \ngoing to have 255 amendments. But at least we could work. We are here; \nwe could be working now. We could debate the Dorgan amendment and vote \non it today. There are five requests I just offered right now, five \namendments we could dispose of this afternoon. The other side objected \nto each one of those.\n  Again, I am extremely frustrated, as the chairman of the committee. \nWe got a bill through. We worked very hard on it. Senator Chambliss \nworked very hard on it. Yet we are stuck. We got it through committee. \nThere was not one dissenting vote in the committee, not one. It is a \ngood bill.\n  As Senator Lincoln said--I heard her speech this morning--it is \nbipartisan, it is multiregional. There are a lot of compromises in it, \nas is true in any bill. But we got it through without a dissenting \nvote. Yet we cannot even work on it on the Senate floor? We cannot even \nwork on it. Forget about passing it, we can't even work on it.\n  I just propounded five requests to have debate and votes on \namendments, relevant amendments to this farm bill, and every time it \nwas objected to.\n  I don't know. I just want to make it clear that we on this side are \nready to do business. We have been for a week. We could have been \ndebating relevant amendments. We could have almost--we could have been \ndone with this bill by now.\n  I want to point out a little bit of history. On the last farm bill, \nwhen I was privileged to chair the committee at that time in the \nSenate, in 2002, we had 10 days of consideration in December and 6 days \nin February. That was it. Mr. President, 53 amendments were considered, \nnot 255.\n  In 1996, we had 4 days of consideration, 24 amendments to the bill; \nin 1990, 7 days of consideration, and we proceeded to vote on it. This \nis very frustrating. We are here. We are ready to do business. We are \nready to debate and vote. Yet the leadership on the other side says no. \nThe leadership says no.\n  I wanted to make it clear, fundamentally, basically clear to all \nSenators and anyone watching: We on this side have been ready, are \nready, are willing to debate and vote on these amendments. It has been \nobjected to on the other side.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this is almost unbelievably disappointing. \nThis is the second week we are on the farm bill. We have people in the \nSenate who believe, apparently, they are trying to imitate a set of \nhuman brake pads and stop everything. We haven't even started. How can \nyou stop it? I don't understand this at all. If family farmers farmed \nlike Congress legislated, there would be no food.\n  When it comes spring you have to plant the seeds. You have to do it. \nIt is not an option. When it comes harvest time, you have to take it \noff the field. When the cows are ready to milk, you have to milk. We \nhave a few people in Congress who believe you don't have to do \nanything. All you have to do, as I said, is imitate a set of human \nbrake pads and just stop everything. I guess maybe that is a successful \nstrategy for some, if you do not believe anything ought to get done.\n  The chairman of this committee, Senator Harkin, and the ranking \nmember, Senator Chambliss, worked hard on this. I understand Senator \nChambliss has been objecting as a result of the minority leader's \nposition. I understand that. But my colleague from Iowa just propounded \na series of unanimous consent requests. He said let's just start. This \nisn't rocket science. How do you get this bill done? First, you start \nthe bill.\n  As I understand it, my colleague proposed a couple of amendments from \neach side, Democratic amendments, Republican amendments. Just start,\n\n[[Page S14365]]\n\nhave some time agreements, have a debate, have a vote.\n  If there are some who do not want a farm bill to be passed in this \nCongress, I understand. They have a right to vote against and speak \nagainst the farm bill. But why on Earth should they hold this bill \nhostage to their whims? We take for granted, every single day in this \ncountry, what family farmers do. They get up out there in the country, \nliving under a yard light, get up, often very early, and do chores. \nThey work hard. They take a lot of risks. They have big dreams. They \nlive on hope. They must live on hope. They hope there is going to be a \nbetter crop, a better year. They hope they are going to be able to make \na decent living. We take all of that for granted.\n  What we try to do in the Congress is to write a farm bill that says \nfamily farmers are important--yes, for economic reasons but also for \ncultural reasons, to have a network of families out there producing \nAmerica's food. Family farmers are important, and we understand \nfamilies can't survive some tough times, so we create a safety net, a \nbridge over price depressions. And we say: We want to help you. That is \nwhat the farm bill is about.\n  There are other pieces of it, nutrition and other issues, but the \ncenterpiece of a safety net for family farmers is very important. I \nguess I don't remember a time when we had a farm bill on the Senate \nfloor that has been held up. I voted against some farm bills I didn't \nlike. But, you know, I didn't like the so-called Freedom to Farm bill, \nwhich I thought was a disaster, so I voted against it, but I didn't \ncome down to the floor to try to prevent it from moving. I just said \nthis is something I will not support, so I voted against it.\n  In this case, and in the previous case with the farm bill we operate \nunder currently, I support it. I really want this to move forward. I do \nnot understand. I do not understand at all. We could compare, perhaps, \nthe Senate to a glacier, but the difference is a glacier actually moves \nfrom time to time. This Senate, on this bill, is going nowhere because \nof a couple of people who decided we are going to stop it.\n\n  The majority leader has brought this bill to the floor of the Senate, \nallowed 2 weeks for it. Both colleagues, Senator Harkin and Senator \nChambliss, have worked hard. My colleague, Senator Conrad, has been out \nhere working hard to see if can we get a list of amendments we can \nbegin working through. Apparently, we now know there are something like \n250 amendments that have been noticed. Obviously, we are not going to \nhave 250 amendments on this bill. We don't have time for that. Some of \nthese amendments, a good many of them, have nothing at all to do with \nthis subject at all--going back into immigration and a whole series of \ntax issues that have nothing to do with farming, agriculture, family \nfarms.\n  So the question is, Can we find a way to reduce that number of \namendments and then just start?\n  The first amendment Senator Grassley and I have offered is an \namendment that would, I think, improve the bill. But we have not been \nable to even begin the first 5 minutes of debate on that amendment. \nThere are many others.\n  My colleague offers a proposal: Let's at least start on two \nRepublican and two Democratic amendments. The first step of any journey \nis the most important step. Let's just begin. Here it is, a week and a \nhalf after the bill comes to the floor of the Senate, and this Senate \nis at parade rest. I do not understand it.\n  One of my great concerns at the moment is that the time has been set \naside to try to get this farm bill done. Senator Harkin and Senator \nChambliss wrote a farm bill that came out of the Agriculture Committee, \nas I understand, unanimously. You would believe, then, that represents \nbipartisan agreement on the central portion of a farm bill. Can we \nimprove it a little bit? I think so. There are some amendments back and \nforth that perhaps will improve some portions of it. But the fact is, \nthey wrote a bipartisan bill that had very strong support, in fact, \nunanimous support in the committee.\n  How on Earth do we get to a point where a bill that comes out of the \ncommittee unanimously, a bill that is as important as this one is to \nevery region of the country, sits on the floor of the Senate at parade \nrest, and we cannot even get to debate on the first amendment? I do not \nunderstand that at all. That makes no sense to me.\n  The fact is, time is running out. I worry if we do not get this bill \ndone this week--work late tonight, late tomorrow night, into Friday, \nget this bill done--I worry that this bill is not going to get done in \nany timely fashion. What an awful message for us to send to family \nfarmers. The message in this bill is, we think they matter. We think \nthey are an important part of this country's economic strength. Family \nfarmers have always been the economic All-Stars.\n  But it is beyond me to understand what is going on here. We have \namendments. My amendment is pending, but we can't even begin the first \nminute of debate. I don't understand it at all.\n  I have said before on the floor of the Senate that family farmers in \nthis country produce a lot more than crops and food. They produce \ncommunities. They are the blood vessels that create the strength for \nthese small towns. I grew up in one of those towns. We raised some \ncattle and some horses. The fact is, family farmers are very important \nto the economic strength and to the culture of this country. They do \nnot expect much. They don't ask for much. They are an independent bunch \nof people. They are people who try to raise a family and raise a crop, \nway out in the country, in many cases. They are not asking for anything \nvery much except that this country has believed for a long while that \nall of the uncertainties, all of the risks that accrue to family \nfarming in many cases just wipe them out unless you have some kind of \nsafety net. That is why we have created a safety net.\n  They plant a seed, hope it grows, hope it rains enough, hope it \ndoesn't rain too much, hope it doesn't hail, hope the insects don't \ncome, hope there isn't any crop disease. Then they hope they have a \nchance to harvest it in the fall and then hope when they harvest it and \ntruck it to the elevator, it is going to have a decent price. All of \nthat risk, all alone.\n  So we create a safety net to say we are going to try, if we can, to \nprovide some strength to that hope because we want family farms to \ncontinue to exist in the future because we think it strengthens our \ncountry. That is why we write a farm bill. All of us come from \ndifferent points on the compass, but we all believe basically the same \nthing: family farming matters for this country.\n  How on Earth have we gotten to the point where, on a Wednesday, a \nweek after we start the debate on the farm bill, we have not been able \nto consider even one amendment?\n  Now we risk not getting the farm bill done. How we have gotten to \nthis point, I don't have the foggiest understanding, but it is not \nhealthy and not good.\n  I hope we can persuade the minority leader and others to let us \nproceed. Just start. We are not asking for the Moon. Just start \ndiscussion, debate, and vote on amendments, and let's see how quickly \nwe can move through these to try to get a bill done before the end of \nthis week.\n  Let me finish, as I started, by saying I know a lot of people have \nworked for a long time on this bill. There are a lot of people on both \nsides of the political aisle who want this bill to get done. I am among \nthem. But there are some who have decided we ought not move forward, \nand they have decided the only way they would allow us to move forward \nis to allow all kinds of amendments that go back and recreate the \ndebates on immigration, and you name it. The fact is, all that means is \nwe will not get this bill done, never get this bill done. So let's go \nback to the tradition.\n  The tradition has been, with respect to farm bills, we have had farm \nbills on the floor of the Senate in which we debate and vote on \namendments. We do not, in most cases, see amendments that have nothing \nto do with agriculture load down this bill and decide we are going to \ntry to stop it from moving. I hope we can get back to that tradition. \nThat is the tradition I think farmers would expect of us.\n  Let me again say, as I started, if families out there in the country \nfarmed like we legislate--or at least like a few\n\n[[Page S14366]]\n\npeople in this Chamber want to legislate--there would be no food \nbecause they would never plant the grain. It wouldn't matter, timing \ndoesn't matter, they wouldn't harvest the grain, timing doesn't matter; \nthey wouldn't milk the cows because they wouldn't care whether the cows \nare fresh or sore.\n  This Congress can do a whole lot better than this, and my hope is, in \nthe coming couple of hours, we can reach agreement and begin debate on \nthe amendments. Let's follow this trail until the amendments are done, \nand I think that farm bill will get a resounding vote on the floor of \nthe Senate. I think the farm bill will get two-thirds or perhaps three-\nfourths in favor of it.\n  I yield the floor. I know we have two other Members on the Senate \nfloor. The Senator from Colorado had indicated he wanted to speak, but \nI know the Senator from Georgia is on the Senate floor as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from North Dakota \nfor his comments. He is exactly right. There are a lot of us in this \nbody who wish to see this farm bill move. I actually came back a day \nearly last week thinking the farm bill would be up the next day.\n  I was prepared, as ranking member, to move ahead with the farm bill. \nWhen I got here, I found out we all of a sudden were going to be caught \nin a process that is unique to the Senate, and that is a process where \nthe majority leader has the right--and I understand he has the right; I \nunderstand that we did that when we were in the majority--to fill the \ntree, and he did so. And when he does so, it kind of brings things to a \nhalt. That is the purpose in doing that, in trying to control what \namendments may be filed. I thought after a week's time, yesterday, \nrather than us debating amendments, moving through, which in all \nlikelihood we conceivably could have been through this bill by now--but \ninstead of being able to call up amendments, debating them and voting \non them over the past week, we have been stuck in this process now that \nrequires a unanimous consent by both sides before we can move forward \nwith the process of dealing with amendments.\n  Yesterday I had some hope, because Senator Harkin and I agreed that \nwhat we thought we ought to do would be to come up with a list of \namendments that are relevant, and as always is the case on any major \npiece of legislation, some were irrelevant amendments. I would hope we \ncould agree on a number. Unfortunately, we have not been able to do \nthat. As of yesterday we had about 140 Democratic amendments that were \nfiled, and about 120 Republican amendments that were filed.\n  Most of them are relevant to the farm bill, but some of them are not. \nBut it is always the case that we deal with some nonrelevant \namendments.\n  But instead of allowing Senator Harkin and me to move through the \nprocess of taking the amendments--the first one we had agreed to take \nwas Senator Dorgan and Senator Grassley's amendment. Instead of \nallowing us to move ahead and debate that amendment, and possibly have \nalready voted on it, if we had taken it up this morning with the time \nagreement we had tentatively agreed to, a decision was made that we are \nnot going to be allowed to do that, and nothing is going to happen \nuntil there is a definite agreement by both sides on not just the \nnumber of amendments but what nonrelevant amendments will be \nconsidered.\n  It will happen. I know this is not the first time this situation has \nhappened in this body with a farm bill. I would remind those who were \nhere in 2002, at that time there were 246 amendments filed; almost \nexactly the same number of amendments were filed to the farm bill while \nthe Democrats were in charge in 2002. There were at least two, and \nthere may have been three, cloture votes. I am not sure because I was \nnot here then. But there were two or three cloture votes asked for and \nmade on the farm bill before cloture was invoked. Those cloture votes \noriginally were made in December of 2001. When cloture was finally \ninvoked in February of 2002, the farm bill sailed through in a matter \nof a few days. So we are basically in exactly the same position we were \nin 2002.\n  But here is the problem. 2002 was an entirely different atmosphere in \nAmerican agriculture. Farmers and ranchers need to be discussing next \nmonth with their bankers and their insurers and landowners from whom \nthey lease property, or farmers whom they lease property to; they need \nto be talking to their equipment dealers about how much they are going \nto plant of what respective crops; how much insurance they are going to \nneed; how much in the way of financing they are going to need; how much \nin the way of new equipment or repairs or replaced equipment they are \ngoing to need, so that come next March, in the whole Southeast, not \njust in my State, but in March we start planting crops. Early corn goes \nin in March or the first part of April. In 2002, I was a Member of the \nHouse, and I was a member of the conference committee on the farm bill \nthat was delayed until final passage occurring sometime in March. \nObviously when farmers do not know what to anticipate from the \nstandpoint of farm policy, do not know what type of programs they are \ngoing to have available to them, it is difficult for them to make any \ndecision regarding how much money they are going to have to finance \ntheir crops, how much insurance they are going to need, or how many \nacres of what crops to plant.\n  So here we are stuck in a process. I am not saying one side or the \nother is more to blame than the other. I think it is more the rules of \nthe Senate that have got us locked into this situation. I am ready to \ngo. I was ready to go last Tuesday morning or actually last Monday \nafternoon. But, unfortunately, we are in a situation now where we \ncannot move ahead.\n  I did have to object to Senator Harkin's request. There is nothing I \nwould rather do than move on the Grassley-Dorgan amendment, although I \nam strongly opposed to it. I am going to advocate a ``no'' vote on it. \nBut I think we ought to move and get this process going and start \nwinnowing down these 260 or so, whatever the number of amendments is we \nhave filed, or that we have been notified that either are filed or are \ngoing to be filed.\n\n  We can do that. It was done in 2002. We can do it now, and we are \nultimately going to have to do it. Whether we do it now or whether we \ndo it in January, whether we do it in February, we are going to do it. \nIt is a bullet we are going to have to bite.\n  I regret very much having to object to Senator Harkin's request. But, \nby the same token, he had to not agree to amend his unanimous consent \nrequest to comply with what I asked for, which would allow us to move \nahead right now with amendments.\n  Those folks who are out in ag country are depending on the Congress, \nthe Presiding Officer being one of those members who sits on the Ag \nCommittee who has a significant interest in agriculture. My friend \nSenator Salazar, a member of the committee, comes from a strong \nagricultural State. Folks are depending on all of us as policymakers to \nget our work done, and yet here we are stuck by the rules of the \nSenate.\n  As I said in the press yesterday, I would simply say again, if we do \nnot get this bill done this week, we do not have the opportunity to \nwork with our colleagues in the House over the next 2 weeks while we \nare gone to get ready for a conference in December, it is going to be \nextremely difficult, if not impossible, to get a farm bill passed by \nboth bodies, on the desk of the President before the end of the year.\n  That does not handicap us, but it surely handicaps those folks we \nrepresent; that is, the great men and women who are the farmers and \nranchers of America. So I am hopeful that over the next several hours--\nI do not how long it may take, but I hope in the short term we are able \nto reach some agreement. Particularly it boils down to the nonrelevant \namendments. If the other side would be lenient with us in trying to let \nus get those amendments up, debate them, get them voted on, we can move \nthis bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I came here this morning, now afternoon, \nto talk about the importance of this farm bill and for us to get off \nthe dime and get us moving forward on the farm bill. I am going to make \na statement on that in a few minutes.\n\n[[Page S14367]]\n\n  My friend from Utah has asked if he can go ahead of me to speak on \nanother subject for about 10 minutes. I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenator from Utah be recognized for 10 minutes to speak on a subject \nthat he will address; then, following the Senator from Utah, that I be \nrecognized for up to 20 minutes; following my statement that Senator \nDurbin be recognized for up to 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Utah.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/14/senate-section/article/S14367-1", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14367-S14375]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           FISA MODERNIZATION\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, following the unauthorized public \ndisclosure in 2005 of what has become known as the Terrorism \nSurveillance Program, numerous lawsuits were filed against electronic \ncommunication service providers for their alleged participation. \nCurrently, more than 40 lawsuits are pending, which collectively seek \nhundreds of billions of dollars in damages. Let me repeat that figure, \nhundreds of billions of dollars.\n  For myriad reasons which I am going to discuss, these service \nproviders alleged to have participated deserve a round of applause and \na helping hand, not a slap in the face and a kick to the gut.\n  The amount of misinformation concerning this issue is staggering. \nGiven that this dialogue involves highly classified details, there are \nmany things that simply can't be discussed. However, the committee \nreport for the recently passed FISA modernization bill, S. 2248, from \nthe Senate Select Committee on Intelligence is public, and contains \nvery pertinent information.\n  The report mentions that as with other intelligence matters, the \nidentities of persons or entities that provide assistance to the U.S. \nGovernment are protected as vital sources and methods of intelligence. \nDetails of any such assistance can not be discussed. However, the \ncommittee report does mention that beginning soon after September 11, \nthe executive branch provided written requests or directives to U.S. \nelectronic communication service providers to obtain their assistance \nwith communications intelligence activities that had been authorized by \nthe President.\n\n  During consideration of FISA modernization legislation, the \nIntelligence Committee examined classified documents relating to this \nissue.\n  The committee, in an overwhelmingly bipartisan tally, voted to \ninclude retroactive immunity for service providers that were alleged to \nhave cooperated with the intelligence community in the implementation \nof the President's surveillance program. Senators from both sides of \nthe aisle, after careful consideration, came to this conclusion. Make \nno mistake, this was the right conclusion.\n  It was the right conclusion for the Intelligence Committee, and it \nshould be the right conclusion for the Judiciary Committee, when it \nconsiders this bill tomorrow.\n  Given the astounding amount of misinformation in the public domain \nconcerning the Terrorism Surveillance Program, it is not surprising \nthat these lawsuits are filled with false information and baseless \nallegations.\n  Some have asked a valid question, if the companies did not break the \nlaw, why do they need immunity? Quite simply, the Government's \nassertion of the state secrets privilege prevents these companies from \ndefending themselves.\n  This assertion by the Government is absolutely essential, as the \npossible disclosure of classified materials from ongoing \ncourt proceedings is a grave threat to national security. Given the \nnecessity for the state secrets privilege, the drawback is that the \ncompanies being sued are forbidden from making their case.\n\n  In fact, the companies cannot even confirm or deny any involvement in \nthe program whatsoever. They have no ability to defend themselves.\n  Ordinarily, these companies would be able to address allegations and \nmake their case. However, the classified nature of the topic means that \ncompanies are not free to do so. They can't even have discussions with \nshareholders or business partners. But we need to remember, lawful \nsilence does not equate to guilt.\n  Another point not mentioned nearly enough is that the Government \ncannot obtain the intelligence it needs without the assistance of \ntelecommunication companies. This means that our collection \ncapabilities are dependent on the support and collaboration of private \nbusinesses.\n  If retroactive immunity is not provided, these private businesses \nwill certainly be extremely hesitant to provide any future assistance \nto our intelligence community. This could have a crippling effect on \nthe security of millions of people in our society; thus, it's simply an \nunacceptable outcome for the safety and security of our Nation.\n  Any hesitation from companies to provide assistance with future \nGovernment requests could be disastrous. This could affect not only our \nintelligence community but domestic law enforcement efforts. The next \ntime a child is kidnapped, and law enforcement needs help with \ncommunications, would that situation allow any hesitation from the \nservice provider? If your son or daughter was missing, would you stand \nfor any lack of cooperation from companies? Do we want endless teams of \nprivate company lawyers second, third, fourth, and fifth guessing \nlawful orders to compel their assistance?\n  This is not the only problem with not including retroactive immunity. \nAs the duration of these lawsuits increases, so does the chance that \nhighly classified sources and methods of our intelligence community \nwill be unnecessarily and unlawfully disclosed. Our enemies are acutely \naware of these proceedings, and are certainly attempting to gather \ninformation previously unknown to them. The potential disclosure of \nclassified information also puts the personnel and facilities of \nelectronic communication service providers at risk.\n  Given all of the tremendous harm and damage that will occur by not \npassing a form of limited liability, I am amazed at the number of \nindividuals who fail to grasp the seriousness of the issue before us.\n  To those who purport to oppose immunity in any form, I would hope \nthat they take the time to actually read the bill. For those unable to \ntear themselves away from their favorite partisan blog, I am going to \nquickly tell you what the immunity provision says, and what it does not \nsay. Remember, this bill passed 13-2 in the Intelligence Committee.\n  A civil action may be dismissed only if a certification is made to \nthe court certifying that either (1) the electronic service provider \ndid not provide the alleged assistance, or (2) the assistance was \nprovided after the 9/11 attacks, and was described in a written request \nindicating that the activity was authorized by the President and \ndetermined to be lawful.\n  Furthermore, this certification has to be reviewed by the court \nbefore a civil action can be dismissed.\n  It does not provide for immunity for Government officials. It does \nnot provide for immunity for criminal acts. Instead, it is a narrowly \ntailored provision that strikes a proper balance. This point can't be \noverlooked; the immunity provision in the current bill has absolutely \nzero effect on the numerous lawsuits pending against Federal Government \nagencies. These cases will go on, with their questionable \nconstitutional challenges, with no impact from this bill.\n  Some Senators have suggested that indemnification or substitution \nwould be possible solutions. Let me be perfectly clear, neither one is \nappropriate or acceptable in this situation. The Intelligence Committee \nconsidered both of these ideas, and rejected them for good reason. \nIndemnification, where the Federal Government would be responsible for \nany damages awarded against the providers, is not advisable since the \nproviders would still be parties to the lawsuits, and thus the suits \nwould continue with the consequences of disclosure and discovery. Not \nonly does this further the likelihood of disclosure of classified \nmaterial, but the companies will face serious damage to their business \nreputations, relationships with foreign countries, and stock prices. \nThis is extremely unfair, if handled improperly.\n\n  Substitution, where the Government would litigate in place of the \nservice providers, is not a viable solution since all of the same \nconcerns just mentioned still apply. Even though the providers will not \nbe parties to the litigation, discovery will still apply.\n\n[[Page S14368]]\n\n  Don't we realize that having the Government fund unnecessary \nlitigation is a tremendous waste of taxpayer dollars? The Government \ndoes not magically create dollars, it taxes hard-working Americans. \nWhen it comes to funding, who do we think the Government is?\n  To say that the Government should pay is to say that our mothers, \nfathers, brothers, sisters, sons, and daughters should have money \nforcefully taken from their paychecks to fund frivolous lawsuits. This \nis Alice in Wonderland, and down the rabbit hole we go.\n  Finally, for those who love to expound the catch phrase ``warrantless \nwiretapping'' to assert some theory of illegality, I encourage you to \ncarefully read the fourth amendment.\n  Contrary to any other assertion, the fourth amendment does not always \nrequire a warrant and is based on the reasonableness of searches. While \nthe phrase is meant to scare people, ``warrantless wiretapping'' in \nthis instance is perfectly legal and constitutional.\n  Immunity is an appropriate remedy. It is just. It is necessary. It \nis imperative for the continued success of our intelligence gathering.\n\n  While reasonable minds can disagree about political topics, this \nissue requires disciplined logic, not political hyperbole. I hope that \npeople keep the following facts in mind when considering this topic.\n  The program did not involve interception of domestic to domestic \nphone calls.\n  The President and the highest levels of the executive branch \ndetermined the program to be lawful and conveyed this fact repeatedly \nin writing to service providers.\n  The electronic service providers' participation was vital to the \nsecurity of our country.\n  Lives have been saved by this program.\n  The companies were called on to support a lawful program that was \nvital to the security of our country. Do the companies require thanks \nor appreciation? No, but they certainly do not deserve illegitimate and \nfalse criticisms that affect their financial well being.\n  A grateful public should certainly appreciate the critical assistance \nthe companies alone can provide for the public's defense. These \ncompanies are quite possibly facing irreversible harm to their business \nreputation and cannot defend themselves due to state secrets.\n  This debate has far too many Monday morning quarterbacks, applying \ntheir revisionist history to best represent their political mantra. I \nstrongly urge all of my colleagues to support the limited immunity \nprovided for in S. 2248. Any company that has done its part to provide \nfor the protection of American families deserves protection in return. \nIf not, the next time we reach out for a helping hand, we will be the \nones who receive a slap to the face. And really, who could blame them?\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, on November 5, almost 10 days ago, I came \nto the floor to say there it was a proud day in my time as a Senator \nbecause we were moving forward with consideration of the 2007 farm \nbill. Almost 10 days have passed and we are stuck. In being stuck, we \nare doing a disservice to the people of America, to the people of rural \nAmerica. It behooves us to move forward with the kind of process that \nput together the 2002 farm bill and farm bills before that, where there \nwas a procedure set out that there was an agreed-upon set of relevant \namendments that were discussed and debated on the farm bill and then a \nfarm bill was passed. To do otherwise is, frankly, letting down the \nfarmers and ranchers. From my point of view, that is something which we \nought not to do. It is something we have a moral obligation to avoid \nand where both Republicans and Democrats coming together can figure out \na way forward to make sure we are addressing the realities and \nchallenges of rural America, the realities and challenges of our \nfarmers and ranchers, and the issues related to nutrition and all of \nthe rest of the components of this very good farm bill which has been \nwritten by the Agriculture Committee, a committee which is composed of \nRepublicans and Democrats, of which the Presiding Officer played a \nsignificant role in putting this farm bill together. It is important we \nmove forward.\n  Let me talk about why I believe it is important to move forward. I \ndecided to run for this position in the Senate several years ago in \nlarge part because there aren't enough people in Washington and on the \nfloor of the Senate who cared much about what happens to rural America. \nThere are very few people here, frankly, who have lived through the \nhard times and celebrated the joys of being a farmer or a rancher. It \nis important the voices of farmers and ranchers, who have dirt under \ntheir fingernails, whose hands are unmistakably calloused by the hard \nwork they do, be heard in this Chamber. We do a tremendous dishonor to \nthose hard-working Americans when there are the procedural and \npolitical games that are being played here today.\n  The majority leader came forward and said what we ought to do is go \nto the farm bill. It is a good farm bill. We ought to decide that there \nis maybe a subset of amendments, 10, 15, 20, whatever it is, and get on \nwith the farm bill. Yet 10 days later, we are not making very much \nprogress. Why aren't we making progress? Is it possible that some \npeople on the other side simply do not want a farm bill, that they \nwould rather see this work, which has been a labor for several years by \nmany people, be killed? Is that their agenda, to kill the farm bill?\n  To all the farmers and ranchers who are listening across America \ntoday, to all those organizations which have been a part of this effort \nover the last several years, to all those people who care about \nnutrition in schools, to all those who care about making sure the \nhungriest are being fed, the faith community and others, I ask them to \nmake their voices heard in Washington today so we are able to move \nforward to get a farm bill done and to get it done before we go back \nfor Thanksgiving. I believe if those voices are heard here, that in \nfact will happen.\n  For me, much of my life has been spent on a farm and on a ranch. I \nknow what the joys of farming and ranching are. I know what the joy is \nafter you have prepared a field and you go out to the field after you \nhave applied the fertilizer and you have watered the soil and you start \nseeing the shoots of wheat or barley or the young plants of alfalfa \nspring up like magic from the soil. I know the joy of what it is like \nto go out in the middle of the night and to watch a baby calf being \nborn and then, within 4 or 5 hours, to watch the baby calf begin to \nstand on its legs, suck on the milk, and then be out prancing around \nwithin 12 hours. It is almost a spiritual experience when you think \nabout the beauty of nature that you get to experience firsthand as a \nrancher and as a farmer.\n  I know the joys of being there for harvest time. I know the joy of \nbeing on a combine and watching the golden color of the grain collected \nin the combine and dumping it out through the chutes into the trucks \nthat take it into the bins for storage. I know the joy of putting up \nstacks of hay, 20,000 bales of the greenest hay that is possible. It \nmakes you proud when your haystack is finally completed. I know all the \njoys that come with farming from what you get to see on the land \nitself.\n  I also know the joy that comes from the effort where a family works \ntogether, where you have, in many cases around America, family farmers \nand ranchers who have been on the same land for generations, as is the \ncase with my family, where they have been on the same farm for five \ngenerations. I know the joy and special meaning of those lands, where \nyou know the reality of every fencepost because it was my great-\ngrandfather who put that fencepost up. I know where the ditches were \nbuilt in our case on our ranch on May 15 of 1857, when they were \nfinally adjudicated and given a water right for that ditch. We know the \nreality of our land and our water.\n  There needs to be voices in the Senate, Democrats, such as the \nPresiding Officer from Pennsylvania, and Republicans as well who come \nup and say: We are not going to let rural America down. We are not \ngoing to let this farm bill die. We are not going to let those who have \nsome political agenda kill this farm bill, to turn their back on rural \nAmerica and do what they are trying to do. It is unconscionable that \nthey would be engaging on that agenda.\n\n[[Page S14369]]\n\n  Like I know the joys of farming, I also know the hardships that come \nas a rancher and a farmer. I know the concerns you can have when you \nhave cut a crop of hay and you see the clouds coming up at 10 or 11 \no'clock in the morning, knowing that maybe before you get to a point \nwhere you are going to bale the hay, you are going to have a crop that \nwill be ruined. I also know the fear of watching those clouds rise over \nthe horizon, when you can know from the color of the cloud itself that \na hailstorm is on the way and you wonder whether that storm is going to \nhit your crop or it is going to hit a neighbor's crop, whether \ndevastation is going to be caused by that storm.\n  I also know the pain of being in a position where ranchers, farmers \ngo to the bank and they say to the banker: I need some assistance \nbecause I can't afford to pay back my operating line because either the \nprices are too low this year or because we have had some kind of \ndisaster that has affected our ability to pay you back.\n  I know farmers and ranchers personally who have lost their farms, who \nhave lost their ranches, and there is nothing that is anymore painful \nthan going to those auctions and watching those farmers and ranchers \nwho have built their life and their entire dream around their farm or \ntheir ranch and the equipment they have and being there in a position \nwhere they are having to sell what, essentially, is the soul of their \nlife, their farm or their ranch.\n  So what we do here today--what we are doing here on this farm bill--\nin incredibly important for rural America. It is incredibly important \nfor farmers and ranchers. It is incredibly important for those of us \nwho want to feed this Nation. Yet, somehow, as I see the debate taking \nplace here, at last count there were some 255 amendments to this farm \nbill. Well, why are there 255 amendments to this farm bill, when we \nhave been working on this legislation for a number of different years?\n  The distinguished ranking member of the committee, Senator Chambliss, \nstarted to hold hearings on the farm bill several years ago. He held \nthem all over the country--from Iowa to Georgia to other places. Then \nSenator Harkin, the chairman of the committee, held hearings in my \nState of Colorado on the farm bill, held hearings all over the \ncountry--each of us working to produce the very best farm bill we \npossibly could.\n  In my own State of Colorado, I worked with the great agricultural \norganizations--from the Colorado Cattlemen's Association to the Rocky \nMountain Farmers Union to a whole host of others--to make sure we were \nputting together the very best farm bill for America.\n  It is a farm bill that, in my view, is one which would give us a \ngreat opportunity to revitalize rural America, to make sure that when \nwe look back at the dawn of this century we did not allow rural America \nto be sunsetted but that instead we reinvigorated rural America in a \nway that has not ever happened before.\n  We have some great opportunities to do that because this farm bill is \nnot just about farms; it is about fuel, it is about our energy \nsecurity, it is about the future of our country in so many different \nways. Yet we are being stalled here. We are not being allowed to move \nforward to consider this legislation and the substance of this \nlegislation.\n  Let me say from my point of view, when I look at the future of \nagriculture, the future of ranching, and the future of rural America, \nwhat I see. First, I see great promise, and then I see great hope. I \nsee great promise and great hope if we can do for rural development \nthat which needs to be done.\n  We know today that per capita income in rural America is a lot less \nthan it is in urban America. We know today that the infrastructure \nissues that are faced in the small towns of rural America exceed the \ncapacity of those communities to be able to deal with those \ninfrastructure needs by multiple times. We know that in many towns in \nevery one of the 50 States, and represented here, you can go through \nthose towns and you can see what has happened as rural America has been \nmore and more forgotten year after year.\n  As to the town of Antonito, located within 5 miles of part of our \nranch, you can drive in that town today and can see the devastation of \na great part of rural America. At one point in time there were four or \nfive gas stations in the town of Antonito. Today, there is one gas \nstation. At one point in time in this town of Antonito, which has a \npopulation of less than 1,000, there used be a number of different \ngrocery stores to go and buy your food. I remember ShopRite because \nthat is where I used to go and buy lunch sometimes when I was working \nout on the farm. ShopRite has closed. So have other stores. There is \nonly one small store that survives today. You see the boarded-up \nstreets of that town where probably 50 percent of all of the buildings \ntoday are vacant.\n  You see a whole host of other problems in rural America. What we have \ntried to do with this farm bill is to address those issues. If we are \nsuccessful--as we should be--if we are successful--as we must be, as we \nare required to do if we are going to do our job--then we are going to \nopen a new chapter of opportunity for America and for rural America.\n  That chapter of opportunity has several very important features to \nit. First, it will make sure we have food security for the United \nStates of America. We do not want to become dependent on foreign \nsources for our food in the same say we have for oil. For me, for the \ntime I have been in public service--and before--I have had a sign on my \ndesk that says: ``No farms, no food.'' So no matter where you are, the \n300 million people of America every day should remind themselves of \nthat reality: ``No farms, no food.'' This is about the food security of \nour Nation.\n  Secondly, the vision that we have with this farm bill we have worked \non so hard for so many years is that we will contribute significantly \nto making sure we get rid of our addiction to foreign oil and that we \ngrow our way to energy independence. The energy aspects of title IX of \nthis farm bill are the most robust in the history of the United States \nof America. What you will see with this legislation, as it is \nimplemented, is a rural America helping us grow our way to energy \nindependence.\n  Senator Grassley and I cosponsored legislation, a resolution which \npassed both this body as well as the House of Representatives, that \nsays we can grow 25 percent of our energy from renewable energy \nresources. That is the ambitious vision that is included in this \nlegislation. The energy components of the farm bill are incredibly \nimportant to the national security of the United States, to the \nenvironmental security of our world, as well as to the economic \nopportunities for America.\n  So I am hopeful we will open this chapter of energy opportunity with \nthe passage of this farm bill, and that we will get it done as soon as \npossible.\n  Finally, when we think about the great conservationists of our \ncountry, there are no better people to take care of their land and \ntheir water than those who depend on it for a living. If you are a \nfarmer or you are a rancher, you know you have to take care of your \nland and your water because that is your way of life. If something \nhappens to your land and to your water, your way of life is taken away \nfrom you. So the conservation programs which are such a major part of \nthis legislation are a keystone to the future of how we take care of \nour planet.\n  This legislation, under the leadership of Senator Harkin, is the best \nlegislation that has ever come forward on a farm bill with respect to \nthe many conservation programs that include the Wetlands Reserve \nProgram, the Conservation Reserve Program, and a whole host of other \nprograms that are going to be important to make sure we have the best \nconservation agenda possible for our Nation.\n  In conclusion, I would make a plea to my colleagues, and that is that \nwe work together to narrow down the number of amendments that need to \nbe considered, and that we set about a process that will bring about a \nconclusion to this farm bill, so that then we can go to conference and \nwe can get a farm bill that is a good farm bill for America, delivered \nto the President.\n  I also say to my colleagues--and there are some--who want this bill \nkilled, don't do it. Don't kill this bill. It is too important for this \ncountry. Across America, people ought to be beating the drums in every \nState, in every county, in every village, on every farm and every \nranch. They ought to be beating the drums and using their\n\n[[Page S14370]]\n\ntelephones calling the Members of this Senate, telling us we ought not \nto leave here until the job is done. And the job will be done when we \nget this farm bill adopted by this Senate, which I predict if this \nbill, in its current fashion, were to be brought to a vote today, it \nwould pass with about 70 to 75 votes.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Menendez). The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Colorado. He \ncomes to the Senate with an amazing background. I have sat and talked \nto him from time to time about his family. Senator Salazar's family \ncame to the United States 400 or 500 years ago. They were some of the \nearliest settlers of our country, in the southwestern part of the \nUnited States. The founding of the city of Santa Fe, NM, his family was \ndirectly involved in; the naming of mountain ranges and rivers. They \nwere there long before my ancestors ever had the good fortune to come \nto these shores.\n  I have also heard the stories of his youth, how he grew up on a ranch \nin Colorado with some very difficult circumstances, without the \ncreature comforts many of us in the cities were used to. It is clearly \nin his blood and in his heart. When he speaks about this farm bill, he \nis not talking about some academic conversation but, rather, about the \nreason he came to the Senate, to make sure families such as his would \nhave a voice in so many different areas but particularly when it came \nto this bill.\n  This monster of a bill, 1,600 pages, is a bill we take up every 5 \nyears. It is the farm bill. But it includes so much more, as Senator \nSalazar has told us. It is not just about keeping our farms productive \nand our ranches profitable, but it is about rural America, small town \nAmerica, the America of the Senator's youth, and the America I was \nfortunate enough to represent as a Congressman in downstate Illinois \nfor so long.\n  His statement on the subject is not just another political speech. I \nknow it came from the heart. I thank him for reminding us about the \nimportance of this bill to small town America, to farmers and ranchers \nacross America, and why these very practical, commonsense, hardheaded \nfolks would find it hard to understand what is happening on the Senate \nfloor over the last week and a half.\n  You see, for 10 days we have virtually tied up and stopped the Senate \nin the consideration of this farm bill. It should have been passed a \nlong time ago. When you take a look back at previous farm bills, in \n1990 there were 7 days of consideration of the farm bill. Mr. \nPresident, 122 amendments were dealt with. There were only 2 that were \nnot relevant to a farm bill--only 2--and 122 were.\n  In 1996, 4 days were spent on the farm bill, and 24 amendments were \nconsidered to the bill. None of them were about anything other than \nfarming and agriculture.\n  In 2001 and 2002, there were about 16 days of consideration on the \nfarm bill, with 53 amendments. Only one was offered that did not have \nanything to do with the farm bill, which was offered by Senator Kyl of \nArizona on the estate tax. There was one side-by-side amendment offered \nby Senator Conrad. That was it.\n  Well, it is a different story today. Senator Salazar has told us. \nThis morning, Senator Reid, the majority leader, the Democratic leader, \ngave me a list of the Republican amendments they want to call on this \nfarm bill. We have been tied in knots now for almost 10 days in the \nSenate because the Republicans refuse to come up with a list of \namendments we could consider.\n  They finally came up with this list. When you take a look at the \namendments on this list, you can understand what their game plan is. \nAfter all the time we spent in preparing this bill, it is very clear \nthey do not want this bill to be called. They do not want us to debate \nit. They want to talk about everything under the Sun except a farm \nbill.\n  Here are a couple examples of things they think should be talked \nabout: Senator Murkowski of Alaska thinks the farm bill is a good time \nto talk about Exxon Valdez litigation. Senator Kyl of Arizona believes \nthis is the tax bill, so he wants to talk about the alternative minimum \ntax. In fact, he has filed at least one amendment, maybe more, on the \nsubject. Senator Lott, the Republican whip, thinks this is a good tax \nbill, too. Let's get into a debate about the alternative minimum tax, \nan issue which clearly we will debate and will decide before the end of \nthe year.\n  Senator Coburn believes we should talk about the estate tax. Senator \nMcConnell also wants to talk about the estate tax. He also wants to \ntalk about the alternative minimum tax. Senator Stevens of Alaska wants \nto talk about protecting kids from online predators. I am all for that. \nI am trying to figure out what the connection is with the farm bill, \nthough.\n  Senator Gregg is one of the most prolific when it comes to producing \namendments which have little or nothing to do with the farm bill. He \nwants us to get into a debate on the mortgage crisis in America. It \ntruly is a crisis. He thinks the farm bill is the place to do it. He \nwants to talk about immigration, too, while we are on the farm bill--\nnot ag workers and immigrants brought in for that purpose--but the \nissue of driver's licenses for the undocumented. He also thinks it is \nimportant for us to get into an issue of collective bargaining for \nfirefighters. I happen to be a cosponsor of that bill. I never would \nhave dreamed that amendment should be offered on a farm bill. Senator \nGregg of New Hampshire--I don't know how many farmers there are in his \nState. I don't know what they grow; I am sure they are very good \npeople--has decided their interests have to be set aside. He has other \nthings he wants to talk about.\n\n  He also has the notion in which he thinks, in addition to \nimmigration, mortgages, firefighters' right to collective bargaining, \nwe should in the farm bill say women who live in rural areas of America \nwill be denied the right to sue doctors guilty of malpractice. Women in \nrural areas will have a limited legal right to sue doctors guilty of \nmalpractice. Well, I am sure the rural women of America are grateful \nSenator Gregg wants to make sure they are a special class, unable to \nuse their constitutional legal rights in court if they are injured or a \nmember of their family is killed as a result of medical malpractice. He \nthinks that belongs on the farm bill. He also has one about the Gulf of \nMexico. I will have to dig into that. He has gone far afield. I think \nhe turned his legislative staff loose and said: Got any ideas? Let's \nput an amendment on the farm bill.\n  Senator Dole wants to get into taxes. It goes on and on; page after \npage of amendments.\n  Well, clearly, we can't consider those amendments if we are serious \nabout passing a farm bill. So what Senator Reid and Senator Harkin, the \nchairman of the Agriculture Committee, did was say to the Republican \nside: Let's get serious. Let's get down to business. Let's cooperate. \nLet's bring up the amendments that relate to the farm bill, and let's \ndo it on a bipartisan basis.\n  So this morning Senator Harkin said: How about starting with the \namendment of the Senator from North Dakota, Senator Dorgan, cosponsored \nby Senator Grassley, a Republican of Iowa. Let's have limited time for \ndebate, and then let's vote on it. Well, Senator Saxby Chambliss of \nGeorgia, the ranking Republican on the Senate Agriculture Committee, \nobjected. He didn't want to bring up a bipartisan amendment to be \ndebated for 60 minutes and vote on it.\n  Then Senator Harkin said: Well, let's pick another bipartisan \namendment, the Lugar-Lautenberg amendment regarding farm program \nreform, 2 hours of debate and a vote. Senator Saxby Chambliss, the \nRepublican on the Senate Agriculture Committee, objected.\n  Senator Harkin, undaunted, then suggested that Senator Pat Roberts of \nKansas, a man who has an extensive background in the House and Senate \non ag programs, be given 90 minutes on his amendment, and then a vote. \nSenator Saxby Chambliss, the Republican ranking member on the Senate \nAgriculture Committee, objected to even calling up his colleague's \namendment for a vote. Do you see a pattern emerging? It isn't so much \nabout amendments and votes; it is a matter of stopping the bill.\n  Senator Harkin, indefatigable, then suggested that Senator Stevens of \nAlaska--another Republican--be allowed to call up his amendment with 60\n\n[[Page S14371]]\n\nminutes of debate and a vote. Senator Chambliss, still stuck on the \nagenda of stopping this bill, objected.\n  Then Senator Harkin, showing the magnanimity of a great corn husker \nfrom Iowa, suggested we proceed to the amendment by Senator Allard, a \nRepublican from Colorado, 60 minutes of debate and a vote. Senator \nChambliss, unmoved by the generosity of Senator Harkin, objected. Five \nrequests, every one of them but one an amendment either sponsored by a \nRepublican or cosponsored by a Republican, and the Republicans \nobjected.\n  Well, you don't need to be a C-SPAN addict to figure out what is \ngoing on. The Republicans don't want us to finish the farm bill. After \nmonths and months of hearings, after an elaborate process, after \nnegotiations and compromises on both sides, after a lot of hard work, \n1,600 pages of policy are rejected by the Republicans. I am not \nsurprised. This is the party that failed for 6 years--6 straight \nyears--to pass the Water Resources Development Act, a critical bill for \nfarmers in my State. This bill will provide the funds to upgrade the \nlocks and dams so important for ag commerce. It wasn't a major priority \nfor the Republican Congress. For 6 years, they ignored it, failed to \npass it. We finally passed it this year, and last week, in a historic \nSenate vote, overrode the President's veto the 107th time it has \noccurred on the floor of the Senate. The Republicans, left to their own \ndevices, couldn't pass the bill. When we finally passed it on a \nbipartisan basis, their President vetoed it, and they joined us in \noverriding the veto.\n  Now comes the farm bill, which doesn't come around that often--it has \nbeen about 5 years--and they want to stop this one too. They want to \nstop it by killing it with amendments. Senator Harkin has gone out of \nhis way to give them votes and debate on critical amendments that do \nrelate to the farm bill, but that is not their strategy and that is not \ntheir goal. Their goal is to kill the farm bill. I am not sure why.\n  In my State, I would hazard a guess that there are more Republicans \nwho are farmers than Democrats. It doesn't make much difference from my \npoint of view as a Senator; I am going to help farmers in general, and \ntheir political identity is secondary. But why would they turn their \nbacks on so many farmers across America when we have a chance to pass \nthis farm bill? Why wouldn't they agree to a reasonable number of \namendments that stick with the farm bill and what it is all about? \nWell, because, frankly, they don't want us to achieve the goal of \npassing the farm bill. It isn't new to many of us. We have seen it \nhappen over and over again.\n\n  We have something in the Senate called a filibuster, and a filibuster \ngoes back in history at least 90 years. We said at that time, any \nSenator can stop any bill from being debated and considered. About 90 \nyears ago, we amended that and said: Well, I will tell you, if 67 \nSenators step forward and say we want to go to the bill anyway, they \ncan overrule that one Senator who said no--67. That was back 90 years \nago. About 40 years ago, that was changed to 60 Senators. So you have a \nfilibuster, which is an attempt to stop the debate, stop the progress \nof the bill, and if 60 Senators will step forward and say we disagree, \nthen you move forward with the amendment, you move forward with the \nbill. That is the filibuster in the simplest terms.\n  In the history of the Senate, the most prolific use of the filibuster \nto delay votes and kill bills produced 58--58--filibusters over 2 \nyears--58 over 2 years. Well, our colleagues on the Republican side of \nthe aisle are about to break through that record dramatically. Senator \nStabenow has created this chart. It shows to date 52 Republican \nfilibusters on motions for cloture--52 this year. We still have another \nyear and 2 months to go. The Republicans have tried to stop legislation \non this floor with a filibuster and a motion for cloture 52 times. So \nthis is certainly going to be the Republican Senate on steroids when it \ncomes to filibusters. They are going to bust through the old record, \nand they are going to stop everything they can, including a bipartisan \nfarm bill.\n  They accomplished so little when they were in charge and in control \nthat they want to make sure we accomplish as little as possible. That \nis unfortunate. It is unfortunate because the American people want us \nto cooperate. They want us to compromise. They want us to try to come \nup with legislation that solves America's problems, not squabble and \nfight and exalt our differences.\n  Luckily, there have been a few things--in fact, a significant number \nof things--that have been enacted by this Congress, despite 52 \nfilibusters. I think back on passing the increase in the minimum wage, \nand I think it was the first time in 10 years we finally passed an \nincrease in the Federal minimum wage. We passed historic legislation to \nprovide student loans for students from families with limited means, \nreducing the cost of those loans and forgiving some of those loans. We \npassed that. We also managed to pass the Children's Health Insurance \nProgram, a program that would extend coverage to another 4 million \nuninsured children in America--children who weren't the poorest, \nbecause those kids are taken care of in our caring Nation; and not the \nluckiest, because their parents don't have health insurance--but those \ncaught right in the middle. Mom and dad go to work, no benefits, and we \nhad a program that said let's help them. Let's provide private health \ninsurance for those kids. Well, the President stopped that, vetoed it, \nand the Republicans refused to override that veto. We passed it, not \nonce but twice, despite the odds against us in passing important \nlegislation.\n  I think about stem cell research, too--the first President in history \nto have a Federal prohibition against medical research when it involves \nstem cells. We passed it with a bipartisan vote to override this \nprohibition. The President vetoed it.\n  So time and again, whether it is help for education or health care, \nwe have been up against it: The failure of the Republicans to cooperate \nand pass the legislation, or the President's veto that they are afraid \nto override. That, I think, is the story of the Republican strategy of \nthis session. It puzzles me. Do they think this is a winning strategy \nin America, a party so bereft of ideas and policies that all they can \ndo is stop us?\n  This bill is not a Democratic bill, this farm bill. I think Senator \nChambliss, if he were on the floor today, would readily concede he \nplayed a big role in writing this bill. Senator Roberts of Kansas \nplayed a major role in writing this bill. Two Republican Senators who \nwere involved in this legislation. Yet when it comes to trying to pass \nit, unfortunately, Senator Chambliss objected five times in our \nattempts to bring this bill forward and move it forward.\n  They don't want this Senate to achieve anything, whether it is a farm \nbill or whatever it happens to be. But we are not going to quit. We are \nnot going to be discouraged. We can only hope that those who follow \nthis debate will respond. If you live in rural America, small town \nAmerica, a farm family, a ranching family; if you know the importance \nof rural electric; if you know what it means to have soil and water \nconservation programs to protect the area you live in; if you think \nthat bringing broadband Internet to all of America, including small \ntowns and rural areas is important; if you think our Food Stamp Program \nto make sure the poorest in our country have something to eat is \nimportant; if you are worried about school lunch programs and whether \nthey have good quality so our kids get nutritious food; if you happen \nto believe that the WIC Program, which is a program which helps low-\nincome mothers and their babies is important; if you believe that \nmaking certain our farm sector in America can survive difficult times--\na bad year--whether it is a drought or a flood, a tornado; if you think \nit is important we have programs to protect that part of America; if \nyou believe we need to have alternative sources of fuel and not be at \nthe mercy of OPEC and the Middle East sheiks and we should be producing \nethanol and other forms of fuel that can help us move toward energy \nindependence; if you think any of those things are important, I \nencourage you to contact your Senator and tell them to get moving.\n  Ten days on the farm bill with nothing happening is unacceptable. It \nis the Senate at its worst. It is the minority with their program at \nits worst.\n  We need to have bipartisan cooperation. Senator Harkin tried \nrepeatedly.\n\n[[Page S14372]]\n\nWe will keep trying. But if the object of the Republicans is to run out \nthe clock, to have us break and go home for Thanksgiving with no farm \nbill passed, I assume they can achieve that. Boy, talk about bragging \nrights, going home to your State and saying: We stopped the farm bill. \nYou know, every 5 years, it comes around. We stopped it cold, even \nthough it is a bipartisan bill. That is what they will be able to brag \nabout.\n  Senator Gregg has told me he has lots of amendments. He is thinking \nof even more. He is ingenious when it comes to different subjects, and \nI am sure his staff is busy right now thinking of other amendments they \ncan add to this bill that have nothing to do with the farm bill, and he \nis going to want to ask that we vote on every single one of them. We \ncould all do that. I guess there would be some personal satisfaction, \nbut at the end of the day, very little legislation and very little to \nshow for our efforts. This list, this three-page list of Republican \namendments, is an indication of bad faith. If they are serious about a \nfarm bill--and we should be--let's agree to a reasonable number of \ngermane, relevant amendments that have something to do with the farm \nbill. Let's not make this a bill for all seasons; let's make this a \nbill for America's agricultural sector that counts on us.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Order for Recess\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nstand in recess today from 2 to 3:30 p.m.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, we have for many weeks now been debating in \nthis Chamber the 2007 farm bill. In my State of Ohio, passage of this \nlegislation is essential to ensuring the well-being of middle-class and \nlow-income families throughout our State. The bill is an agriculture \nbill, it is a hunger bill, it is an energy bill, it is a conservation \nbill. Melding these priorities is not easy. Melding these priorities \ninto a bill that helps farmers, that advances our Nation's energy \ngoals, that increases the focus on conservation, and that bolsters \nnutrition programs is a profound accomplishment.\n  As we debate the complex components of this legislation, I applaud \nChairman Tom Harkin, a Senator from Iowa, for his leadership. We must \nnever lose sight that this bill is about families. Families in Ohio and \nacross the Nation are depending on us to pass this legislation in a \ntimely manner.\n  This spring, I traveled throughout Ohio and heard directly from \nfarmers about what they need in this year's farm bill. They need the \nsame thing any other entrepreneur needs--a fair shake. They need a \nsafety net that makes sense given the revenue fluctuations they \nexperience. They need for Washington rhetoric about conservation and \nalternative energy to translate into commonsense programs and \nmeaningful incentives.\n  This bill will help family farmers in Ohio and in New Jersey, the \nState of the Presiding Officer, and across our country by strengthening \nand diversifying the farm safety net. Current farm programs protect \nfarmers from chronically low prices. However, these programs do little \nto help farmers when prices are high but yields are low, resulting in a \nrevenue shortfall. By targeting overall revenue rather than simply \nprice, farmers can receive better protection against swings in prices \nand natural disasters.\n  Currently, crop prices are high but volatile. Farmers' input costs \nare rising, as well as their overall risks. Farmers should be given the \nopportunity to choose an alternative safety net if it better allows \nthem to manage their own farm's risk in today's uncertain and evolving \nfarm environment.\n  The average crop revenue program, brought to this bill by Senator \nDurbin, Chairman Harkin, and me, gives farmers a choice. The average \ncrop revenue program will matter to help those farmers with a safety \nnet. For the first time ever, farmers will be able to enroll in a \nprogram--it is their choice; they don't have to--they can enroll in a \nprogram that insures against revenue instability which for many farmers \nmakes more sense than a price-focused safety net, which is the old farm \nprogram.\n  As I traveled around Ohio, I met with Mark Schweibert, a corn farmer \nin Henry County in northwest Ohio who will likely take advantage of \naverage crop revenue. He will be supplying corn to one of the first \nethanol plants in Ohio. I met that same week with Ralph Dull, a hog \nfarmer from Montgomery County, who uses wind turbines to provide on-\nfarm energy.\n  This farm bill makes a commitment to move beyond antiquated energy \nsources and to prepare American agriculture to lead the world in \nrenewable energy production. With the right resources, the right \nincentives, farmers can help decrease our dependence on foreign oil and \nproduce cleaner, sustainable, renewable energy. In a State such as \nOhio, with a talented labor force and a proud manufacturing history, \nthat just doesn't mean stronger farms, more prosperous farms; it means \na better Ohio and a stronger economy.\n  This bill will provide more than $4 billion in additional funding for \nconservation programs to help farmers protect our water quality, expand \nour wildlife habitat, and preserve endangered farmland. And this bill \ndoes something else equally important: It fights hunger.\n  Earlier this year, when the Agriculture Committee began this process, \nwe heard from Rhonda Stewart of Hamilton, OH. Rhonda Stewart, a single \nmother, came with her young son. She told us a story. She told us that \nshe works a full-time job, has no health care, and makes about, I \nbelieve, $9 an hour. She teaches Sunday school, She is involved with \nthe Cub Scouts for her son, and she is president of the PTA at her \nson's school. She plays by the rules. She works hard. She said that at \nthe beginning of the month, as she is a food stamp beneficiary, she \nmakes pork chops for her son once or twice that first week. Later on in \nthe month, maybe she takes him to a fast food restaurant. Almost \ninvariably at the end of the month, she says she sits down at the \nkitchen table and her son is eating dinner and she does not.\n  Her son says: Mom, what is wrong? Are you not hungry?\n  She says: I am not feeling well tonight.\n  For Rhonda Stewart, who teaches Sunday school, is involved with the \nCub Scouts, is president of the PTA, works hard, pays her taxes, raises \na son, is a food stamp beneficiary of $1 per person per meal, and $6 a \nday roughly for Rhonda Stewart does not go far enough. What we do in \nthis Chamber can help Rhonda Stewart, her family, and millions of \nfamilies such as hers. The farm bill increases food stamp benefits and \nindexes those benefits to inflation. When the purchasing power of food \nstamps erodes, so does our Nation's progress against hunger. We are the \nwealthiest country in the world. We are a caring, compassionate people. \nFamilies in our country, especially families who work hard, such as \nRhonda Stewart and her family, should not go hungry.\n  I am pleased with the overall bill. There are some things we can do \nto improve it. The public is perfectly willing to help family farmers \nwhen they need it, as we should. However, taxpayers will not support \nmassive payments to farms that have substantial net incomes or huge \npayments to farmers who are not really farmers, who have huge off-farm \nincome and really just happen to own farmland.\n  I will be offering an amendment to return some of the excess \nsubsidies in the Crop Insurance Program to the American taxpayers and \nto provide funding for the McGovern-Dole program.\n  We have heard, of course, tales of woe from the crop insurance \nindustry over\n\n[[Page S14373]]\n\nthe past few weeks as they furiously lobby against this amendment. But \nthe facts tell a different story. Instead of letting the crop insurance \nindustry exceed even their already record returns, I think we will get \nfar better returns with modest investments at home and abroad. The \nMcGovern-Dole program--which would be funded with part of the revenues \nfrom the crop insurance amendment--provides funding for school lunches \nin developing nations. The potential benefits are immense for our \nnational security. We responded decades ago to a hostile Communist \nthreat in Europe with the Marshall Plan. Our best response to a hostile \nthreat overseas is to provide help in nutrition and education for \npeople who desperately need it.\n  Passage of the 2007 farm bill is not just a responsible thing to do \nfor this body, it is the right thing to do for our families, for our \nfarmers, and for our Nation.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I personally thank you for your courtesy \nin taking over the Presiding Officer duties so that I may make these \ncomments. I appreciate your courtesy.\n\n\n                                  Iraq\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, 3 weeks ago, I began a series of \nspeeches on the price America is paying for the failed war in Iraq, and \nI wish to continue today. The number of American service men and women \nkilled in action has risen to 3,855, and with every death of a husband \nor wife, a son or daughter, a mom or dad, the suffering of a family \nsoars to that place where numbers do not matter, to that place where \npain is beyond infinite.\n  I have spoken about what the war has cost us financially. Since the \nwar began more than 4 long years ago, we have spent over $455 billion. \nOver the long run, it will cost almost $2 trillion. Again, those are \nnot just numbers, those were cargo scanners that could have been \ninstalled at our ports, safer bridges that could have been built, \nlifesaving cancer research that could have been done, children who \ncould have been educated, lives that could have been saved--a world of \npossibilities that passed by us all. I have tried to help us all \nimagine what we are giving up by failing to awaken ourselves from the \nliving nightmare that is the war in Iraq.\n  Today, I wish to talk about the people who have given so much, people \nwho will be paying for this war for the rest of their lives--our \nveterans and their families.\n  On Sunday, we celebrated Veterans Day. I wish to talk about how much \nwe could do for those who have served with the amount of money we have \nused to send them into harm's way.\n  Mr. President, 28,451 troops have come back from Iraq with horrible \nwounds. Some wounds are physical. Some have had their legs or arms \nblown off by bombs. Some are blind from shrapnel in their eyes.\n  And some wounds are mental. Denying that war can wound a brain along \nwith the rest of the body is denying so many veterans' nightmares, \nflashbacks, shocks or changes in personality so radical--so radical--\nthat loved ones can no longer recognize the person they once knew.\n  Today, Army researchers are releasing a study showing that the full \npsychological impact of the war tends to hit soldiers even harder 6 \nmonths after they have returned from the war. So the ranks of those \nsuffering are about to grow by many thousands.\n  Beyond the human cost of these injuries, the financial costs to our \nsociety are tremendous. A report released by Physicians for Social \nResponsibility puts the cost of medical care and disability benefits \nfor veterans returning from Iraq at over $660 billion. So in a very \ndirect sense, the war has been more than twice as financially expensive \nas we might think just looking at the combat costs.\n  The human and financial costs don't end with just health care. Here \nis a shocking statistic, Mr. President: Veterans make up one in four \nhomeless people in this country. That means almost 200,000 veterans \ndon't have a home to go back to tonight. Experts say the rates of \nhomelessness are spiraling up faster than they did after the war in \nVietnam.\n  Mr. President, that is a moral outrage. These people put their lives \non the line for our country, no questions asked. It is a shame our men \nand women in uniform would be sent to patrol the streets of Baghdad \nonly to have to come back and sleep on the streets of their own \nhometowns.\n  That is why Democrats in Congress are working to give veterans the \nsupport they deserve. The Senate recently passed a bill that contains \nthe largest increase in funding for our veterans in history. We are \nreinvigorating our Veterans Affairs Department with a record $87 \nbillion, which is several billion dollars more than President Bush said \nhe was willing to spend on our veterans, with $37 billion for veterans \nhealth care. Billions of dollars are headed to expand medical services \nand beef up the administrative side so vets spend less time waiting to \nget their benefits.\n  Now, compare this to the costs of combat. Let's compare the \ninvestment in the men and women who serve in the uniform of the United \nStates to the costs of combat. We could pay for the entire Veterans \nHealth Administration budget--the entire Veterans Health Administration \nbudget, all $37 billion--with what we spend in less than 4 months of \ncombat in Iraq. Take care of every veteran, in terms of the veterans \nhealth care system. We could pay for that entire budget, $37 billion, \nwith what we spend in less than 4 months of combat in Iraq. And some \nsay it is too much? Where are their priorities?\n  Just as important as making sure vets have excellent health care is \nmaking sure they have an opportunity to get an excellent education. I \nam proud to be a cosponsor of a bill offered by Senator Webb that would \nbe the biggest boost to veterans education since World War II. \nPreparing thousands of veterans to enter the civilian workforce with a \nfirst-rate education would cost about $5.4 billion next year--$5.4 \nbillion--for, in essence, a new GI education bill. In other words, it \nwould cost what it takes to fund combat in Iraq for roughly 2 weeks to \nmake sure thousands of veterans can enter the civilian workforce when \nthey come back.\n  Here is one of our challenges. Many of our vets come back and find \nthe jobs they once had are no longer there. They find themselves, after \nserving their Nation, unemployed. The type of first-rate education we \ncould give them would clearly create an opportunity to ensure they \nwould have greater skills, greater employability, and that would take \nroughly 2 weeks of funding for the war in Iraq.\n  Democrats in Congress are also working to end the pandemic of \nhomelessness. I joined with Senator Obama to support a bill called \nHomes for Heroes. The bill would establish permanent housing and \nservices for low-income veterans and their families. It would make more \nrental assistance available to help providers of veteran housing and \nservices, and focus more attention on vets who are homeless. Of course, \nthe more soldiers who go off to war, the more necessary this bill \nbecomes.\n  The portion of the bill that helps community and nonprofit \norganizations offer housing to low-income veterans would require about \n$225 million to fund. We grind up enough money to house thousands of \nveterans in 16 hours in Iraq--not even a day. The costs of combat \ncompared to the opportunity to providing a year of expanded housing for \nhomeless veterans would cost the same as 16 hours of the amount we \nspend in Iraq. Some say too much. Where are your values? What are your \npriorities? How is it that you choose?\n  Of course, the price we pay in dollars can never compare to the price \nour wounded warriors and their families pay in lost limbs, in haunted \ndreams, and in lives changed forever. That is a price not one more \nsoldier should be asked to pay for a pointless war. In the meantime, we \nneed to act fast to get returning vets the help they need. Veterans got \ntheir wounds following their\n\n[[Page S14374]]\n\nGovernment's orders. Those wounds can only heal if the Government \nreorders its priorities.\n  Democrats wanted to send the bill increasing funding for veterans to \nthe President before Veterans Day, but President Bush is trying to use \nveterans funding as an excuse to veto other programs on which America \ndepends. The President has also said funding a new GI bill for \nveterans' education is too expensive. Too expensive. Never have calls \nfor fiscal responsibility been so morally irresponsible.\n  First and foremost, we can never forget the price tag our veterans \nhave ultimately paid with their service, and the price tag for veterans \nservices wouldn't be so high if this administration didn't recklessly \nsend them into harm's way to begin with. The President seems to think \nwe can't afford to spend on both veterans health and children's health. \nHe seems to think we can't afford to treat the wounds our soldiers \nsuffer and fund cancer research to save civilians from that brutal \nkiller. He seems to think we can't afford to ensure the safety of our \nreturning soldiers and make sure all Americans find safety in the \nworkplace. But he did seem to think we could afford to chase Osama bin \nLaden in Afghanistan--as we should have--and then invade Iraq, even \nthough both situations today are major challenges. He did seem to think \nwe could fight a $2 trillion war in Iraq and give a massive tax cut to \nmillionaires and billionaires, even though the economy hovers near \nrecession and most American families are no better off now than they \nwere at the beginning of this administration. He did seem to think he \ncould sign every bill--every bill--the Republican-controlled Congress \nsent him, running up a debt to the tune of $3 trillion, borrowing money \nfrom foreign countries to pay for a war that makes no sense, ignoring \npressing national priorities, underfunding care for veterans, leaving \nour ports vulnerable, leaving our educational systems underfunded, \nleaving the massive crisis in global climate change completely ignored, \nleaving children in this country without health care--because we have \nwanted to expand the number of uninsured children who have no health \ncare coverage to those who would have health care coverage under our \nbill--leaving 47 million Americans with no health insurance whatsoever, \nand he thought that he could get away with all of it.\n\n  Well, Mr. President, now is the time for us to stand up and say: \nSometimes you can't have it both ways. When it comes to children's \nhealth, when it comes to education and homeland security and veterans \ncare, we had better be getting all the support we need.\n  On Sunday, our Nation devoted a day to those who devoted themselves \nto the Nation for military service. We took that day to celebrate how \nlucky we are--how lucky we are--and how unbelievably blessed we are as \na nation to have such brave men and women rise again and again to offer \ntheir service when they hear the call. I hope we took that day to offer \nnot just words but deeds of thanks.\n  A grateful nation not only goes to a Veterans Day observance or \nmarches in a Memorial Day parade, as we should, but a grateful nation \nshows their gratitude by how we treat veterans in terms of getting them \nthe health care they need, how we treat them in terms of taking care of \ntheir disabilities, and how we take care of the survivors of those who \nhave made the ultimate sacrifice. That is the true measure of a \ngrateful nation.\n  We took that day to remember the duty we have to them because of the \ndevotion they have shown to us. Veterans Day is about a fundamental \nprinciple. When soldiers are shipped off to war, if we can look them in \nthe eye and tell them there is a good reason we are waving goodbye, we \nbetter be able to look them in the eye when they come back and tell \nthem we mean it when we say: Welcome home.\n  With 171,000 troops still in Iraq, I hope America's message on Sunday \nwas: We look forward to the soonest possible year when you will \ncelebrate Veterans Day here with all of us. We welcome you back, and we \nhonor you by how we take care of you in your health care, for those who \nhave disabilities, and how we have taken care of the families of those \nwho have made the ultimate sacrifice. That will be the true measure of \nwhether we are a grateful nation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Menendez). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I am here to speak on the farm bill \nonce again. I have done this before, but I wish to urge my colleagues \nacross the aisle to move on this farm bill. I think it is incredibly \nimportant for my State of Minnesota and for our country that we move \nforward.\n  Minnesota is one of the largest agricultural States in the Nation. As \na member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, where we worked hard to \nreach a bipartisan compromise under the leadership of Chairman Harkin \nand Ranking Member Chambliss, as well as Senator Conrad and Senator \nBaucus--they worked hard on this--I believe we need to move forward. \nThe bipartisan farm bill before us will invest in our farms and our \nrural communities so they will be a strong, growing, and innovative \npart of the 21st Century.\n  I have seen firsthand in my State, where I visited all 87 counties 2 \nyears in a row, what the 2002 farm bill meant for rural America. It \nrevitalized our communities. It gave our farmers the chance to take a \nrisk and expand their production. We are on the cusp of starting to \nmove forward toward energy independence. We are on the cusp of not \ndepending on these oil cartels in the Mideast and instead investing in \nthe farmers and the workers of the Midwest. I do not believe we should \nturn away from that. I believe it is time to move forward.\n  America's farm safety net was created during the Great Depression as \nan essential reform to help support rural communities and protect \nstruggling family farmers from the financial shocks of volatile prices \nand equally volatile weather. Almost 75 years later, the reasons for \nmaintaining that safety net still exist.\n  As I said, the 2002 farm bill spurred rural development by allowing \nfarmers across Minnesota and across this country to expand production. \nBecause of the gains in productivity and the expansion of the last farm \nbill, the 2002 farm bill came in, under a 10-year period, $17 billion \nunder budget.\n  As we continue to debate the 2007 farm bill--and I hope my colleagues \non the other side of the aisle will allow us to debate this farm bill--\nit is important not to underestimate the value of a strong farm bill. \nThat is why, as a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, I support \nthis bill.\n  I do believe, as I know the Presiding Officer does, there should be \nmore reform. I support the Dorgan-Grassley amendment to put some limits \non subsidies. I also believe we should have some limits on \neligibility--I suggest $750,000 for a full-time farmer, $250,000 income \nfor a part-time farmer. I don't think there are the significant limits \nwe need in the current farm bill. But, that said, we are not even going \nto be able to get to talk about those important reforms if we do not \nallow this bill to move forward. I think that is what our leadership is \ntrying to do every day with this farm bill.\n  One of the issues that most interests me about this bill is the \nincreased focus on cellulosic-based ethanol. That is a part our office \nworked on. Actually, the bill we drafted is a part of this bill. The \nidea is to build on our corn-based ethanol and soybean-based biodiesel \nto a new generation of cellulosic ethanol. It is better for the \nenvironment. It puts carbon back in the soil and is higher in energy \ncontent. We are not going to get there unless we have the incentives in \nplace.\n  I know there are people who complain about ethanol, but I tell you I \nthink of it as the computer industry in the 1970s, when the computers \nwere in these huge rooms and they got more and more efficient and \nchanged our country. It is the same with fuel. Right now we are at the \ninfancy of an industry, ethanol and biomass and other kinds of farm-\nbased fuel. We are at the beginning. If we let the oil companies have \ntheir way and tell us it is stopping them from building their \nrefineries and allow them to get in the way\n\n[[Page S14375]]\n\nand not allow us to retail the fuel as we should--there are outrageous \nstories of them not allowing the prices to be posted or the pumps to be \nput in. There are only 1,200 ethanol pumps in this country and 320 of \nthem are in my State, but who is counting. If we are going to move \nforward with biomass and with our own energy, we have to allow this \nindustry to develop.\n  When I talk to farmers across our State, what they like most about \nthe 2002 farm bill is the safety net and the way it worked. It worked \nwell for the first time in a long time. What we did with this farm bill \nwas basically allow that safety net to stay in place and also rebalance \nthe commodity programs to be more equitable for some northern crops \nsuch as wheat, oats, barley, soybeans, and canola.\n  I met with our wheat and barley growers a few hours ago. They are one \nof the many groups that care a lot about this. Again, they revitalized \na lot of the areas of our State that had been troubled because of the \nfact that we have a thriving rural economy.\n  Another top priority for Minnesota farmers was creating a permanent \nprogram for disaster assistance. I thank Senator Baucus and the Finance \nCommittee for their work in this area. Farmers are tired of coming back \nto Congress every year with a tin cup. We have been hit by drought, \nflooding, and everything in between. They had to wait for 3 years for \nCongress to pass the ad hoc disaster relief bill, and the permanent \nprogram of disaster relief will give farmers the security they need in \nmoving forward.\n  I urge my colleagues on the other side of the aisle who are from farm \nStates to think about the importance of this disaster program for their \nStates.\n  The farm bill is not, as we know, just about the commodity programs \nand the safety net. It is also about energy. It is also, as I \nmentioned, about biofuels. I mentioned the cellulosic piece of it that \nis so important. It also includes bipartisan legislation Senator Crapo \nand I introduced to double the mandatory funding for the Biodiesel \nEducation Program. Spreading the word about biodiesel to drivers and \ngas stations is very important if we are going to help that industry. \nAgain, I urge every Senator who wants less dependence on foreign oil to \nlook at the energy portion of this farm bill.\n  One of the things that has plagued our rural communities in the last \ndecade or so is the inability for younger people to get involved in \nfarming. The committee accepted my amendment to improve the Beginning \nFarmer and Rancher Program. There are real opportunities today to start \nout in farming, especially in growing areas such as organic farming and \nenergy production. But beginning farmers also face big obstacles, \nincluding limited access to credit and technical assistance and the \nhigh price of land.\n\n  The Beginning Farmer and Rancher Programs in this farm bill provide \nmentoring and outreach for new farmers and training in business \nplanning and credit building--the skills they need to succeed and to \nstay on the land. If you are concerned because you have seen fewer and \nfewer young people going into farming in your State, I urge you to move \nthis bill forward.\n  As I said, there are a lot of good things for Minnesota and for our \ncountry in this farm bill. There is, however, one area that needs \nreform and that is that we need to stop urban millionaires from \npocketing farm subsidies intended for hard-working farmers. Here are \nthe facts in our State. Minnesota is the sixth largest agricultural-\nproducing State in the Nation and, I would add, as we approach \nThanksgiving, the No. 1 turkey producer in our country. I was able to \njudge a race recently between a Minnesota turkey and a Texas turkey at \nthe King Turkey Days in Worthington, MN, and I would like to report \nthat the Minnesota turkey won the race. The Texas turkey got too cold \nand had to be carried over the finish line.\n  Minnesota, as I said, is the sixth largest agricultural-producing \nState in the Nation. Nationally, 60 farms have collected more than $1 \nmillion each under the 2002 farm bill. None of them are in our State. \nThe average income for Minnesota farms, after expenses, is $54,000, but \nunder the current system, a part-time farmer can have an income as high \nas $2.5 million from outside sources and still qualify for Federal \nbenefits.\n  I very strongly support this farm bill, but I also believe we need \nsome reform in this area because it makes no sense to hand out payments \nto multimillionaires when this money should be targeted to family \nfarmers and conservation and nutrition and other programs under the \nfarm bill. Right now, nearly 600 residents of New York City, 559 \nresidents of Washington, DC, and even 21 residents of Beverly Hills \n90210 received Federal farm checks in the past 3 years. Some collected \nhundreds of thousands of dollars.\n  We have the opportunity to fix this in this farm bill because the \nadministration has not been doing its job in enforcing the rules, so I \nsay let's use this farm bill to do it. Already in this farm bill in \nboth the House and the Senate we have gotten rid of the ``three \nentity'' rule, of which there is much abuse. The House bill does \ncontain some income eligibility limits. I believe it is $1 million for \na full-time farmer, $500,000 for the part-time farmer. We, in this farm \nbill, have an ability to go further, as I suggested, with an amendment \nfor $750,000 for full time and $250,000 part time. The Dorgan-Grassley \namendment, which passed this Chamber in the past, would keep subsidy \nlevels at $250,000. You put that in this farm bill. If we don't have \nthis farm bill, if our colleagues will not allow the Senate to proceed, \nif we are not allowed to make this reform which the administration has \nnot enforced on its own--I believe this is a great opportunity for us.\n  For the reasons I laid out there for the energy title, which is \nforward thinking, for the conservation title, which is more funding and \nmuch more aggressive look at conservation, for the nutrition title, \nwhere we are finally promoting our fruits and vegetables and are doing \nnew things to promote more healthy kids--these are all things that are \ndifferent about this farm bill. If we rest on our laurels and don't do \nanything new, we are not going to be able to move in the direction we \nwant for the energy revolution in this country.\n  When my daughter did a project for sixth grade on biofuels last year, \nshe actually drew a map of the State of Minnesota.\n  She had two little dots that said ``Minneapolis'' and ``St. Paul,'' \nthen she had a big circle that said ``Pine City, the home of farmer Tom \nPeterson.'' That is whom she had talked to about biofuels.\n  I tell you this story because the future for our economy in Minnesota \nand across the country, when you look at energy, the rural part of our \ncountry is going to have a big piece of this. It is necessary for that \ndevelopment.\n  If we do not pass this farm bill, we are not going to get there. I \nurge my colleagues, for that and many other reasons, to move forward \nwith the 2007 farm bill.\n\n\n                 Unanimous-Consent Agreement--H.R. 1429\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 3:30 p.m. today, the \nSenate proceed to the consideration of the conference report to \naccompany H.R. 1429, Head Start Authorization; that it be considered \nunder the following limitations; that there be 60 minutes of debate \nwith respect to the conference report, with the time equally divided \nand controlled between the chair and ranking member of the HELP \nCommittee, or their designees; that upon the use or yielding back of \ntime, the Senate proceed to vote on adoption of the conference report \nwithout further intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

There will be 60 minutes of debate equally \ndivided.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague, the \nSenator from Wyoming, Mr. Enzi, for his strong advocacy and extremely \neffective work on this legislation. I also thank the staff of the HELP \ncommittee for their work on this important piece of legislation. This \nis an important moment in the Senate because this reauthorization of \nHead Start focuses on the most vulnerable members of society, the \nchildren, and it delivers a message of hope for these children and \ntheir families.\n  HELP Committee members are extremely involved and active in all the \nmatters that come before our committee, but never more than on issues \nof education and early childhood development. We have before us \nlegislation that reflects a coming together of both parties and both \nchambers of Congress to address the needs of children in our society. \nReflected in this legislation are the interest of some of those who \naren't with us physically, colleagues who are involved in the \nPresidential campaign. Senator Dodd, who has been a longtime leader in \nthe Senate on children and children's interests, has had important \nsuggestions and recommendations. Barack Obama has followed this process \nvery closely and has been in frequent communication with us. Senator \nClinton has been very much involved in crafting this legislation, as \nwell as a number of other pieces of legislation we approved in the \ncommittee earlier today.\n  We welcome an overwhelming vote this afternoon. There was an \noverwhelmingly bipartisan vote in the House of Representatives, 381 to \n36. I am hopeful we will have a similar expression of support in the \nSenate.\n  We have an hour. I know I have several colleagues who want to talk. I \nwill yield myself 12 minutes. I don't know how much I have used so far.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 3\\1/2\\ minutes. Is that \nanother 12 on top of the 3\\1/2\\?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. No, a total of 12. If the Chair will let me know when I \nhave a minute and a half, I would appreciate that.\n  Planning for Head Start began in the early 1960s, before we knew all \nthat we know today about how to best intervene and support the lives of \nyoung children living in poverty. At that time, as Attorney General, my \nbrother Robert Kennedy decided to tackle the problem of juvenile \ndelinquency. Research pointed to poverty as the root of the Nation's \nsocial and economic challenges. It was agreed that a strategy based on \nearly education could be a significant part of the answer.\n  In August 1964, President Johnson and Congress launched the war on \npoverty by passing the Economic Opportunity Act. The Nation's poor \nnumbered 10 million, with nearly half under the age of 12.\n  In the fall of that year, my brother-in-law, Sargent Shriver, \nconvened a panel of experts in child development, education, public \nhealth, and social work to lay a foundation for the Head Start program. \nHe envisioned a bold national commitment to prepare our neediest \nchildren for kindergarten and first grade. He conferred with experts \nlike Dr. Edward Zigler, who is still a vigorous, forceful advocate for \nchildren, and they agreed that a comprehensive approach was needed. \nPreschool was the centerpiece of the plan, but a major emphasis was \nplaced on health care and parent involvement, too.\n  The following year, Head Start came into being as an 8-week summer \nprogram. With the help of thousands of volunteers, it served 560,000 \nchildren through preschool classes, medical and dental care, and health \nservices. Over the years, it would reach over 24 million.\n  Today the face of poverty and of America's neediest families has \nchanged. The American workplace has changed, and our education system \nis being challenged to keep up with the global economy. Head Start has \nalways adapted, finding new ways to respond to the demands on low-\nincome, working families. But its mission has remained the same--to \nhelp our most vulnerable children succeed in school and in life.\n  When parents are asked what they most want to accomplish in life, \ntheir answer undoubtedly includes a desire to open the doors of \nopportunity for their children. They want a fair chance for their \nchildren to grow up in a healthy and safe environment, to graduate from \nhigh school and go on to college, and to achieve the American dream.\n  That dream should be available to every child in America. But far too \noften, families are still struggling to put food on the table, buy \nclothes for their children, pay the rent, or see a doctor. Poverty is \nagain on the rise. Today, one out of every five children in America \ngrows up poor.\n  Poverty has many dimensions. It is a labor issue, because pay is so \nlow and workers are exploited. It is a civil rights issue, because so \nmany African American and Latino families are often the ones left \nbehind. It is a health care issue, because the health care that \nfamilies in poverty receive is so substandard. Most of all, it is a \nchildren's issue, because the children of the poor have done nothing \nwrong. But they still pay the price.\n  It is our responsibility as a Nation to help those in need. The \nFederal bedrock of that commitment is Head Start. It has always been an \nimportant symbol of our responsibility to others. At its core are the \nvalues that shaped our democracy: Equity, opportunity, community \nempowerment, and economic progress.\n  Head Start is based on the premise that education is the key to the \nfuture and to breaking down the destructive forces of poverty.\n\n  It provides the starting point for a child's day, with a healthy meal \neach morning and a promise to parents that while they are at work and \nbalancing two jobs, their children will see a doctor and dentist, and \nreceive immunizations.\n  It provides children with the building blocks they need to enter \nschool ready to learn. It teaches the social and emotional skills \nneeded by children to pay attention in the classroom and get along well \nwith others. It expands their vocabulary, gets them excited about \nreading, and teaches them to count.\n  It welcomes parents into its programs, gives them opportunities to \nmake decisions about their child's learning and development, and \nsometimes helps families find a roof for over their head.\n  Over the years, with each new educational and developmental advance \nin research, we have learned more about how Head Start can be improved. \nAnd with that learning, modifications have been made to enable the \nprogram to be even more effective.\n  In 1972, the Child Development Associate program was established, to \nprovide a standard of quality for Head Start teachers and aides.\n  In 1974, the reauthorization of Head Start established the \ncomprehensive Program Performance Standards to guide Head Start centers \nin providing essential educational, health, and social services, and \nachieving parental involvement. The reauthorization also paved the way \nfor a network of training and technical assistance activities to help \nHead Start agencies enhance the quality of their programs.\n  In the 1980s and early 1990s, the Indian and Migrant Head Start \nprograms were formed, and family service centers were established to \ncombat illiteracy, substance abuse, and unemployment in Head Start \ncommunities. At that time, Head Start also began its important focus on \nimproving transitions for preschool children to public schools.\n  In 1994, we created Early Head Start to serve low-income infants and \ntoddlers in the first 3 years of their development. That legislation \nalso led to the development of improved performance measures to assess \noutcomes in Head Start and new guidelines for monitoring Head Start \nprograms.\n\n[[Page S14377]]\n\n  The current reauthorization applies the lessons learned from the past \nwith the new knowledge of child development and early education to \nenable Head Start to be even more successful in the years ahead.\n  There is no question that Head Start is effective. Our own federally \nmandated study of Head Start found that it expands children's \nvocabularies, and makes the greatest difference for those with the \ngreatest needs. Head Start improves children's writing skills, and \nhelps children grow in their social skills and behavior.\n  By the time Head Start children complete their kindergarten year, \ntheir skills and developmental abilities are near the national average, \nwith scores of 99 in early literacy, 98 in early writing, 95 in early \nmath, and 95 in vocabulary.\n  We are talking about the most disadvantaged children in America. They \nare often well behind in terms of their ability to enter school ready \nto start. Look at the results at the end of kindergarten. Head Start \nchildren catch up to their peers, to the national norm. It brings the \nchildren up so, hopefully, we will be, as a country and society, more \nequitable, more fair.\n  This reauthorization maintains high standards and comprehensive \nservices in Head Start. It upgrades educational components of the \nprogram, and ensures that it delivers the skills and support that \nchildren need to succeed in kindergarten and the early grades. It \npromotes greater partnerships between Head Start programs and local \nschools, and ensures that services continue to be framed by the highly \neffective Head Start Child Outcomes Framework. It also provides a \nneeded bridge for parents to their local schools, to promote greater \ncoordination and ease the transition of children from preschool to \nkindergarten.\n  We also terminate the flawed National Reporting System, and ensure \nthat new educational standards and measures used in Head Start will be \ninformed by the National Academy of Sciences. Two years ago, the \nGovernment Accountability Office confirmed many of our long-standing \nconcerns with this assessment, concluding that the test is not valid to \nmake determinations about programs and students. The study also \nconfirmed that the test was inconsistent with nationally-recognized \ntesting standards, and unclear in its purpose.\n  This reauthorization ensures that any assessments used in Head Start \nwill be valid and reliable, fair to children from all backgrounds, and \nmeasure the whole child. Head Start children and their families deserve \nnothing less.\n  Head Start teachers and staff are the heart and future of the \nprogram. They help children learn to identify letters and arrange the \npieces of puzzles. They teach them to brush their teeth, wash their \nhands, make friends, and follow rules.\n  This reauthorization sets important and unprecedented goals for \nenhancing the skills and qualifications of Head Start teachers and \nstaff. In this reauthorization, we are striving to help all teachers \nearn their associate's degree over the next 6 years, help half of all \nteachers in Head Start earn their bachelor's degree, and help all \nassistant teachers work toward completing a CDA or another early \neducation credential.\n\n  These are ambitious goals. But we know that learning and development \nof young children require good teachers and that there is a strong link \nbetween educational qualifications and the quality of programs.\n  The quality of a program doesn't just depend on the educational \nbackground of its teachers, which is why we are also calling for \nprofessional development and a career advancement plan for every Head \nStart employee including family service workers, assistant teachers, \nand curriculum coordinators. We have established new partnerships to \nincrease staff in Head Start who are prepared to serve the diverse \nchildren enrolled in the programs.\n  Most of all, we have worked to ensure that Head Start agencies have a \ndedicated stream of funds to provide needed training for teachers. The \nreauthorization dedicates $2 million this year to local training and \nimprovement efforts, much of which will be used to improve and \nstrengthen the Head Start workforce. We commit to confronting the \npersistent challenge of compensating Head Start teachers as the \nprofessionals that they are. Head Start teachers earn half the salary \nof kindergarten teachers, and turnover is about 11 percent per year.\n  This conference report commits 40 percent of new funds in Head Start \nto program quality and teacher salaries, to do more to attract and \nretain caring and committed leaders. It ensures that each Head Start \nCenter will receive an annual cost-of-living increase to keep up with \nthe rising costs of operation and overhead.\n  We grant additional flexibility in this reauthorization for Head \nStart to serve thousands of additional low-income children in need, by \nincluding families just above the Federal poverty level. It is \nessential for Head Start to prioritize its services to the neediest \nfamilies in their communities. But this new flexibility enables those \nliving near poverty and earning less than what they need to get by to \nreceive assistance too. It is the right thing to do, and it is what \nHead Start is all about.\n  The reauthorization also makes a long-overdue commitment to expanding \nHead Start programs in Indian country, and programs for migrant and \nseasonal farmworkers. By reserving up to $20 million annually to expand \nservices in these programs, we can hopefully reach an additional 5,500 \nmigrant children and an additional 5,100 Native American children \nliving in poverty. New provisions are also included to enhance services \nfor homeless children, children who are English language learners, and \nchildren with disabilities in order to ensure that these populations \nreceive the care and attention they deserve.\n  Accountability is a cornerstone of excellence and should start early. \nHead Start should be accountable for its commitment to provide safe and \nhealthy learning environments, to support each child's individual \npattern of development and learning, to build community partnerships in \nservices to children, and to involve parents in their child's growth.\n  This reauthorization makes significant progress in increasing \naccountability and investing in excellence in Head Start. It continues \nthe comprehensive monitoring that has become a hallmark of Head Start, \nand ensures that reviews are fair and balanced in order to account for \nchallenges and strengths in programs. It also establishes a new system \nfor the designation of Head Start grants, to be phased in over the next \nseveral years.\n  We know that the vast majority of Head Start programs provide \noutstanding services--fewer than 20 percent of programs are found to be \ndeficient each year. But where serious deficiencies exist, we must see \nthat substantial problems do not languish at the expense of children. \nIf a local program is unable to meet Head Start's high standards of \nquality, timely action should be taken. This new system will facilitate \naccountability and funding decisions, and do so in a manner that is \ntransparent, fair, and responsive to the local needs of families and \nchildren.\n  We have established greater accountability for enrollment in programs \nand delineated a clear system of governance in Head Start.\n  The reauthorization also takes important steps to expand Early Head \nStart. Since its inception, results have proven that Early Head Start \nis one of the most effective programs of the Department of Health and \nHuman Services. In this legislation, we improve the training and \nassistance network serving Early Head Start and guarantee a dedicated \nexpert in each State to work with programs to meet the needs of infants \nand toddlers. We also expand the screening available to infants exposed \nto trauma, violence, or other circumstances detrimental to their \ndevelopment. We commit to expanding Early Head Start to serve an \nadditional 8,000 low-income infants and toddlers over the next 5 years.\n  As in elementary and secondary education, reform in early childhood \neducation requires resources. Today, half of all children eligible for \nHead Start have no access to it. Early Head Start however, serves only \n3 percent of eligible infants and toddlers--we leave behind a shameful \n97 percent.\n  When Sargent Shriver discussed the war on poverty, he said ``You have \nto put immense resources into winning a\n\n[[Page S14378]]\n\nwar.'' He was right, and he wasn't talking about wars like Iraq. He was \ntalking about the war on poverty. This conference report increases \nauthorizations for Head Start to $7.3 billion in fiscal year 2008, $7.6 \nbillion in fiscal year 2009, and $7.9 billion in fiscal year 2010. On a \nbipartisan basis, the conferees have signaled a commitment to invest \nmore in our youngest children, and to assist Head Start in responding \nto the changing and evolving needs of the communities it serves.\n  Research shows that the first 5 years of life make an immense \ndifference for a child. Those who attend high-quality early education \nprograms are more likely to do well when they reach elementary school, \nare less likely to be held back a grade, and are more likely to \ngraduate from high school and go on to college.\n\n  Our Federal investment in early childhood education clearly pays \noff-- for every dollar invested in high-quality early education, there \nis a 16 dollar return later in life.\n  All children--regardless of their background--deserve to learn and \ndevelop. We need to strengthen early childhood for young children, in \norder to help them succeed later in school and in life.\n  A comprehensive curriculum and a stable and well-qualified workforce \nare cornerstones of a good early education. I am especially pleased \nthat this reauthorization of Head Start includes a blueprint to \nstrengthen the array of early childhood programs and services for young \nchildren.\n  The bill establishes an Early Childhood Advisory Council to examine \nneeds of early childhood programs, develop a plan to improve \nprofessional development, upgrade standards, enhance collaboration \namong programs, and improve data collection.\n  More than 40 States have early learning standards in place or under \ndevelopment. States such as Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Illinois \nhave developed the systems needed to improve program quality and expand \naccess to programs in the early years. We need to build on that \nprogress. States that are ready to take on the challenge of \nimplementing needed improvements in their early education programs will \nqualify for incentive grants to get such improvements under way.\n  One of our highest priorities in Congress is to expand educational \nopportunities for every American. In this age of globalization, every \ncitizen deserves a chance to acquire the skills needed to compete in \nthe modern economy. That challenge begins at birth, and accelerates in \nthe early years of life well before children even begin kindergarten.\n  This reauthorization helps us reach this essential goal. It keeps \nHead Start on its successful path, and enables it to continue to thrive \nand improve.\n  We still haven't won the war on poverty in America. But thanks to \nHead Start, we are getting closer. Day by day, and one child at a time. \nThis conference report continues that indispensable progress, and I \nurge my colleagues to approve it.\n  Mr. President, we have others who desire to speak at this time. I \nwill have a chance with the remaining time, perhaps, to get into some \nof the additional items.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I thank Senator Kennedy for that excellent \nrecap of what has taken us months, in fact, years to get done.\n  I am pleased after many years of false starts, we have finally \nreached agreement on Head Start reauthorization. This conference \nagreement is a bipartisan, bicameral effort that focuses on improving \nthe lives of low-income children and their families. We need to ensure \nthat children, regardless of their circumstances, have the opportunity \nto get the preparation they need to enter school ready to learn and be \nsuccessful.\n  The Head Start Program was established in 1965 as part of the war on \npoverty to level the playing field for low-income children. The purpose \nof the program was, and remains, to provide educational and other \ndevelopmental services to children in very low income families. It \nrecognizes that children do not start school with the same set of \nexperiences or knowledge. Head Start programs provide low-income \nchildren with a solid base of experiences and knowledge that enables \nthem to start their elementary school experience on par with their more \naffluent peers.\n  Since its creation, Head Start has been a comprehensive, early \nchildhood development program that provides educational, health, \nnutritional, social, and other services to low-income, preschool-aged \nchildren and their families. Head Start currently provides services to \nover 900,000 children and their families through a network of over \n1,600 public and private agencies. This program also recognizes the \nimportant role that families play in a child's development and \nencourages their regular participation in the program.\n  I do thank Senator Kennedy and Congressman Miller for their \ncommitment to working together on a bipartisan basis. That commitment \nhas resulted in a conference report that meets the needs of children \nand families who participate in Head Start programs throughout our \nNation. I also thank my other colleagues, particularly Senators \nAlexander and Dodd, and Congressmen McKeon, Kildee, and Castle, for \ntheir fine work and dedication to this important legislation.\n  The conference agreement before us today builds off legislation we \ndeveloped last Congress when I was chairman of the HELP Committee. \nSenator Kennedy agreed to use that legislation as the base for this \nyear's bill to build on the bipartisan support it had received. Senator \nKennedy and I understand that to get anything done, especially in the \nSenate, you have to have bipartisan support.\n  Years ago, I established an ``80-percent rule'' to help guide my work \nin committee and on the Senate floor. It means that 80 percent of what \nCongress works on we agree to. The other 20 percent is the stuff we may \nnever agree on. But that is what always seems to get the attention. I \ndo think we do our best work when we focus on the 80 percent. \nLegislation seems to move more quickly when we work together in a \nbipartisan way.\n  I am pretty certain people in Massachusetts are cringing, and people \nin Wyoming are cringing and saying: Oh, no, Kennedy and Enzi are doing \nit again. But that is the way things get done, and we have quite a \ntrack record of doing things that wind up pretty unanimous on both \nsides of the Capitol because they figure with our two backgrounds it \nhas to be reasonable or we will not agree. That is exactly how it works \nout.\n  So this bill probably will not make headlines, and it is not the most \nsensational sound bite. However, this is work Congress can and must do \nto improve the lives of children and families across America.\n  Today, with the passage of the Head Start conference report, we begin \nto fulfill this obligation. But our work is far from done. This is just \nthe first in a number of education and training bills we have to \ncomplete this Congress.\n  With the reauthorization of the Head Start Act, the first bookend is \nin place. I hope we can continue to work together on legislation to \nreauthorize No Child Left Behind, the Higher Education Act, and the \nWorkforce Investment Act. These four bills represent the continuum of \neducation and workforce training legislation supported by the Federal \nGovernment--with Head Start as one bookend and the Workforce Investment \nAct as the other.\n  These acts support programs from preschool, through elementary and \nhigh school, into postsecondary education and the workforce, and are \ncritical to maintaining our global competitiveness. We cannot afford to \nlet those programs fall victim to election year politics.\n  I am pleased the House Education and Labor Committee has moved \nforward with the markup of the reauthorization of the Higher Education \nAct. It is my hope we can continue this momentum and move into a \nconference on that important legislation in the very near future.\n  Head Start provides the building blocks children need for success \nlater in life. The Improving Head Start for School Readiness Act of \n2007 before us today helps ensure that children in Head Start programs \nwill be better prepared to enter school with the skills necessary to \nsucceed. We have always worked hard to improve and strengthen this act \nbecause we believe in the future success of all children.\n\n[[Page S14379]]\n\n  I am particularly pleased with the accountability provisions in this \nconference report. The conference agreement includes important changes \nrelated to the evaluation and review of grantees. We have taken steps \nto increase the quality of Head Start, and there is now greater clarity \nfor grantees as to what constitutes a program deficiency.\n  The roles of governing body and policy councils have been clarified \nand strengthened, while also preserving the important role of parents. \nIt is absolutely necessary and vital that a single entity, the \ngoverning body, has fiscal and legal control of the Federal grant \ndollars. That said, we maintain the equally vital and necessary role of \nthe policy councils in setting program priorities, classroom \nactivities, and classroom personnel changes. We believe this will help \nensure the continued integrity of the Head Start Program for years to \ncome.\n\n  Parents are their children's first teachers. It is vital we continue \nto encourage and strengthen the role parents play in Head Start \nprograms. This conference agreement increases the presence of parents \nin Head Start programs. It strengthens services for families, and it \nprovides training and development opportunities for parents who serve \non policy councils and governing boards.\n  Today we are taking the final legislative step toward a comprehensive \nand bipartisan reauthorization of the Head Start Program. As we take \nthis step to reauthorize Head Start, it is important we review the \neffectiveness and need for the 57 other early childhood and preschool \nprograms currently receiving Federal support. Many of those programs \nare programs in name only. Others are ineffective and fail to provide \nthe services children need to be ready for school. We have to direct \nfunds to programs that have been shown to be effective at preparing \nchildren for success in elementary school. Head Start is a successful \nprogram that deserves our continued support. This support should not be \ndiluted by competing programs or the creation of new programs.\n  I again wish to thank all the members of both committees, in \nparticular Senators Kennedy, Alexander, Isakson and Dodd, and \nCongressmen Miller, McKeon, Kildee, and Castle, for getting this done.\n  I also thank all of the staff who worked to complete this \nreauthorization. Many of them have been working toward this day since \nearly January. In particular, I would like to thank the following staff \nfor Congressman Miller: Ruth Friedman, Lamont Ivey, Denise Forte, and \nStephanie Moore; for Congressman McKeon: Kirsten Duncan, James \nBergeron, and Susan Ross; for Congressman Kildee: Lloyd Horwich; for \nCongressman Castle: Jessica Gross; for Senator Kennedy: Roberto \nRodriguez, Carmel Martin, and David Johns--I would like to mention how \nwell Senator Kennedy's staff and my staff have been able to work \ntogether on all of the issues--for Senator Isakson: Glee Smith; for \nSenator Alexander: David Cleary and Sarah Rittling; and for Senator \nDodd: Catherine Hildum, and former staffer Sharon Lewis.\n  For my staff, I want to be sure to thank Lindsay Hunsicker, who has \ndone a marvelous job of working and understanding and providing some \ncreativity in the decisions that had to be made to get here; Beth \nBuehlmann, who oversees all of these education issues and is making \nsure they are moving forward in a bipartisan way; and Ilyse Schuman, \nwho is the legal brains behind the drafting and decisions for my team; \nKatherine McGuire, who heads up the team as staff director; and, of \ncourse, Kelly Hastings.\n  Passage of this conference report will ensure that low-income \nchildren are prepared not only for success in school but, most \nimportantly, for later success in life.\n  I look forward to getting this conference report to President Bush \nfor his signature as soon as possible.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my \ntime.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nWashington, Mrs. Murray, who has been particularly involved in making \nsure parents are going to be included in this program. She has been \nsuch an outspoken advocate for the homeless and foster children who so \noften get left out and left behind. She is a former schoolteacher \nherself and member of a school board. She brings extraordinary \nknowledge, experience, and understanding to this problem. We are very \nfortunate to have her on our committee, and the Senate is very \nfortunate to have her as well. I hope they listen to her message.\n  Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Washington.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Washington is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  I am delighted we are here today to talk about one of the most \nimportant things this Congress has done for our children, and that is \nthe Head Start Program.\n  I thank the Senators from Massachusetts and Wyoming for shepherding \nthis important bill to the floor today, where it is in its last final \nstep before it reaches the President for his signature.\n  For over 40 years now, Head Start has helped children from low-income \nfamilies build the confidence and skills they have to have to succeed \nin school. As the Senator from Massachusetts said, I am a former \npreschool teacher, parent, school board member, and U.S. Senator. I can \ntell you, I have seen from every aspect how this important program \nbenefits our children.\n  Today, I am very excited we are taking a vote to renew this important \nprogram. The bill we have in front of us now strengthens Head Start by \nmaking it more efficient, more accommodating, and more sensitive to our \nchildren's social, emotional, and developmental needs. It will allow us \nto better serve millions of children and improve on this already \nsuccessful program.\n\n  This bill will help raise the quality that Senator Kennedy talked \nabout of our Head Start services across the country so that we ensure \nall of our children, no matter where they live, receive high quality, \nconsistent services. Also, it will help ensure that all Head Start \npartners from our early childhood centers to our elementary schools, \nour childcare centers, our health care providers, our family service \ncenters, are all working together in a coordinated way so we can best \nserve our young children and their families.\n  This bill increases funding authorization for Head Start each year \nfrom 2008 to 2010, and that will enable even more of our kids to start \nschool ready to learn than ever before. I hope all of our colleagues \nwill support this important bill, and I urge the President to sign it \nas soon as possible so we can put these new tools to work for our kids.\n  As the, I believe, only former preschool teacher here in the Senate, \nI feel a personal obligation to stand up for all of our young children. \nAnd standing up for our children, particularly our most vulnerable \nchildren, means standing up for Head Start. Each year, nearly a million \npoor children across this country attend our Head Start programs. Those \nkids didn't choose to be poor, but fortunately, since they live in this \nNation, which values our young people, many of them are enrolled in \nHead Start where they can get the tools and the training they need to \nprepare them for school.\n  I thank Senator Kennedy and his staff as well as Ranking Member Enzi \nfor working so hard on this bill.\n  I am particularly proud of the provisions that increase Head Start \naccess for our homeless and for our foster children. This bill will \nhelp improve transportation and services for these children and places \na priority on enrolling them. These are some of our kids who face some \nof the greatest barriers to learning in our society, and I am glad we \nare making their success in school and in life an immediate priority.\n  I also fought to make sure that parents of children enrolled in this \nprogram have a voice in the decisionmaking process on local Head Start \nissues. I think our parents need to be involved in these programs and \nto have responsibility, and I think as their kids get a jump on \nlearning through Head Start, this program will help our parents begin \nto understand that they have a very important and critical role in \nshaping their children's education. So I am very proud we were able to \nwork out that language and move forward in a positive direction.\n\n[[Page S14380]]\n\n  To name a few other quick additions, this reauthorization improves \nthe transition of Head Start children to school by making sure that the \ncurriculum they get matches their State early learning standards and \nkindergarten skills, which is very important. It also reserves 40 \npercent of new Head Start funds to improve programs as well as increase \nsalaries for staffers, and it enables Native-American and migrant Head \nStart programs to expand, which will increase access to early learning \nfor those particularly vulnerable populations.\n  I have visited Head Start centers all across my State. I have talked \nwith teachers, I have talked with the parents, and I have talked with \nadvocates about ways we can improve Head Start. I am very pleased that \na number of their suggestions have been put into this bill. Washington \nState, my home State, is a leader in early learning efforts. I think we \ncan all be proud of this bill, and I hope all of our colleagues will \nsupport it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I yield 7 minutes to the former Secretary of \nEducation.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask the Chair to please let me know \nwhen I have 1 minute remaining.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Chair will so advise.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, it is not too much to say that this \nvote on this piece of legislation on Head Start is about whose century \nthis century will be. Some say it will be China's century. Some say it \nwill be India's century. I think the jury is still out, but I do \nbelieve it can be the American century, and I believe it is up to us to \nmake sure it is.\n  We have the advantages in our country. One of them, of course, is our \nbrain power advantage. We don't have better brains than others, but \nsince World War II, we have spent a great deal of time building our \neducation system, our universities, our research laboratories. We \nworked together this year to pass the America COMPETES Act, authorizing \n$34 billion over the next 3 years to step that up. A second advantage \nwe have is the e pluribus unum. We are one country. Where different \ncountries are fractured, we are working here to help our children and \nour new arrivals learn English, our common language, and to learn our \nAmerican history so we can stay as one country. That is an advantage we \nhave. The third advantage we have is that we are the only country in \nthe world that believes that anything is possible. We don't say leave \njust a few children behind, or 80 percent of us are created equal; we \nset these very high goals. Anything is possible. Most of our politics \nis about failing to reach the goals, dealing with the disappointment, \nand then trying again.\n  How do we make sure that the dream that anything is possible is real? \nWell, No. 1, we keep down taxes and we keep down regulations, and we \nkeep markets free so people can go from the back to the front of the \nline. The other thing we do is to make sure that all Americans have a \nchance to get to the starting line ready. Some people need some help, \nand that is what Head Start is about.\n\n  I was very pleased to come to this floor in the earlier part of this \nyear with Senator Kennedy, Senator Enzi, and Senator Dodd, introducing \na piece of legislation that we hoped would get to the point this one \nhas today. I thank them for the way they have worked on this for the \nlast 3 or 4 years. It didn't matter much whether it was a Republican or \na Democratic Senate; we all worked together and we are here now with \nthis result.\n  A lot has changed, and there are four major advantages to this bill, \nin my opinion. No. 1, I call special attention to the 200 new centers \nof excellence that are created. These are opportunities for Governors \nto look, say, at Nashville or at Boston or at some place in their State \nand designate a center of excellence. These would be shining examples \nof all of the best efforts that are being made for early childhood \neducation. The centers would get up to $200,000 a year for 5 years and \nwould hopefully try to coordinate all early childhood education and \ndevelopment efforts.\n  When I was a child, my mother's preschool class in the garage in our \nbackyard was the only preschool education program in town. In the \n1970s, Tennessee adopted public kindergarten for the first time, a few \nyears after Head Start. Well, today, Head Start is a $7 billion \nprogram. It has 1,700 agencies, 29,000 centers, but that is far from \nall the effort we are making. There are 21 billion Federal dollars for \nearly childhood education, and many State and local dollars. They are \nnot always spent in the most efficient manner. The President thought it \nwould be better to give the Head Start funds to the States. I disagree \nwith that. We have disagreed with that, but we have respected his \nimpulse by saying in these 200 centers for the next 5 years, let's see \nwhat happens. Let's see what happens when States work with local \ngovernments and put all the Federal, State, and local money together \nfor early childhood education in these centers for excellence.\n  Second, there is a system for renewal for Head Start agencies. There \nis not an automatic renewal after this time, and the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services will develop a process for that to make sure \nthat for every cycle, the Head Start agency earns its right to \ncontinue. Third, there is clear authority to governing boards about the \nbig dollars we are spending here and the big lives we are affecting. We \nheard eloquent testimony from the mayor of Shelby County, A.C. Wharton, \nabout money that was stolen down there. So we have done a better job \nlistening to Mayor Wharton and to others in making it clear who is in \ncharge of the money, who is in charge of the administration, and at the \nsame time, making sure that the parents, who are the lifeblood of the \nuniqueness of Head Start, are active and full participants through \npolicy councils.\n  Finally, as the President also recommended, we have worked over the \nlast 2 or 3 years in developing this bill to increase cognitive \nlearning standards. Forty years ago, we didn't know nearly as much \nabout how the brains of very young children work, but we know now that \nto be ready to learn, to be at the starting line when the time comes to \ngo to school, children need to learn more in their earlier years. So \nHead Start will provide that opportunity.\n  It is not too much to say that this bill is about whose century this \nwill be. We hope it will be the century of every child in the world, \nbut we like the idea that it could be the American century, and we want \nto take full advantage of the assets we have. One of the assets we have \nis the dream that anything is possible, that you can go from the back \nof the line to the front. We will keep our markets free. We will try to \nkeep our taxes down. We will get rid of unnecessary regulations so \npeople can get ahead. But this bill is a commitment that says we will \nalso make certain we will do our best to make sure every single child \nhas an opportunity to get to the starting line ready to succeed.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I am proud to rise in support of the \nconference report for the Head Start for School Readiness Act. Since \n1965, Head Start has been one of the most successful Federal programs \nfor helping low-income children and their families. This long overdue \nreauthorization is good news for over a million Americans who rely on \nHead Start's comprehensive services.\n  Head Start is for the poorest children. About 75 percent of Head \nStart families are at or below the poverty level. For a family of four, \nthat is just $20,600 per year. These children are often the furthest \nbehind in learning to read and learning the alphabet. Yet Head Start \nmakes a difference. In 1 year, these students see huge improvements in \ntheir vocabulary, increasing from the 16th percentile to the 32nd \npercentile, which is almost the national norm.\n  But Head Start does so much more. It brings children to the doctor to \nget immunizations and hearing checks. It helps parents get on the right \ntrack. Many parents become Head Start teachers and go back to school to \nget their degrees. It provides nutritious meals for children who might \notherwise go hungry. I am a social worker. I have seen first hand \nchildren whose lives were changed by a simple hearing\n\n[[Page S14381]]\n\naid or a good breakfast. Believe me: it can make all the difference.\n  Head Start is also a smart investment. Research shows that society \naccrues $9 in benefits for every $1 invested in Head Start children. \nHead Start graduates are more likely to have increased earnings and \nemployment than non-Head Start participants. Head Start graduates are \nalso less likely to be dependent on welfare or to have been charged \nwith a crime when compared to their siblings who did not participate in \nthe program.\n  Unfortunately, only 60 percent of eligible preschool children are in \nHead Start, and less than 5 percent of eligible infants and toddlers \nare in Early Head Start. In Maryland, about 25 percent of eligible \nchildren age zero to 5 years are in Head Start and Early Head Start. \nThe Bush administration has underfunded this critical Federal program \nfor the past 7 years. Now is the time to renew the Federal investment \nin Head Start.\n  That is why I am proud to support this bill that makes low-income \nchildren and families a priority in the Federal checkbook. It increases \nthe authorized spending level from $6.9 billion in fiscal year 2007 to \n$7.3 billion in fiscal year 2008. That is nearly a $450 million \nincrease. This increased investment will allow tens of thousands more \nchildren to participate in the program who would be otherwise turned \naway because of inadequate funding.\n  This bill also expands Head Start by increasing the eligibility \nincome level from $20,600 to $26,800. This means that a family of four \nwho are scrimping and saving on an annual income of only $26,800 will \nno longer be denied the comprehensive services Head Start provides.\n  The Head Start for School Readiness Act makes a serious investment in \nour youngest children and their families. The benefits of Head Start to \nthe children, their families and society at large far outweighs the \ncost. I urge my Senate colleagues to vote in favor of this conference \nreport. Our young children deserve nothing less.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I strongly support H.R. 1429, the Improving \nHead Start for School Readiness Act of 2007. This important bipartisan \nlegislation, which I helped craft as a member of the Senate Education \nCommittee and as a conferee, reauthorizes the Head Start Act for the \nfirst time since 1998 and strengthens our commitment to ensuring that \nthe nation's neediest children receive high-quality early education \nsupports and services.\n  Since 1965, Head Start has provided comprehensive early childhood \ndevelopment, educational, health, nutritional, social and other \nservices to low-income preschool children and their families, and this \nreauthorization builds on our long-standing investment in this \nessential initiative.\n  There are two provisions that I am particularly pleased are included \nin this legislation, and which are important to my State of Rhode \nIsland. First, the Improving Head Start for School Readiness Act builds \non provisions I first authored in 2003 to provide Head Start programs \nwith additional flexibility to serve children up to 130 percent of \npoverty. Current law limits program eligibility to 100 percent of \npoverty or below. This increase in income eligibility will enhance the \nopportunity for struggling, low-income families to participate in Head \nStart while ensuring that programs prioritize serving families under \nthe poverty guideline and enhance outreach to ensure those most in need \nare served first. Raising the income eligibility limit finally puts \nHead Start on the same level as other means-tested programs, which \nessentially all serve above the poverty level to provide for greater \nparticipation and help the working poor.\n  Second, this legislation for the first time establishes the Parent \nPolicy Council as a decisionmaking authority within the governing \nstructure of Head Start programs. Strong parent involvement in their \nchildren's early education and development has been a key tenet of the \nHead Start program since its inception in 1965, and is one of the \nprimary reasons for the program's continuing success.\n  This reauthorization also includes a provision I authored to enhance \ncoordination between Head Start programs and school and public \nlibraries to excite children about the world of books, assist in \nliteracy training for Head Start teachers, and support parents and \nother caregivers in literacy efforts.\n  Additionally, I am pleased that this conference report does not \npermit employment discrimination based on religion despite the \nadministration's continuing advocacy for such a change. Faith-based \norganizations are an integral part of Head Start. However, there is no \nneed to change a program that has encouraged their participation by \nallowing such discrimination.\n  I want to thank Chairmen Kennedy, Dodd, and Miller and Ranking \nMembers Enzi, Alexander, and McKeon and their staffs, for their \nextraordinary work on this conference report. The Improving Head Start \nfor School Readiness Act is significant legislation for the people of \nRhode Island and the nation, and I am pleased to support it. This \nstrong reauthorization in tandem with necessary funding increases will \nensure that Head Start can continue its important and critical work to \nlessen the effects of poverty and ensure that children are successfully \nprepared for school and life.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today we approved the Conference Report on \nthe Improving Head Start for School Readiness Act of 2007--H.R. 1429. I \napplaud the good work of all involved. I particularly want to commend \nChairman Kennedy and Senator Enzi, as well as Chairman Miller and \nRepresentative McKeon on the House side for their collective work on \nthis important bill.\n  Head Start is a national program promoting school readiness through \neducational, health, nutritional, and social services. Currently, Head \nStart serves over 900,000 low-income children and their families in \napproximately 1,600 programs run by public and private agencies. As a \nwhole-child, whole-family program, Head Start prepares children for \nwhat we hope will be a lifetime of learning.\n  I want to recognize and commend our Head Start programs in Utah. They \ndo an outstanding job, and I believe this legislation will go a long \nway to providing additional support for them. I have appreciated their \ninput during this long process.\n  I have been struck by some of the stories shared by our Head Start \npeople in Utah. I remember hearing from one of our Head Start Directors \nthat a number of children have never held a book before entering the \nprogram. When they are handed their first book, many don't know how to \nopen it. Entering Head Start swings wide the doors of learning and \nopportunity and exposes young children to the reading and learning \nprocess.\n  I have also heard stories of Head Start children who were suffering \nfrom major medical problems that would not only threaten their ability \nto learn but their very lives. One of the great characteristics of the \nHead Start program includes the identification and treatment of several \nmedical conditions, many problems can be detected and treated before \nthey become serious learning impediments.\n  The Improving Head Start for School Readiness Act of 2007 not only \nreauthorizes the program, it greatly improves and strengthens it. This \nbill will enable more low-income children to get into the Head Start \nprogram. Utah has only been able to serve just over 50 percent of its \neligible children. This bill provides for the expansion of Head Start \nand Early Head Start in States, like Utah, serving fewer than 60 \npercent of eligible children.\n  This bill strengthens the accountability of Head Start programs and \nimproves the overall quality of Head Start grantees, as they will be \nreviewed every 5 years. It clarifies and strengthens the role of the \ngoverning board in the oversight of the program. It also respects the \npriority role of parents and family through the collaborative role of \nthe policy councils and operations of the Head Start programs.\n  Through this legislation, the Head Start workforce is strengthened, \nas goals have been established for education standards for Head Start \nteachers, curriculum specialists, and teacher assistants. It requires \nHead Start teachers to have in-service training every year and ensures \nprofessional development for all Head Start staff working directly with \nchildren.\n  The Improving Head Start for School Readiness Act of 2007 strengthens \ncoordination and collaboration of the program by aligning services with\n\n[[Page S14382]]\n\nState early learning standards, providing professional development \nopportunities for Head Start staff, and promoting partnerships with \nother agencies.\n  Because I believe that education is best done at the local and State \nlevels with appropriate Federal support, I am pleased that under this \nbill, states will designate a State Advisory Council that will closely \naddress the education and care of children from birth to school entry. \nI strongly support the authorization for Centers of Excellence to \ndesignate model exemplary Head Start programs in every State.\n  One of the concerns expressed by many of us as we started this \nprocess years ago, was the challenge of strengthening the academic \nportions of Head Start. Under this bill, Head Start agencies will use \nscientifically based measures to support learning and program \nevaluation. Recommendations of the National Academy of Science study on \nDevelopmental Outcomes and Assessments for Young Children will be \nincorporated. Although the National Reporting System was intended to \nimprove the program, it was found to be time-consuming and unwieldy for \nHead Start programs, and without demonstrated benefits. That reporting \nsystem has been eliminated under this bill.\n  In order to educate every child in our country, we must prepare them. \nMany pre-school children, particularly those who are disadvantaged, \nwould have learning difficulties long before they entered elementary \nschool. This bill will help these young, vulnerable, and teachable \nchildren develop the necessary early reading and math skills to be \nsuccessful in school. It will address their health and nutritional \nneeds, and it will provide important socialization. It also engages and \nempowers parents, and benefits us as a Nation.\n  I was proud to have worked with my colleagues on the Senate Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions Committee to get this bill through the \nlegislative process, and I was pleased to see it pass unanimously \ntoday.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the conference \nreport to accompany the Head Start reauthorization bill. For the first \ntime since 1998, Congress will send a bill to the President to \nreauthorize and strengthen the Head Start program.\n  A child's education begins well before he or she enters a school \nbuilding for the first day of kindergarten. The children who succeed in \nkindergarten are the children whose parents read to them every day, who \ntalk with them, and who engage their minds with games, art, and new \nexperiences. These are the children who enter kindergarten ready to \nlearn.\n  Unfortunately, many children enter kindergarten well behind their \npeers. They may have parents whose long hours interfere with the kind \nof time they spend with their small children. Or they may have parents \nwho don't know how important these early developmental activities are. \nThat is why we created Head Start in 1965, to make sure low-income \nchildren are ready to learn when they arrive in kindergarten. Head \nStart provides preschool-aged, low-income children and their families \nwith school activities, health screening, healthy snacks, and structure \nto encourage parental involvement.\n  Each year, over 900,000 children are served by Head Start nationwide; \n40,000 of those children live in my home State of Illinois. The \nlegislation that we are considering today will increase authorized \nfunding for Head Start to $7.9 billion in fiscal year 2010, allowing \ntens of thousands more children to participate in the program.\n  The legislation will also expand eligibility, allowing Head Start to \nserve low-income children and families up to 130 percent of Federal \npoverty, or $26,800 for a family of four. It will also expand the Early \nHead Start program, so it can reach an additional 8,000 low-income \ninfants and toddlers. The earlier children enroll in Head Start \nprograms, the more likely they are to succeed once they enter \nkindergarten.\n  The legislation also sets new minimum qualification standards for \nHead Start teachers. Within 6 years, all Head Start teachers must have \nan associate's degree, and half of all teachers must have a bachelor's \ndegree. Forty percent of new funding will be reserved for program \nquality enhancements, including much-needed salary increases for Head \nStart staff.\n  Educational standards will be strengthened in Head Start programs to \nmake sure children are presented with language and literacy, math, \nscience, and other cognitive development material. These new standards \nwill be updated and aligned with the latest research in child \ndevelopment. The legislation we are considering today will improve the \ntransition for children who are leaving Head Start to enter \nkindergarten, through better coordination between Head Start programs \nand schools, shared teacher training, and alignment of curriculum.\n  I am especially pleased that this legislation strengthens Head Start \nwithout weakening its long-standing civil rights protections for more \nthan 200,000 Head Start teachers and 1.3 million parent volunteers.\n  Since 1972, the law has prohibited agencies that receive government \nfunding for Head Start from employment discrimination on the basis of \nrace, creed, color, national origin, sex, political affiliation, or \nbeliefs. These civil rights protections have been reaffirmed all six \ntimes that the Head Start program has been reauthorized since then, and \nI strongly support the seventh reaffirmation today.\n  Preserving this provision is especially important given this \nadministration's attempts to overturn long-standing principles of \nnondiscrimination through Executive orders, proposed legislation, and, \nrecently, Department of Justice opinions.\n  Let me be clear. I support the right of religious organizations to \nuse religious criteria in hiring people to carry out their religious \nwork. This exception--which is the current law--makes sense because it \nallows people of common faith to work together to further their \nreligion's mission.\n  However, there is a fundamental difference between religious \norganizations using their own funds for their religious work and \nreligious organizations using government funds for that purpose. In \n1972, Congress established the current, expanded religious exception \nunder title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The same Congress \nestablished the nondiscrimination provisions in Head Start that \ncontinue with today's legislation. They understood the difference \nbetween permitting hiring based on religion for religious functions not \nfunded by the government, and allowing discrimination based on religion \nin hiring people to carry out activities funded by the Federal \nGovernment.\n  I also want to address a memo released last month by the Department \nof Justice entitled ``Effect of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act \non Faith-Based Applicants for Grants.'' This troubling memo concludes \nthat the Religious Freedom Restoration Act allows faith-based \norganizations to receive Federal funds even when considering religion \nin employment. It further asserts that RFRA ``protects this right to \nprefer co-religionists for employees even if the statute that \nauthorizes the funding program generally forbids consideration of \nreligion in employment decisions by grantees.''\n  I strongly disagree with these conclusions in general, and especially \nwith respect to the legislation before us today. The law and the \nhistory regarding Head Start is clear with respect to nondiscrimination \nin employment, and this explicit civil rights protection must be \nfollowed.\n  In closing, I want to affirm my strong support for the participation \nof religious organizations in the Head Start program. These \norganizations provide critical support for our Nation's children in 5 \npercent of Head Start centers and greatly improve our pre-schoolers' \neducation. It is not surprising that Head Start is the second-largest \nsource of federal funding for faith-based organizations.\n  This program truly is a model for how the government can successfully \npartner with faith-based organizations, while complying with \nnondiscrimination requirements.\n  I thank Senators Kennedy and Enzi for their bipartisan work on this \nimportant legislation, and I urge my colleagues to support this \nconference report.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as I understand, we have 9 minutes left. \nAm I correct?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is correct.\n\n[[Page S14383]]\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from Ohio and 3 minutes \nto the Senator from Vermont, and I will take the last 3 minutes, and we \nwill alternate with our Republican colleagues.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Ohio is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I thank Chairman Kennedy and Ranking Member \nEnzi for their leadership, as well as the staff, for their tireless \nwork on the Head Start reauthorization bill. It is long overdue. It \nwill help prepare thousands of low-income children for their transition \ninto school and for their success later in life.\n  There is no greater investment, of course, that we can make than \ninvesting in our children. This legislation means an additional 8,000 \nlow-income infants and toddlers younger than those who have \ntraditionally been enrolled in Head Start will be eligible for the \nprogram. Teachers will receive more training, the critical training \nthey need and the cost-of-living increases that they deserve. This \nlegislation means expansion of the program to children whose families \nearn just above the poverty line. For tens of thousands of children in \nthis country, this legislation gives them hope. It is a step forward, a \nmajor step forward.\n  Yesterday, unfortunately, the President vetoed the funding for Head \nStart. That is why we take a step forward today with this Head Start \nreauthorization, as the President took a step backward in vetoing the \nfunding for Head Start. Budgets, we know, are about priorities. Whether \nit is a family budget, it speaks to your values; whether it is a \nFederal budget, it speaks to our values. Vetoing funding for Head \nStart, for medical research, and for job training as the President did \nyesterday, tells us something about his priorities.\n  I am pleased that on a bipartisan basis, by passing legislation that \nexpands Head Start to reach more low-income children, this Senate is \nsaying our priorities are different. I hope that together we can \noverride the President's veto and fulfill the promise inherent in the \nHead Start Program.\n  I thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for their good work \non this Head Start reauthorization. We should move forward.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Almost 14 minutes.\n  Mr. ENZI. I yield 7 minutes to the Senator from Georgia, who has \nalways played a tremendous role in this piece of work with his staff \nperson Glee Smith, and he brings with him a world of knowledge from \nGeorgia where he served as the chief school official there. They set \nsome precedent-setting things at all levels of education while he was \ndoing that, and he did it in conjunction with former Senator Zell \nMiller, who was Governor at that time. I yield 7 minutes to the Senator \nfrom Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I wish to thank Ranking Member Enzi for \nhis kind remarks and his tremendous dedication and commitment to \nbringing this conference report to the floor. I particularly want to \nthank Senator Kennedy from Massachusetts, who is a consummate \nlegislator by anybody's definition and a very committed individual in \nthe development of our youth and the betterment of education.\n  As Senator Enzi said, about a decade ago I served as chairman of the \nState Board of Education in the administration of my predecessor in \nthis seat who was then Governor Zell Miller. Those were the years that \nthe breakthrough brain research came forward and illustrated \nconclusively that there is a direct correlation between early childhood \ndevelopment and the potential development of a person as an adult. We \nworked very hard together in Georgia to improve the plight of all \nGeorgians and did everything we could to develop new programs. One of \nthem that we developed was none other than the 4-year-old \nprekindergarten program which now is available to every child in \nGeorgia. It is a program that builds on the fact that the earlier you \ncan begin instruction, the earlier you can improve the environment and \nthe atmosphere in which a child is exposed, the better that child is \ngoing to do.\n  It is critical for us, if we want to turn around the trend in terms \nof dropouts in this country, to see to it that we enhance and enrich \nthe lives of every single student who is going to go to our public \nschools.\n  Mr. President, it is conclusive that the environment in which a child \nlives in their early years--that to which they are exposed, their \nnutrition, the total environment--is directly a correlation to their \nability to learn. The Head Start Program is designed to get to those \nchildren most in need for quality support, for uplift, for a greater \nself-esteem, and for a leg up, a chance to get to go to a 4-year-old \nprekindergarten program or to a kindergarten program ready to learn.\n  USA Today ran an article about a week ago talking about America's \ndropout factories, and it enumerated schools in almost every State, \nwith dropout rates of 40, 50, 60 percent. If you looked at the facts \naround those articles and those schools, you would find a common \ndenominator: Those schools' children came from the least of \nbackgrounds, with the least support, and from the poorest of \nenvironments. We have an obligation to ourselves and, as Senator \nAlexander said, America's future to see to it that every American child \narrives at kindergarten or first grade ready to learn. The advancement \nof programs such as Head Start will make that happen.\n  I commend Senators Alexander, Enzi, and Kennedy, Congressmen Miller \nand McKeon, and all those who worked on this important legislation. I \nurge every Member to cast a favorable vote in favor of a better \natmosphere for our young children to grow up in, better exposure to \nthose things that help them go to school ready to learn, and turn \naround the paradigm on dropouts in the United States.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Vermont is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I wish to add my voice to the others and \nthank Senator Kennedy and Senator Enzi for their leadership on this \nissue and for the cooperative, bipartisan relationship we see on that \ncommittee, which makes it perhaps the most productive committee in the \nSenate.\n  As others have said, this is a very important day forward for the \nchildren of our country. Right now, I am thinking about the Head Start \nworkers in Vermont who do such an extraordinary job in reaching out and \nproviding for low-income kids throughout our State, and I know the same \nis true throughout this country. They are dedicated people, they are \nunderpaid and overworked, but they do it for the love of the children. \nI very much appreciate all they are doing.\n  Mr. President, while this is, in fact, an important day forward, it \nis significant to point out again that this is an authorization bill, \nnot an appropriations bill. We had the disappointment just the other \nday of the President vetoing the Labor-HHS bill, which includes Head \nStart. My hope is that in the very near future we are going to have a \nstrong Labor bill, with adequate funding for Head Start, but more \nsignificantly--and this is an issue I will talk about until the cows \ncome home--we have to change our national priorities with regard to how \nwe treat the children of this country.\n  Every Member of Congress, every American should be deeply ashamed and \nembarrassed that in this great country, we have, by far, the highest \nrate of childhood poverty in the industrialized world. The figures are \nthat between 18 and 20 percent of our children live in poverty. As \nother speakers have pointed out, if children at an early age don't get \nthe intellectual and emotional nourishment they need, they are not \ngoing to do well in life. It is not an accident that at the same time \nwe have the highest rate of childhood poverty, we also have the highest \nrate of incarceration of any major nation on Earth. So we don't take \nadequate care of our children, and, lo and behold, we are shocked when \nthey end up behind bars, and we spend $50,000 to $70,000 for each \nperson who is incarcerated. It makes a lot more sense to me--and I hope \nmy colleagues agree--that we put that money up front to make sure all \nof our kids get the opportunities they are entitled to as young \nAmericans.\n  The truth is that while this bill is a significant step forward--and \nI applaud all those who built it--as Senator Kennedy indicated earlier, \nonly one-half of\n\n[[Page S14384]]\n\nthe eligible children in America today, because of inadequate funding, \nare able to get into the Head Start Program. So this is an important \nstep forward. I congratulate all who have made this day possible. We \nhave a long way to go to, in fact, keep the faith with the children of \nAmerica.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from New \nHampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Wyoming and the \nSenator from Massachusetts. I rise to express my appreciation for their \nexcellent work on this legislation. It has been a long time in \ngestation. I think it reflects their commitment to legislating in a \nbipartisan and effective way that the bill is now at this stage. I \ncongratulate them.\n  I think anybody who has been exposed to Head Start is impressed by \nthe program. There have been studies and reports of that which can be \ndone to improve the program, and hopefully this bill will work in that \ndirection. But the underlying idea of giving low-income kids the \nability to come into an atmosphere where they get nurturing, good \nnutrition, and now, because of this bill, where they get starting \nblocks for learning how to deal with an academic program is totally \nappropriate and something that has succeeded.\n  If you look at what we are facing as a nation, as discussed here at \nconsiderable length--I heard the Senator from Tennessee make an \nexcellent statement on the needs of education, and what our country \nreally needs is the ability to bring into the educational mainstream \nchildren who today, unfortunately, are not able or do not come to \nschool with the necessary skills to compete with some of their fellow \nstudents. Head Start gives those children that opportunity. It gives \nlow-income kids the ability to start kindergarten and get into the \nfirst grade with an understanding of how, first, to be social and deal \nwith an atmosphere where there are other children; secondly, to have \nthe necessary nutrition to get through the day and be able to learn; \nand third, begin the building blocks of learning. This program works, \nand it has worked. It is something that should be continued to be \nsupported by the Federal Government and also by the local communities \nthat stand behind Head Start.\n  That is one of the great things about Head Start. In my experience, \nwhen you go to a local Head Start center in New Hampshire--or \nanywhere--as chairman of the committee, I visited Head Start centers \nall across the country. They are usually community-oriented events. \nBehind those teachers and committed people, who are willing to spend \nthe day with the children and try to make their lives better during the \nday, there are usually a lot of volunteers and people from the \ncommunity stepping up to also make those programs work well.\n  So Head Start is one of the success stories and one of the things we \nneed as one of the building blocks in order to continue to make America \na great place to live and give people the ability to participate in the \nAmerican dream.\n  Again, I thank the Senators for orchestrating this effort.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time? The Senator from \nWyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, it has been a pleasure and an honor to get \nto work on this bill and to work with people on both sides of the \naisle. You can see the unanimity from the Republican side and the \nDemocratic side in making sure the bill came to pass.\n  As I mentioned before, we have had a lot of false starts trying to \nget Head Start done. This time, we have gotten through the process. \nToday, we will have a positive vote and send it to the President for \nsignature. I think you can tell from the debate that it has been a very \npositive process.\n  The only distinction appears to be the few comments we have had about \nthe Labor-HHS appropriations bill. I don't want to get into that issue \nbecause it will take a long time to discuss it. I ask unanimous consent \nto have the Wall Street Journal article from today called ``Return to \nSpender'' printed in the Record to counter some of the things talked \nabout. It wasn't Head Start that he vetoed; it was the entire Labor-HHS \nbudget.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                           Return To Spender\n\n       Congressional Democrats spent the fall preparing for their \n     budget confrontation with the White House, and the strategy \n     they seem to have settled on is futility. They knew President \n     Bush would veto their first appropriations bill, as he did \n     yesterday, and they also knew they'd lack the votes for an \n     override. If they're wondering why the bottom's fallen out of \n     their approval ratings, here it is.\n       Mr. Bush said the bill exceeds ``reasonable and responsible \n     levels for discretionary spending,'' and he was being too \n     kind. Ostensibly the $606 billion ``minibus''--combining \n     funding for the Departments of Labor, Health and Human \n     Services, and Education--is ``only'' $12.2 billion beyond the \n     President's budget request for discretionary spending. But \n     that's more than half of the $22 billion that Democrats want \n     to spend for 2008 above the Administration's top line. (That \n     $22 billion, by the way, swells to at least $205 billion in \n     additional outlays over five years.)\n       Democrats are already feigning outrage. House \n     Appropriations kingpin David Obey complained, ``There has \n     been virtually no criticism of its contents,'' and if he's \n     only referring to Congress, he's not far off. The bill marks \n     a return to Capitol Hill's earmarks-as-usual spending \n     culture, assuming it ever abated. There are more than 2,200 \n     earmarks worth some $1 billion.\n       The pork includes $1.5 million for the AFL-CIO Working for \n     America Institute and $2.2 million for the AFL-CIO \n     Appalachian Council. There's $500,000 for a ``virtual \n     herbarium'' in New York and $50,000 for a Utah ``ice \n     center.'' Also check off $1 million for the Clinton School of \n     Public Service in Little Rock, and another $1 million for the \n     Thomas Daschle Center for Public Service and Representative \n     Democracy at South Dakota State University. Plus the usual \n     assorted millions for art centers, aquariums, aviation and \n     jazz museums, and so forth.\n       The Members also reverted to habit by using a House-Senate \n     conference to ``airdrop'' $155 million in earmarks that were \n     not included in earlier editions--in violation of the 2006 \n     ethics ``reform.'' The conference also clandestinely removed \n     a provision barring federal funding for the ``hippies \n     museum'' near Woodstock. All of this from Democrats who rode \n     into the majority promising to restore ``fiscal discipline.''\n       Mr. Obey was especially instructive in a speech immediately \n     before the final House vote: ``I would ask every serious-\n     minded person in this body, if they really think there is a \n     chance of a snowball in Hades that Members' earmarks on \n     either side of the aisle will survive if we wind up at the \n     President's level of funding.'' He concluded: ``The fate of \n     every project . . . is in your hands.''\n       The Democrats were desperate for a veto-proof majority, and \n     for the sake of their earmarks some Republicans were content \n     to go along. The pork, of course, was cover for much larger \n     domestic spending excesses, including a $2.4 billion budget \n     gimmick for'' advance appropriations'' designed to circumvent \n     Democratic ``pay as you go'' budget rules. Thankfully, enough \n     GOP Members realized it, and maybe a few even hoped to \n     recover their credibility on spending.\n       Since there aren't enough votes to override Mr. Bush, it's \n     back to the drawing board. Maybe next time Democrats should \n     try something new--say, spending less money.\n\n  Mr. ENZI. I hope the vote today will display the unanimity we have \nhad while working on this bill. I congratulate the Senator from \nMassachusetts for the way he is running the committee. We have not just \ndone hearings on things--hearings are a little more divisive than the \nother mechanism, which has been his morning coffees. In hearings, the \ntwo sides bring people to testify, and we kind of beat up on each \nother's witnesses. In the coffees he has held, we get to bring in a \nbunch of people and hear what they think. We have the interaction of \none person who has had experience, and he talks to another person who \nhas had experience, and they talk about how the two experiences might \ncome together. That has been helpful on this bill, as well as the other \nones, the bookends I mentioned. This being the first part of the \nbookend, and the next one we will be working on is No Child Left \nBehind.\n  We have already done the Higher Education Act on this side. I look \nforward to conferencing that and getting on to the Workforce Investment \nAct, which passed this body twice already but never has been \nconferenced. Our work is still cut out for us, but this is a day to \ncelebrate the good work done on both sides of the aisle.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Massachusetts is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague from \nWyoming. He believes we ought to listen to experts before we actually \nlegislate, which was a rather dramatic\n\n[[Page S14385]]\n\nthought to many around here. He certainly is right. He reminds us of \nour unfinished business in terms of higher education and the workforce \nlegislation. We are strongly committed, and we will get a response on \nthat.\n\n\n             Unanimous-Consent Agreement--H. Con. Res. 258\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that upon the \nadoption of the conference report to accompany H.R. 1429, the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of H. Con. Res. 258, a correcting \nresolution; that the concurrent resolution be agreed to and the motion \nto reconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection? Without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Finally, I would take a few moments to mention the staff \nwho worked on this bill. I want to personally mention those who have \nworked so hard on this legislation. Some have been working on this for \n4 years. I will not get into the reasons for that. This has been a very \nlong and, in the past, contentious piece of legislation and without \nthem, there is no way we could have completed this bill.\n  I would like to thank Michael Myers, Carmel Martin, Roberto \nRodriguez, David Johns, Lily Clark, Liz Maher, and Raquel Alvarenga \nfrom my staff.\n  I would like to thank Katherine Graham Hildum of Senator Dodd's \nstaff; Janelle Krishnamoorthy of Senator Harkin's staff; Mildred Otero \nof Senator Clinton's staff; Michael Yudin of Senator Bingaman's staff; \nRobin Juliano of Senator Mikulski's staff; Seth Gerson of Senator \nReed's staff; Kathryn Young of Senator Murray's staff; Will Jawando of \nSenator Brown's staff; Huck Gutman of Senator Sanders' staff; and Steve \nRobinson of Senator Obama's staff.\n  This has been a bipartisan process all the way. I would also like to \nthank Senator Enzi's wonderful staff, specifically Katherine McGuire, \nBeth Buehlmann, Lindsay Hunsicker, and Adam Briddell.\n  I would also like to thank David Cleary and Sarah Rittling of Senator \nAlexander's staff; Celia Sims of Senator Burr's staff; Juliann Andreen \nof Senator Hatch's staff; Allison Dembeck of Senator Gregg's staff; \nElizabeth Floyd of Senator Coburn's staff; Karen McCarthy of Senator \nMurkowski's staff; Suzanne Singleterry of Senator Allard's staff; Glee \nSmith of Senator Isakson's staff; and Alison Anway of Senator Roberts' \nstaff.\n  It is important to mention the work done by our colleagues in the \nHouse and I would like to thank Ruth Freidman of Congressman Miller's \nstaff; James Bergeron, Kristen Duncan and Susan Ross of Congressman \nMcKeon's staff; Lloyd Horwich of Congressman Kildee's staff and Jessica \nGross of Congressman Castle's staff for all of their work on this \nlegislation.\n  I would like to thank especially Roberto Rodriguez and David Johns \nwho have taken the lead on Head Start in my office. Their good work has \nmade all the difference. I know Roberto is especially pleased to see \nthe Senate and House pass this conference report, as he has worked on \nthis legislation for several years now. I commend him for his \nexpertise, diligence, good nature and all of his efforts.\n  Mr. President, finally, the Head Start Program reaches the neediest \nchildren in this country. It reaches them to help and assist by \nproviding health care, teaching proper nutrition, and by supporting \nproper development of cognitive abilities to ensure that children are \nready to successfully transition to school.\n  Head Start is targeted to the neediest children in this country. Even \nwith the small numbers we reach--we only reach a million, and there are \n4 million poor children who are between ages 0 and 5--we see the \ndifference it makes. Head Start raises them to a level playing ground. \nThat is what our country is really about--trying to raise people to a \nlevel playing ground. Head Start alone does not guarantee success, but \nit gives them the opportunity to be successful.\n  If we have a group in our society that needs this kind of support, it \nis our children. As pointed out in this debate, through no fault of \ntheir own many children are born into difficult and challenging \ncircumstances. As a nation we have a responsibility to get them up to a \npoint where they can succeed in school and in life. That is what Head \nStart is about--a recognition that our Nation believes that children \nwho are living in poverty, in some of the most challenging \ncircumstances, should have the opportunity to be on a level playing \nfield.\n  Finally, there is one thing we have learned in the area of education; \nthat is, the more resources are targeted to early education, the better \nthe opportunities these children have to succeed.\n  In this reauthorization we have taken advantage of the lessons we \nhave learned from Head Start's successful history and built upon \nexcellent recommendations made by members of our committee. This is a \nvery solid and important piece of legislation that will make a \ndifference in the lives of millions of children. I urge the Senate to \nsupport it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following three \nletters in support of the Head Start reauthorization conference report \nbe printed in the Congressional Record following my remarks on the \nconference report.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                              National Head Start Association,\n\n                                Alexandria, VA, November 13, 2007.\n     Hon. Edward Kennedy,\n     Chairman, Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor & \n         Pension, Washington, DC\n       Dear Chairman Kennedy: On behalf of the National Head Start \n     Association, the children, parents, staff and teachers of \n     Head Start and Early Head Start programs, and the Board of \n     Directors, I would like to take this opportunity to \n     congratulate you, the members of the Senate Committee on \n     Health, Education, Labor and Pension for supporting the \n     reauthorization of Head Start--truly a bipartisan effort and \n     success story for America's premier preschool program, Head \n     Start.\n       As the national association representing the Head Start \n     community, we represent more than 1 million children and \n     their families, 200,000 staff, and 2,700 Head Start programs. \n     With the assistance of over 1 million volunteers, these \n     programs comprehensively meet the early childhood \n     development, educational, health and family needs of our \n     children.\n       Head Start as you very well know, was established in 1965 \n     as part of President Lyndon Baines Johnson's ``Great \n     Society'' program, and is the most successful, longest \n     running, national school readiness program in the United \n     States. Head Start has served over 25 million preschool-age \n     children, infants, toddlers, and pregnant women since its \n     inception. Your successful reauthorization of Head Start \n     signals the continued legacy for future low-income children \n     and families.\n       The Head Start reauthorization bill is a lesson in \n     bipartisan cooperation and leadership in addressing a \n     critical priority need of our country--the preschool \n     readiness of our children. In short, the ``Improving Head \n     Start Act'' addresses income eligibility, where the working \n     poor are supported and provided incentives to work; \n     terminates the National Reporting System; helps more programs \n     operate full-day and year round; reaffirms the accreditation \n     of teachers in early childhood; provides expansion for \n     Migrant and Seasonal Head Start and American Indian/Alaskan \n     Native populations; and underscores the importance of \n     parental involvement in the education of their children.\n       Therefore, I call upon our longtime friends and supporters \n     in the U.S. Congress to approve overwhelmingly the \n     ``Improving Head Start Act of 2007'' and send it to the \n     President for his signature.\n       Again, congratulations on your success and that of our \n     children and families.\n           With great gratitude,\n                                                     Sarah Greene,\n     President and CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                      Fight Crime:\n\n\n                                               Invest in Kids,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 14, 2007.\n       Dear Senators Kennedy, Enzi, Dodd and Alexander: The over \n     3,500 police chiefs, sheriffs, prosecutors and violence \n     survivors of Fight Crime: Invest in Kids know from the front \n     lines--and the research--that investments in Head Start are \n     critical to our nation's public safety. Head Start helps kids \n     get a good start in life so that they avoid later criminality \n     and grow up to become responsible citizens. But the maximum \n     crime reduction impacts--and many other benefits of Head \n     Start--can only occur when programs reach more of the at-risk \n     kids and are comprehensive and of the highest quality.\n       We are pleased that the final conference report version of \n     the Improving Head Start Act of 2007 (H.R. 1429) includes the \n     following:\n       Funding authorization: We are pleased the bill includes \n     increased funding authorizations in Fiscal Years (FY) 2008-\n     2010, with ``such sums'' funding levels for FY11-FY12. A $750 \n     million increase in FY08--beyond the FY07 level--is needed to \n     simply restore funding to the FY02 service level. And that \n     level would only serve a small portion of the eligible, poor \n     kids now left out of Head Start. These increases are an \n     important first step in the right direction.\n       Teacher qualifications: We are pleased the bill includes a \n     quality improvement requirement that 50% of classroom lead \n     teachers\n\n[[Page S14386]]\n\n     have at least a bachelor's degree by 2013. The requirement is \n     crucial to Head Start program quality, since no peer-\n     reviewed, scientific research study has found an early care \n     and education program that demonstrated significant, long-\n     term crime reduction and education results without a \n     bachelor's degree teacher requirement.\n       Quality improvement set-aside: We are pleased the bill \n     directs 40% of annual increases over the prior year's funding \n     level to quality improvement, with half of those funds \n     directed toward improved teacher compensation rates. Improved \n     teacher compensation is critical to attracting and retaining \n     better-educated individuals--who would otherwise flock to \n     higher-paying opportunities, including K-12 schools.\n       Targeting to serve the poorest children: We are pleased the \n     bill maintains Head Start's priority for serving the poorest, \n     most at-risk children by ensuring that children living in \n     poverty are served first as income eligibility is expanded to \n     130% of the Federal Poverty Level.\n       Early head start: We are pleased that bill adds flexibility \n     for Head Start programs to serve zero-to-three-year-olds if \n     they meet the Early Head Start quality standards. In \n     addition, we are pleased that the bill directs half of new \n     expansion funding toward Early Head Start enrollment \n     increases.\n       The bill also includes several provisions that will \n     continue to strengthen Head Start's quality:\n       No state block grants, state waivers, or state application \n     authority that might have endangered current quality \n     standards;\n       Training/technical assistance activities (including through \n     a 2.5%-3% set-aside);\n       Strengthened research-based school readiness elements of \n     Head Start (of course, it is critical to maintain and \n     strengthen all eight of the domains of Head Start's outcomes \n     framework);\n       Strengthened parent education and home visiting provisions;\n       A requirement that Head Start agencies utilize high-\n     quality, research-based developmental screening tools to \n     identify children with early emotional and behavioral \n     problems, so kids can receive the treatment they need to \n     prevent later delinquency;\n       Improvements in fiscal and program accountability among \n     grantees, including improved monitoring and termination of \n     grantees that are significantly and/or systemically \n     deficient;\n       Enhanced outreach to at-risk kids;\n       Enhanced collaboration and coordination efforts \n     requirements between local Head Start grantees and other \n     early education providers though collaboration grants;\n       Increased state-level coordination through State Advisory \n     Councils on Early Childhood Education and Care;\n       The development of an integrated data collection system to \n     provide complete information about children served by the \n     programs and the services offered; and\n       Suspension of the National Reporting System, and provisions \n     for any future assessment approaches to be based on the \n     results the National Academy of Sciences study regarding \n     appropriate, comprehensive and scientifically valid and \n     reliable child assessments.\n       We appreciate the efforts of the Health, Education, Labor \n     and Pensions Committee and the Education and Labor Committee \n     to strengthen Head Start through this reauthorization \n     legislation. This bill will benefit at-risk kids now and help \n     ensure safer communities in the years to come. The result \n     will be generations of disadvantaged children progressing \n     toward school success and graduation rather than later arrest \n     and incarceration.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    David S. Kass,\n                                                        President.\n                                                 Miriam A. Rollin,\n     Vice President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n          Community Action Agencies Welcome Head Start Renewal\n\n       Washington (Nov. 14, 2007).--The nation's Community Action \n     Agencies applaud the work of Senate and House conferees on \n     Head Start reauthorization and look forward to passage of \n     this national child development legislation later this week.\n       Community Action Agencies (CAAs) administer 30 percent of \n     Head Start grants and a third of all enrollments nationwide. \n     Children and families participating in programs offered by \n     CAAs also benefit from the comprehensive services offered by \n     these organizations to help them secure housing, gain \n     employment, and build assets to help them achieve economic \n     security.\n       ``Low-wage working families who turn to Community Action \n     Agencies to prepare their children for school with Head Start \n     leave with a variety of resources to help them improve the \n     lives of the entire family,'' said National Community Action \n     Foundation Executive Director David Bradley.\n       The conference agreement expands access for more eligible \n     children, increases classroom quality, enhances the Head \n     Start workforce, strengthens governance and provides more \n     tools for greater accountability.\n       ``It is commendable that this Congress has focused so much \n     of its agenda on domestic issues that are important to \n     American voters, and, in this instance, has been able to do \n     so with strong bipartisan cooperation to assist low-wage \n     working families,'' Bradley said.\n       ``Once these important enhancements are adopted for the \n     Head Start program, we hope that Congress will next turn its \n     attention to the remaining Human Services initiatives: the \n     Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) and the \n     Community Services Block Grant,'' he said. ``These programs \n     make key investments in the daily lives of low-wage working \n     American families, and are long overdue for reauthorization. \n     NCAF hopes its proposals to strengthen and modernize these \n     programs will be considered soon.''\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY.

Mr. President, I rise to applaud the Senate \npassage of the Head Start Improvement for School Readiness Act of \n2007--a product of hard work by my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle.\n  For more than 40 years, Head Start has provided comprehensive \nservices to poor families--health, nutrition, academic skills, family \nliteracy, and more--ensuring children get the cognitive, social-\nemotional, and academic skills they need to succeed in kindergarten and \nlater in life. In New York, almost 50,000 families benefit from Head \nStart services.\n  This bill takes several steps forward in strengthening Head Start \nprograms across the country. It dramatically expands Early Head Start--\na program created under the Clinton administration to reach children \nfrom birth to age 3. Though we have decades of research underscoring \nthe importance of this stage of development, Early Head Start has only \nbeen able to reach 3 percent of eligible infants and toddlers. This \nconference report doubles Early Head Start funding from 10 percent to \n20 percent to ensure more infants and toddlers receive services and \narrive at kindergarten ready to learn.\n  The conference report increases Head Start authorization by 6 percent \nin the first year and 4 percent in the following 2 years. For years, \nour Head Start providers have had to make difficult decisions in the \nface of President Bush's budgets that have included flat-funding or \nfunding cuts, as well as the effects of inflation. Many centers had to \ncut back on comprehensive services that Head Start families rely on. In\n\n[[Page S14387]]\n\nNew York, programs have been forced to eliminate vital transportation \nservices. This much needed increase in funding will finally give Head \nStart agencies the resources they need to maintain enrollment, improve \nquality service levels, and provide for the necessary cost of living \nincrease for teachers.\n  The Head Start Improvement for School Readiness Act of 2007 enhances \nteacher quality. Research has shown that the right teaching training \nand successful instruction lead to successful Head Start programs. \nRight now, about a third of Head Start teachers hold a bachelor's \ndegree. This bill will help increase the skills and training of more \nHead Start teachers and increase the quality of instruction for Head \nStart children. I am also pleased this conference report retains the \nimportant roles parents have always maintained in Head Start programs, \nincluding ensuring parents' voices are heard in Head Start's daily \noperations.\n  The bill also increases a portion of the income eligibility \nguidelines from the current 100 percent of poverty level to children in \nfamilies with income up to 130 percent of poverty. This is particularly \nimportant for States like New York, where the cost of living is higher \nthan most States'. Many programs need flexibility in serving these \nfamilies earning just slightly above the poverty line, including the \nability to assist families who have moved off welfare and are now \nworking and struggling to make ends meet. For New York City, this \nprovision means thousands more children will be able to participate in \nHead Start programs. This bill will give those hard working families \nsupport as they become self sustainable.\n  This bill also terminates use of the National Reporting System, NRS. \nI have expressed my concern about this test for several years now. In \n2003, I joined my colleague Senator Bingaman in offering an amendment \nduring the markup of Head Start to suspend NRS. In 2005, the Government \nAccountability Office produced a report underscoring our concerns when \nit called into question the validity and reliability of the NRS. I am \npleased this bill suspends the unfair NRS test and asks the National \nAcademy of Sciences to make recommendations on an appropriate \nassessment for young children.\n  Head Start is critical to ensuring our most vulnerable children enter \nschool ready to learn. Head Start has provided comprehensive services \nto low-income families--from health and nutrition, to academic skills \nand family literacy. I am pleased that we were able to move this bill \nforward in this session in a bipartisan fashion. The Senate passage of \nthis bill is a victory for our neediest children and the Head Start \ncommunity that serves them.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I move to reconsider the vote and to lay that motion on \nthe table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, H. Con. \nRes. 258 is adopted, and a motion to reconsider that vote is considered \nmade and laid on the table.\n  The resolution (H. Con. Res. 258) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Salazar).

Mr. President, I indicated this morning that sometime \ntoday, unless something changed, I would file a cloture motion on the \nDorgan-Grassley amendment and, as I have indicated, on the bill, which \nI have just done. I had a long conversation with the distinguished \nSenator from North Dakota. Very few people know the farm bill as well \nas he does. Certainly his partner in this amendment, Senator Grassley--\nno one can dispute his knowledge of the farm bill.\n  It is the feeling of Senator Dorgan, after having conferred with \nSenator Grassley, that it would not be in the interests of the Senate, \nthe farm community, and the country to go forward on cloture on that \namendment at this time. I have followed their suggestion and that is \nwhy I did not go forward with this.\n  Unless something is worked out, it appears very clear--we have heard \nthe debate all day on the farm bill. Tremendously difficult, hard work \nhas gone on. The bill was reported out of the Agriculture Committee. \nEvery Senator there voted for it. There was not a recorded ``no'' vote, \nbut that only says part of the story. The rest of the story is numerous \nSenators worked for weeks and weeks to arrive at a point where a bill \ncould come out of that committee. It came out here to the floor. It \ncame out last week and we have tried to move forward on it. That we \nhave been unable to do that was unfortunate.\n  I hope Senators, when they are called upon to vote cloture on this \nmatter, would understand that the work of the committee was very good \nwork. Does that mean there should not be amendments to improve it? \nProbably not. But if we did nothing more than pass the bill that came \nout of that committee and took it to conference with the House-passed \nbill, we would be way ahead of the game. I hope that is what Senators \nwill understand.\n  I am confident virtually every Democratic Senator will vote for \ncloture on the farm bill, even though there are many Democratic \nSenators whose No. 1 industry in the State is not agriculture. But they \nrecognize that agriculture is an important business for this country. \nIt is an important business for this country for so many reasons, one \nof which is the farming and ranching industry in this country is \nexemplary. We are able to compete with the rest of the world, without \nany question. We have modern techniques that have gone into farming \nthat have made our production extraordinary.\n  We now have, as represented by Senator Tester from Montana--one \nexample--we have now a thriving business in America of organic farming. \nThere are many people in this Senate who, when they go shopping, will \nonly buy organic produce. That is part of this bill. Part of this bill \nrecognizes that. It is very unfortunate that we have been stopped from \ngoing forward on this bill because people want to vote on immigration \nmatters, they want to vote on tax matters, they want to vote on issues \nthat are not related. I went over that entire list this morning, of all \nthe nonrelevant, totally nongermane amendments that have been given to \nus.\n\n[[Page S14388]]\n\n  I have said we Democrats will agree to five amendments. Five \namendments; that is all we want. We don't expect the same from the \nRepublicans. If they want more amendments--fine, give them to us. I \nsaid to Saxby Chambliss and to Trent Lott, we will even take a look at \nsome of the nonrelevant amendments. If you want to meet the standard \nthat has been in the last three farm bills and come up with one \namendment--that is what has been the average--but come up with some \nnonrelevant amendments that people believe they have to offer, we will \nbe happy to consider that. But let's agree to a finite number of \namendments. We will take a few. The Republicans have more than we have.\n\n  This is something we want to do. We want to do the farm bill. As I \nhave said before on the Senate floor, the farm bill is not the most \nimportant bill for the State of Nevada. When I go shopping at Smith's \nor one of the other grocery stores in Las Vegas, I am impressed with \nall that I find on those shelves: food produced in America. There is no \nquestion we import some food. I always look at the labels. We get some \nmangoes from other places and a few things, but we in America do well. \nEven though I am from Nevada--and I am very proud of the white onions \nwe grow. The largest white onion producer is in Nevada, in Lyon County. \nI am happy about the garlic we grow and I am happy about the alfalfa we \ngrow, but the driving force is tourism and gold. We produce 85 percent \nof all the gold that is produced in America.\n  But I think I represent the Democratic caucus. We are not all pushing \nforward on this farm bill because it is the most important thing in our \nState, directly. But indirectly, it is one of the most important things \nthis body can do.\n  There can be all the statements made about: he will not take down the \ntree, and we never did do this before, and the last bill we had 240 \namendments, the one before we had 196 or whatever it is. Of course \nthere are a lot of amendments filed on bills, but we don't deal with \nthat many of them. We have been stopped for 10 days from dealing with \nthese amendments.\n  I reach out to my Republican colleagues and I say this with all \nsincerity: You want to bring down this bill? That is what you are \ndoing. Yes, maybe we can take it up some other time, and I will \ncertainly try to do that, but I think the time is slowly evaporating \nhere. We need to get this bill done. We could still complete the bill \nbefore we leave here. If we couldn't complete the bill before we leave \nhere for Thanksgiving, we certainly could get it teed up so we could \nfinish in a day or so when we get back.\n  I hope above all hope, with the hard work that has gone into this \nbill on a bipartisan basis--this is not a Democratic bill by any \nstretch of the imagination; this is a bipartisan farm bill--I hope \nsomehow we can work our way out of this.\n  I stand willing to do whatever I can, to be as reasonable as I can \nbe. I am sure I have Senators on my side of the aisle over here who are \nnot happy with the proposal I have made--five amendments. But I have \ndone that because I believe it is that important to get the bill done.\n  This is a bill where there will be a conference. We have had bills \nthat passed here and passed the House and we have not had a conference. \nThis is a bill that will be conferenced.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Will the majority leader yield?\n  Mr. REID. I will be happy to yield to my friend from Kentucky for a \nquestion.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I believe I heard my good friend say what we needed to \ndo was get a list of amendments and a starting place. I remind my good \nfriend from Nevada, the majority leader, we were prepared to do that \nyesterday. We are prepared to do that now, if we could enter into an \nagreement to have a finite list of amendments, which I offered to do \nyesterday. That would at least define the universe, and at whatever \npoint we get back to beginning to make progress on the bill, it would \nbe a good starting place.\n  I was pleased to hear the majority leader indicate that is what we \nneed to do and I say to him I am happy to do that.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, as you can see, looking at our list, \nour list of amendments is mostly amendments saying, ``If you offer one, \nI am going to offer one.'' I don't have the list before me. Well over \nhalf of the amendments we have are ``relevant''--just relevant \namendments. In the vernacular, that means I have an amendment but \nprobably not. That is to protect them in case they want to offer an \namendment.\n  I plead to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle--yes, you \nhave given us a list. But give us a real list. I have made a proposal I \nthink is very reasonable. We will take five relevant amendments. You \ngive us a number of amendments that you have, relevant and nonrelevant, \nand let's see if we can work something out. I talked with the \ndistinguished manager of the bill and he said to me: I have no \nauthority to do anything. So talking to my friend from Georgia, for \nlack of a better description, is a waste of my time. He says he has no \nauthority to do anything. What kind of negotiation is that?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Will the majority leader yield?\n  Mr. REID. Of course.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Would the majority leader agree with me that it would \nbe at least desirable to prevent there being a further proliferation of \namendments? It strikes me the longer we are out here, the more the \namendments would multiply. Why would it not be a good idea to enter \ninto a consent agreement now to limit the universe of amendments, as I \nwas prepared to do yesterday, at least to give us a first step toward \npreventing the multiplicity of amendments that have a way of coming out \nof the woodwork around here, so at whatever point we go back to the \nfarm bill we have at least defined the universe? That is the way we \nalmost always start on a bill of that magnitude. It is the way we \nstarted on past farm bills. At the end we, of course, will pass a farm \nbill. We have in the past and we will this year.\n  I ask my friend from Nevada, what would be wrong with locking in the \nmaster, the universe--the list that we both produced yesterday? I was \nhappy to enter into a consent agreement to limit the amendments to that \n24 hours ago.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, there is no question, if you have to \nwalk a mile, a few steps is better than nothing. Here is what I would \nbe willing to do on behalf of the Democratic caucus. OK, we have your \nlist, they have our list. We have two lists. I would have no problem \nentering into an agreement that that is a finite list. How we complete \nall those amendments is a different question. I am not going to take \ndown the tree at this stage. I am happy to work on that at a subsequent \ntime, to see what we can do in that regard, but I am willing to do \nthat.\n  We have their amendments and our amendments. I agree to a unanimous \nconsent proposal that that is the finite list of amendments and that we \nwill try to figure out a way to move through that. Maybe, as I have \nindicated, each mile has to be done in short steps. This would be a \nshort step. I would be willing to do that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, obviously we prefer the tree be taken \ndown so we didn't have one Senator, in effect, dictating to the rest of \nthe Senate what amendments get to be considered. But it does strike me \nthat at least that is a place to start. Both sides are familiar with \nthe list that was produced yesterday. I wish to ask unanimous consent \nthat that list be adopted as the list that could be--we all know the \nvast majority of these amendments are never offered and will not be \noffered on this one.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I would say to my friend and friends on the \nother side of the aisle, we will continue to work. We have now a \ntentative arrangement, starting arrangement. This is not the end, we \nknow that. But we will figure out a way that people can offer \namendments.\n  I will be happy to consider--I do not like language like this, but \nthat is what we use around here, ``take down the tree.'' That kind of \nturns into a buzzword for--it is kind of like ``earmarks'' or something \nlike it is real bad.\n  So I would be happy, at this stage, to accept the proposal that these \ntwo lists the staff has, these be the entire universe of the amendments \nthat we will work on, on this bill. We will come back at a subsequent \ntime to figure out\n\n[[Page S14389]]\n\na way to take down the tree and work our way through these.\n  I think it is fair. I would say this to my friend, that these \namendments would be subject to relevant second-degree amendments. I \naccept that.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Reserving the right to object, obviously I am not \ngoing to, I wish to make sure we do not have any misunderstanding. This \nis a little, small step forward. This does not mean we will invoke \ncloture on either the bill or the substitute.\n  But it does indicate there is an interest, on this side of the aisle \nand on the other side of the aisle, in preventing the further kind of \nproliferation of amendments that will go on a virtually daily basis \nuntil we define the universe.\n  At whatever point we go back to the bill and seriously try to go \nforward with it, we can have further discussions about some further \nlimitation of amendments. We are certainly, in order to agree to any \nfurther limitation of amendments, going to want the tree to be unfilled \nso we can have a more free-flowing debate on this bill, as we have had \nin the past.\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to work with my esteemed colleague, the minority \nleader, to see how we can work our way through this procedure. We have \ntaken a short step, but it is at least a very important step.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I want to make sure I got the nod of Senator McConnell's \nimportant staff person. The agreement says there will be unanimous \nconsent that there be only relevant second-degree amendments.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Reserving the right to object, I shall not object to a \nbaby step, but let me try to understand exactly what we have.\n  I looked at the list that is before us. My name is not on that list. \nI assume that the Dorgan-Grassley amendment is now pending. And if the \ntree is taken--\n  Mr. REID. You are protected.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I wish to make sure there is protection for that \namendment. I also would like, if I might for a moment, to say that the \ncloture motion you have filed does not alter or change the opportunity \nfor Senator Grassley and myself? The point that you had made was I did \nnot want a vote on the Dorgan-Grassley amendment to be a cloture vote \nbecause there may be some who feel they have to vote with their \nleadership on a cloture, in a manner that would be different than if we \nhad it straight up and down on the merits. It will still be pending, \nand we will intend to pursue that amendment.\n  The list of amendments is as follows:\n\n       Akaka--Amdt.

Mr. President, I wish to announce there will be no further \nvotes on this today.\n  Unless someone has something else, I yield to my friend from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I wanted to speak on the farm bill. I \nam glad to see we are taking baby steps forward. If the leaders have \ntheir things worked out, I want to go ahead and speak.\n  The farm bill obviously for my State is a very important issue. I \nappreciate that we are making some steps forward. I do think it would \nbe wiser if we could start amending and start working as a legislative \nbody and see how far we get. We have been on the bill now for 10 days. \nWe have not had a vote. It seems it would be prudent to go ahead and \ntry it. I realize the leaders are trying to work something out,\n\n[[Page S14390]]\n\nand I hope they can. But each day we do not get something moving, we \nare not moving forward on the farm bill.\n  I think we can trust each other in the process. I do want to \nrecognize the work that has been done by the committee on the farm \nbill, the Agriculture Committee and their work. I think they have done \na number of very nice things in the bill. I say that as someone from an \nagricultural State, from an agricultural family, who has been Secretary \nof Agriculture for the State of Kansas and has a degree in agriculture.\n  I can see some very positive things. I like the overall trend in \ncertain areas of the bill and some of it not. I wish to comment on both \nof those and make one particular policy provision notice to my \ncolleagues and friends in the Senate.\n  The Senate farm bill creates the Average Crop Revenue Program, a new \nsafety net for farmers to utilize if they choose to do so. That is key \nfor me, giving farmers the choice in how they manage their risk and not \nrequiring that they take and use this program. Farmers may choose to \nstay in the current system or may opt into the new ACR Program. I think \nthat flexibility is a good way to go forward.\n  Despite several threats throughout the year, the farm bill leaves \ndirect payments at their current level. I think that is a victory and \nthat is good for farmers in farm country. Direct payments are the only \ncommodity title program that provides direct assistance to producers \nwhen they have no crop to harvest. Unfortunately, that happens all too \noften in my State.\n  It has happened in places of my State this year. In fact, 2 weeks \nago, I was in a field of soybeans tilling them up. There was not enough \nthere to harvest. It happens. There is nothing a farmer can do about it \nif the weather breaks that poorly against him.\n  So I am pleased to see those direct payments continue to exist, \nbecause when you have no crop, it does not matter how much the price \nis, it doesn't work, you have nothing to sell.\n  I also particularly appreciate the expanded research for energy \ncoming from agriculture. To me, this has been one of the Holy Grails in \nagriculture for years and years, to expand the definition of the \nbusiness from food and fiber, to food, fiber, and fuels. This effort \nrecognizes our need to grow more of our own fuel to help in the \nenvironment in doing that, to help in the economy, the rural economy in \ndoing that. It recognizes this fabulous chance we have in a world today \nto do things along that line.\n  If I could take a moment to set a root off to the side or shoot it \noff to the side, on this particular energy provision, I think there is \nanother way we can also go that the managers have put in the base bill; \nthat is, replacing oil-based products with starch-based products. This \nis again something the agricultural industry has worked at for a long \ntime, is doing a much better job of, but we still do not have many of \nthe products on the marketplace.\n  For instance, I had a company from my State, Midwest Grain Products, \nin my office 2 weeks ago with now 100 percent starch-based plastic \nutensils. He gave me some spoons and chopsticks that were made 100 \npercent out of wheat starch. They had been going 50 percent out of \nstarch and 50 percent out of oil-based products. But he is now at 100 \npercent.\n  Yet they have not been able to crack through the marketplace yet on \nthis, a totally biodegradable product made out of agricultural \ncommodities, better for the environment, certainly better for our \neconomy.\n  One of the things we have put in this farm bill is a New Uses Expo, \nwhere we would showcase on an annual basis, almost like you do at an \nauto show, the computer shows, on an annual basis, the new widgets \ncoming out of agriculture, replacing, in many times and places, oil-\nbased products with agricultural-based products, but showcasing that, \nhaving the Secretary of Agriculture and indeed even the Secretary of \nEnergy cohosting that event. I think that is something that can help us \nexpand the marketplace and expand value added coming out of \nagriculture, which is key for rural communities in my State and many \nothers.\n  There are problems in the bill. That is why I hoped we could get some \namendments moving. First, the bill contains a ban on packers owning \nlivestock. This is a very contentious issue in my State and many places \naround the country.\n  Under this packer ban provision, processers would be prohibited from \nowning, feeding or controlling livestock more than 14 days before \nslaughter. You can look at this, and as someone raised in a farm \nfamily, I look at this and say: Well, that sounds like a pretty good \nthing. I do not want packers owning livestock. I want the family farm, \nI want my dad and my brother to be owning that livestock rather than \nthe packers.\n  But then you start looking at the marketplace and the changes taking \nplace in the marketplace and say: Wait. This is going to disrupt some \ngood things happening. Ten days ago, I was on a ranch, a feed yard in \nLyons, KS. They are raising certified Angus beef, natural, no \nartificial hormones, no antibiotics in the livestock, and then direct \nmarketing that to consumers on the east coast, a great innovative \nproduct they have got coming out. They are getting a premium then for \nfarmers when they can market this product that way.\n  But to do it, they had to enter into a contractual agreement with the \npackers that are set to process the animal and to deliver it to the end \nconsumer, to the stores that they are going to directly to the \nconsumers with.\n  So with this packer prohibition ban, this innovative market technique \nthat is getting more in the pocketbooks of my farmers, because they are \nworking with the packers, going straight to the consumer with a product \nthey want, certified Angus beef, that is all natural, you are going to \nbreak that supply chain.\n  They are not going to be able to work with the packer on a \ncontractual arrangement to do this. They are saying: Look, this is \ngoing to hurt us. We are not going to be able to do this. Now your ban \nthat you are doing to try to save family farmers is going to hurt \nfamily farmers. So this is kind of the law of unintended consequences, \nthat something people are trying to do on a positive basis to help \nfamily farmers is, in the end, going to hurt many of them in being able \nto increase the income they get from their livestock.\n  That is what they need. They need to be able to get more income from \ntheir livestock, and here is a key marketing tool and a way to be able \nto do that. I would hope that would be something we could deal with and \nsomething we can get passed.\n  Overall, I do not want to take a lot of time of my colleagues, other \nthan to recognize the importance of getting this bill through. I would \nurge them on the Democratic side to let us start doing some amendments \nand working this bill through. I think we have a good base bill to work \nfrom. I think we can make some sensible decisions around here and get a \nfarm bill through that is important to my State, important to the \ncountry, important to the future of the industry, and important to \nsecurity in the United States on energy security.\n  But to do that, we need to get the process going. I would urge my \ncolleagues to allow that to move on forward.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I want to express my support for the tribal \nforestry provisions in title VIII of S. 2302, the Food and Energy \nSecurity Act of 2007, also referred to as the 2007 farm bill. These \ntribal provisions make important and needed improvements in the U.S. \nForest Service by authorizing direct tribal governmental participation \nin State and private forestry conservation and support activities, and \nby providing the Secretary with flexible authority to enhance and \nfacilitate tribal relations with the Forest Service and activities on \nNational Forest System lands. The Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition \nand Forestry is to be commended for its bipartisan development and \nadoption of these provisions.\n  There are nine federally recognized tribes within my home State of \nOregon, and it is my pleasure to serve on the Committee on Indian \nAffairs. Indian tribal governments are separate sovereigns that have a \nunique government-to-government relationship with the United States. \nThat relationship embraces special duties to tribes that extend \nthroughout the Federal Government, including the Department of \nAgriculture and the U.S. Forest Service.\n\n[[Page S14391]]\n\n  Within the Forest Service, State and private forestry programs \nauthorized by the Cooperative Forestry Assistance Act are intended to \nconserve and strengthen America's non-Federal forest resources across \nthe landscape. However, the Cooperative Forestry Assistance Act of 1978 \ndoes not authorize direct support to tribal governments, and the Forest \nService has found that tribal forest land participation is inconsistent \nand low. The new authorities in title VIII will help rectify these \nmatters by establishing a more appropriate and equitable relationship \nbetween tribal government and the Forest Service. In so doing, it will \nalso enable State and private forestry to better meet its mission among \nall stakeholders across the landscape.\n  The tribal provisions in title VIII authorize direct tribal \ngovernmental participation in a new Community Forest and Open Space \nConservation program and in the established forest legacy conservation \neasement program. The title also authorizes Forest Service support \ndirectly to tribal governments for consultation and coordination, for \nconservation activities, and for technical assistance for tribal forest \nresources.\n  Additional tribal provisions in title VIII facilitate the Forest \nService's interaction with tribal governments on National Forest System \nlands. In Oregon, all nine of the tribes in the State have deep \nhistorical ties and active current interests in the National Forests \naround the State. From time immemorial, the tribes have drawn physical \nand spiritual sustenance from what are today Oregon's national forests, \nand they continue those activities to this day. Of course, the modern \nconduct of those activities involves both the tribes and the Forest \nService, and the Senate's farm bill provides the Secretary and the \nForest Service new authorities that will enable these two stewards of \nour forests--one ancient and one contemporary--to work in closer \ncooperation. The bill gives clear authority for the reburial of tribal \nremains and cultural items on National Forest System land, and it \nallows free tribal access to forest products from the national forests \nfor cultural and traditional purposes. It also allows the Secretary to \ntemporarily close National Forest System land for the tribal conduct of \ncultural and traditional activities.

Madam President, the United States today faces a broad set \nof national security challenges, so many of them, but just to name a \nfew: initiating a responsible redeployment of U.S. combat troops out of \nIraq, preventing the Taliban from making a comeback in Afghanistan, \naddressing the current turmoil in Pakistan, responding to \nantidemocratic trends in Russia.\n  Our whole country has a full plate of national security challenges. \nSo today I wish to speak about one of those, but I think it is at the \ntop of the list, and I think it is an issue that has not received \nnearly enough attention in the Senate or in the other body. It is a \nlonger term threat that has not received the attention it deserves, but \nI believe this issue is the single greatest peril to this great Nation, \nand that is the prospect that a terrorist group, possibly with the \nactive support of a nation state, will detonate an improvised nuclear \nweapon in an American city.\n  I commend those who have displayed outstanding leadership on this \nissue, many of these individuals over several years, if not, in some \ncases, decades. Former Senator Nunn, of course, has been a leader on \nthis issue; Senator Lugar, a colleague of ours and the ranking member \nof the Foreign Relations Committee, a committee on which I have the \nhonor to serve; and, of course, the chairman of that committee, Senator \nJoe Biden. All of these individuals and others have worked on this \nissue for many years.\n  In the weeks following 9/11, a lot of Americans know our intelligence \ncommunity picked up a very frightening report from an agent. It was \nrumored that al-Qaida had acquired a Soviet-era nuclear weapon and had \nmanaged to smuggle it into New York City. The response of our \nGovernment, although secret at the time, was swift. Teams of experts \nwere deployed across New York City with state-of-the-art detection \nequipment in an effort to track down this bomb before it exploded.\n  The threat was ultimately discounted. There was no nuclear weapon \ninside the United States at that time. The intelligence community's \nagent had bad information. But what is so frightening about these \nevents is that it is entirely plausible that al-Qaida could have \nsmuggled a nuclear weapon into our Nation.\n  One can only imagine the retrospective questions that would have \nfollowed such a horrific attack. What could our Federal Government have \ndone to prevent such a detonation, we would ask. What policies or \nprograms did we fail to prioritize? And, thirdly, how could we not have \nappreciated the urgency and the magnitude of the threat of nuclear \nterrorism?\n  I hope we never have to ask and answer those questions. But here we \nare 6 years later and neither the United States nor any other nation \nhas been forced to confront the aftermath of a terrorist attack \ninvolving a nuclear weapon. Yet I regret to say we cannot rely upon \ngood luck continuing indefinitely. The threat of nuclear terrorism \npersists, and the United States and the international community are \nfailing to move quickly enough to neutralize this threat.\n  Why am I so concerned about nuclear terrorism and the challenges that \nit poses, not just for the world of today but for the world of our \nchildren and the world of our grandchildren? Some may ask that, and in \nresponse I just will cite a couple examples as to why I and everyone in \nthis body should be concerned.\n  No. 1, last year a Russian citizen was arrested in Georgia on charges \nof seeking to smuggle 100 grams of highly enriched uranium on the local \nblack market in that country, with the promise made that he could \ndeliver another 2 to 3 kilograms of highly enriched uranium at a later \ntime.\n  This arrest on smuggling charges is only one of hundreds involving \nfissile material that have emerged since the breakup of the Soviet \nUnion in 1991. The good news is the quantities detected so far have \nbeen very small. The bad news is, just as with drug trafficking, those \ntransactions come to our attention only after a fraction of what may \nactually be occurring.\n  No. 2, too many facilities across the globe do not yet have the \nsecurity safeguards we should demand for stockpiles of fissile \nmaterial. Today, as many as 40 nations--40 nations--possess the key \nmaterials and components required to assemble a nuclear weapon. \nSurprisingly, we don't fully understand the magnitude of this problem. \nAmong other experts, Dr. Matthew Bunn, a leading expert on nuclear \nterrorism, reports that neither the United States nor the International \nAtomic Energy Agency--we know from the news as IAEA--has a \ncomprehensive prioritized list assessing which facilities around the \nworld pose the most serious risk of nuclear theft.\n  Finally, the third example I would cite in terms of why this is such \nan important issue and important question is, a columnist by the name \nof David Ignatius, with the Washington Post, reported last month that a \nsenior Energy Department intelligence official had briefed the \nPresident and other administration officials that al-Qaida is engaged \nin a long-term mission--a long-term mission--to acquire a nuclear \nweapon to use against the United\n\n[[Page S14392]]\n\nStates. According to this report by a senior Energy Department \nofficial, al-Qaida may have held off against further attacks against \nour Nation since 9/11 to focus on attaining a nuclear weapon.\n  Madam President, I do have good news in this area. It is a serious \ntopic, but there is some good news to report, although it also presents \na challenge to us. The good news is, we know exactly what needs to be \ndone to address the threat of nuclear terrorism. And a terrorist group \nas sophisticated as al-Qaida cannot build a nuclear weapon from \nscratch. The production of nuclear weapons and the fissile material \nthat gives these nuclear weapons their deadly explosive power remains a \ncapacity limited to a national government. A terrorist group can \nacquire a nuclear weapon through several means: It can purchase or \nsteal a completed warhead from a state, or it can acquire the weapons-\ngrade plutonium or enriched uranium at the core of a nuclear warhead to \ndevise an improvised nuclear device.\n  Thus, if the United States works in concert with other nations to \n``lock down'' nuclear warheads and weapons grade materials around the \nworld, we can prevent terrorists from accessing this material in the \nfirst place. We are making some progress on this front through programs \nsuch as the Nunn-Lugar effort--named after Senators Nunn and Lugar. \nThis effort to dismantle nuclear weapons and secure excess nuclear \nmaterials is playing out, but we are not moving fast enough. Additional \nfunding is required but, perhaps even more important, high-level \nattention at the level of Presidents and Prime Ministers is necessary \nto break through the bureaucratic obstacles and political inertia \nblocking more rapid security gains.\n  After 9/11, the President should have made nuclear terrorism a key \ninternational priority, raising it to the very top of the U.S.-Russian \nagenda, for example. Instead, this administration continued a business-\nas-usual approach. I believe this was a gross misjudgment. This issue \ncries out for Presidential leadership.\n  But as vital as cooperative threat reduction programs are, we must go \nabove and beyond them if we are to be successful in deterring a nuclear \nattack or nuclear terrorism. Not only should we do everything we can to \nprevent terrorist groups from acquiring the means to detonate a nuclear \nweapon, we must also fortify our capability to deter their use. A \nterrorist group such as al-Qaida is undeterred, but states, and \ncertainly the states from which al-Qaida would acquire or steal a \nnuclear weapon, are not undeterred. We should make sure we keep \npressure on them. We must enhance our ability to threaten overwhelming \nretribution against any state that by inattention or lax security \nenables a terrorist group to detonate a nuclear warhead in the United \nStates.\n  We can do this in a number of ways: First, we must elevate the cost \nfor individuals and businesses that choose to facilitate illicit \nsmuggling of fissile material and related nuclear components. Nuclear \nsmugglers and nuclear smuggling networks rely upon middlemen to \ntransport fissile material and nuclear components, to forge export \nlicenses and Customs slips, and engage in other black market \nactivities. Too often in the past, when such individuals and businesses \nare caught in the act, so to speak, or with their hands dirty, they \nreceive minimal prison sentences. For example, the Russian citizen \narrested in Georgia for nuclear smuggling was sentenced to only 8 years \nin prison. These lax criminal penalties cannot deter future actions of \nnuclear smuggling.\n  Aiding and abetting nuclear smuggling is abhorrent and should be \nrecognized for what it is--a crime against humanity. Just as the \ninternational community has banded together in the past to stigmatize \nthe slave trade and genocide as crimes against humanity, so too should \nit now do the same thing for those who help terrorist groups acquire \nweapons of mass destruction. The United States should be a leader in \nthis effort.\n  No. 2, we should be working with the International Atomic Energy \nAgency to establish a global library, a library of nuclear fissile \nmaterial. If the IAEA were to have nuclear samples from every weapons \nproduction facility in the world, when a nuclear device exploded \nsomewhere in the world, we could, in short order, trace the nuclear \nmaterial used in that explosion to the originating reactor or \nproduction facility. The capability of a library such as this could \nserve as a powerful deterrent. If a state knew it could be held \nultimately responsible for a nuclear detonation, it would have a far \ngreater incentive to secure and protect its nuclear materials. Those \nstates that refuse to cooperate with such a global library would risk \ncondemnation and suspicion in the event of a nuclear attack.\n  Our colleague, Senator Biden, the chairman of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee, has worked with the Armed Services Committee to strengthen \nU.S. efforts to take the first steps toward such a global library. \nToday, a group such as al-Qaida can get away with a nuclear attack on \nthe United States because it does not have a fixed address at which we \ncan easily retaliate. The same, however, does not apply to a nation \nthat intentionally or through lax security provides the means for a \nterrorist group to detonate a nuclear device. The United States must \nleverage the same type of deterrence against those nations as it did \nagainst the Soviet Union during the Cold War.\n  Finally, we must be doing more in the overall effort to combat \nnuclear proliferation among states. It is a very simple equation. The \nmore states that acquire a nuclear weapon and fissile material, the \nmore likely it is one of those states or some of those weapons and/or \nfissile material may be vulnerable to theft or illicit sale to \nterrorist groups. That is but one reason we must prevent Iran from \nacquiring nuclear weapons. It is why we must work with our \ninternational allies and partners to continue to ensure that North \nKorea verifiably dismantles its nuclear facilities and weapons under \nthe Six Party Talks. This link between nuclear proliferation and \nnuclear terrorism demonstrates the importance of reinforcing the \nNuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.\n\n  It is very difficult to imagine the utter devastation of an American \ncity by an improvised nuclear device. It is perhaps for that reason the \nspectre of nuclear terrorism remains an abstract threat today. Yet \nbefore 9/11, very few of us could appreciate the dangers by commercial \njet airliners hijacked by those on a suicide mission.\n  Madam President, the time for action on the challenge of nuclear \nterrorism is now. We must move to bolster existing threat reduction \nprograms, strengthen our deterrence capability against those who would \nperpetrate acts of nuclear terrorism, and, finally, recommit ourselves \nto the effort to reduce the role and the number of nuclear weapons in \nour world today. We do not have the luxury of time to wait.\n  Before I relinquish the floor, I want to thank one of our great staff \nmembers for his work on this and so many other areas of our work.

Mr. President, last Thursday, November 8, 2007, the \nassistant majority leader, Senator Durbin, propounded unanimous consent \nagreements on two bills reported by the Veterans' Affairs Committee--S. \n1233, the proposed ``Veterans Traumatic Brain Injury and Other Health \nPrograms Improvement Act of 2007'' and S. 1315, the proposed ``Veterans \nBenefits Enhancement Act of 2007.''\n  Both proposed agreements called for the bills to be considered ``at \nany time determined by the majority leader, following consultation with \nthe Republican leader'' and also provided that the only amendments that \nwould be in order would be ``first-degree amendments that are relevant \nto subject matter of the bill.'' In other words, the request was for \nthe Senate to take up these two bills, ordered reported by the \ncommittee in late June and reported in August, at some future time with \nthe only exclusion being that no nonrelevant amendments would be in \norder.\n  It is hard to think of a more modest request for action on \nlegislation. Unfortunately, my friend and colleague, the former \nchairman and ranking member of the committee, Senator Craig, objected \nto both unanimous consent agreements.\n  In explaining his objection, Senator Craig expressed the view that \nsome provisions in the two bills are ``controversial enough to merit \nconsiderable floor debate.'' Whether I agree with that characterization \nof the provisions, I would not seek to keep Senator Craig or any other \nSenator from debating the two bills. As I just noted, that was \nprecisely what the unanimous consent called for--debate, at a mutually \nagreed upon time, with the only limitation being that any amendment had \nto be relevant. Judging by the concerns Senator Craig discussed in his \nexplanation of his objection to the unanimous consent agreement, his \namendments would, indeed, be relevant.\n  I was patient while our colleagues on the other side of the aisle \ndealt with the upheaval that followed the unanticipated change in the \nminority leadership on the committee. I recognized that they needed \ntime to reorganize and for Senator Burr to move into his new role as \nthe committee's ranking member. However, that change in the ranking \nmember's position occurred over 2 months ago. It is time to bring these \nbills to the floor, time to engage in a full and open debate, time to \nvote on any amendments, and time to allow the Senate to have its say on \nthe bills.\n  In his objection, Senator Craig spoke of the committee's history of \nworking in a bipartisan fashion to resolve differences at the committee \nlevel. He is certainly correct that our committee rarely brings \nmeasures to the floor for debate. However, I do not understand that \nhistory to mean that any and all differences of opinion on legislation \nare resolved before we seek Senate action. Rather, it is my \nunderstanding that the committee's bipartisan practice means that we \nseek to negotiate so as to reach agreed-upon positions on legislation \nafter legislative hearings and before committee markups. When we are \nunable to reach agreement, there is an opportunity for amendments to be \noffered during markups. After a markup, our traditional practice has \nbeen to move forward from a committee markup without further debate on \nthe floor.\n  That approach is exactly what happened in 2005, when Senator Craig \nwas chairman of the committee. He and I had negotiated on a variety of \nlegislative initiatives up to the markup but could not reach agreement \non a number of matters. At the markup, I offered amendments--five or \nsix is my memory--on a number of the issues about which I had strong \nfeelings. I did not, however, continue to pursue those matters on the \nfloor. And I most assuredly did not do anything to block Senate \nconsideration of the legislation that I had sought to amend. In fact, \nas ranking member, I worked with then-Chairman Craig to gain passage of \nthe legislation by unanimous consent.\n  While I would certainly appreciate similar cooperation with respect \nto S. 1233 and S. 1315, I realize that Senator Craig and others may \nwish to continue to pursue amendments during debate before the full \nSenate, and I am prepared to support that result. All that is needed \nfor that to happen is for agreement to be reached to begin that debate, \nas set forth in the unanimous consent agreement put forward by Senator \nDurbin last week.\n  I do not know why others on the other side of the aisle are blocking \nthis debate. I urge them to reconsider and to agree to allow the debate \nto go forward. Our committee should finish our work. America's veterans \ndeserve no less.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/14/senate-section/article/S14393-4", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14393-S14394]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    MORTGAGE CANCELLATION RELIEF ACT\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to speak concerning the Mortgage \nCancellation Relief Act, S. 1394. In previous Congresses, I have \nintroduced this legislation to provide immediate tax relief to \nhomeowners adversely impacted by the recent downturn in the Nation's \nhousing markets.\n  However, this Congress, I am pleased to join my friend and colleague \nfrom Michigan, Senator Debbie Stabenow, as a cosponsor of S. 1394. She \nwas on the floor earlier this morning, and she had the opportunity to \naddress this bill. I want to thank her for her continued interest in \nthis issue.\n  I agree with her that it is well past time for Congress to act on \nthis legislation.\n  There are a number of positive things I can say about S. 1394. It is \na bipartisan bill. It is sound tax policy. It is good economic policy. \nAnd it treats those who have been impacted by housing declines fairly \nin their time of need.\n  As I mentioned, Senator Stabenow introduced this bill in May.\n  The President recommended a similar proposal in August.\n  However, the one not-so-positive thing I can say is that it is not \nlaw.\n  We are now into November. And despite all of the positive aspects of \nS. 1394, it has still not been reported by the Finance Committee or \ndebated on the Senate floor.\n  The problem addressed by this legislation has its roots in the \nhousing market.\n  In September, overall home sales slid 8 percent from the month \nbefore. Single-family sales slowed to the lowest pace in nearly 10 \nyears.\n  Inventory is going up. At the end of August, there was a 9.6-month \nsupply of homes. At the end of September, there was a 10.5-month supply \nof homes on the market.\n  So supply is up, and demand is down.\n  A high school senior, barely paying attention in his economics class, \ncould tell you the result.\n  The result is a buyer's market. The median home price is down 4.2 \npercent from the year before.\n\n[[Page S14394]]\n\n  With the dip in the housing market has come a corollary decrease in \nnew home construction.\n  According to one recent estimate, construction spending on all new \nhomes fell by 22 percent in 2007. The decline was even greater for \nsingle family homes--25 percent.\n  With another 4 percent dip in 2008, residential construction spending \nwill be down to $254 billion in 2008 from $384 billion in 2005.\n  While this is not good news for the Nation's builders, at least it \ntells us that the U.S. housing market is functioning rationally. As the \nsupply of housing tightens, demand and prices will once again go up. \nThis leads many economists to believe that housing markets will turn \nthe corner sooner rather than later.\n  In the meantime, however, we have a deadly economic mix of declining \nhousing prices, interest rate volatility, and adjustable rate mortgages \nthat are beginning to reset. When this convergence of events takes \nplace and is followed by a certain unnecessarily punitive and totally \nunfair provision in our Tax Code, life becomes even more burdensome for \nsome of our most vulnerable families and communities.\n  Let me explain why.\n  Adjustable rate mortgages are a product that provides an opportunity \nfor millions of families to achieve home ownership. Because they pose \nless risk to lenders, these mortgages can be a more affordable product \nthat allows families to purchase homes while assuming the risk that \ninterest rates will increase.\n  Yet because of the easy availability of adjustable rate mortgages, \nsome people took out very high mortgages and according to the Wall \nStreet Journal, there are 17 percent adjustable rate mortgage holders \nwho cannot make their payments on time.\n  We are currently witnessing how well private industry will be able to \nhandle this problem on its own. The Nation's largest mortgage lender, \nCountrywide Financial, announced that it is modifying the terms of $16 \nbillion in adjustable rate mortgages. Thirty thousand have already \nrestructured their loans, and Countrywide intends to contact 52,000 \nborrowers to see if they would like to restructure their loans as well.\n  Still, the declines in the Nation's housing markets have left two \ngroups particularly vulnerable.\n  First, there are those who sell their homes for less than the \noutstanding amount of the mortgage.\n  Second, there are those who are unable to make their mortgage \npayments and suffer foreclosure.\n  As I mentioned earlier, the Tax Code effectively kicks these folks \nwhile they are down.\n  The Internal Revenue Code defines income very broadly.\n  And when lenders forgive mortgage debt in a short-sale or a \nforeclosure, the borrower has technically received taxable income. Yet \nthis is phantom income, and it makes little sense to have these \nfinancially vulnerable families getting a form 1099 and an increased \ntax liability for income they never received.\n  This makes little sense as public policy. And it is inequitable as \ntax policy.\n  Section 121 of the Internal Revenue Code allows the exclusion of up \nto $250,000--or $500,000 on a joint return--of gain on the sale of a \nhome. Few people realize gains in excess of this statutory exclusion. \nAnd for those who do, those gains are taxed at lower capital gains \nrates.\n  Yet if a family is in such a dire financial situation that it is \nlosing its home or selling it at a loss, the phantom gain on these \ntransactions is taxed at ordinary income rates.\n  With adjustable rate mortgages being reset, growing housing \ninventory, and declining housing prices, too many people will be \ngetting a 1099 form in the mail telling them that they owe income taxes \non this debt forgiveness.\n  This is not the way it ought to be.\n  Our legislation would remedy this problem by excluding this debt \nforgiveness from gross income.\n  There is precedent for this. Congress provided similar relief in the \nwake of Hurricane Katrina.\n  Given the ramifications of housing market declines, we should extend \nthis needed relief to all Americans who find themselves receiving this \nkind of phantom income.\n  Yes, we would forgo some tax revenue by making this simple, fair, and \ncommonsense change to our tax laws, but the House has found a \nreasonable offset that is supported by the housing industry so the net \neffect to the Federal budget should be zero.\n  As I stated earlier, it is time to act. I am not sure what the delay \nis.\n  The drop in the housing market and the problems with adjustable rate \nmortgages are no longer breaking news. It has been nearly 6 months \nsince this bipartisan legislation was introduced. It has been over 2 \nmonths since the President indicated he supported this legislation and \nwanted to get it signed into law.\n  This Congress seems to have ground to a halt.\n  You can hear crickets chirping on the Senate floor lately. To say we \nare too busy to address this important legislation is simply false.\n  The lack of quick action on this legislation is no longer acceptable.\n  I urge my colleagues to support S. 1394 and for the Senate to pass \nthis legislation as soon as possible. Families in need and vulnerable \ncommunities demand that we act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/14/senate-section/article/S14394-1", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14394-S14395]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     MOTORCOACH ENHANCED SAFETY ACT\n\n  Mr. BROWN.

Many of the other 33 passengers were treated for \ninjuries.\n  For John Betts, who lost his son David in the crash, it was important \nto take the accident and make it into something positive, in honor of \nhis son and the other bright, talented young men who died that morning. \nMotorcoach safety became his crusade.\n  Mr. Betts has been interviewed by the media, local and national, \nbringing to light the need for stronger motorcoach safety regulations.\n  He has called for seatbelts for all passengers as well as other \nregulations that lower the risk of injury or fatality in accidents.\n  Mr. Betts sees upgrading the safety laws for motorcoaches as an \nopportunity to save the lives of future riders.\n  More importantly, he sees it as a way to memorialize David and his \nteammates and, as he puts it, to make the world they lived in better \nthan it was when they left it.\n  Sadly, the Bluffton University baseball team's fatal accident was not \nunique. We have witnessed story after story about motorcoach accidents.\n  While the investigation into the cause of the crash is ongoing, one \nthing is clear--stronger safety regulations could have minimized the \nfatalities resulting from this crash.\n  The Motorcoach Safety Enhancement Act, which I introduced today along \nwith Senator Hutchison, would address the shortfall in safety \nregulations for motorcoaches.\n  Many of the injuries sustained in motorcoaches could be prevented by \nincorporating high-quality safety technologies that exist today but are \nnot widely used, such as crush-proof roofing and glazed windows to \nprevent ejection.\n  More basic safety features, such as readily accessible fire \nextinguishers and seatbelts for all passengers, are still not required \non motorcoaches.\n  As a father of four, I find it particularly disturbing to know \nstudents are still riding in vehicles without even the option of \nbuckling up.\n  I applaud Mr. Betts and the other Bluffton parents for their \ncourageous fight in the midst of so much personal pain.\n  Seatbelts, window glazing, fire extinguishers--these are not new \ntechnologies. These are commonsense safety features that are widely \nused.\n  And they are features that the National Transportation Safety Board \nrecommends be enacted into law. Yet they have been languishing for \nyears.\n  The Motorcoach Safety Enhancement Act would instruct the Secretary of\n\n[[Page S14395]]\n\nTransportation to enact these and other safety features. It would put a \ntimeframe on final rulings so these safety requirements do not spend \nany more time in limbo.\n  This bill takes the lessons learned from the tragic events of the \nBluffton University baseball team's motorcoach accident, and aims to \ncorrect them for future riders.\n  It is my hope that in the future, parents will not have to endure the \nanguish and grief that John Betts and the other family members \nexperienced.\n  I hope for swift consideration of this bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/14/senate-section/article/S14395-1", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14395]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n            RECOGNIZING THE STUDENT CONSERVATION ASSOCIATION\n\n Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, today I honor the 50th anniversary \nof the Student Conservation Association. Over these last five decades, \nthe SCA has led the way in promoting the importance of conservation \nservice and stewardship. Its staff and supporters have made an \nextraordinary commitment to instilling this ethic in our country's \nyoung people. While it is headquartered in my home State of New \nHampshire, the SCA's reach and influence go far beyond the borders of \nNew Hampshire. Since its founding in 1957 by Elizabeth C. Titus Putnam, \nnearly 50,000 SCA volunteers have worked to protect the critical \nnatural habitats and threatened wildlife in our country's parks, \nforests, and urban green spaces. Its members can be found in all 50 \nStates, as well as Canada, Mexico, Brazil, Germany and Latvia. In 2006 \nalone, 4,000 volunteers logged 1.6 million service hours at 511 \nseparate sites. In past years, they worked to restore the Everglades \nfollowing the devastation Hurricane Hugo left behind and to repair the \ndamage to Yellowstone National Park following the fires which damaged \nthat park in 1988. This year, they were chosen to lead the Northwest \nRecovery at Mount Ranier and other parks in that region of the United \nStates following the floods of 2006. It is, in fact, the largest \nconservation service program in the country.\n  Those numbers and facts are impressive, but they do not fully convey \nthe central role this organization plays in strengthening the quality \nof life in the United States. The thousands of volunteers and interns \nclearly have relished meeting the obligation we all have to protecting \nthe vital natural areas in our country. Their unique dedication and \nenthusiasm have made them great role models and leaders. These \nqualities explain why such Federal agencies as the Bureau of Land \nManagement, U.S. Forest Service, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and \nthe U.S. Armed Forces all have partnered with the SCA and are the \nreason the White House, National Wildlife Federation, and the National \nPark Service have recognized the SCA's achievements.\n  The prime architect behind the SCA is Elizabeth Titus Putnam, and I \nam especially pleased to honor her. It is a great reflection on her \ncharacter that the vision she developed 50 years ago became a reality. \nHer energy and passion for environmental protection have touched \ncountless people and demonstrate why the SCA continues to be an \neffective and vibrant organization.\n  For these reasons, I am proud to be a member of the 50th Anniversary \nHonorary Committee. I hope all the alumni and current volunteers will \nlong remember the deep impact they have made on communities from Maine \nto Hawaii and from Alaska to Florida. Happy Birthday to the Student \nConservation Association and my best wishes for continued \nsuccess.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/14/senate-section/article/S14395-2", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14395]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           RETIREMENT OF BRIGADIER GENERAL WILLIAM T. BESTER\n\n Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I wish to recognize the service of \na great public servant, outstanding Army officer, and dedicated \nacademic leader.\n  In his latest stint of public service, BG William T. Bester, U.S. \nArmy retired, distinguished himself by exceptionally meritorious \nservice to the Graduate School of Nursing, Uniformed Services \nUniversity of the Health Sciences, Bethesda, MD, as acting dean from 10 \nJuly 2006 to 30 December 2007.\n  During this period, the outstanding leadership and ceaseless efforts \nof General Bester resulted in major contributions to the Graduate \nSchool of Nursing, GSN, and to the Uniformed Services University, USU. \nHe assumed his duties during a period of significant change and growth \nin the history of the GSN and the USU. He lead efforts in dealing with \nsubstantial change in the GSN: planning for a new psychiatric/mental \nhealth nurse practitioner master's option, facilitating the merger of \nthe GSN and Navy nurse anesthesia master's option, fostering renewed \ncollaboration with the Federal nursing service chiefs, FNSCs, assisting \nthe USU with the search for a new brigade commander and GSN dean, and \ndealing with base closure and realignment strategy and requirements. He \nfocused on every issue with unwavering directness, a spirit of \ncommunity participation, collegial respect, enthusiasm, and a wonderful \nsense of humor and fair play. His leadership brought about a change in \nGSN character and personality that is visible at every level of USU. \nHis tenure has been marked by strong, supportive relationships with \nsenior USU leaders, an increase in FNSC collaboration and trust \nresulting in additional senior scholars assigned to the Nursing Science \nDoctoral Program and new educational program opportunities and \nincreased student involvement in and enthusiasm for the school and the \nuniversity.\n  Working closely with my office, he was instrumental in solidifying \nDOD core budgeting for the GSN. He negotiated an expansion of faculty \nresearch support with the School of Medicine and the USU vice president \nfor research. He established a sense of calm and collaborative team \nbuilding by fostering a common vision, always listening to the faculty \nand staff issues, and addressing their concerns. As a genuine and \ndedicated ambassador of the university, General Bester often \nrepresented the USU president at external senior level meetings. His \ncareer interdisciplinary leadership experiences and the respect he \nmaintains within the Department of Defense always provided credibility \nas spokesperson when he represented the university and its president. \nThese same qualities allowed him to be an essential advisor to \nPresident Rice during a time of significant change within USU, on the \nBethesda campus, and in emerging military and Federal health \ncooperative concerns. Brigadier General Bester's total dedication to \nservice in all aspects of his leadership of the Graduate School of \nNursing and his exceptional leadership contributions to USU reflect an \nunsurpassed commitment to maintaining the highest standards for \nmilitary and Federal health nurse education at the Uniformed Services \nUniversity. The distinctive accomplishments of Brigadier General Bester \nreflect great credit upon himself, the Department of Defense, and the \nUniformed Services University.\n  The Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences continues to \nfulfill our vision as a key part of the Nation's academic health \neducation enterprise because of the dedication of its faculty and \nadministrative leadership. General Bester exemplifies the best of the \nbest. We owe a debt of gratitude for his years of public service, and I \nwish to take this opportunity to thank him along with his family: his \nwife Cheryl, his son Jason, daughter Jodi, and grandsons Will and Jake.\n  We wish General Bester Godspeed as he returns to his family and Texas \nwhere his children and grandchildren now live.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/14/senate-section/article/S14395-3", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14395-S14396]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                RECOGNIZING JORDAN-FERNALD FUNERAL HOMES\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I wish to recognize Jordan-Fernald \nFuneral Homes, an outstanding small business in my home State of Maine \nthat exemplifies the best of Maine's community spirit. Founded in 1860 \nby the Fernald family, Jordan-Fernald is now in its fourth and fifth \ngenerations of ownership. Over the years, the Fernalds purchased \nseveral Jordan Funeral Home locations to become Jordan-Fernald in 2004. \nCurrently, four Fernalds siblings--Bill, Tom, and Lauri, along with \ntheir father, Robert--co-own the business.\n  Presently maintaining funeral homes in four towns in Hancock County, \nthe Fernalds have always prided themselves on their stalwart commitment \nto the ever-changing needs of the local communities. For example, Bill \nparticipates in a local project to prepare\n\n[[Page S14396]]\n\nthe Hancock County area against a potential pandemic flu. Meanwhile, \nTom serves on the boards of the Maine Funeral Directors Association and \nthe Maine Coast Memorial Hospital and Lauri serves on the boards of the \nHospice of Hancock County, the Abbe Museum, and the Hospice Regatta of \nMaine. Finally, Robert is well known in the area for his work on behalf \nof the Lions Club.\n  In recognition of the Fernalds' contributions to the communities, \nJordan-Fernald received the Gannett Family Business of the Year Award \nin 2005. This award recognizes family-run businesses that demonstrate \ncreativity in ensuring their company's vitality while maintaining ties \nwith their communities and stakeholders. Jordan-Fernald was selected, \nalong with one other business, out of a pool of 22 nominees. Family-\nowned businesses represent approximately 90 percent of all Maine \nbusinesses, yet less than 30 percent survive to the second generation \nand only 13 percent survive to the third generation, making it all the \nmore impressive that Jordan-Fernald has survived to the fifth \ngeneration!\n  Most recently, Jordan-Fernald received the Top Drawer Award from the \nEllsworth Area Chamber of Commerce. The award is presented to a \nbusiness that has made a substantial contribution to the growth, \ndevelopment, and improvement of Ellsworth, Hancock County, and the \nState of Maine. The Ellsworth Area Chamber president, Chrissi Maguire-\nHarding, cited Jordan-Fernald's commitment to the region through \nparticipation on community boards, support of other businesses, and \neconomic growth as the main reasons for the award. In modern times, \nwhere one-third of Maine funeral homes are owned by a single \ncorporation based in Texas, Jordan-Fernald has managed to maintain \nindependence and a bountiful community spirit.\n  Jordan-Fernald is an exemplary small business. The firm's dynamic \napproach toward business and community involvement benefits everyone \nthroughout eastern Maine and, indeed, the entire State of Maine. I \ncommend Jordan-Fernald Funeral Homes for its dedication and leadership, \nand I wish the enterprise much success going forward.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/14/senate-section/article/S14396-1", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14396]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                RECOGNIZING THE RAPID CITY MEALS PROGRAM\n\n Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, today I honor the Rapid City, SD, \nMEALS program as they celebrate 26 years of dedicated service to the \nBlack Hills community.\n  For more than a quarter century, the Rapid City MEALS program has \nprovided our seniors with quality nutrition, education, community, and \nsupport services so they can live in their own homes and maintain their \nindependence.\n  The MEALS program would not be able to perform its invaluable mission \nwithout the hard work and dedication of the many volunteers who put in \ncountless hours serving the needs of others.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide Medicare beneficiaries greater choice with regard to accessing \nhearing health services and benefits; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the Medicare \nHearing Health Care Enhancement Act with my colleagues, Senators \nHarkin, Coleman, and Menendez. This legislation is the companion bill \nto legislation introduced in the House by Representative Mike Ross, \nwith a number of cosponsors.\n  This legislation will provide Medicare beneficiaries with the same \nhearing care options available to veterans and Federal employees, \nincluding every member of this body. Under this bill, Medicare \nbeneficiaries who experience hearing problems will have the option of \ngoing directly to an audiologist, rather than first visiting a \nphysician. This is the policy for the health care programs administered \nby the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Office of Personnel \nManagement. Direct access works well for our veterans and for Federal \nemployees, including Members of Congress, and direct access should be \navailable to senior citizens in the Medicare program.\n  More than 31 million Americans have some type of hearing problem, \nmaking hearing loss the third most common health problem in the U.S. \nMany of them are older Americans, and this statistic is fast increasing \nwith the aging of the ``baby boomers.'' Yet half of all hearing \nimpaired persons are under age 65. With 80 to 90 percent of hearing \nproblems not medically or surgically treatable, it seems only \nreasonable that Medicare patients be allowed to consult with an \naudiologist without first seeing another health care provider. It is \npart of regular audiological practice to refer patients for medical \nmanagement when clinical indicators are present.\n  In 1992, the Department of Veterans Affairs, VA, changed its health \ncare policy to allow for the option of direct access to a licensed \naudiologist. The VA reports: ``the policy has provided and continues to \nprovide high quality, cost effective, and successful hearing health \ncare to veterans.'' The VA did not experience increased utilization of \naudiology services due to the policy change and instead found, ``the \npolicy did not increase the number of visits beyond what would be \nexpected in the aging veteran population.''\n  In 2003, the Congress in the Appropriations Conference Report number \n108-10 recommended that the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services \nmake this change. We have since learned that CMS does not have the \nauthority to do so under current law. Therefore, I hope that we can all \nagree that this is a common sense idea whose time has come, and move \nthis legislation forward to enactment.\n  Direct access would facilitate access to hearing care without \nexpanding the scope of practice for audiologists. This legislation will \nmake it easier for Medicare beneficiaries, particularly in rural \nAmerica, to have the same high quality hearing care provided by the VA \nand OPM. It is also important to point out that both the Medicare and \nMedicaid programs now recognize State licensure as the appropriate \nstandard for determining who is a qualified audiologist.\n  This legislation enjoys the support of a large number of \norganizations including the American Academy of Audiology, the American \nSpeech-Language and Hearing Association, the National Association of \nthe Deaf and the National Rural Health Association. I commend this \nlegislation to the attention of my colleagues and urge them to lend \ntheir support by cosponsoring this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN:\n  S. 2353.

A bill to amend the National Climate Program Act to enhance \nthe ability of the United States to develop and implement climate \nchange adaptation programs and policies, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Climate \nChange Adaptation Act of 2007.\n  Before I describe the merits of this bill, I would like to take a \nmoment to commend many of my colleagues for their ongoing efforts to \ndevelop legislative solutions to meet the enormous challenges global \nwarming poses to our Nation and our planet. I feel this bill helps \naddress a somewhat overlooked, but key tool, to tackling this \npreeminent challenge facing our Nation.\n  I am proud that Washington State is taking the lead on the issue of \nglobal climate change. While my State's contribution to global warming \nis relatively small--because we are fortunate enough to derive about 70 \npercent of our electricity from inexpensive, emissions-free \nhydropower--global warming threatens to seriously impact our economy.\n  Ironically, one of the primary impacts of global warming on the \nPacific Northwest will be to change our rainfall patterns in a way that \nreduces the amount of water available for hydropower production.\n  And these changes will not only harm electricity generation, they \nwill also impact billions of dollars of economic infrastructure \nassociated with irrigation systems, municipal water supplies, even ski \nresorts that depend on our historic snowfall patterns.\n  Faced with these possibilities, we must ask several simple questions: \nWhat are we doing to prepare for these changes? How are predicted sea \nlevel rises being incorporated into shoreline restoration projects, \nsiting of public infrastructure, or disaster response plans, among many \nother examples? What tools do we need to give Federal, State, and local \ndecisionmakers to take climate change into account on long-term, \nmultibillion-dollar decisions?\n  Unfortunately, we don't have any answers.\n\n[[Page S14402]]\n\n  As we discovered when I held a hearing on ocean acidification as \nchair of the Oceans, Atmosphere, Fisheries and Coast Guard subcommittee \nlast May, our Government is ill-equipped to plan for the consequences \nof global climate change. We simply lack the tools to develop the \nstrategies we need to adapt.\n  In August, the Government Accountability Office found that the \nFederal government is not providing Federal agencies with the proper \ntools or policy mandates to take climate change impacts into account in \ncarrying out their responsibilities to manage public resources.\n  In September, the National Academy of Sciences concluded there is a \ntremendous need to improve the delivery of climate change information \nto Federal, regional, and local levels so they can take climate change \nimpacts into account in planning and managing resources.\n  The reality is that even if we were somehow able to stop using fossil \nfuels today, a certain degree of warming and ocean acidification will \nstill occur over the next 2 or 3 decades.\n  While my top priority is to move our Nation to a clean energy system, \nwe must face the fact that global warming is happening already, and it \nis only going to get worse.\n  That is why I am pleased today to be introducing the Climate Change \nAdaptation Act--a bill to ensure that our government plans for the \nchanges that global warming will inevitably bring. This bill will \nrequire the President to develop a national strategy for addressing the \nimpacts that climate change will have on our natural resources. It will \nalso specifically require NOAA to conduct vulnerability assessments on \nthe impacts of climate change on coastal and ocean resources, and to \nprepare adaptation plans for those resources.\n  Planning for the future isn't just common sense--it's responsible \ngovernment.\n  This bill is complementary to several bills under consideration by \nthe Commerce Committee on which I serve, including the Kerry-Snowe bill \nthat was under discussion at a Commerce Committee hearing earlier \ntoday. Their bill contains many provisions I believe are vitally \nimportant--including language I authored with Senator Collins on the \nneed for a program to study the threat of abrupt climate change.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Section 2 (15 U.S.C. 2601) is amended to read as follows:\n\n     ``SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       ``The Congress finds that--\n       ``(1) weather, climate change, and climate variability \n     affect public safety, environmental services and security, \n     human health, agriculture, energy use, water resources, and \n     other factors vital to national security and human welfare;\n       ``(2) the present rate of advance of national efforts in \n     research and development and the application of such advances \n     is inadequate to meet the challenges posed by observed and \n     projected rates of climate change and climate variability and \n     the increasing demand for information to guide planning and \n     response across all sectors;\n       ``(3) the United States lacks adequate research, \n     infrastructure, and coordinated outreach and communication \n     mechanisms to meet national climate monitoring, prediction, \n     and decision support needs for adapting to and mitigating the \n     impacts of climate change and climate variability;\n       ``(4) information regarding climate change and climate \n     variability is not being fully disseminated or used, and \n     Federal efforts have given insufficient attention to \n     assessing and applying this information;\n       ``(5) climate change and climate variability occur on a \n     global basis making international cooperation essential for \n     the purpose of sharing the benefits and costs of a global \n     effort to understand and communicate these changes;\n       ``(6) recent scientific reports by the Intergovernmental \n     Panel on Climate Change conclusively found that climate \n     change is occurring, and that impacts from climate change can \n     be expected in even shorter time periods than had been \n     previously predicted;\n       ``(7) the Panel found that the resilience of many \n     ecosystems is likely to be exceeded this century by an \n     unprecedented combination of climate change, associated \n     disturbances such as flooding and drought, and other global \n     change drivers such as land-use change;\n       ``(8) according to the Panel, approximately 20 to 30 \n     percent of plant and animal species assessed so far are \n     likely to be at increased risk of extinction if increases in \n     global average temperature exceed 1.5 to 2.5 degrees Celsius;\n       ``(9) the Panel also found that the progressive \n     acidification of oceans due to increasing atmospheric carbon \n     dioxide is expected to have negative impacts on marine shell-\n     forming organisms, such as corals, and their dependent \n     species;\n       ``(10) the Panel found that coasts will be exposed to \n     increasing risks, including coastal erosion, over coming \n     decades due to climate change and sea-level rise, and that \n     adaptation costs for vulnerable coasts are much less than the \n     costs of inaction;\n       ``(11) in its September, 2007, study entitled Evaluating \n     Progress of the U.S. Climate Change Science Program: Methods \n     and Preliminary Results, the National Academy of Sciences \n     concluded that there is a tremendous need to improve the \n     delivery of information to decision makers at the Federal, \n     regional, and local levels on climate change impacts and to \n     take such impacts into account in planning and in managing \n     resources;\n       ``(12) States and local communities may need Federal \n     assistance in developing and implementing strategies to \n     address the impacts of climate change;\n       ``(13) in its August, 2007, report entitled Climate Change: \n     Agencies Should Develop Guidance for Addressing the Effects \n     on Federal Land and Water Resources, GAO-07-863, the \n     Government Accountability Office found that the Federal \n     government is not providing the National Oceanic and \n     Atmospheric Administration and other Federal agencies that \n     are responsible for managing natural resources with the \n     proper tools or policy mandates to take the impacts of \n     climate change into account in carrying out their \n     responsibilities to manage public resources;\n       ``(14) the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, \n     which plays a leading role in the Federal government's Global \n     Change Research Program, has a key role to play both in \n     predicting impacts of climate change on natural resources and \n     in improving the delivery of information critical to \n     adaptation and management to end users; and\n       ``(15) the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration \n     has a key role to play in addressing the impacts of climate \n     change on our Nation's coastal areas and ocean resources.''.\n\n     SEC. 4.

NATIONAL CLIMATE PROGRAM ELEMENTS.\n\n       Section 5 (15 U.S.C. 2904) is amended--\n       (1) by striking ``subsection (d)(9);'' in subsection (b)(1) \n     and inserting ``section 6;'';\n       (2) by striking subsections (c), (e), (f), and (g); and\n       (3) by striking subsection (d) and inserting the following:\n       ``(c) Program Elements.--\n       ``(1) In general.--The Program shall include--\n       ``(1) a strategic plan to address the impacts of climate \n     change within the United States; and\n       ``(2) a National Climate Service to be established within \n     the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.''.\n\n     SEC. 6.

Res. 381\n\n       Whereas on December 2, 1980, four churchwomen from the \n     United States, Maryknoll Sisters Maura Clarke and Ita Ford, \n     Ursuline Sister Dorothy Kazel, and Cleveland Lay Mission Team \n     Member Jean Donovan, were violated and executed by members of \n     the National Guard of El Salvador;\n       Whereas in 1980, Maryknoll Sisters Maura Clarke and Ita \n     Ford were working in the parish of the Church of San Juan \n     Bautista in Chalatenango, El Salvador, providing food, \n     transportation, and other assistance to refugees, and \n     Ursuline Sister Dorothy Kazel and Cleveland Lay Mission Team \n     Member Jean Donovan were working in the parish of the Church \n     of the Immaculate Conception in La Libertad, El Salvador, \n     providing assistance and support to refugees and other \n     victims of violence;\n       Whereas these four churchwomen from the United States \n     dedicated their lives to working with the poor of El \n     Salvador, especially women and children left homeless, \n     displaced, and destitute by the civil war in El Salvador;\n       Whereas these four churchwomen from the United States were \n     among the more than 70,000 civilians who were murdered during \n     the course of the civil war in El Salvador;\n       Whereas on May 23 and May 24, 1984, five members of the \n     National Guard of El Salvador, Subsergeant Luis Antonio \n     Colindres Aleman, Daniel Canales Ramirez, Carlos Joaquin \n     Contreras Palacios, Francisco Orlando Contreras Recinos, and \n     Jose Roberto Moreno Canjura, were found guilty by the El \n     Salvador courts of the executions of these four churchwomen \n     from the United States and were sentenced to 30 years in \n     prison, marking the first time in El Salvador history in \n     which a member of the Armed Forces of El Salvador was \n     convicted of murder by an El Salvador judge;\n       Whereas the United Nations Commission on the Truth for El \n     Salvador was established under the terms of the historic \n     January 1992 Peace Accords that ended 12 years of civil war \n     in El Salvador and was charged to investigate and report to \n     the El Salvador people on human rights crimes committed by \n     all sides during the course of the civil war;\n       Whereas in March 1993, the United Nations Commission on the \n     Truth for El Salvador found that the execution of these four \n     churchwomen from the United States was planned, that \n     Subsergeant Luis Antonio Colindres Aleman carried out orders \n     from a superior to execute them, that then Colonel Carlos \n     Eugenio Vides Casanova, then Director-General of the National \n     Guard and his cousin, Lieutenant Colonel Oscar Edgardo \n     Casanova Vejar, then Commander of the Zacatecoluca military \n     detachment where the murders were committed, and other \n     military personnel knew that members of the National Guard \n     had committed the murders pursuant to orders of a superior, \n     and that the subsequent coverup of the facts adversely \n     affected the judicial investigation into the murders of the \n     churchwomen;\n       Whereas the United Nations Commission on the Truth for El \n     Salvador determined that General Jose Guillermo Garcia, then \n     Minister of Defense, made no serious effort to conduct a \n     thorough investigation of responsibility for the murders of \n     these four churchwomen from the United States;\n       Whereas the families of these four churchwomen from the \n     United States continue their efforts to determine the full \n     truth surrounding the murders of their loved ones, appreciate \n     the cooperation of United States Government agencies in \n     disclosing and providing documents relevant to the murders of \n     the churchwomen, and pursue requests to release to the family \n     members the few remaining undisclosed documents and reports \n     pertaining to the case;\n       Whereas the families of these four churchwomen from the \n     United States appreciate the ability of those harmed by \n     violence to bring suit against El Salvador military officers \n     in United States courts under the Torture Victim Protection \n     Act of 1991 (28 U.S.C. 1350 note);\n\n[[Page S14405]]\n\n       Whereas the lives of these four

the call to service and to \n     pursue lives dedicated to addressing the needs and \n     aspirations of the poor, the vulnerable, and the \n     disadvantaged, especially among women and children;\n       Whereas the lives of these four churchwomen from the United \n     States have also inspired numerous books, plays, films, \n     music, religious events, and cultural events;\n       Whereas schools, libraries, research centers, spiritual \n     centers, health clinics, women's and children's programs in \n     the United States and in El Salvador have been named after or \n     dedicated to Sisters Maura Clarke, Ita Ford, Dorothy Kazel, \n     and lay missionary Jean Donovan;\n       Whereas the Maryknoll Sisters, headquartered in Ossining, \n     New York, the Ursuline Sisters, headquartered in Cleveland, \n     Ohio, numerous religious task forces in the United States, \n     and the Salvadoran and international religious communities \n     based in El Salvador annually commemorate the lives and \n     martyrdom of these four churchwomen from the United States;\n       Whereas the historic January 1992 Peace Accords ended 12 \n     years of civil war in El Salvador and have allowed the \n     Government and the people of El Salvador to achieve \n     significant progress in creating and strengthening \n     democratic, political, economic, and social institutions in \n     El Salvador; and\n       Whereas December 2, 2007, marks the 27th anniversary of the \n     deaths of these four spiritual, courageous, and generous \n     churchwomen from the United States: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) remembers and commemorates the lives and work of \n     Sisters Maura Clarke, Ita Ford, and Dorothy Kazel and lay \n     missionary Jean Donovan;\n       (2) extends sympathy and support for the families, friends, \n     and religious communities of these four churchwomen from the \n     United States;\n       (3) continues to find inspiration in the lives and work of \n     these four churchwomen from the United States;\n       (4) calls upon the people of the United States and \n     religious congregations to participate in local, national, \n     and international events commemorating the 27th anniversary \n     of the martyrdom of these four churchwomen from the United \n     States;\n       (5) recognizes that while progress has been made in El \n     Salvador during the post-civil war period, the work begun by \n     these four churchwomen from the United States remains \n     unfinished and social and economic hardships persist among \n     many sectors of El Salvador society; and\n       (6) calls upon the President, the Secretary of State, the \n     Administrator of the United States Agency for International \n     Development, and the heads of other United States Government \n     agencies to continue to support and collaborate with the \n     Government of El Salvador and with private sector, \n     nongovernmental, regional, international, and religious \n     organizations in their efforts to reduce poverty and hunger \n     and to promote educational opportunity, health care, and \n     social equity for the people of El Salvador.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url":

Res. 382\n\n       Whereas the World Health Organization and the International \n     Diabetes Federation established World Diabetes Day in 1991 \n     with the aim of coordinating diabetes advocacy worldwide;\n       Whereas World Diabetes Day is celebrated annually on \n     November 14;\n       Whereas, on December 20, 2006, the General Assembly of the \n     United Nations passed a landmark resolution recognizing \n     diabetes as a chronic, debilitating, and costly disease;\n       Whereas the resolution designates World Diabetes Day as a \n     United Nations Day to be observed every year starting in 2007 \n     in order to raise global awareness of diabetes;\n       Whereas the theme of the 2007 United Nations World Diabetes \n     Day campaign focuses on raising awareness of diabetes in \n     children and adolescents, who face unique challenges when \n     diagnosed with diabetes;\n       Whereas the United Nations campaign aims, among other \n     objectives, to firmly establish the message that no child \n     should die of diabetes;\n       Whereas the global diabetes epidemic has devastating \n     effects on families, societies, and national economies;\n       Whereas diabetes is the 4th leading cause of death by \n     disease in the world, and is the 6th leading cause of death \n     in the United States;\n       Whereas diabetes is a leading cause of blindness, kidney \n     failure, amputation, heart attack, and stroke;\n       Whereas in almost every country the incidence of diabetes \n     is increasing, growing from an estimated 30,000,000 people \n     worldwide in 1985 to an estimated 245,000,000 people in 2007, \n     and to 380,000,000 by 2025, as reported by the International \n     Diabetes Federation;\n       Whereas diabetes is one of the most common chronic \n     childhood diseases;\n       Whereas diabetes can strike children at any age, and when \n     diagnosed in young people the risk of developing life-\n     threatening complications at an early age increases and life \n     expectancy is shortened by, on average, 10 to 20 years;\n       Whereas new figures from the International Diabetes \n     Federation's Diabetes Atlas suggest that more than 70,000 \n     children develop type 1 diabetes each year and 440,000 \n     children worldwide under the age of 14 now live with type 1 \n     diabetes;\n       Whereas recent data indicate that 1 out of every 3 children \n     born in the United States will develop diabetes during their \n     lifetime, including 1 out of every 2 children from ethnic \n     minority groups;\n       Whereas in low- and middle-income countries, many children \n     with diabetes die because they are diagnosed late or \n     misdiagnosed or because insulin is unaffordable, unavailable, \n     or in short supply;\n       Whereas the incidence of type 2 diabetes, which was \n     previously rare in children, is rising at alarming rates, \n     with more than 200 children a day developing this form of \n     diabetes;\n       Whereas obesity is a major contributor to type 2 diabetes;\n       Whereas according to the International Obesity Task Force \n     of the International Association for the Study of Obesity, \n     155,000,000 school-age children worldwide are overweight, \n     representing at least 1 out of every 10 school-age children;\n       Whereas at least 30,000,000 of those overweight children \n     are classified as obese, accounting for at least 2 percent of \n     the world's children between the ages of 5 and 17 years of \n     age;\n       Whereas research has shown conclusively that type 2 \n     diabetes can be prevented or significantly delayed through \n     healthy weight maintenance and regular physical activity;\n       Whereas adopting a lifestyle high in physical activity and \n     adopting a low-sugar, low-fat diet can successfully prevent \n     the onset of obesity and diabetes among school-age children;\n       Whereas diabetes is costly, with the world estimated to \n     spend at least $232,000,000,000 in 2007 and over \n     $302,500,000,000 by 2025 to treat and prevent diabetes and \n     its complications;\n       Whereas world treatment costs for diabetes are growing more \n     quickly than the world population;\n       Whereas diabetes threatens to subvert global economic \n     advancement by both straining government budgets worldwide \n     (with the cost of diabetes-related disability payments, \n     pensions, social and medical service costs, and lost revenue) \n     and burdening private health insurers and employers with \n     spiraling health care costs;\n       Whereas by 2025 the largest increases in diabetes \n     prevalence will take place in developing countries, whose \n     economies are less able to support increased expenditures to \n     provide for those with the disease and engage in effective \n     prevention efforts;

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Healthy Mothers and \n     Healthy Babies Rural Access to Care Act''.\n\n     SEC. _02. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--\n       (1) Effect on women's access to health services.--Congress \n     finds that--\n       (A) the current civil justice system is eroding women's \n     access to obstetrical and gynecological services;\n       (B) the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists \n     (ACOG) has identified nearly half of the States as having a \n     medical liability insurance crisis that is threatening access \n     to high-quality obstetrical and gynecological services;\n       (C) because of the high cost of medical liability insurance \n     and the risk of being sued, one in seven obstetricians and \n     gynecologists have stopped practicing obstetrics and one in \n     five has decreased their number of high-risk obstetrics \n     patients; and\n       (D) because of the lack of availability of obstetrical \n     services, women--\n       (i) must travel longer distances and cross State lines to \n     find a doctor;\n       (ii) have longer waiting periods (in some cases months) for \n     appointments;\n       (iii) have shorter visits with their physicians once they \n     get appointments;\n       (iv) have less access to maternal-fetal medicine \n     specialists, physicians with the most experience and training \n     in the care of women with high-risk pregnancies; and\n       (v) have fewer hospitals with maternity wards where they \n     can deliver their child, potentially endangering the lives \n     and health of the woman and her unborn child.\n       (2) Effect on interstate commerce.--Congress finds that the \n     health care and insurance industries are industries affecting \n     interstate commerce and the health care liability litigation \n     systems existing throughout the United States are activities \n     that affect interstate commerce by contributing to the high \n     costs of health care and premiums for health care liability \n     insurance purchased by health care system providers.\n       (3) Effect on federal spending.--Congress finds that the \n     health care liability litigation systems existing throughout \n     the United States have a significant effect on the amount, \n     distribution, and use of Federal funds because of--\n       (A) the large number of individuals who receive health care \n     benefits under programs operated or financed by the Federal \n     Government;\n       (B) the large number of individuals who benefit because of \n     the exclusion from Federal taxes of the amounts spent to \n     provide them with health insurance benefits; and\n       (C) the large number of health care providers who provide \n     items or services for which the Federal Government makes \n     payments.\n       (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this title to implement \n     reasonable, comprehensive, and effective health care \n     liability reforms designed to--\n       (1) improve the availability of health care services in \n     cases in which health care liability actions have been shown \n     to be a factor in the decreased availability of services;\n       (2) reduce the incidence of ``defensive medicine'' and \n     lower the cost of health care liability insurance, all of \n     which contribute to the escalation of health care costs;\n       (3) ensure that persons with meritorious health care injury \n     claims receive fair and adequate compensation, including \n     reasonable noneconomic damages;\n       (4) improve the fairness and cost-effectiveness of our \n     current health care liability system to resolve disputes \n     over, and provide compensation for, health care liability by \n     reducing uncertainty in the amount of compensation provided \n     to injured individuals; and\n       (5) provide an increased sharing of information in the \n     health care system which will reduce unintended injury and \n     improve patient care.\n\n     SEC. _03.

means \n     objectively verifiable monetary losses incurred as a result \n     of the provision of, use of, or payment for (or failure to \n     provide, use, or pay for) health care services or

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S.

Res. 368\n\n       Whereas Atlantic bluefin tuna are a valuable commercial and \n     recreational fishery of the United States and many other \n     countries;\n       Whereas the International Convention for the Conservation \n     of Atlantic Tunas entered into force on March 21, 1969;\n       Whereas the Convention established the International \n     Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas to \n     coordinate international research and develop, implement, and \n     enforce compliance of the conservation and management \n     recommendations on the Atlantic bluefin tuna and other highly \n     migratory species in the Atlantic Ocean and the adjacent \n     seas, including the Mediterranean Sea;\n       Whereas in 1974, the Commission adopted its first \n     conservation and management recommendation to ensure the \n     sustainability of Atlantic bluefin tuna throughout the \n     Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea, while allowing for the \n     maximum sustainable catch for food and other purposes;\n       Whereas in 1981, for management purposes, the Commission \n     adopted a working hypothesis of 2 Atlantic bluefin tuna \n     stocks, with 1 occurring west of 45 degrees west longitude \n     (hereinafter referred to as the ``western Atlantic stock'') \n     and the other occurring east of 45 degrees west longitude \n     (hereinafter referred to as the ``eastern Atlantic and \n     Mediterranean stock'');\n       Whereas, despite scientific recommendations intended to \n     maintain bluefin tuna populations at levels that will permit \n     the maximum sustainable yield and ensure the future of the \n     stocks, the total allowable catch quotas have been \n     consistently set at levels significantly higher than the \n     recommended levels for the eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean \n     stock;\n       Whereas despite the establishment by the Commission of \n     fishing quotas based on total allowable catch levels for the \n     eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean bluefin tuna fishery that \n     exceed scientific recommendations, compliance with such \n     quotas by parties to the Convention that harvest that stock \n     has been extremely poor, most recently with harvests \n     exceeding such total allowable catch levels by more than 50 \n     percent for each of the last 4 years;\n       Whereas insufficient data reporting in combination with \n     unreliable national catch statistics has frequently \n     undermined efforts by the Commission to assign quota \n     overharvests to specific countries;\n       Whereas the failure of many Commission members fishing east \n     of 45 degrees west longitude to comply with other Commission \n     recommendations to conserve and control the overfished \n     eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean bluefin tuna stock has \n     been an ongoing problem;\n       Whereas the Commission's Standing Committee on Research and \n     Statistics noted in its 2006 report that the fishing \n     mortality rate for the eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean \n     stock may be more than 3 times the level that would permit \n     the stock to stabilize at the maximum sustainable catch \n     level, and continuing to fish at the level of recent years \n     ``is expected to drive the spawning biomass to a very low \n     level'' giving ``rise to a high risk of fishery and stock \n     collapse'';\n       Whereas the Standing Committee has recommended that the \n     annual harvest levels for eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean \n     bluefin tuna be reduced from 32,000 metric tons to \n     approximately 15,000 metric tons to halt decline of the \n     resource and initiate rebuilding, and the United States \n     supported this recommendation at the 2006 Commission meeting;\n       Whereas in 2006, the Commission adopted the \n     ``Recommendation by ICCAT to Establish a Multi-Annual \n     Recovery Plan for Bluefin Tuna in the eastern Atlantic and \n     Mediterranean'' containing a wide range of management, \n     monitoring, and control measures designed to facilitate the \n     recovery of the eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean bluefin \n     tuna stock;\n       Whereas the Recovery Plan is inadequate and allows \n     overfishing and stock decline to continue, and initial \n     information indicates that implementation of the plan in 2007 \n     by many eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean bluefin tuna \n     harvesting countries has been poor;\n       Whereas since 1981, the Commission has adopted additional \n     and more restrictive conservation and management \n     recommendations for the western Atlantic bluefin tuna stock, \n     and these recommendations have been implemented by Nations \n     fishing west of 45 degrees west longitude, including the \n     United States;\n       Whereas despite adopting, fully implementing, and complying \n     with a science-based rebuilding program for the western \n     Atlantic bluefin tuna stock by countries fishing west of 45 \n     degrees west longitude, catches and catch rates remain very \n     low;\n       Whereas many scientists believe that mixing occurs between \n     the western Atlantic bluefin tuna stock and the eastern \n     Atlantic and Mediterranean stock, and as such, poor \n     management and noncompliance with recommendations for one \n     stock are likely to have an adverse effect on the other \n     stock; and\n       Whereas additional research on stock mixing will improve \n     the understanding of the relationship between eastern and \n     western bluefin tuna stocks and other fisheries, which will \n     assist in the conservation, recovery, and management of the \n     species throughout its range: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that the \n     United States delegation to the 20th Regular Meeting of the \n     International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic \n     Tunas, should--\n       (1) seek the adoption of a harvesting moratorium, which \n     includes appropriate mechanisms to ensure compliance, on the \n     eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean bluefin tuna fishery of \n     sufficient duration to begin the process of stock recovery \n     and allow for the\n\n[[Page S14418]]\n\n     development and implementation of an effective program of \n     monitoring and control on the fishery when the moratorium \n     ends;\n       (2) seek to strengthen the conservation and management of \n     the eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean bluefin tuna by making \n     recommendations to halt the decline of the stock and begin to \n     rebuild it;\n       (3) reevaluate the implementation, effectiveness, and \n     relevance of the Commission recommendation entitled \n     ``Recommendation by ICCAT to Establish a Multi-Annual \n     Recovery Plan for Bluefin Tuna in the eastern Atlantic and \n     Mediterranean'' (Recommendation 06-05), and seek from \n     Commission members that have failed to fully implement the \n     terms of the recommendations detailed justification for their \n     lack of compliance;\n       (4) pursue a review and assessment of compliance with \n     conservation and management measures adopted by the \n     Commission and in effect for the 2006 eastern Atlantic and \n     Mediterranean bluefin tuna fishery, occurring east of 45 \n     degrees west longitude, and other fisheries that are subject \n     to the jurisdiction of the Commission, including data \n     collection and reporting requirements;\n       (5) seek to address noncompliance by parties to the \n     Convention with such measures through appropriate actions, \n     including, as appropriate, deducting a portion of a future \n     quota for a party to compensate for such party exceeding its \n     quota in prior years; and\n       (6) pursue additional research on the relationship between \n     the western Atlantic and eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean \n     bluefin tuna stocks and the extent to which the populations \n     intermingle.\n\n

Mr. President, I wish to speak regarding an effort that, \nin recent years, has received the support of many of us in the Senate. \n``Feed America Thursday'' is an effort, promoted by a number of \ncharitable organizations, aimed at fostering our Nation's spirit of \nselflessness and sacrifice in order to help those in need.\n  According to the Department of Agriculture's most recent numbers, \nroughly 35 million Americans, including 12 million children, live in \nhouseholds that do not have an adequate supply of food. As I have said \nin the past, it is simply inexcusable that, in the most prosperous \nnation on Earth, so many children go to bed hungry at night. While \nthere are often disputes as to how we should address these problems, I \nbelieve there are steps that every American can take to help those in \nneed.\n  The leaders and participants in ``Feed America Thursday'' encourage \nall Americans to sacrifice two meals on the Thursday before \nThanksgiving Day and to donate the money they would have used for food \nto a charity or religious organization of their choice. The charities \nand churches, in turn, are encouraged to use these funds to feed the \nhungry.\n  Today, as I have in previous Congresses, I introduced a resolution \nthat would designate this Thursday, November 15, 2007, as ``Feed \nAmerica Thursday.'' I urge my Senate colleagues and every American to \njoin me in feeding the hungry and affirming the values that make our \nNation great.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Res. 381) remembering and commemorating \n     the lives and work of Maryknoll Sisters Maura Clarke and Ita \n     Ford, Ursuline Sister Dorothy Kazel, and Cleveland Lay \n     Mission Team Member Jean Donovan, who were executed by \n     members of the Armed Forces of El Salvador on December 2, \n     1980.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent to be added as a cosponsor of \nthis measure.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am grateful to my colleagues for \njoining me in passing a resolution which remembers the lives of four \nAmerican women who continue to be a source of great inspiration.\n  Mr. President, on December 2, 1980, two Maryknoll Sisters, Maura \nClarke and Ita Ford, Ursuline Sister Dorothy Kazel, and Cleveland Team \nlay missionary Jean Donovan were brutally violated and murdered by \nmembers of the Salvadoran National Guard. We do not wish to revisit the \nevents of those difficult times in Central America with this \nresolution. We wish to remember and honor the love and dedication these \nwomen of faith showed to those they came to serve.\n  Two years ago, on the December 2 anniversary of the brutal deaths of \nthese four American women, several 25th anniversary events were held in \nthe United States including one at Milwaukee's Saint Therese Church in \nmy home State of Wisconsin. I was pleased that the House passed a \nresolution honoring the lives of the four missionaries in the year of \nthe 25th anniversary. Unfortunately, one or more members of this body \nanonymously blocked the Senate from passing a similar resolution to \ncommemorate the 25th anniversary of the murder of these nuns. Along \nwith my cosponsors, I am pleased that the Senate is now appropriately \nhonoring these women with the passage of this resolution.\n  Mr. President, remembering these women is a very personal and moving \nthing for those who actually knew them, but it is also truly powerful \nfor those who have only learned of them after their deaths. I had the \nopportunity several years ago to meet many of their family members and \nhave become well aware of one of the churchwomen, Sister Ita Ford, \nthrough my chief of staff and her aunt, Jean Reardon Baumann, who was a \ndear friend of Ita's from their childhood together in Brooklyn, New \nYork.\n  I would like to share with my colleagues a letter Sister Ita Ford \nwrote to her niece in August of 1980:\n\n       Dear Jennifer, the odds that this note will arrive for your \n     birthday are poor, but know I'm with you in spirit as you \n     celebrate 16 big ones. I hope it's a special day for you. I \n     want to say something to you and I wish I were there to talk \n     to you because sometimes letters don't get across all the \n     meaning and feeling. But, I'll give it a try anyway.\n       First of all, I love you and care about you and how you \n     are. I'm sure you know that. That holds if you're an angel or \n     a goof-off, a genius or a jerk. A lot of that is up to you, \n     and what you decide to do with your life. What I want to say \n     . . . some of it isn't too jolly birthday talk, but it's \n     real. . . . Yesterday I stood looking down at a 16-year-old \n     who had been killed a few hours earlier. I know a lot of kids \n     even younger who are dead. This is a terrible time in El \n     Salvador for youth. A lot of idealism and commitment is \n     getting snuffed out here now. The reasons why so many people \n     are being killed are quite complicated, yet there are some \n     clear, simple strands. One is that many people have found a \n     meaning to life, to sacrifice, to struggle, and even to \n     death. And whether their life span is 16 years, 60 or 90, for \n     them, their life has had a purpose. In many ways, they are \n     fortunate people.\n       Brooklyn is not passing through the drama of El Salvador, \n     but some things hold true wherever one is, and at whatever \n     age. What I'm saying is, I hope you come to find that which \n     gives life a deep meaning for you . . . something worth \n     living for, maybe even worth dying for . . . something that \n     energizes you, enthuses you, enables you to keep moving \n     ahead. I can't tell you what it might be--that's for you to \n     find, to choose, to love. I can just encourage you to start \n     looking, and support you in the search. Maybe this sounds \n     weird and off-the-wall, and maybe, no one else will talk to \n     you like this, but then, too, I'm seeing and living things \n     that others around you aren't. . . . I want to say to you: \n     don't waste the gifts and opportunities you have to make \n     yourself and other people happy. . . . I hope this doesn't \n     sound like some kind of a sermon because I don't mean it that \n     way. Rather, it's something you learn here, and I want to \n     share it with you. In fact, it's my birthday present to you. \n     If it doesn't make sense right at this moment, keep this and \n     read it sometime from now. Maybe it will be clearer . . .\n       A very happy birthday to you and much, much love,\n                                                              Ita.\n\n  From that one letter alone, I am sure that others will understand the \nkind of people these women were, and the impact they continue to have \non us all.\n  I also want to thank, in particular, my friend from Massachusetts \nCongressman Jim McGovern and his staff who have led the efforts in \nCongress to appropriately remember these four courageous American women \nwho dedicated their lives to their faith and to the service of others.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed to, \nthe preamble be agreed to, the motions to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable en bloc, and that any statements relating thereto be printed in \nthe Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 381) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 381\n\n       Whereas on December 2, 1980, four churchwomen from the \n     United States, Maryknoll Sisters Maura Clarke and Ita Ford, \n     Ursuline Sister Dorothy Kazel, and Cleveland Lay Mission Team \n     Member Jean Donovan, were violated and executed by members of \n     the National Guard of El Salvador;\n       Whereas in 1980, Maryknoll Sisters Maura Clarke and Ita \n     Ford were working in the parish of the Church of San Juan \n     Bautista in Chalatenango, El Salvador, providing food, \n     transportation, and other assistance to refugees, and \n     Ursuline Sister Dorothy Kazel and Cleveland Lay Mission Team \n     Member Jean Donovan were working in the parish of the Church \n     of the Immaculate Conception in La Libertad, El Salvador, \n     providing assistance and support to refugees and other \n     victims of violence;\n       Whereas these four churchwomen from the United States \n     dedicated their lives to working with the poor of El \n     Salvador, especially women and children left homeless, \n     displaced, and destitute by the civil war in El Salvador;\n       Whereas these four churchwomen from the United States were \n     among the more than 70,000 civilians who were murdered during \n     the course of the civil war in El Salvador;\n       Whereas on May 23 and May 24, 1984, five members of the \n     National Guard of El Salvador, Subsergeant Luis Antonio \n     Colindres Aleman, Daniel Canales Ramirez, Carlos Joaquin \n     Contreras Palacios, Francisco Orlando Contreras Recinos, and \n     Jose Roberto Moreno Canjura, were found guilty by the El\n\n[[Page S14420]]\n\n     Salvador courts of the executions of these four churchwomen \n     from the United States and were sentenced to 30 years in \n     prison, marking the first time in El Salvador history in \n     which a member of the Armed Forces of El Salvador was \n     convicted of murder by an El Salvador judge;\n       Whereas the United Nations Commission on the Truth for El \n     Salvador was established under the terms of the historic \n     January 1992 Peace Accords that ended 12 years of civil war \n     in El Salvador and was charged to investigate and report to \n     the El Salvador people on human rights crimes committed by \n     all sides during the course of the civil war;\n       Whereas in March 1993, the United Nations Commission on the \n     Truth for El Salvador found that the execution of these four \n     churchwomen from the United States was planned, that \n     Subsergeant Luis Antonio Colindres Aleman carried out orders \n     from a superior to execute them, that then Colonel Carlos \n     Eugenio Vides Casanova, then Director-General of the National \n     Guard and his cousin, Lieutenant Colonel Oscar Edgardo \n     Casanova Vejar, then Commander of the Zacatecoluca military \n     detachment where the murders were committed, and other \n     military personnel knew that members of the National Guard \n     had committed the murders pursuant to orders of a superior, \n     and that the subsequent coverup of the facts adversely \n     affected the judicial investigation into the murders of the \n     churchwomen;\n       Whereas the United Nations Commission on the Truth for El \n     Salvador determined that General Jose Guillermo Garcia, then \n     Minister of Defense, made no serious effort to conduct a \n     thorough investigation of responsibility for the murders of \n     these four churchwomen from the United States;\n       Whereas the families of these four churchwomen from the \n     United States continue their efforts to determine the full \n     truth surrounding the murders of their loved ones, appreciate \n     the cooperation of United States Government agencies in \n     disclosing and providing documents relevant to the murders of \n     the churchwomen, and pursue requests to release to the family \n     members the few remaining undisclosed documents and reports \n     pertaining to the case;\n       Whereas the families of these four churchwomen from the \n     United States appreciate the ability of those harmed by \n     violence to bring suit against El Salvador military officers \n     in United States courts under the Torture Victim Protection \n     Act of 1991 (28 U.S.C. 1350 note);\n       Whereas the lives of these four churchwomen from the United \n     States have, for the past 27 years, served as inspiration for \n     and continue to inspire Salvadorans, Americans, and people \n     throughout the world to answer the call to service and to \n     pursue lives dedicated to addressing the needs and \n     aspirations of the poor, the vulnerable, and the \n     disadvantaged, especially among women and children;\n       Whereas the lives of these four churchwomen from the United \n     States have also inspired numerous books, plays, films, \n     music, religious events, and cultural events;\n       Whereas schools, libraries, research centers, spiritual \n     centers, health clinics, women's and children's programs in \n     the United States and in El Salvador have been named after or \n     dedicated to Sisters Maura Clarke, Ita Ford, Dorothy Kazel, \n     and lay missionary Jean Donovan;\n       Whereas the Maryknoll Sisters, headquartered in Ossining, \n     New York, the Ursuline Sisters, headquartered in Cleveland, \n     Ohio, numerous religious task forces in the United States, \n     and the Salvadoran and international religious communities \n     based in El Salvador annually commemorate the lives and \n     martyrdom of these four churchwomen from the United States;\n       Whereas the historic January 1992 Peace Accords ended 12 \n     years of civil war in El Salvador and have allowed the \n     Government and the people of El Salvador to achieve \n     significant progress in creating and strengthening \n     democratic, political, economic, and social institutions in \n     El Salvador; and\n       Whereas December 2, 2007, marks the 27th anniversary of the \n     deaths of these four spiritual, courageous, and generous \n     churchwomen from the United States: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) remembers and commemorates the lives and work of \n     Sisters Maura Clarke, Ita Ford, and Dorothy Kazel and lay \n     missionary Jean Donovan;\n       (2) extends sympathy and support for the families, friends, \n     and religious communities of these four churchwomen from the \n     United States;\n       (3) continues to find inspiration in the lives and work of \n     these four churchwomen from the United States;\n       (4) calls upon the people of the United States and \n     religious congregations to participate in local, national, \n     and international events commemorating the 27th anniversary \n     of the martyrdom of these four churchwomen from the United \n     States;\n       (5) recognizes that while progress has been made in El \n     Salvador during the post-civil war period, the work begun by \n     these four churchwomen from the United States remains \n     unfinished and social and economic hardships persist among \n     many sectors of El Salvador society; and\n       (6) calls upon the President, the Secretary of State, the \n     Administrator of the United States Agency for International \n     Development, and the heads of other United States Government \n     agencies to continue to support and collaborate with the \n     Government of El Salvador and with private sector, \n     nongovernmental, regional, international, and religious \n     organizations in their efforts to reduce poverty and hunger \n     and to promote educational opportunity, health care, and \n     social equity for the people of El Salvador.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url":

I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nimmediate consideration of S. Res. 382 submitted earlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 382) supporting the goals and ideals \n     of World Diabetes Day.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, today I was pleased to introduce a \nSenate resolution recognizing November 14 as World Diabetes Day. I am \nalso pleased to be joined by my colleagues, Senators Pete Domenici and \nFrank Lautenberg. Established in 1991 by the World Health Organization \nand the International Diabetes Federation, this day has been recognized \nannually as World Diabetes Day.\n  Through World Diabetes Day, advocates worldwide can coordinate \ndiabetes awareness activities and create a sense of urgency about this \ndevastating disease. In almost every nation, diabetes is on the rise. \nIn the United States, diabetes is the sixth leading cause of death by \ndisease. Globally, diabetes is fourth.\n  Diabetes currently affects 246 million people worldwide and is \nprojected to affect 380 million by 2025. Last year, the United Nations \npassed landmark Resolution 61/225 recognizing diabetes as a chronic, \ndebilitating, and costly disease.\n  Each year, over 3.7 million people die due to diabetes. An even \ngreater number die from cardiovascular disease exacerbated by diabetes-\nrelated lipid disorders. Every 10 seconds, two people develop diabetes \nand one person dies from diabetes-related causes.\n  The prevalence of diabetes is increasing in Michigan--from 5.3 \npercent to 7.9 percent over the past 10 years. There are 1.3 million \nMichiganians who have diabetes or are prediabetic. Michigan has the \nseventh highest rate of diabetes in the Nation, and diabetes costs our \nState's economy $6 billion a year in health costs and lost \nproductivity. Diabetes is the sixth leading cause of death in Michigan \nand the fourth leading cause of death among African-American females in \nMichigan.\n  This year, the World Diabetes Day campaign will focus on the message \nthat no child should die of diabetes.'' I take this goal very \nseriously. As a member of the Agriculture Committee, I am committed to \nensuring our children have healthy options in their school meals. And I \nam working with Senator Domenici on reauthorizing the Special Diabetes \nProgram.\n  We can no longer ignore the growing incidence of diabetes. Instead, \nlet us draw worldwide attention to prevention, access, and treatment.\n  Finally, I am pleased to have letters of support from diabetes \nadvocacy organizations. I ask unanimous consent that they be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                            International Diabetes Federation,\n\n                             Brussels, Belgium, November 11, 2007.\n     Hon. Debbie Stabenow,\n     Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Pete Domenici,\n     Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear U.S. Senator Stabenow and U.S. Senator Domenici: The \n     International Diabetes Federation (IDF), an over 50-year old \n     worldwide alliance of over 200 diabetes associations in more \n     than 160 countries, is pleased to endorse H. Con. Res. 211, \n     your resolution supporting the goals and ideals of World \n     Diabetes Day.\n       Established by the World Health Organization and \n     International Diabetes Federation in 1991, World Diabetes Day \n     has been commemorated annually on November 14th. World \n     Diabetes Day has succeeded in elevating and coordinating \n     diabetes advocacy globally. Further, it is especially \n     meaningful for the international diabetes advocacy community \n     that on December 20, 2006, the General Assembly of the United \n     Nations passed a landmark Resolution recognizing diabetes as \n     a chronic, debilitating and costly disease.\n       Cities and nations all over the world are holding events to \n     celebrate World Diabetes\n\n[[Page S14421]]\n\n     Day. For example, in Egypt, the well-known Bibliotheca \n     Alexandrina (Library of Alexandria) will light up in blue on \n     November 14th. And, La Federacion Mexicana de Diabetes \n     (Mexican Diabetes Federation) has planned a series of events \n     throughout Mexico to mark this year's World Diabetes Day, \n     including a diabetes awareness week in Jalisco, walks in \n     Mexico City and Guanajuato, and activities for children and \n     adolescents in Chihuahua.\n       Senators Stabenow and Domenici, we share your particular \n     enthusiasm that the 2007 Campaign's theme focuses on raising \n     awareness of diabetes in children and adolescents, who face \n     unique challenges when diagnosed with diabetes. The campaign \n     aims, among other objectives, to firmly establish the message \n     that ``no child should die of diabetes''.\n       Thank you for your leadership on this important global \n     health awareness campaign, Senators Stabenow and Domenici.\n           Sincerely,\n     Martin Silink.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                American Diabetes Association,\n\n                                                November 14, 2007.\n     Sen. Debbie Stabenow,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Sen. Pete Domenici,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators: On behalf of the 20.8 million children and \n     adults living with diabetes in the Unites States, the \n     American Diabetes Association is pleased to endorse your \n     resolution supporting the goals and ideals of World Diabetes \n     Day. This important day has succeeded in elevating and \n     coordinating diabetes education and advocacy around the world \n     and we applaud your leadership in bringing congressional \n     attention to it.\n       Established by the World Health Organization and \n     International Diabetes Federation in 1991, World Diabetes Day \n     has been commemorated annually on November 14th. On December \n     20, 2006, the General Assembly of the United Nations passed a \n     landmark Resolution recognizing diabetes as a chronic, \n     debilitating and costly disease, and designating World \n     Diabetes Day as a United Nations Day to be observed every \n     year starting this year.\n       As you know, Diabetes is a lifelong chronic disease that \n     has become a health problem of epidemic proportions around \n     the globe. More than 240 million people worldwide are living \n     with diabetes. This number is expected to exceed 350 million \n     in less than 20 years if action is not taken. Diabetes is the \n     fifth highest cause of disease-related death, killing more \n     than 2.9 million people from diabetesrelated complications \n     annually, greater than 600 people each day in our own \n     country. In fact, every 10 seconds a person dies of diabetes-\n     related causes--including heart disease, stroke, blindness, \n     kidney disease and amputations.\n       Children are not spared from this global epidemic, with its \n     debilitating and life-threatening complications. The theme of \n     this year's World Diabetes Day campaign is `Diabetes in \n     Children and Adolescents.' Type 1 diabetes is growing by 3% \n     per year in children and adolescents, and at an alarming 5% \n     per year among pre-school children. Type 2 diabetes was once \n     seen as a disease of adults. Today, this type of diabetes is \n     growing at alarming rates in children and adolescents. In the \n     United States, it is estimated that type 2 diabetes \n     represents between 8 and 45% of new-onset diabetes cases in \n     children depending on geographic location. Early diagnosis \n     and early education are crucial to reducing complications and \n     saving lives.\n       Senator Stabenow and Senator Domenici, we share your \n     enthusiasm that the 2007 Campaign's theme focuses on raising \n     awareness of diabetes in children and adolescents, who face \n     unique challenges when diagnosed with diabetes. Passage of \n     this resolution will send a powerful message about the \n     seriousness of this disease and help to alleviate the human, \n     economic and social burden of diabetes.\n       Thank you, again, for your leadership on this important \n     global health awareness campaign. In this, and in other \n     diabetes issues, the American Diabetes Association stands \n     ready to support your efforts.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Hunter Limbaugh,\n                               Chair, National Advocacy Committee.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed to, \nthe preamble be agreed to, the motions to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable en bloc, and that any statements relating thereto be printed in \nthe Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Res. 382\n\n       Whereas the World Health Organization and the International \n     Diabetes Federation established World Diabetes Day in 1991 \n     with the aim of coordinating diabetes advocacy worldwide;\n       Whereas World Diabetes Day is celebrated annually on \n     November 14;\n       Whereas, on December 20, 2006, the General Assembly of the \n     United Nations passed a landmark resolution recognizing \n     diabetes as a chronic, debilitating, and costly disease;\n       Whereas the resolution designates World Diabetes Day as a \n     United Nations Day to be observed every year starting in 2007 \n     in order to raise global awareness of diabetes;\n       Whereas the theme of the 2007 United Nations World Diabetes \n     Day campaign focuses on raising awareness of diabetes in \n     children and adolescents, who face unique challenges when \n     diagnosed with diabetes;\n       Whereas the United Nations campaign aims, among other \n     objectives, to firmly establish the message that no child \n     should die of diabetes;\n       Whereas the global diabetes epidemic has devastating \n     effects on families, societies, and national economies;\n       Whereas diabetes is the 4th leading cause of death by \n     disease in the world, and is the 6th leading cause of death \n     in the United States;\n       Whereas diabetes is a leading cause of blindness, kidney \n     failure, amputation, heart attack, and stroke;\n       Whereas in almost every country the incidence of diabetes \n     is increasing, growing from an estimated 30,000,000 people \n     worldwide in 1985 to an estimated 245,000,000 people in 2007, \n     and to 380,000,000 by 2025, as reported by the International \n     Diabetes Federation;\n       Whereas diabetes is one of the most common chronic \n     childhood diseases;\n       Whereas diabetes can strike children at any age, and when \n     diagnosed in young people the risk of developing life-\n     threatening complications at an early age increases and life \n     expectancy is shortened by, on average, 10 to 20 years;\n       Whereas new figures from the International Diabetes \n     Federation's Diabetes Atlas suggest that more than 70,000 \n     children develop type 1 diabetes each year and 440,000 \n     children worldwide under the age of 14 now live with type 1 \n     diabetes;\n       Whereas recent data indicate that 1 out of every 3 children \n     born in the United States will develop diabetes during their \n     lifetime, including 1 out of every 2 children from ethnic \n     minority groups;\n       Whereas in low- and middle-income countries, many children \n     with diabetes die because they are diagnosed late or \n     misdiagnosed or because insulin is unaffordable, unavailable, \n     or in short supply;\n       Whereas the incidence of type 2 diabetes, which was \n     previously rare in children, is rising at alarming rates, \n     with more than 200 children a day developing this form of \n     diabetes;\n       Whereas obesity is a major contributor to type 2 diabetes;\n       Whereas according to the International Obesity Task Force \n     of the International Association for the Study of Obesity, \n     155,000,000 school-age children worldwide are overweight, \n     representing at least 1 out of every 10 school-age children;\n       Whereas at least 30,000,000 of those overweight children \n     are classified as obese, accounting for at least 2 percent of \n     the world's children between the ages of 5 and 17 years of \n     age;\n       Whereas research has shown conclusively that type 2 \n     diabetes can be prevented or significantly delayed through \n     healthy weight maintenance and regular physical activity;\n       Whereas adopting a lifestyle high in physical activity and \n     adopting a low-sugar, low-fat diet can successfully prevent \n     the onset of obesity and diabetes among school-age children;\n       Whereas diabetes is costly, with the world estimated to \n     spend at least $232,000,000,000 in 2007 and over \n     $302,500,000,000 by 2025 to treat and prevent diabetes and \n     its complications;\n       Whereas world treatment costs for diabetes are growing more \n     quickly than the world population;\n       Whereas diabetes threatens to subvert global economic \n     advancement by both straining government budgets worldwide \n     (with the cost of diabetes-related disability payments, \n     pensions, social and medical service costs, and lost revenue) \n     and burdening private health insurers and employers with \n     spiraling health care costs;\n       Whereas by 2025 the largest increases in diabetes \n     prevalence will take place in developing countries, whose \n     economies are less able to support increased expenditures to \n     provide for those with the disease and engage in effective \n     prevention efforts; and\n       Whereas the economic impact of diabetes threatens to \n     undermine the achievement of the United Nation's Millennium \n     Development Goals for developing countries: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate supports the goals and ideals of \n     World Diabetes Day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/14/senate-section/article/S14421-1", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14421-S14422]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ORDERS FOR THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 15, 2007\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, in America--the land of prosperity and \nplenty, some people have the misconception that hunger plagues only \nfaraway, undeveloped nations. The reality is that hunger is a silent \nenemy lurking within 1 in 10 U.S. households.\n  In my home State of North Carolina alone, nearly 1 million of our 8.8 \nmillion residents are struggling with food insecurity issues. In recent \nyears, once-thriving North Carolina towns have been economically \ncrippled by the shutting of textile mills and furniture factories. \nPeople have lost their jobs and sometimes their ability to put food on \nthe table.\n  I know this scenario is not unique to North Carolina, as many \nAmerican manufacturing jobs have moved overseas. While many folks are \nfinding new employment, these days a steady income does not necessarily \nprovide for three square meals a day. Hunger and food insecurity are \nfar too prevalent, but I think Washington Post columnist David Broder \nhit the nail on the head when he wrote:\n\n       America has some problems that defy solution. This one does \n     not. It just needs caring people and a caring government, \n     working together.\n\n  I certainly agree. The battle to end hunger in our country is a \ncampaign that cannot be won in months or even a few years, but it is a \nvictory within reach.\n  To this end, I strongly support what the nutrition title of the farm \nbill strives to accomplish. I commend my colleagues on the Senate \nAgriculture Committee for putting together a package that helps address \nthe hunger and nutrition needs of Americans of all ages. For example, \nwith regard to the Food Stamp Program, this bill seeks to responsibly \naddress concerns of fraud, waste, and abuse in the system and help \nensure that it serves those who truly need assistance.\n  I am also pleased that the nutrition title expands the Fresh Fruit \nand Vegetable Program to all 50 States. This program encourages healthy \neating habits in schoolchildren and helps combat childhood obesity. \nAccording to a recent Duke University report, in the last 25 years, the \nrate of obesity has doubled for children ages 6 to 11, and has tripled \nfor teens.\n  Today, about 10 percent of 2- to 5-year-olds and 15 percent of 6- to \n19-year-olds are overweight. In North Carolina, where childhood obesity \nrates have been higher than national averages, I am very proud that \nnearly 1.4 million children are enrolled this school year in the Fresh \nFruit and Vegetable Program. This certainly is a positive way to help \ncombat the childhood obesity problem.\n  Furthermore, I am pleased this bill will allow schools participating \nin the School Lunch Program to use geographic preference when \npurchasing fruits and vegetables. This is especially good news in North \nCarolina where our farmers produce a wide variety of nutritious fruits \nand vegetables.\n  I also welcome a provision in the nutrition title that makes \npermanent the exclusion of combat zone pay from eligibility \ndeterminations in the Food and Nutrition Program. More than 157,700 \nservicemembers from North Carolina have deployed to Iraq and \nAfghanistan, and their families, who are sacrificing greatly, should \nnot become ineligible because the head of household receives extra \nincome for serving in harm's way.\n  Additionally, I am pleased that the nutrition title expands the use \nof electronic benefit transfer at farmers' markets. As in other States, \nin North Carolina's rural areas the poverty rate tends to be higher, \nand there is limited access to grocery stores that participate in the \nFood and Nutrition Program. Our State prides itself on having some of \nthe finest farmers' markets around, and allowing the use of EBT will \nprovide needier individuals access to these healthy, homegrown foods.\n  Likewise, this bill also increases funding for the Senior Farmers' \nMarket Nutrition Program, which helps low-income seniors, and it \ncontinues and extends the Commodity Supplemental Food Program to more \nlow-income individuals.\n  While I am encouraged by these hunger and nutrition components, there \nis still more we can and should accomplish in this farm bill to help \nthose in need.\n  One area where I have focused my efforts is gleaning, where excess \ncrops that would otherwise be thrown out are taken from farms, \npackinghouses, and warehouses, and distributed to the needy.\n  It is staggering--really staggering--that each year in this country \n96 billion pounds of good, nutritious food, including that at the farm \nand retail level, is left over or thrown away. Gleaning helps eliminate \nthis waste. It helps the farmer because he does not have to haul off or \nplow under crops that do not meet exact specifications of grocery \nchains. And it certainly helps the hungry by giving them nutritious, \nfresh foods.\n  Last month, in Harnett County, NC, I gleaned sweet potatoes with \nvolunteers from the hunger relief organization the Society of St. \nAndrew. One of the single largest concerns for groups such as this \nwonderful organization is transportation--how to actually get food from \nthe farm, for example, to those in need. According to the Society of \nSt. Andrew, the increase in fuel costs has made food transport \nparticularly challenging. They say today it costs 30 percent more to \nhire a truck to move food than it did 2 years ago.\n  To help address this problem, I am putting forward my bill, the \nHunger Relief Trucking Tax Credit, as an amendment to this legislation. \nMy measure would change the Tax Code to give transportation companies \ntax incentives for volunteering trucks to transfer gleaned food. \nSpecifically, my bill would create a 25-cent tax credit for each mile \nthat food is transported for hunger relief efforts by a donated truck \nand driver. This bill would provide a little extra encouragement for \ntrucking companies to donate space in their vehicles to help more food \nreach more hungry people.\n  Additionally, I am proud to join my colleague Senator Lautenberg as a \ncosponsor of an amendment that helps fight hunger in our communities by \ncombining food rescue with job training, thus teaching unemployed and \nhomeless adults the skills needed to work in the food service industry.\n  The FEED Program, which stands for Food Employment Empowerment and \nDevelopment, will support community kitchens around the country with \nmuch needed resources to help collect rescued food and provide meals to \nthe hungry. Successful FEED-type programs already exist. For example, \nin Charlotte, NC, the Community Culinary School recruits students from \nsocial service agencies, homeless shelters, halfway houses, and work \nrelease programs. And just around the corner from the U.S. Capitol, \nstudents are hard at work in the DC Central Kitchen's culinary job \ntraining class. This is a model program, which began in 1990, and it is \nalways, to me, a great privilege to visit the kitchen and meet with the \nindividuals who have faced adversity but are now on track for a career \nin the food service industry.\n\n[[Page S14423]]\n\n  While I do have a number of concerns about the farm bill and its \nimpact on North Carolina agriculture, I welcome this bill's hunger and \nnutrition focus. Particularly with Thanksgiving just 1 week away, let \nus remember our 35 million fellow Americans who are struggling to have \nenough to eat. With the addition of the Hunger Relief Trucking Tax \nCredit and the FEED Program provision, this farm bill can go even \nfurther to responsibly lend a helping hand to those in need.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/14/senate-section/article/S14423-1", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14423]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
